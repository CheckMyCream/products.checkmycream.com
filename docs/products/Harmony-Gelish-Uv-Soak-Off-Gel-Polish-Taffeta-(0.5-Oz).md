      <li>love this polish</li>

      <li>Out of the several bottle I ordered, I like this one best!!</li>
      <li>wish it would cover better</li>

      <li>Nice light shade for the summer.</li>

      <li>Once I pay all the return costs (restocking fee, postage, etc) it almost costs more than what I paid for the items.  </li>
      <li>Love Gelish.  </li>
      <li>Harmony by Gelish is my favorite of all the gel polishes out there.</li>
      <li>This is the latest I&#x27;ve ordered</li>
      <li>Pretty color!!!  </li>
      <li>just the perfect amount of pink in it.&lt;br /&gt;i would describe it more as a &amp;#34;peachy&amp;#34; color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Did a nice job with my first application.</li>
      <li>After I applied it and cured it, it came out a perfect, shiny, and light shade of pink!</li>
      <li>The color is to light so it doesn&#x27;t show on the nails.</li>
      <li>When light hits the polish, it gives off almost a silver/metallic looking sheen.</li>
      <li>Perfect for everyday wear.</li>
      <li>This polish goes on smoothly and lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had a curing light that my mom bought &amp; never used, and I use acetone (to soak off) &amp; rubbing alcohol to prep the surface.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had it on for about 1 week, so far so good.</li>
      <li>Wearing this color right now and it is perfect in military uniform.</li>
      <li>I use two coats and it is still pretty light, but it is also very nice looking for a barely there look.  </li>
      <li>This Polish is much more sheer than I would have liked.</li>
      <li>full out shimmer.</li>
      <li>Not even sure it&#x27;s a real Gelish polish.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad just not for me.</li>
      <li>I have tried other brands like revlon and sephora but this brand covers better and I prefer the overall look of it best.</li>
      <li>The polish stays on great, but the actual color is much lighter than it shows online.  </li>
      <li>Thanks !!</li>
      <li>Taffeta is a very frosty light peachy-pink gel polish which applies easily without much risk of brush marks.</li>
      <li>I decided to stick with one coat only because I liked the results.</li>
      <li>The best way to describe this color is sheer with a hint of pink.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the color at all.</li>
      <li>Looks nice next to the Bronze!</li>
      <li>very very sheer, best to use over other colors.</li>
      <li>After checking the name and number, I verified that the right product was sent; the bottom said Taffeta.</li>
      <li>I think Taffeta is a tad more understated than Light Elegant, and the little pieces of glitter or shimmer are much finer in Taffeta.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nice by itself too but not much color unless you do about 3 coats.</li>
      <li>Did my nail with this for the first time.</li>
      <li>I also have bashful, which is much more sheer!</li>
      <li>Thanks harmony!</li>
      <li>this color, the white color, a top coat, and a brush to do the &amp;#34;smile lines&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I love the harmony gelish products and my manicures last about 2 weeks.  </li>
      <li>Taffeta is my favorite of those three colors and even when I try one of the others, I invariably go back to Taffeta.  </li>
      <li>If you are into pretty nails</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>google for swatches when ordering any Gelish ;)</li>
      <li>I love the rest of the nail system and can&#x27;t wait to try different colors.</li>
      <li>Light Elegant is very similar to Taffeta, but it is a little more glittery.  </li>
      <li>I love this light pink, and it&#x27;s great for French manicures with less than 3 coats.</li>
      <li>Of those three, my first choice is Taffeta, although Light Elegant is similar and a close second.  </li>
      <li>Ok color, not the same pretty pink shown but ok.</li>
      <li>Two coats made a very light, shimmery pink.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I like really neutral colors</li>
      <li>similar colors I have tried include Light Elegant and Pink Smoothie.  </li>
      <li>As always, received fast, was what was pictured.</li>
      <li>This color turned out much lighter than I thought it would be.  </li>
      <li>I do wish I&#x27;d known it was completely transparent - thought it would be a more solid color.</li>
      <li>This color gives me a natural nail apperance with just a hit of milky, pink while allowing my own nail tomshow through.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s perfect for a very pale and barely tinted pinkish hue with a silvery sheen that makes it obvious you&#x27;ve had a manicure but not garish at all.</li>
      <li>Works so much better than other brands I have purchased.</li>
      <li>Good durable product though the colors are a little different in real life.</li>
      <li>I have used Pink Smoothie for a first coat and Taffeta as a second coat, which gives a more opaque finish than Taffeta alone.  </li>
      <li>finish.&lt;br /&gt;Not quite dark enough for decals, but looks nice with a painted decoration.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this color and the way it works under the LED lamp for perfect gel nails.  Thin, thin, thin layers of polish are the key here, and if you follow that rule you will be pleased with the results you get.</li>
    <li> Taffeta is my favorite Gelish color. It is a light, sheer pink. It can be worn with anything.  It&#x27;s corporate-office to Disney princess appropriate.</li>
    <li> i found this product (and color) at the salon and have used it exclusively for a few months. it&#x27;s perfect for a very pale and barely tinted pinkish hue with a silvery sheen that makes it obvious you&#x27;ve had a manicure but not garish at all. with the gelish layers finished, i can paint over it with my favorite OPI pearl white or silver, or any color and remove it with nail polish remover just like natural nails, but that pale taffeta is always under there as a base that doesn&#x27;t interfere with what i put on top, but could also stand alone for a very distinguished, understated and elegant looking manicure. it looks somewhat natural, like a champagne pearl but is opaque enough to cover any discoloration under the nails or variations of nail color. no chips, ever ... LOVE this polish and will scarf it up wherever i see the color \\&quot;taffeta\\&quot; ...</li>
    <li> Love Gelish.  This was just a little light for me.</li>
    <li> love this polish I like really neutral colors and this is perfect</li>
    <li> I love this color! The color in the window is darker than I expected. After I applied it and cured it, it came out a perfect, shiny, and light shade of pink! Thanks harmony!</li>
    <li> Pretty color!!!  LOVE Gelish!!!  It works the best on my nails!!!  It arrived on time and as described!!!</li>
    <li> I bought four of this brand of nail gel.  I don&#x27;t like any of them because they have absolutly NO COLOR!  They are terrible, but I can&#x27;t afford to send them back.  Once I pay all the return costs (restocking fee, postage, etc) it almost costs more than what I paid for the items.  BEWARE OF THIS SELLER.......in the end you will pay alot for something you don&#x27;t want. These are the ones I purchased.  I have tried them all and none of them has any color.  Might as well put clear polish on.

    <li> The best way to describe this color is sheer with a hint of pink. When light hits the polish, it gives off almost a silver/metallic looking sheen. I think that&#x27;s what they consider \\&quot;frost\\&quot;. I&#x27;m not crazy about the color at all. The pink is hardly noticeable. Sorry Gelish, this color is a no go.</li>
    <li> just the perfect amount of pink in it.&lt;br /&gt;i would describe it more as a &amp;#34;peachy&amp;#34; color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love neutral colors on my nails. this is definitely one of them!</li>
    <li> This is not a comment on the gelish product but on the color. The color is to light so it doesn&#x27;t show on the nails.</li>
    <li> Gelish continues to be my favorite gel nail polish.  I have tried other brands like revlon and sephora but this brand covers better and I prefer the overall look of it best.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product for my daughter to go along with her new gel manicure set.  Good quality product.</li>
    <li> Very pretty soft pink color.  Perfect for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> Very good product, very quick shipping at a very reasonable price! I&#x27;ve had it on for about 1 week, so far so good. Good durable product though the colors are a little different in real life. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Finally a thin, sheer color that looks elegant while covering my natural nails.  It goes on nicely and leaves a good finish.&lt;br /&gt;Not quite dark enough for decals, but looks nice with a painted decoration.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Gelish colors. I&#x27;ve got vivid reds, subtle beiges, hot pinks, and 3 different shades of sparkly, see-through sheers. This is the latest I&#x27;ve ordered and it&#x27;s as I expected, a very sheer pink with lots of fine sparkles in it. Just great!</li>
    <li> It is my fault for not reading it completely as it did state not available in 2 days, but if it&#x27;s not available for 2 day shipping then it should not be labeled Amazon Prime!  If I had realized it I would have selected something different as I did not get it when I needed it!</li>
    <li> It goes without saying that Gelish products are great and allow you to do a long-lasting, salon-quality home manicure.  This polish goes on smoothly and lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So -- the trick is finding a color that works for you, and it&#x27;s so hard to tell when shopping online!  I have eight Gelish colors now, three of which are pale pink, for what I intended to be a neutral , everyday manicure.  Taffeta is my favorite of those three colors and even when I try one of the others, I invariably go back to Taffeta.  Taffeta is a sheer, shimmery pink.  It does not add a lot of color to the nails, but gives them a nice sheen.  It has a little glitter or iridescence, but it doesn&#x27;t look glittery at all.  It is not opaque.  I can still see (although barely) the white part of my nail through two thin coats of Taffeta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other similar colors I have tried include Light Elegant and Pink Smoothie.  Light Elegant is very similar to Taffeta, but it is a little more glittery.  I think Taffeta is a tad more understated than Light Elegant, and the little pieces of glitter or shimmer are much finer in Taffeta.  Pink Smoothie is an opaque pink with no shimmer.  I have used Pink Smoothie for a first coat and Taffeta as a second coat, which gives a more opaque finish than Taffeta alone.  Of those three, my first choice is Taffeta, although Light Elegant is similar and a close second.  If you&#x27;re looking for more color and less sheer, then Taffeta is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps -- it is so hard to really know what colors look like in person based on a little swatch of color on the screen.</li>
    <li> This color turned out much lighter than I thought it would be.  I use two coats and it is still pretty light, but it is also very nice looking for a barely there look.  Wearing this color right now and it is perfect in military uniform.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this color as of yet.  I love the rest of the nail system and can&#x27;t wait to try different colors.</li>
    <li> This is a nice polish that can be used by itself, or layered with another polish, very nice shimmer.</li>
    <li> Nice light shade for the summer.</li>
    <li> This Polish is much more sheer than I would have liked. Even with three coats I could still see the underside of my nails.</li>
    <li> Perfect, barely-there color.</li>
    <li> great price and quick service</li>
    <li> I love the harmony gelish products and my manicures last about 2 weeks.  The only problem is that it is difficult to see the color when ordering on line.  This color is a sheer pink frost and it would look good used for a french manicure.  I put on 3 coats and it still did not completely cover my natural nail tips, next time I will paint them white.</li>
    <li> As always, received fast, was what was pictured. Thanks !! Will continue to purchase from you in the future. This was not my first purchase from you and will not be the last.</li>
    <li> Sweet color but a little thin so use more than one coat! Looks nice next to the Bronze!</li>
    <li> Ok color, not the same pretty pink shown but ok.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color polish that stays on well. Works so much better than other brands I have purchased. I love it!</li>
    <li> Taffeta is a very frosty light peachy-pink gel polish which applies easily without much risk of brush marks. It requires up to 3 thin coats to be opaque, and is somewhat warmer (peach) in tone than it appears in the swatch on this page. I love this light pink, and it&#x27;s great for French manicures with less than 3 coats. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year.</li>
    <li> I got tired of paying the gossipy nail girl $40 for a french gel manicure every 2-3 weeks.  I bought Gelish foundation, this color, the white color, a top coat, and a brush to do the &amp;#34;smile lines&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve done 3-4 DIY manicures, and I&#x27;m pretty darn good if I do say so myself!  I had a curing light that my mom bought &amp; never used, and I use acetone (to soak off) &amp; rubbing alcohol to prep the surface.  This color is pretty, very pale pink with a touch of shimmer, almost nail bed color, so very subtle but pretty!  I use 2 coats, and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> Harmony by Gelish is my favorite of all the gel polishes out there. It glides on with ease and has the best color choices. I have never been disappointed with this one. This color is so natural you could wear it with anything. Great for those days when you just need a light shade and are not worried that it may not look good with what you are wearing. It is not too pink.</li>
    <li> I got the polish, UV lamp, and a mini set of the undercoat, overcoat etc. Did a nice job with my first application. I do wish I&#x27;d known it was completely transparent - thought it would be a more solid color.</li>
    <li> Just a touch of pink to a pearl white.  Was iffy reading the reviews, but glad I took the chance.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this polish.  It is sheer pale gentle-frost pink and two coats make is semi-sheer. Out of the several bottle I ordered, I like this one best!! Love it, Love it; Love it!!</li>
    <li> So for a much fancier French manicure this is ok, but I tend to use a lot of colors on my tips other than white. It does add to much pink and shimmer for my liking changing the tip color to much. It&#x27;s not bad just not for me. I like the nail bed of my French manicures to have a more natural pink tone than a full out shimmer.</li>
    <li> The polish that I got doesn&#x27;t even look like the picture. It&#x27;s more of a shiny orangey color. It smells awful and there&#x27;s definitely dirt/debris under the label. Not even sure it&#x27;s a real Gelish polish.</li>
    <li> very very sheer, best to use over other colors. it&#x27;s nice by itself too but not much color unless you do about 3 coats. google for swatches when ordering any Gelish ;)</li>
    <li> is as pink as the little blurb in the picture...perfect for doing a french.  I also have bashful, which is much more sheer!</li>
    <li> The polish stays on great, but the actual color is much lighter than it shows online.  I wanted a little color but this one is almost too sheer,</li>
    <li> Love,mlove this color.... my manicurist did not have a barely there pink without sparkles, glad I found this. This color gives me a natural nail apperance with just a hit of milky, pink while allowing my own nail tomshow through.</li>
    <li> When I received the nail polish, the color dot scared me as it looked orange. When I opened the bottle, the color was still orange. After checking the name and number, I verified that the right product was sent; the bottom said Taffeta. I decided to try it and was relieved that there was no orange tint. I decided to stick with one coat only because I liked the results. I&#x27;m happy with the color as it is something I was going for, very faint pink, French manicure base or almost clear; I attached a picture as that helped me decide with other colors.</li>
    <li> Very thin light color  needs multiple coats</li>
    <li> yes I liked it....when its time to just be neutral for a while. when you need a break from colors.</li>
    <li> Two coats made a very light, shimmery pink.  I doubt you could get this to hide the nail lines, but it makes for a nice, subtle manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ido think the swatches shown are painted over white, so to get the color shown you might want to do a base of white, then use the taffeta, as it is notnearly as noticeable as it appears on the screen.</li>
    <li> I love the Gelish polishes and found it easy to do my own manicures. This is a soft  forsted pink shade and goes well under June Bride. I have done the manicure i two tones with the June Bride covering the tips only and it makes for a stunning yet subtle enough manicure. The prices on Amazon are the best as well.</li>
    <li> Did my nail with this for the first time. Sheer pink even after two coats! LOVE it! Goes on very smooth! Arrived on time!</li>
    <li> wish it would cover better</li>
    <li> This product is great. Easy to use and cost so much less on your site then anywhere I have found.&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to judge the color on line but It was very close to expected.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the beautiful color.  If you are into pretty nails this color is for you, Yes!</li>
    <li> Very nice subtle color with a slight shimmer. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
