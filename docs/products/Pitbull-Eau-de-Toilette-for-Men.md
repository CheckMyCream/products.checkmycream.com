      <li>I was interested in this because I&#x27;m always hearing people who meet Pitbull say how good he smells, so I figured he might have good taste in fragrances.  </li>
      <li>Love love love this on my man!</li>
      <li>Smells great when you first spray it on then</li>

      <li>What a sexy sent...</li>
      <li>Nice- not too over powering, light.</li>
      <li>it wouldn&#x27;t have been a better fragrance .</li>
      <li>Product was just as it was described..extremely pleased with the price.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>In those cases I&#x27;m sure Justin Bieber&#x27;s cologne would probably be a better fit for them.</li>
      <li>He really did a good job here w this cologne.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smells very nice and masculine.</li>
      <li>, when my husband use this perfume drives me crazy &amp;#34;on a very good way&amp;#34;, smell amazing!!!!!</li>
      <li>My hubby asked me about this a few weeks ago and this was a great surprise for him!!</li>
      <li>Great smell but does not last all day...</li>
      <li>you can smell first !!</li>
      <li>OK.. first of.</li>
      <li>If you want a cologne that says sexy, confident, and classy</li>
      <li>Sweet deal, 1oz bottles are going for 20$.</li>
      <li>fresh flavour.</li>
      <li>Fresh but not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>Love the scent, not harsh.</li>
      <li>My teenage son really liked it.</li>
      <li>but this was worth the try.</li>
      <li>Smells great, just doesn&#x27;t last long so be ready to use more than once or twice a day.</li>
      <li>He never wears it to work ; )</li>
      <li>it smells like a cheap cologne from dollar General .</li>
      <li>Refreshing smell and lasts a long time too.  </li>
      <li>However this one, although smells good once sprayed, does not last long, whether on the skin or on clothes.</li>
      <li>So I secretly purchased it (at a Great price) and used it..</li>
      <li>I really like it, and don&#x27;t care what it is called.</li>
      <li>My husband isn&#x27;t much into colognes but he does wear this here and there and always gets compliments on it.</li>
      <li>It smells good, not musky or MACHO or soft, it has a unique aroma kind of hard to describe, but I have had a few complements, two from total strangers.</li>
      <li>I like a subtleness of this particular cologne.</li>
      <li>Pitbull actually really annoys me as a musical artist, but he did amazing job with both the male and female fragrances here.</li>
      <li>Great price, wife loves the fragrance but the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long compared to other colognes.</li>
      <li>This one was great andvwouldcwear on a night out as well as a casual day.</li>
      <li>I asked a coworker if she could smell my new cologne</li>
      <li>Does he want more of it? :/</li>
      <li>Usually cologne from celebrities are more hype then anything.</li>
      <li>This actually smells really great…love it on my husband</li>
      <li>My boyfriend loves it so much he say he only wears it when we are out together on &amp;#34;naughty dates&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I find it is very close to the scent of Ralph Lauren&#x27;s &amp;#34;The Big Pony Collection&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>More like less than half of it.</li>

<li> Oh well 2 weeks later and still not able to smell..  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t usually buy cologne with out smelling it, however, it is PitBull,.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that a few people that never even smelled this fragrance gave it 1 star just because they don&#x27;t like Pitbull&#x27;s music.</li>
<li> All of the bad reviews here are from people who have never even tried it and joke about</li>
<li> I was shocked for the 34.99 price</li>
<li> and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>

    <li> The cologne smell doesn&#x27;t last very long at all, I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love love love this on my man! He is the pitbull and I&#x27;m the shitzhu! Get it? He&#x27;s the pit and I&#x27;m the sh-----.</li>
    <li> Great price, wife loves the fragrance but the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long compared to other colognes.</li>
    <li> Best Cologne I have yet</li>
    <li> Nice Perfume. But doesn&#x27;t stay longer.</li>
    <li> All of the bad reviews here are from people who have never even tried it and joke about it&#x27;s name. Since it is only sold online (?), it is really hard to tell what the scent is actually like. I find it is very close to the scent of Ralph Lauren&#x27;s &amp;#34;The Big Pony Collection&amp;#34; #1 (Blue). I really like it, and don&#x27;t care what it is called. I have no interest in the music of Pitbull.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy cologne with out smelling it, however, it is PitBull,. Very light fragrance and I love it.</li>
    <li> I was interested in this because I&#x27;m always hearing people who meet Pitbull say how good he smells, so I figured he might have good taste in fragrances.  Smells like aftershave to me.  Good aftershave.  Refreshing smell and lasts a long time too.  Nothing new or really different, but nothing negative.  Women do notice and compliment.  This one will stay in my rotation.</li>
    <li> I tested this at a Sears store and liked it. However this one, although smells good once sprayed, does not last long, whether on the skin or on clothes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that a few people that never even smelled this fragrance gave it 1 star just because they don&#x27;t like Pitbull&#x27;s music. The cologne is actually really, really nice smelling. Pitbull actually really annoys me as a musical artist, but he did amazing job with both the male and female fragrances here.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, not harsh. Do not like buying Cologne online without smelling or getting an opinion but this was worth the try. Great product!</li>
    <li> At my request my wife got this for me as a Christmas gift. I wanted a new everyday cologne and I thought this would be a good fit and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. This product has a very attractive smell that isn&#x27;t over bearing. I asked a coworker if she could smell my new cologne and she couldn&#x27;t until she was close to me. As far as I&#x27;m concerned I don&#x27;t like cologne that you can smell three people down. I like a subtleness of this particular cologne. As far as the negative reviews of this product I believe there ratings are unfounded given that they haven&#x27;t tried the product or are just not a fan of Pitbull. In those cases I&#x27;m sure Justin Bieber&#x27;s cologne would probably be a better fit for them. If you want a cologne that says sexy, confident, and classy this is the way to go!!</li>
    <li> Fresh but not overpowering.  Definitely something that can be worn daily.  It&#x27;s fine for work and still holds up on a night out!  Love this fragrance!</li>
    <li> My teenage son really liked it.</li>
    <li> Smells AMAZING on my husband!!!!</li>
    <li> Great price and a great product.</li>
    <li> Smells good, my wife likes it.</li>
    <li> OK.. first of. my wife has to be the biggest Pitbull fan in the world and she was looking forward for this to come out. So I secretly purchased it (at a Great price) and used it.. Now my wife has a sinus issue that she cant smell. so I kept asking her.. honey do you like my cologne and she would answer.. I cant smell anything.. Oh well 2 weeks later and still not able to smell..  But here is my review of this product. It smells good, not musky or MACHO or soft, it has a unique aroma kind of hard to describe, but I have had a few complements, two from total strangers. So Yes I would purchase another bottle and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This actually smells really great…love it on my husband</li>
    <li> Smells great when you first spray it on then it smells like a cheap cologne from dollar General . I was shocked for the 34.99 price it wouldn&#x27;t have been a better fragrance . I&#x27;ve learned my lesson never buy cologne you can smell first !!</li>
    <li> I think this fragance is ideal for young men!</li>
    <li> He really did a good job here w this cologne. It&#x27;s smells very nice and masculine. My husband isn&#x27;t much into colognes but he does wear this here and there and always gets compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I bought the men and the women&#x27;s.  I read the reviews and thought I would buy them without trying.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Usually cologne from celebrities are more hype then anything. This one was great andvwouldcwear on a night out as well as a casual day.</li>
    <li> Awesome smelling cologne.</li>
    <li> I just love it!!!!!!, when my husband use this perfume drives me crazy &amp;#34;on a very good way&amp;#34;, smell amazing!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great smell but does not last all day... More like less than half of it.</li>
    <li> What a sexy sent... my husband smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Nice- not too over powering, light.</li>
    <li> my wife loves this on me she is all over me</li>
    <li> My hubby asked me about this a few weeks ago and this was a great surprise for him!! Delivered quick and smells great!! I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> Smells great, just doesn&#x27;t last long so be ready to use more than once or twice a day.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice smelling cologne that doesn&#x27;t fill up the room.  When someone you want to smell it is close, they can smell it.  But your work colleagues may not notice it at all.</li>
    <li> fresh flavour. awesome !!!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves it so much he say he only wears it when we are out together on &amp;#34;naughty dates&amp;#34;.  He never wears it to work ; )</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for one of my grown sons.  He really liked it and it smells really good.</li>
