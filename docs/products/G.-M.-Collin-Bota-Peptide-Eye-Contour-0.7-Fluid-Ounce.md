    <li> It&#x27;s good. Not super mega awesome but it is good. I didn&#x27;t get any burn on my eyes so that is a good sign. I might be looking for something with more benefits but it not found it is safe to order it again.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous products that make the same claim. This product does significantly reduce lines around the eyes. Much better than any others tried, including those purchased at salon. The .7 ounce container lasts about 5 to 6 months. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day and have not seen any results yet.  Hopefully I will in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I have never used a product before that so significantly diminshed my crows feet lines upon the first use! Love it !</li>
    <li> Although expensive, this cream last for MONTHS and I use it daily. I have noticed much younger-looking skin around my eyes since using it, and using it together with an anti-puffing gel around my eyes, I look vibrant and young. I love this product!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is the best!</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple of other eye creams out there and this is the best one yet. It was recommended to me at a spa where I had a facial and I haven&#x27;t stopped using it since.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is lightweight and does an excellent job of moisturizing around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I love the way this feels on my skin. I had a professional facial &amp; this is what she recommended for my skin. It smells good too.</li>
    <li> People are always accusing me of being 10years younger than my actual age. I would recommend these products to anyone with Normal to dry skin.</li>
    <li> Products made for GM Collins are excellent.  I wish if GM Collins could have bigger bottles with more fluid ounce. I know it will cost more.</li>
    <li> Just what she wanted, and not at the blown-up salon price.</li>
    <li> Got this in the mail on Tuesday today is Saturday n my eyes look drastically better. ... bags are significantly smaller n the depth of the bags are less deep. .. also the eyes look pulled up. .. I cant explain it!  I don&#x27;t look tired... in otherwords worked in a few days n look forward to continued use n the results as well</li>
    <li> Have been using these products for the last 6 months and the results are amazing.  My face feels refreshed and supple again. Thanks GM Collins.</li>
    <li> This product helps to avoid wrinkles and puffiness around the eyes.  There is evidence of healthy supple skin.  I have been using it for awhile.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is ok, I did not see any outstanding results, and the pump top broke only a few weeks after I purchased it. I am still able to use it, but have to hold piece on.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is amazing- light weight with almost immediate results for a well toned and fresh looking eye contour area. This product truly delivers esthetician-quality results. Start using this product in your late 40&#x27;s and you will continue to reap the benefits well into your 50&#x27;s. You don&#x27;t need much so the product lasts. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years. It&#x27;s simply amazing!</li>
    <li> Works great on my eye area. I love it.</li>
    <li> This hands down the best eye cream for reducing puffiness. Period.  Worth the cost.</li>
    <li> nice product, reasonably priced</li>
    <li> I love Bota-peptide eye contour.  I also dab it above my eyelid</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product</li>
    <li> I love this eye contour - great product</li>
    <li> This product worked well/  Made area around eyes look great.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t improve lines or puffiness or firmness. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> My eyes are looking so much better using this product. I wish it would be packaged differently because the pump gives out too much product and is wasteful. The product itself is wonderful tho.</li>

    <li> I was recommended this cream at the salon for dark circles and wrinkles around the eyes. It worked really well. There are less wrinkles and the circles, although didn&#x27;t disappear, but are lighter now. Will be ordering it again. It was delivered timely and was well-packaged.</li>
    <li> I use this together with the Bota-Peptide for the entire face.  At 56 my skin needs additional support along with a good moisturizer.  Seems to soften the lines around the eyes.  Tried to go without after the first bottle was finished...like it too much.  Even though expensive, one pump does both eyes and lasts about 5 months for me...</li>
    <li> Wonderful hydration for the eye area.  While softening fine wrinkles, this eye serum makes my concealer go so much smoother.</li>
    <li> I do see a difference in my black eye circles.</li>
    <li> The salon where I get facials uses this product and recommended it to me for daily use. It did not disappoint. It removes small lines and calms down the puffiness around the eyes. It Has worked very well and I have used this for over a year.</li>
    <li> Recommended to me by the spa I go to for facials.  Expensive but you only need to use a small amount at night.</li>
    <li> I use it during the day.  It&#x27;s light but seems to help my fine lines.</li>
