      <li>I put the part on the side of my head rather than in the middle and that made it look great.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very pretty and came early. Wig fits, but made for small to average; in general.</li>
    <li> Very Nice, Thank you!</li>
    <li> Better then expected, great quality, and looked great on.</li>
    <li> Will not be buying this again. The top part of the wig is very curly and the bottom half is wavy so i feel like I have a mullet. Doesn&#x27;t look anything like the photo. It is very shiny and looks VERY fake. Mine is also alot shorted then the picture shows. I regret not listening to the other reviews. I dont recommend this product to future buyers.</li>
    <li> love the wig.  Great for Cosplay.</li>
    <li> JUST TOO TOO TOO THIN FOR MY TASTE..  I FELT IT COULD OF BEEN A LITTLE THICKER BUT NOT TOO THICK.</li>
    <li> I could hardly maneuver this wig. The way it was packaged was the way it stayed. Just would not work with me.</li>
    <li> The front of the wig was missing a few hairs making it to where you could tell it was a wig and see parts of the wig if you looked. Closely but other that that i loved the wig</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t take much to become a tangled mess.</li>
    <li> I got it a week before the estimate date which I am glad because I need the wig for my cosplay.&lt;br /&gt;Like everyone said the parting is weird and it sheds a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It looks natural if you wear a hat with it.</li>
    <li> YUK!!! This wig is so cheap and low quality, I threw it straight into the trash. I didn&#x27;t even want to waste my time sending it back. It looks cheap and began to tangle before I even put it on my head.</li>
    <li> Hair shred way toooo much not happy</li>
    <li> it was exactly what I was trying to order and it was as described.  it came with a hair cap too.</li>
    <li> this is a really nice piece, thought it would easly get tangled and matted, it did not. love it you can see it on a model on  facebook/ourlovemagazine.</li>
    <li> It do gets a little tangled as soon as I touch it or put it on but it looks nice on me.</li>
    <li> This wig is ugly&lt;br /&gt;Its unbelievably shiny and messy. It is going to take so much work to fix it</li>
    <li> This wig is so awesome!  I have had a pixie cut for a year and now I am growing my hair out.  I thought it would be fun to try out long hair again.  I expected the wig to be coarse and scratchy and fake, but I was actually surprised at how real it feels and how convincing it looks.  It was packed very well and I got it before the expected arrival date.  It&#x27;s very fun!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Could not use after first time wearing trouble trouble</li>
    <li> The wait to get this wig took 6-7 weeks but it was worth it. It was the right color and felt real. But it does get frizzy if you don&#x27;t brush it daily and its somewhat challenging to part. You might have to cut it to fit your head. Other than that its great.</li>
    <li> It took me a month to be sure that the product wasn&#x27;t arriving (for whatever reason). But once I contacted seller, they sent another one out right away. The wig looks good -  but this is my first wig so I really have nothing to compare with.</li>
    <li> I ordered the dark brown and it was red. The wig was tangled. Thankfully I didnt purchase this for something important</li>
    <li> They did not send me the color I ordered, it was nothing like the picture, they sent me one the color of copper light mahogany instead, not very nice</li>
    <li> This is a wig. . .that looks like a wig. Quality is okay, but it doesn&#x27;t look real at all.</li>
    <li> The wig looks nothing like the picture! When I received it, it was all crumbled up into a ball and after 10 minutes of trying to get it to look like how I want it, it was completely useless. Wasted money and time.</li>
    <li> It is a long lasting quality of hair in a beautiful color and it comes at a great price. I recommend this purchase for an everyday style</li>
    <li> the wig looked just like the picture discribed it but it started to look to wiggy for me. i applied baby powered to it because it tkes away that wiggy shine but anything that takes to much effort and time as far as wigs are concerned, is a waste for me. I work with ppl who have alopecia and hair lost, i dont want to put them in a bad wig. I want to make it look as natural as possible.</li>
    <li> I am a black woman the wig look very real on me. .looks like real hair. would buy another one.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful and thick, adjusts to fit well. I have an autoimmune disorder that causes my hair to fall out, and my young daughter said, &amp;#34;Mom, it looks like you never lost your hair!&amp;#34; That alone is worth it!</li>
    <li> I received my wig today and I am very happy with it. I was surprised at the quality of the wig and the color is perfect.</li>
    <li> A tangled mess that takes a month  arrive  It takes soo long you will forget you even ordered it  It is very cheap and does not work for repeated use</li>
    <li> I should have known better for the price but I figured hey, its for halloween.. I think i purchased it for 7 bucks and it looked like it was worth every bit ot 20 cents</li>
    <li> It looks really fake, the bangs are too long, sheds and tangles really easy. Although it was only 7 dollars.</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig! Amazing price!  Worked so well with my costume, absolutely love it.  This isn&#x27;t a reusable wig but at this price, totally worth it. I wore it for 3 days at a convention and it held up!</li>
    <li> it knotted up within a week of wearing ...</li>
    <li> Great wig. I really enjoyed wearing it. The wig is small and dose shed but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Arrived before expected delivery date, the hair is gorgeous, the cap is a little small, but for me that works great(i have a smaller head) I bought this just because, I thought the hair style was pretty and it was super cheap.. But i&#x27;m very glad I did. I love the look of this on.</li>
    <li> So soft and luxurious ! It lasted way longer that any wig that cost what it cost did ! i I got almost 2 months of everyday wear out of it ! The curls hold well ! It styles very well too !</li>
    <li> Looks very fake! It would be good to wear as a part of  Halloween costume or something like that. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it in an everyday basis.</li>
    <li> What I expected. Good thickness, correct color and length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word to the wise. Wigs always shed. Real hair sheds too :P To deal with tangles, mix a little fabric softener with a good bit of water and spray the ends/brush them. This wig is of course shiny, you don&#x27;t get &amp;#34;lifelike&amp;#34; wigs for this price. But if you want to make it more dull/less shiny, apply some baby powder LIGHTLY. There are tutorials all over the web and wig care materials can all come from a dollar store.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig to complete my halloween costume. It was packaged well but it had an odd smell to it. The wig also did a lot of shedding</li>
    <li> I recently checked for wigs at local costume stores for halloween this year, everything that I found was overpriced and looked beyond cheap, not even resembling real hair. This wig is an awesome value. The only thing that would give it away is the part line, as so with most wigs. I&#x27;m wearing a hat with my costume so that&#x27;s not an issue. I was most pleased that the color was consistent with the online photo and the texture wasn&#x27;t coarse at all, which I expected from a synthetic wig. When I removed it from the package I was extremely happy to see the seller included a wig cap and a pair of socks (what a lovely bonus!). It was shipped within 4 days, where as the products i looked at on ebay from the same region estimated at least 2 weeks. Overall I feel like a Kardashian in this thing... I may even reuse it for going out on weekends occasionally :)</li>
    <li> The crown has a weird fuzzy area, not like the photo.  It doesn&#x27;t look natural.  The hair itself though is very nice, beautiful color, and so soft.  Also.. the wig doesn&#x27;t fit my head at all.  I think I have a normal sized head.  Maybe this wig was meant for Asian women, maybe they have smaller heads?  I put it on my dog and snapped a bunch of photos.  It was good for a $20 joke.</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing. It is super comfortable to wear and gorgeous. Looks completely real. East to maintain as well.</li>
    <li> Is this a joke? Horrible.</li>
    <li> Very nice wig. Doesn&#x27;t feel synthetic and looks good as well. Would recommend for someone who is looking for a wig for thicker hair or to switch off with their other wig or to do hair styles in it.</li>
    <li> ratted and ragged.  thin in the back but too thick in the front.  Other wigs by same manufacturer are very good, this one is not.</li>
    <li> it looks like a costume wig.....the middle part is awfully not well made......waste of money.....I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if anybody want it too look real.......soooo disappointed n upset</li>
    <li> This is a very nice and soft wig not to shiny but just wright the only thing is that some of the hair will fall out easlily but every easy to style</li>
    <li> I love this wig I own 4  wigs all together n this is by far the softest one yet I&#x27;m thinking of getting it in dark brown also because it&#x27;s so soft</li>
    <li> I am going into the airforce, and I am planning on shaving my head prior to.  (yes I am a brave girl) My hair was long, healthy, and blonde, but I just went back to my natural brown color and chopped it pretty short just to get the feel for it. well prior to this decision, I purchased 3 cheap wigs on amazon thinking at least 1 of them will work... they didnt. None of them are real hair or even manageable, and they are not even parted. The hairs all gather in the back of the head and fall in a circle all over the place.  The hair wants to go in front of my face constantly and it&#x27;s just unmanageable.</li>
    <li> I was really scared, reading some of the bad reviews, and knowing how cheap it was, to buy this wig. But I chanced it and bought it. Gosh was I shocked when I got it; it is such great quality for a small amount of 8 bucks! Wigs this good are usually MUCH more expensive. And I know, &#x27;cause I cosplay and dress up a lot, so I have a looooootta wigs.&lt;br /&gt;And, it even came with its own wig cap.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisified, this wig is of very good quality and looks pretty natural. The only thing that I would say is annoying is the way it&#x27;s parted but I mean a lot of synthetic wigs are gonna have that fake-looking-parting in it so it&#x27;s hard to avoid.</li>
    <li> To large tracks coming out had to sew them back in</li>
    <li> Daughter Happy, Mama happy</li>
    <li> Loved the wig..I ended up getting a lighter brown for some reason. Maybe if you order, you should contact the seller and tell him that you want the dark brown. The wig is beautiful and long. It feels heavy but I loved it. Just make sure you store it right or it will get tangled. My is tangled alittle in the back. It doesn&#x27;t look super real, mostly because of the hair color. I think the dark brown would have looked more natural.</li>
    <li> The wig was longer than I expected it to be but it was also very beautiful!! I love the color; however it sheds an tangles quick other than that I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This product looked nothing like the photo provided, and is a low quality, ugly wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge regrets.  Money and time wasted.</li>
    <li> material: feel a tiny bit fake but for the most part it was exactly as described for cheap wig its not bad</li>
    <li> The product was not as the picture showed. it was a of a lighter brown and it was all over the place. My fiancee has to do some modifications to the hair in order to wear it. It sounds like nylon and it had a big bump at the back of it. I guess that&#x27;s what you get for cheap hair.</li>
    <li> This wig is the worst I have ever purchased. It was way too long! If I want to look like a mermaid ok, but to really wear no. horrible.</li>
    <li> As much as I like the wig I can&#x27;t get it to hang the way it should......It sits funny on your head....</li>
    <li> I Really Like this wig its not one of my favorites just because the dark brown i ordered looks more redish brown and the curl in it lasted oh maybe 2 days of me wearing it.</li>
    <li> This look is chic and silky looks very nice in up do&#x27;s as well as full lenght very charming .</li>
    <li> The texture is wonderful and feels like real hair. the curls and cut look and feel natural. The color is very pretty, a dark reddish brown. Definitely more reddish than the picture. My only complaints are the hairline looking pretty unnatural, and some minor shedding and a tendency to tangle easily. Very great wig for the price, a wonderful value.</li>
    <li> I bought the dark brown wig. The color is gorgeous! It has a slight red tint to it which makes it pretty. The only problem I have is wearing it. I have no idea how to part the wig where I want it. This is my first wig, so maybe all wigs are like this, but I am just having trouble getting the bangs where I want. The length is great. It is long and curly, just as described. I would recommend this wig. The wig arrived much sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> BUT, opening the wig and running my fingers through the hair has captured me. Im in love with the wig and I haven&#x27;t even worn it yet. It has very soft beautiful curls. The hair is soft and very bouncy.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and is of great quality. Looked great right out of the package, which was a welcomed surprise. The wig sheds a tiny bit at first and needs just a little brushing to style, but is overall beautiful and very convincing!</li>
    <li> i purchased this wig to display my handmade boho headbands during photoshoots. I am extremely pleased with it. If I wore wigs I&#x27;d wear this too!</li>
    <li> This wig looks halfway decent when compared to most of the costume wigs I have purchased in the past. Your probably not going to pass this off as your real hair. I would not recommend it for anyone needing a wig due to hair loss, because its very obviously a wig. I gave it 4 stars because, by comparison, it looks a lot nicer than all other similarly priced wigs I have seen. The bangs are very long, you will probably need to cut them. I cut mine myself with no problem. I ordered the dark brown, which has more auburn in it than expected. Its also a little big on my head, and might slip off easily if not pinned down.</li>
    <li> Well made. Have ordered several times. I like to dress up and put this wig on. Looks great with a hat on.</li>
    <li> This wig is not as great as some other cool2day wigs to be honest, however, the curls were really pretty! :D The dark brown I got was actually much lighter than in the picture. The middle parting was really weird and fake looking because the scalp was only a small circle in the middle (which ended up being on the back of my head), but overall I loved it! Thanks</li>
    <li> The color is great! it fits perfect and feels so real. its not to shiny so it does not give off the fake look. i love it :)</li>
    <li> unfortunately this product does not resemble the picture. It is also very thin, so it does not cover very well.</li>
    <li> the hair fall out of wig and it hard to wash the wig</li>
    <li> Liked it very much. Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really look like photo. Really bad quality!!! Did ship fast !!! But for the price you get what u pay for</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people complain about shiny wigs but when my hair was long and natural (dyed black) my hair was very shiny and with  argon oils even more so. So I&#x27;m not bothered by the wig&#x27;s shine and I know that as I work with it the shine will reduce. If not, I learned that hair spray and even dry shampoo works well to calm the shine down. It&#x27;s a nice long wig, it&#x27;s not truly a dark brown but close enough. I love it. Posting pics soon. Cool2day wigs are pretty damn nice and very inexpensive!</li>
    <li> i wore it once for 3 hours out on a date and it is so tangled that it is garbage.</li>
    <li> FIRST  I WOULD LIKE TO SAY WAITING ON THIS WIG WAS A LONG PROCESS AND WHEN I GOT THE  WIG IT DID  NOT LOOK LIKE THE WIG  ON DISPLAY  THE  STYLES WAS KIND OF LIKE THE DISPLAY BUT IT REALLY DID  NOT LOOK LIKE WHAT I SEEN ON THIS SITE  BUT I GUESS YOU  GET  WHAT YOU  GET WHEN YOU  BUY A $10 WIG LOL</li>
    <li> I didnt get it yet so I dont know how it looks like. Seems like it is taking forever to arrive.</li>
    <li> Went bad after a few weeks. good for a cheap buy though</li>
    <li> My wig just came in very quick, was supposed to recive it on the 11th of january. I havent had long hair in so long so it was weird to wear it, but it looks great, have to fix he bangs though cause they are in my face. but overall, its very soft and real looking</li>
    <li> Its easy to style and detangle. I straightened it out since the waves were to big for me but I love it even more then my $70 wig!</li>
    <li> This wig is great and seems to be made of good quality.  There is a good amount of hair that makes it look authentic.  The only problem I have with this wig is that the part is a very pale white color rather than a pink color like skin color.  I put the part on the side of my head rather than in the middle and that made it look great.  I think this is a great purchase for the money.  If you add a little baby power or corn starch it takes away the shine and makes it look authentic.</li>
    <li> If i could give this more than 5 starts i would! The product was shipped out may 18th and had an estimated delivery of June 12th - June 28th. I received it on May 30th 2 weeks faster than expected! The product itself was amazing! It feels real and looks real. It was comfortable to wear and the seller included a wig cap for free! I cant believe what a steal this is for under $10!!! I personally don&#x27;t have bangs and the hair in front is a bit long for my liking so i may end up having to trim them a bit, but I have had a blast changing the hairstyle. i will definitely be purchasing more from this seller!</li>
