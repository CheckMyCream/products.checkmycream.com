      <li>This product works amazingly well.</li>
      <li>Every 2 weeks my gray line grows and with this I kind of erase it...</li>
      <li>And if you worry about getting it on your skin, catching hair with a fine-tooth comb solves the problem.</li>
      <li>Taking the advice of everyone here, I got one shade darker than my own hair and it blends well.</li>
      <li>Would be nice if it came in a skinnier size for easier</li>
      <li>but it blends in nicely.  </li>
      <li>i was thrilled to find it here.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this - it also doesn&#x27;t rub off easily (i.e.: on your pillow), but it does wash out just fine when you shampoo.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this product as far as it doing what I need it to do.</li>
      <li>I love this product and it has saved me alot of money in &amp;#34;between times&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Love this...</li>
      <li>Will order more.</li>
      <li>I have tried many touch-ups and scalp cover-ups.</li>
      <li>Interesting......  </li>
      <li>I take a q-tip and rub it in some more</li>
      <li>I love this product...</li>
      <li>Wasnt sure</li>
      <li>and it costs more.</li>
      <li>Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
      <li>but there was more on my scalp than on my hair.</li>
      <li>(mine is at work now). :)</li>
      <li>Just have patience, take your time and you will be pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I love this for in between color&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Enjoyed using this hair color touch up stick, it saves me coloring my hair every month, now I color every two months.</li>
      <li>it is fast and looks great.</li>
      <li>I like this much better than the rinse or covre.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re better off just using mascara.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed this product and I will purchase more of it.</li>
      <li>The service I received was top class</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased and will continue to use this product.</li>
      <li>Also, I love that it&#x27;s shaped like a lipstick.  </li>
      <li>Covers ok,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
      <li>but the smell is overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to look around, tho, in case there is a better item out there.</li>
      <li>The more gray you have the more product you have to use.</li>
      <li>You will get it all over your hands when you use it, but that is ok</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>so I LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, stays in, covers gray really well, covers the teenager&#x27;s brown roots to match perfectly with her black dyed hair - it&#x27;s a wonderful product!</li>
      <li>Wow I was not expecting it to be so good!  </li>
      <li>This product gives excellent coverage to grey hair.</li>
      <li>It is a good product to use on the crown of your head when you need a quick touch up and don&#x27;t have time to do a full root color.  </li>
      <li>I am thrilled with it, as it does exactly what it is described to do!</li>
      <li>Great product, I have dark brown hair and this covers/lessens the bright gray appearance of those gray hairs between color appointments.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The best way to test this is to wet it then rub it on your hand to see how opaque or translucent it will be with the amount of water you are putting on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Best $7 I&#x27;ve spent in a while!</li>
      <li>It washes out easily with water.</li>
      <li>Tried using it on my hair and the color does not stick on the hair easily.</li>
      <li>and easy, will buy it again</li>
      <li>easy to use and stays on all day.</li>
      <li>This is easy, and it lasts til you shampoo.  </li>
      <li>it works ...quick and easy fix to cover the gray before touch-ups...</li>
      <li>It does have a strong smell, but I haven&#x27;t noticed it once I color my hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product...it works ...quick and easy fix to cover the gray before touch-ups...yes this is a good product to have when needed....</li>
    <li> helps but you should know it leaves your hair sticky and gummy</li>
    <li> I wanted this to work so much. I have dark hair, and I am graying prematurely. I felt that this was very hard to apply and it was a mess when it ran. You have to get the stick wet enough so that it will cover the gray area properly, and after I used it, my scalp started itching.</li>
    <li> I received the product promptly.  I use it when my hair is wet or I wet the stick if my hair is dry.  My sister has used this product for years and recommended it to me.  It is a good product to use on the crown of your head when you need a quick touch up and don&#x27;t have time to do a full root color.  My colored hair is medium brown so I bought dark brown.  My natural color is white.</li>
    <li> Enjoyed using this hair color touch up stick, it saves me coloring my hair every month, now I color every two months. Good Product!</li>
    <li> i was kind of skeptical about how effective this would be, but im surprised at how well it works. i have dark brown hair and very few white hair so i didnt wanna have to go thru the hassle of coloring the whole head for their sake. So i got this, put it under running water for about 5 secs and ran it over the white hair. they completely merged in and had no heavy/residue feeling either! Such a life saver!</li>
    <li> Recently, the hair along my hair line has been turning white 2 weeks after having it colored.  Out of desperation, I tried the Roux dark brown which was recommended by my stylist.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it and it stays in until the next washing.  Like other reviewers have said, it has a slight odor but it  lingers only a short time after being applied.  It is a bit inconvenient to have to keep wetting the stick but it&#x27;s necessary in order to apply the color.  Once the color is on my hair I take a q-tip and rub it in some more so it&#x27;s not caked on.  The product is effective in covering much of the white until the next coloring.</li>
    <li> When I received this product: Roux Temporary Haircolor Touch-Up Stick Dark Brown, I was getting ready to return it. It look as if I applied too much pressure on it, it would break. The color stick doesn&#x27;t go up and down as lipstick does, so you have to handle the stick just so. First of all, moisten the stick and \\&quot;paint\\&quot; your gray hair, going over a one-inch area a couple of times to be sure the gray is covered. Don&#x27;t push too hard. I have another product; it&#x27;s smaller and looks like a regular lipstick. It takes longer to do the job since it only \\&quot;paints\\&quot; about 1/2 inch at a time.  I think this touch-up stick is a good product for the money.  Don&#x27;t expect it to do miracles. It beats dyeing your hair for just a few strands of gray. Practice makes perfect. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> The Roux Temporary Haircolor Touch-up stick works exactly as expected.  I had used a similar product in the past and this was as good if not better.  The few reviews that I read about it not spreading properly must have been because they weren&#x27;t wetting the tip before applying (read the directions?).  If you do, it works perfectly.  And as far as the smell, I found the odor to be minimal and not offensive at all.  Much less than most hair products, hair sprays, gels, perms or colors! I find it works best if you lift the hair with a brush or comb and apply to the roots as you move upward.  It will get on your skin if it&#x27;s real wet and you push too hard, but you can just wipe it off with a damp tissue.  I have very dark brown hair and this covers the shiny grays as they grow out between colors.  It definitely tones them down and makes it look natural until I can get colored again. It is \\&quot;temporary\\&quot; and will wash out with your next shampoo or if you go swimming but I find it lasts all day and have never had it run even if I sweat.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to minimize the harsh contrast while your gray is growing out.</li>
    <li> I love this for in between color&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Wife didn&#x27;t like it so much.</li>
    <li> I know others have poo-pooed this product because you have to use water for it&#x27;s application. I purchased this product along with some of it&#x27;s rivals. Hands down this product was better...for the following reasons:   1) It was less messy to apply because only the part of the stick that is wet will apply color to your hair.   2) It dried quickly and didn&#x27;t rub off of my hair onto my clothes and fingers easily.     I really enjoyed this product and I will purchase more of it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use for touch up between colorings. If too much is applied, hair can feel waxy.  A little bit goes a long way. I friend told me about this product, and I wish I had learned of it long ago.</li>
    <li> I bought this to cover the gray in my part line, it does what it is supposed to, it masks the gray. The more gray you have the more product you have to use. This is like a big crayon and you have to wet it. I did not know when I purchased it that I had to have access to water to use it, not a problem for me, but it&#x27;s certainly not for use on the go. The only real issue I have is that it makes the hair a little flat and waxy feeling when you use a lot. I didn&#x27;t notice this when I first started using it but I had less gray to cover...what this means is I need get to the hair dresser and stop trying to cover the gray, I just have too much now for this product. It is good for a little coverage between your colorings.</li>
    <li> this stick is excellent to cover hair roots between my montly color at the salon.  I first purchased it when visiting in Texas 6 years ago and that one stick lasted all this time. Wasnt sure i could ever find it again but i found it on AMazon.  Didnt have to go from store to store... i was thrilled to find it here. Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it.  easy to use and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> This works just like it says.  I just use it with a wet Q-tip.  It&#x27;s kind of like using a paint brush to avoid that crayon problem some people complained about.</li>
    <li> The touch up stick does not really do a great job. My hair color is dark brown, however the stick gave me a lighter color that was noticeable. Besides, the part of the hair that you paint gets a very dull color. It might work for other people, but I did not like the results that I got.</li>
    <li> This in effect just puts colored wax on your hair making it look greasy! its a lipstick that is colored . the color is good but the fact that its so greasy to your hair makes it a waste.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a number of years and have been very happy with it, however, recently I have not been able to purchase in Australia and decided to purchase directly from the USA.  The service I received was top class and I was extremely impressed with the speed in which my items arrived.</li>
    <li> This really works temporarily. It touches up the roots without a mess and it&#x27;s not permanent, but washes right out. It works in a pinch. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so cosmetics snob so was unsure about a product like this, I&#x27;ve got dark brown hair with about 80% grey and need to colour roots every 3 weeks.  I&#x27;m about to have my first baby so guessing my hair maintainable might suffer and looking for shortcuts and solutions so thought I&#x27;d try this. Wow I was not expecting it to be so good!  Good colour match and coverage, just what I need for a quick fix between colours, I wish I had discovered it earlier.  Hair does feel a little chalky at the roots where you apply it but it&#x27;s to be expected with sort of product.  Best $7 I&#x27;ve spent in a while!</li>
    <li> You wet it and rub it on. It will also color your scalp, if you are not careful, tho it rubs right off. That&#x27;s another thing. If you are going to be out all day, you will need to reapply it. Cheap, quick fix, and better than nothing, but don&#x27;t expect fantastic results. It will look greasy if you overdo it. Also, I bought dark brown and it&#x27;s not dark enough. My hair is not the darkest brown I&#x27;ve seen, either. Note that you will need to wash it out before you do color your roots, or the color won&#x27;t take well. So, this is a cool emergency measure, imo, not an everyday-use thing. But for those times when you are going somewhere and don&#x27;t have the time for a touch-up -- excellent! I&#x27;m going to look around, tho, in case there is a better item out there.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dark hair so the few greys that I have are easily spotted.  I wanted something to cover here and there where needed.  This product covers grey hairs, but it is difficult to work with.  I have tried wetting the stick, warming it up a bit...and that helps, but it is still difficult to get it to go onto my hair.  The texture is also too heavy for me as I have very fine hair that is weighted down easy...and it is a bit sticky.  Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again, however maybe it would be ok for someone with thick hair.</li>
    <li> This product gives excellent coverage to grey hair. I just wet it and apply and it blends very well with my natural hair color. It washes out easily with water. I would definitely buy it again.[[ASIN:B000AAAVS6 Roux Temporary Haircolor Touch-Up Stick Dark Brown]]</li>
    <li> I love this!  The color seemed at first that it would be a little light for my black brown hair but it blends in nicely.  I also have this in black which I purchased for my 17 year old and find I can combine both colors if needed.  It does just what it claims to do.  It&#x27;s easy to use, stays in, covers gray really well, covers the teenager&#x27;s brown roots to match perfectly with her black dyed hair - it&#x27;s a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I have tried many touch-ups and scalp cover-ups. I have thinning hair and color my hair so these products are a necessity. I saw this and it is similar looking to a product Michael diCesare had that was a lipstick for your hair. It was a great product but i can no longer find it so i purchased this product because it looks like the other but the Roux was so hard you can&#x27;t even get it on your hair or scalp. It is a hard brown stick that does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money trying this product. It is worthless and useless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan.  You have to significantly wet it to get it on your hair so your hair either has to be wet when you do this or else it appears like a greasy strip on dry hair.  Also not easy to get the color to coverup my gray-maybe good if you have like only two gray hairs but not a lot of gray roots like myself.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that would allow me to keep my hair longer (this creates more obvious parts) in medium reddish brown color.  My hair is very grey on top. I work in a professional setting and need to keep a corresponding professional look.  I had been using a brown eye shadow powder with poor to mixed results (better than nothing but still visible).  I had also tried other (costly) products (e.g. MoniMay Sun Shadz Hair Powder as well as a mascara-type color applicator), but they would be messy, come off, make my skalp itchy (like it is dirty) and color my scalp (vs. the hair).     By contrast, this product is perfect.  It does have the odor and waxy consistency noted on other reviews, but it does exactly what it is supposed to do - it covers my very light grey hair to a medium brown ... you can&#x27;t tell I am \\&quot;due\\&quot; to color my hair again.  We will see if I can still color my hair through it (I will give that a try this weekend).  I plan to rub off what I can, brush it thoroughly and give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have my hair professionally colored, but the grey starts peeking through in just three weeks.  I had purchased an expensive temporary spray on product from my stylist to cover the grey. It was messy and difficult to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews here on Amazon regarding this Roux touch up stick and ordered the dark brown.  I love love love it!!!!  It does have a citronella fragrance, but it is not heavy, and I find it to be pleasant.  I take a little bowl of water and dip the stick in it to moisten the stick.  I keep dipping the stick to get good application on all of my roots.  My hair is medium dark brown with reddish highlights and this color blends perfectly! The dark brown has a bit of an auburn hue but when dried looks good.  I have also purchased the black color and surprisingly, the black blends in beautifully and perhaps, even better.  I used the stick yesterday and today my hair looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use one hand to lightly pull or hold down your roots as this makes application so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this for a thinning part (I do) then you may need to experiment with a couple of different colors to see which looks more natural.  For my thinning hair part line and scalp...the black works best.</li>
    <li> Covers the greys if you submerge the stick in water first. It has a strong smell and does make the hair turn hard. But it does help in a pinch to cover greys if you haven&#x27;t had the time to dye it.</li>
    <li> Interesting......  It&#x27;s like a dry tube of lipstick.  I found it to be too large to use directly on my roots, but with a small make up brush, I got great coverage.  I haven&#x27;t used it a lot, but it seems to do the job</li>
    <li> This did not work well for me at all.  To use it I had to dab the color on a wet Q-tip to even get the crayon to be usable and then apply to my gray roots.  I don&#x27;t like the dry crayon but prefer a mascara style wand for doing touch ups.</li>
    <li> Roux Touch-Up Stick looks like a giant brown lipstick coming out of the container.  It needs to be wetted thoroughly, and then rubbed onto the hair you want to color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is good, it&#x27;s masks my gray roots enough so that they&#x27;re not really noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, it will rub off a lot while your still damp in your roots.  So, be careful!  It rubs off a little even when it dries, too.  So, don&#x27;t fix your hair where you can&#x27;t wash your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pretty overpowering at first but it doesn&#x27;t last, thankfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, it can leave the portions of the hair rather waxy and textured where applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a nice cheap way to save some $$ in between colors, if you don&#x27;t mind some minor issues.</li>
    <li> Does a great job dying the gray hairs when they creep up (according to my wife).  Great way to save from having to buy those expensive dye kits to do her whole head every time.  Great product and well worth the price.  Don&#x27;t hesitate!!</li>
    <li> I carefully read all the reviews for this product before making my purchase. When it arrived I was anxious to see if the yays or nays were correct. I am thrilled with it, as it does exactly what it is described to do! Yes, this product is like a large crayon. Yes, the end needs to be dipped in water to dispense color. Yes, it absolutely covers the gray! Yes, it does have a slight odor, but I do not find it to be over powering or offensive ... in fact it is only very slight while the hair is still wet. Yes, it is only intended to be an in-between solution for root growth JUST AS DESCRIBED. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve never discovered it before now, but am so happy that I have!  I will be ordering another to keep in my purse. It is just barely larger than a lipstick tube, and will be handy if pulling hair back into an up-do or twist and discovering a spot of gray that I may have missed. I do not understand the bad reviews unless those people are just not using it correctly. The people leaving comments about it being &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;hard to apply&amp;#34; must not be wetting the tip...which is necessary. I simply run a little water in the sink or a small cup, and dip the tip, apply to roots, then dip and apply as many times as needed to cover your growth area. I highly recommend this product if you are looking for something to help keep you sane while you are too busy to make an appointment for color touch up or highlights. SO much faster than mixing up color, and It really does work!</li>
    <li> I love this color stick, it covers the gray with minimal fuss.  Great for when you are between color jobs.</li>
    <li> Hope it could cover my gray hair but not and it works like a lip stick go onto my hair. Not good.</li>
    <li> I have grey hair around my temples and around the part of my hair.  I have very dark hair, and the grey is very noticable.  I ordered this thinking it would do well between colorings every 4 weeks, and I ws right.  You have to wet it, and it helps if your hair is wet also.  It blends in perfectly with my natural, non grey hair.  The only thing I do not like about it is the part where you hold on to the product is very small.  You will get it all over your hands when you use it, but that is ok, it washed right off.  I have had no problem with it running and it will wash out when you wash your hair.  It does make your hair a litle still where it is applied, but that is not a problem for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years instead of hair dye.  I touch up my front streaks after washing hair and also very lightly if needed on subsequent days.  It takes minutes and I do not have the chemical damage caused by dyes.  Some greys still show, but my hair overall looks dark and I am very pleased with this system.  I will continue doing this even if I do get a lot of grey eventually.  No mess, no dangerous chemicals.  It also does not have the harsh look of dark chemical dyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties and have never truly dyed my hair. I started getting white hairs toward the front of my head and didn&#x27;t want to start dyeing my hair just for a few strands of white. This crayon works really well and covers the white hair. It does have a strong smell, but I haven&#x27;t noticed it once I color my hair. It&#x27;s not like I can smell it all day. I&#x27;d definitely purchase another one of these in the future.</li>
    <li> I have recommended this product to friends. Great product at any price - the last product I purchased to cover my grey was more than 3 times the price, and this will last longer.  I had read the reviews before my purchase, and really the only negative reviews seemed to be the blondes - maybe it does not cover as well in for a blonde?  I have dark brown hair and after coloring my hair, it grows so fast that I have an almost white stripe so I LOVE this product.  I stand at the sink, put a little water in the sink and dip it in and paint it on the grey - it is fast and looks great. It does not come off until I shampoo my hair.</li>
    <li> I would only use this in an emergency. It really stinks. Covers ok, but the smell is overwhelming. And no, you can&#x27;t use in really thin areas… looks like you coloured your scalp.</li>
    <li> This product does not work well at all.  You can barely get the thing to get on your hair.  Waste of money.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> stick is to hard and slick will not go on hair.thre it away.</li>
    <li> Love this... I need to buy another to keep at home (mine is at work now). :)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover grey hair very well.  Family member is&lt;br /&gt;extremely disappointed that hair still shows lighter than&lt;br /&gt;her natural hair after application.</li>
    <li> This stuff looks pretty natural, washes out no problem, covers the gray. I&#x27;m pleased and will continue to use this product. It is very dark brown with no red hint to it. If you dye your hair brown, you know that it tends to redden a bit as it fades, so it&#x27;s not a dead on match... but close enough.</li>
    <li> When your hair starts getting grey before going back to the beauty parlor, what do you do?  You reach for Roux Tween Time Hair Crayon.  It blends in with your color and hides the grey until the next beauty Parlor appointment.</li>
    <li> I do not mind the smell at all!  That is definitely a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;In reading the negative reviews it sounds like people are either putting TOO much water or none at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to test this is to wet it then rub it on your hand to see how opaque or translucent it will be with the amount of water you are putting on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great for me!</li>
    <li> Loved it. Will order more.</li>
    <li> This is my first review because I don&#x27;t want people to waste money on this product. I bought this one and its competitor to compare and the other one works as promise.  This one is dry so it doesn&#x27;t glide on the strands like it supposed to and it costs more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and would not needed to order another save for the fact that my daughter &#x27;borrowed&#x27; mine.&lt;br /&gt;There are many products on the market, but I feel this one is still the best.</li>
    <li> It does its job to cover up the grays.  Too bad it lasts until you wash your hair.  Great for a day or two.</li>
    <li> It works well but it&#x27;s extremely fragrant. Leaves the hair sticky but I can live with that until I color my hair</li>
    <li> I am allergic to hair dye so I thought this would be the perfect product to cover a few greys.  This didn&#x27;t work at all!  It definitely did not cover anything.  It was very dry and nothing really came off of the stick (color).  I basically just threw it out and purchased another cover up product.  Bad purchase!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Covers gray areas very well and lets me go longer between colorings. Easy to use, just wet the stick and apply. Has a slight odor, but not offensive. The Dark Brown shade matches my hair color quite well. Would be nice if it came in a skinnier size for easier application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product will last a LONG time. Well worth it. Give it a try!!</li>
    <li> Recommend  by a friend, no messy no grey, save time quick&amp; easy to applied, nice product, love it and love it</li>
    <li> I bought this over a year ago at my stylist&#x27;s recommendation.  I have to color every four weeks and really could go every three but it&#x27;s just getting too expensive.  I&#x27;ve started using this that last week or slightly more and it&#x27;s great.  I use it right up to the day I get my color.  Having it on the roots doesn&#x27;t prevent the new color from taking.&lt;br /&gt;My color is single process with a lot of red showing where the gray is over my dark brown hair.  I tried the auburn but the dark brown works better so I&#x27;d recommend choosing the darker color if you have to choose between two shades in your hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, I have dark brown hair and this covers/lessens the bright gray appearance of those gray hairs between color appointments.  Very happy, easy to use, just wet the tip a little and you are good to go,  Washes out easily, reapply after each wash and dry.</li>
    <li> Tried using it on my hair and the color does not stick on the hair easily. The crayon is dry and though I rubbed it against my hair repeatedly, the color still didn&#x27;t cover the white hair strands.</li>
    <li> I use the Roux Tween in between  tint jobs and it does a fantasized job. I like this much better than the rinse or covre.</li>
    <li> very hard to apply on hair. you&#x27;re better off just using mascara.</li>
    <li> Love this product; just ordered a second stick to carry in my purse.  As previous reviewers stated, order a shade darker than your hair color and wet the touch up stick frequently with water before applying to your hair.</li>
    <li> This works very good to cover up grays that break through.  It goes on a little sticky and you can feel it on there if you touch it, but no one would ever know if you didn&#x27;t tell them.  It&#x27;s going to save me a ton of time and money between coloring.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a joke. It&#x27;s like a hard peice of charlk. I couldn&#x27;t even get the stuff to go on my hair. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Between root touchups, the stick is very effective in covering the white roots.  Does not come off either on your clothes or pillowcases but it does cover the gray well until you wash your hair.  A very inexpensive way to extend the life of your color.</li>
    <li> Works well. oclor isn&#x27;t exact, but I think if i order the black it will work as well. Does the trick in between colors. Gave it a 4 out of 5 because it is sticky</li>
    <li> I had FanciFull hair stick which was great - but it ran out and I could not find a replacement anywhere. Found this and thought it was close enough so I ordered it. It is as expected - works fine - I&#x27;m not a big fan of the way the whole stick is exposed - my FanciFull one was a &amp;#34;wind up&amp;#34; type so only the end was exposed. It works like this - you get it wet and then &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; the stick on your gray roots. It works well for touch up between coloring. Right after I ordered this I found a similar product at a store for about 1/3 the price!</li>
    <li> The first use was easy to apply and coverage was adequate.  However, the odor was immediately overpowering and noxious and didn&#x27;t dissipate. I returned the item immediately.</li>
    <li> Yes, it does have an odd smell and you can feel the crust on your hair, but I got it for exactly one reason, to cover up the root line for a day until I can get to the real hair color the next day.  Oftentimes, I have been headed out the door to go somewhere and noticed my gray root line and had to live with it.  This crayon does precisely what it advertises, covers up in an emergency.</li>
    <li> works ok, but when i wash my hair there is a brown, waxy mess in the tub, not worth it</li>
    <li> Fantastic, easy way to stretch out the time between professional coloring.  (I&#x27;ve tried home coloring, and those &#x27;hair mascara&#x27; products, and I&#x27;m lousy at both of them.)  This is easy, and it lasts til you shampoo.  And if you worry about getting it on your skin, catching hair with a fine-tooth comb solves the problem.</li>
    <li> This product works amazingly well. The directions are silent on whether to apply the stick on wet or dry hair, but I have found that by far it applies better, goes on easier and lasts longer when my hair is still thoroughly wet after washing it. Even then, the stick needs to be moistened frequently in the few minutes it takes to apply. The time I did it with mostly dry hair was pretty much a disaster. My hair looked greasy, had grey spots showing and the color looked too dark and globby, none of which happens when applied to wet hair. Taking the advice of everyone here, I got one shade darker than my own hair and it blends well. My hair designer swears that the front of my hair is growing out again while she&#x27;s cutting the back, which tells you why I needed the touch ups in the first place. This stuff is a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> Was given this and could not find local so, again, went on Amazon to purchase.  IT is great to cover my roots before my hair appointment and so easy to use.  Again, my hair stylist told me about it since I did not know it existed.  A great product!  I love it!</li>
    <li> This product really does what it says!  I have used it daily since purchasing it and it&#x27;s perfect for extending the life of my hair color.  I need it for the stray grays around my hair line.  I don&#x27;t care how often I color that hair, the gray returns so quickly, while the other gray in my hair will remain colored for weeks.  I hate the three-color-hair look, natural color, gray and the color from the bottle! This product allows me to have a consistent look until it&#x27;s time to have my hair re-colored.  It&#x27;s conveniently packaged so you can carry it and touch-up anytime, no mess at all.  It doesn&#x27;t run when I perspire and that&#x27;s important to me because I pespire quite a bit and I was concerned that I might get streaks of color running down my face! Not at all! It does have a fragrance, but nothing obnoxious.  Also, I love that it&#x27;s shaped like a lipstick.  I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> This crayon is mainly for roots.  I tried it all over my hair and it didn&#x27;t do well.  The dark brown is just right and seems to be not really dark but more medium.</li>
    <li> Made my hair look greasy, even when I apply it on damp hair and blow dry afterwards.  Coverage is not that great either.  Not a good alternative to touching up the roots and coloring on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> This is a true life-saver between hair coloring at the salon. As the other reviewers mentioned, works when you warm up the product by running warm water over your palm, and rubbing the crayon on your palm to get it to then rub into your scalp to cover the gray. I&#x27;m really happy with this - it also doesn&#x27;t rub off easily (i.e.: on your pillow), but it does wash out just fine when you shampoo. Really a great product!</li>
    <li> This product is a little tricky to get use to at first. You do have to moisten it pretty well for it to work. Like another reviewer said, I put a small cup of water next to me while I am applying this to my hair and dip the product into the water several times during the process. At first it comes out very sticky and looks wet. It does have a smell which is not that great but you get use to it and it does go away after a while. It does dry very well and can be brushed which causes it to soften up and not look so sticky. I am very happy with this product as far as it doing what I need it to do. My gray grows in too quickly for me to constantly dye it. So, After I apply all my makeup and am ready to head out the door, I dip this in a cup of water , apply to my hair, wait a few minutes for it to dry, brush out my hair and viola!  The gray is covered! Just have patience, take your time and you will be pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Every 2 weeks my gray line grows and with this I kind of erase it...I can go near a month  without dying my hair!&lt;br /&gt;I love it because I think that the chemicals in the dye are not good for using it every two weeks and this my hair and I are healthier an happier. I received in my front door ( isn&#x27;t it great! ) with a click in Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product - does the job</li>
    <li> This works great when the roots start to show. Easy to apply and not messy. Good match to my dark brown color. Stays put until the next shampoo.</li>
    <li> I use it on my part where new hair growth appears white every 3 weeks. It works well, you just need to wet the product before smearing it onto the hair.</li>
    <li> Bought after reading the reviews.  It works good for those stubborn grays that pop up before your next haircut along the temple and earline area.  Little messy, but not bad.  Does the job.</li>
    <li> I purchased this stick (along with another brand) at a Sally Beauty Supply. It was fine for a couple of weeks, but then it got so hard that even wetting it did not work. It won&#x27;t get wet. Maybe you have to soak it or something, but I typically don&#x27;t have that kind of time. It actually hurt my head when I tried to rub it on and, even then, I could not get it to put color onto my hair. I threw it away and will not get another. I *will* continue to get the other (which works pretty well, was easy to use, and was consistent use after use).</li>
    <li> About 7-10 days before my scheduled trip for color and cut gray starts showing at the tip of my part. Others say they would not notice if I did not say anything but I see it. I can&#x27;t change the frequency of my coloring because it would be to damaging to my hair. I used to use my eye brow pencil to try to cover it up but there was more on my scalp than on my hair. This products gets me through those days until I have my services at the salon and more importantly I don&#x27;t feel so self conscious about that clump of gray in the front of my part. I have found that best coverage is if you apply some pressure when applying it. I would definitely recommend it to other who are self conscious when gray hair starts appearing in between salon services.</li>
    <li> I first saw this at a beauty shop warehouse.  I love this product and it has saved me alot of money in &amp;#34;between times&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My mom used to use this product and so I&#x27;d give it a try now that I&#x27;m at the point that my roots are exposed. . . and I couldn&#x27;t pass it up for the price. I found it gave good coverage and my roots looked almost night and day.  Just be careful about running your fingers through your roots at all after applying as it will get on them.</li>
    <li> I have to say I haven&#x27;t colored my hair since I&#x27;ve purchased this product in over 4 months.  It does the trick in hiding the gray coming out of the root line but the feel of it on my hair is odd.  It feels dull like you&#x27;ve got crayons on your hair.  If I use it very sparingly and lightly, it seems better.  Overall, it is ok, but could be better.  I wish they would create a wide marker similar to a sharpie that was safe for hair.  Honestly, I&#x27;ve used black sharpies in a bind and I like it much better than this product but I&#x27;m afraid it will damage my hair.  Any thoughts?</li>
    <li> I purchased Roux Tween Time Hair Crayon because I was experiencing some breakage from trying to keep my roots &amp;#34;grey free&amp;#34;.  I have very curly, fine hair and even with temporary hair color, the chemicals were starting to cause damage.  So far this hair crayon fits my needs.  When my hair is still wet after I wash it, I color the grey in the conspicuous places and vola! Grey be gone!  I would highly recommend this temporary hair crayon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how others have rated this so well, but I found it to apply and it just didn&#x27;t cover the grey.  Nope.</li>
    <li> This is a handy product with good coverage. I&#x27;ve found that the easiest way to apply it is with a small brush. I use a brush that I saved out of a root touch up kit.&lt;br /&gt; I wet the brush with water and rub it on the hair crayon until I can see a good amount of color on the brush. Then I brush it on the roots of my hair. Doing it this way alleviates some of the stickiness as compared to trying to use the crayon directly on my hair. Using your fingers instead of the brush is a good alternative.</li>
    <li> it really covers the gray and looks natural, and convenient to use inbetween shampoos&lt;br /&gt;quick and easy, will buy it again</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this works to cover up grays between colorings (I use it only on my part).  I have medium brown hair and the dark brown covers perfectly.  My hairdresser recommended going a shade darker than my hair color.  I put it on when my hair is still damp, and wet the crayon too.  It&#x27;s very easy to use.  Then I blow dry and style as usual.  It is a little stiff and sticky when it dries, but the results are well worth it.</li>
    <li> Works great--easier than any other coverage item I have used.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try out a &amp;#34;crayon&amp;#34; style root color versus the brushes or sprays.  And it&#x27;s okay.  The other two methods deliver better color and are easier to apply.  I need to really press as I &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; to camouflage my grays.  It&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
    <li> I use this to touch up my grey hair between colors and this allows me to color less frequently.  It is easy to apply - just color in the roots while hair is still wet from showering, or wet the applicator and apply to dry hair.  It covers the grey completely.  I&#x27;m glad I followed advice from other reviewers and went a shade darker than my hair color.  Even though the top section of my hair tends to wash out to to a dark blonde, the dark brown blends nicely.</li>
