      <li>Truth is a light &amp; refreshing essence!</li>
      <li>I just love this scent.</li>
      <li>This time, it&#x27;s the lily which is amplified on my skin, becoming cloying, sweet, &amp; headache-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, Truth is a superb scent &amp; very under-rated, imo.</li>
      <li>I love the smell</li>
      <li>I plan to buy more</li>
      <li>It is ok.</li>
      <li>and I get many compliments on it.&lt;br</li>

      <li>Glad I can still get it.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I can find it on</li>
      <li>Most perfume out there</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been discontinued in many places.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE</li>
      <li>I BUY one of the same brand in Venezuela and the smell was wonderful, this does not smell or anything like that.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I purchased my favorite Truth Parfum just thinking I would have</li>
      <li>My recent purchase delivered was excellent.</li>
      <li>More affordable and just as sexy.</li>
      <li>Truth by Calvin Klein has been my favorite for over 8 years.</li>
      <li>I was happy because considering the volume, it was reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Hello:&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for the excellent service, I love this fragance since 5 years ago an in the only place that I can find it is in internet, I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>What could be better?</li>
      <li>I was so excited to see it on Amazon!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter where you are - at work, doing shopping or just wearing it at home it always keep you warm and calm.</li>
      <li>I love wearing it and having an original perfume.</li>
      <li>I was happy with the delivery and will order from the same supplier again.</li>
      <li>, I think Truth would be fabulous as an office scent in the winter.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is no longer available in the stores in my area.  </li>
      <li>a light, airy</li>
      <li>Thanks!!!</li>
      <li>I give this item a five, if you had more stars I&#x27;d give it a higher rating.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s like having a trusted and true friend around.  </li>
      <li>then it turns sweet.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this fragrance for years because it has a clean smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower, but enhances - to where complete strangers will comment they love it and ask for the name.</li>
      <li>was fast and easy and shipping time was short.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend product and company.</li>
      <li>I will shop with them again in the future :)!</li>
      <li>Unlike so many of Calvin&#x27;s other perfumes--which I find too heavy--truth envelopes me with light floral aromas!  </li>
      <li>It is the best, not really floral, not really citrus.  </li>
      <li>reasonable price, quick resoonse.</li>
      <li>I love this colone on my woman,Some I think that i will requst To Kelvin to bring it back...</li>
      <li>Fast Service - Product is as it was described and pictured!</li>
      <li>I can always rely on Amazon to have what I need and to sell it for a reasonable price!</li>
      <li>There is something about the white florals in many of the CKs that just doesn&#x27;t agree with me.</li>
      <li>My favorite, hard to find perfume at an unbeatable price, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
      <li>Rather, Truth is for those who like classic scents but want something more modern &amp; up-to-date, even a bit atypical and off-center yet not jarring and demanding.</li>
      <li>Like most women I own a variety of perfumes from Victoria Secret, Bath &amp; Body Works &amp; many other designer names, but this one is my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; one.  </li>
      <li>it was a really large bottle and I</li>
      <li>so I will have some to last me for a good long while!  </li>

    <li> Fast Service - Product is as it was described and pictured! I will shop with them again in the future :)!</li>
    <li> The perfume is wonderful.  The scent stays on.  At first the scent is very green then it turns sweet. The perfume arrived in a timely manner--about three days.  All in all a good purhcase.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed I am unable to find this perfume in any stores! I am glad I am able to find it on line!!! Truth is a light &amp; refreshing essence! Unlike so many of Calvin&#x27;s other perfumes--which I find too heavy--truth envelopes me with light floral aromas!  I need to find lotion!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used to wear it, and only stopped when I could not find it anymore. It smells great!!</li>
    <li> This product is my favorite!  I can&#x27;t imagine why they discontinued it!  It is the best, not really floral, not really citrus.  It&#x27;s great, subtle, and I wish they would bring it back!!!!</li>
    <li> It is ok. No problems.</li>
    <li> Truth is a nice perfum, I&#x27;m using it during a day and I feel good and chic.....</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite perfume for over 10 years!  It&#x27;s the ONLY perfume that I ever get compliments from others when I wear it.  Like most women I own a variety of perfumes from Victoria Secret, Bath &amp; Body Works &amp; many other designer names, but this one is my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; one.  I can put it on at 6 am, &amp; at 10 pm have someone tell me \\&quot;wow, you smell good\\&quot;!  It&#x27;s not an overpowering fragrance at all, but is still long-lasting.</li>
    <li> Truth by Calvin Klein has been my favorite for over 8 years. My recent purchase delivered was excellent. I have tried ordering from several online perfumeries as well as an occasional retail outlet that carries Truth. Not all are the same quality which led me to the realization that I needed to find another perfume that fits me. Not having any success in finding that perfect scent, I decided to try ordering Truth one more time. Voila! I am happy knowing that I can still find the quality of Truth.  I was happy with the delivery and will order from the same supplier again. Jewel</li>
    <li> I purchased my favorite Truth Parfum just thinking I would have&lt;br /&gt;a regular size bottle. Wow! it was a really large bottle and I&lt;br /&gt;am very satisfied with it and it smells Divine!!!</li>
    <li> my mom and sis, loved it. Very good item at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite perfume for years and was so sad that it was discontinued.  Thank you for keeping it stocked online! Smells just like I remember &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Great perfume! I don&#x27;t know why it was discontinued. Glad I can still get it.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering was fast and easy and shipping time was short.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend product and company.</li>
    <li> This has been my signature fragrance for the last 10 years. I hope they never discontinue it.&lt;br /&gt;Its just perfect and I always get compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;Its not floral at the same time its not too musky.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!! Love it!! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Truth by Calvin Klein for years.  Unfortunately, I started noticing that I could no longer purchase it at the perfume counter of any store because it was no longer available.  Imagine my surprise (and enormous delight) when I realized I could purchase it through Amazon!!  Thank heavens!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the price of the 3.4 ounce bottle cannot be beat!  Usually, the 1.7 ounce size costs about $35 dollars at the perfume counter.  I love that for that same price point, I can get a bottle that&#x27;s double in size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So long as Amazon continues to make Truth available for purchase, I will be a repeat customer.  :o)</li>
    <li> There is something about the white florals in many of the CKs that just doesn&#x27;t agree with me. Sadly, Truth is another in a long line of CK fragrances that I like but can&#x27;t wear. This time, it&#x27;s the lily which is amplified on my skin, becoming cloying, sweet, &amp; headache-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, Truth is a superb scent &amp; very under-rated, imo. On the one hand, it&#x27;s a bright green floral; on the other, it&#x27;s a deep woody oriental. Complex &amp; interesting, I think Truth would be fabulous as an office scent in the winter. It&#x27;s not for those who like sugar &amp; cupcakes. Rather, Truth is for those who like classic scents but want something more modern &amp; up-to-date, even a bit atypical and off-center yet not jarring and demanding. That&#x27;s Truth, even if it is a pretentious name.</li>
    <li> I have tried to get this cologne in all the department stores, but have been told it has been discontinued. I was delighted to find its availability here at Amazon. I wear all of the Calvin Klein colognes, but Truth is my favorite! I always am told how great I smell when wearing this fragrance.</li>
    <li> great price; great perfume</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my wife&#x27;s cousin. She likes it a lot. The fragrance is very good. Good product to be given as a gift.</li>
    <li> This scent is the one that has remained after all others...It&#x27;s light and fresh, and best of all I feel better by smelling it.  I get compliments by those people that say, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t usually like perfume but...\\&quot; I hope CK never discontinues it.  This is the best price I&#x27;ve ever found, too.</li>
    <li> Thanks but the item is no arrive to Colombia, because in the company losted the package. I m very sad in this moment.</li>
    <li> This is my &#x27;signature&#x27; fragrance and I get many compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a light, airy scent.&lt;br /&gt;It is no longer available in the stores in my area.  So if ever wish to try it - now is the time.  It&#x27;s been discontinued in many places.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this fragrance for years because it has a clean smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower, but enhances - to where complete strangers will comment they love it and ask for the name.</li>
    <li> I give this item a five, if you had more stars I&#x27;d give it a higher rating.  It is very light but it stays with me all day long.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like having a trusted and true friend around.  And yes....I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This perfume has become a fav of mine over the last two years. Every time I wear it, I get compliments. The price through Amazon is awesome!</li>
    <li> Magnificent fragrance!  Not recommended for those who are sensitive to high scents, will definitely induce a headache.</li>
    <li> Hello:&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for the excellent service, I love this fragance since 5 years ago an in the only place that I can find it is in internet, I&#x27;m so happy. thanks again.</li>
    <li> Hey, it&#x27;s a packaged jar of perfume. I ordered because this is what I wanted for my bfgf. It arrived on time and all I had to do was consult Amazon to get it! What could be better?</li>
    <li> I love this but my grandson said it smells like &#x27;old lady perfume&#x27; whatever that is!</li>
    <li> My favorite, hard to find perfume at an unbeatable price, what&#x27;s not to love? I am so happy to find this site!</li>
    <li> Smells good. Last longing fragrance</li>
    <li> Got this for my gf&#x27;s mom.. Its the only one she uses. She loves it and I usually get her more than one at at time.</li>
    <li> this is a CK perfume from 10 years ago- I love wearing it and having an original perfume. I get compliments daily</li>
    <li> Nice outdoor fragrance and long lasting.  I dropped down a star because the fragrance is a bit heavier than what I like to wear.  I do like the woodsy scent - can&#x27;t really find this type of scent anymore.  Modern scents tend to be too fruity for my taste.</li>
    <li> This has always been my favorite perfume! I&#x27;m so glad I can find it on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;It smells just like it always has.</li>
    <li> This was my 2nd &amp;#34;Truth&amp;#34; CK perfum. I love the smell and I had used this brand for years. just Love it and repurchse again!</li>
    <li> I always get compliments when I wear this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;and they always ask the name.&lt;br /&gt;Love this scent.... it&#x27;s not overwhelming,</li>
    <li> Great scent. Green and watery. Great for spring time evenings or humid summer nights.&lt;br /&gt;To me it&#x27;s a rainy day scent.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this fragrance for some time. I was so excited to see it on Amazon! One of Calvin Klein&#x27;s best. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance ! Very comfortable scent. Doesn&#x27;t matter where you are - at work, doing shopping or just wearing it at home it always keep you warm and calm. It&#x27;s feminine and intimate smell. It&#x27;s like whispers &amp;#34; Hey, don&#x27;t worry. I&#x27;ll always be with you&amp;#34;. I will buy it again !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a FAKE product, a mixture of some scent, and oily liquid.</li>
    <li> Disappointed because it doesn&#x27;t smell like it&#x27;s the real deal for Truth&#x27;s perfume.</li>
    <li> Nice as always, good service</li>
    <li> All time fave perfume at about 80% off retail.</li>
    <li> I love this colone on my woman,Some I think that i will requst To Kelvin to bring it back...The only fragraces that come close to it is 212 and fantasy.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne.  Changes to harmonize with the wearer&#x27;s individual scent.</li>
    <li> This is now my favorite perfume!  So sorry to hear it is being discontinued.  I plan to buy more so I will have some to last me for a good long while!  I highly recommend this light and beautiful fragrance!</li>
    <li> perfume I received is poor , it does not have the same flavor of the original perfume seems an imitation . I BUY one of the same brand in Venezuela and the smell was wonderful, this does not smell or anything like that. left very disappointed because I love the original aroma, I do not recommend it ....</li>
    <li> I just love this fragrance and it&#x27;s hard to find.  I can always rely on Amazon to have what I need and to sell it for a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> IT SMELL REALLY GOOD IT STAY ON FOR A LONG TIME TOO</li>
    <li> I have been using this perfume for more than 13 years and it never bothered  or disappointed me!  I will use it as long as find it..&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for good prices....</li>
    <li> I will order again and again. I just love this scent. I believe this will replace Chanel Allure as my signature scent. More affordable and just as sexy. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> She loves the smell, says she plans on using often. Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t been able to smell it myself because she stays in another country but it&#x27;s nice to know she likes it.</li>

    <li> My mom loves this perfume. This is the 2nd time I buy it for her.</li>
    <li> Actually bought this for my wife at her request. She likes it a lot and I like the way she smells when she&#x27;s wearing it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this perfume for about 15 years, I love it because it doesn&#x27;t smell to floral, and it is one of the few perfumes sold today that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache. Most perfume out there (that I have smelled) gives me a terrible headache almost as instantly as I smell it. This is fresh smelling with slightly musky undertones. It is not over powering, but a little goes a long way, and I find 1 application in the morning lasts until I get out of work. So from about 9am-6pm. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> reasonable price, quick resoonse.</li>
    <li> I. LIKE BUT FOR MY MON, THIS FRAGNACE IS STRONGE FOR MI</li>
