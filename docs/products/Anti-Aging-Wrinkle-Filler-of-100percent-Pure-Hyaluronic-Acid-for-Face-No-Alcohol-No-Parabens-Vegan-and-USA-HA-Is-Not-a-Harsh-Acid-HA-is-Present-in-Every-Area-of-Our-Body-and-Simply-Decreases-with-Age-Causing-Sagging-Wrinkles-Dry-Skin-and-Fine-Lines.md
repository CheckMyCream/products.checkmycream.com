### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I want the results for the best value.</li>
      <li>Best product i have ever used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of serums but this one has the best texture and no smell.</li>
      <li>I mix it with their Argan Oil and it works great.</li>
      <li>Thus, I cannot in good conscience recommend it to family and friends.</li>
      <li>My face hasn&#x27;t felt this good in years.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for some time and and love it!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>This is because it holds up to 1k times its own weight in moisture.  </li>
      <li>and I believe that it is giving my skin a nice glow while reducing some of my frown lines.</li>
      <li>After doing a great deal of research into what would be best to help my early fine lines around my eyes, I knew I needed hyaluronic acid, peptides, and retinol.</li>
      <li>, I purchased from Direct 2u Wholesale, and was very happy with their service.</li>
      <li>It soaks into the skin quickly, and the best part is that the HA helps whatever product you use right after it to be pulled into the skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love the way my skin feels and looks. .  </li>
      <li>It just keeps getting better.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully I will be able to use it forever.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Really pleased...</li>
      <li>I love this product, but it has to be applied to the skin and immediately followed by moisturizer or what ever cream you use for moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t detect in significant anything!</li>
      <li>When I followed up w/my traditional crème moisturizers the results were still good, but not as good as w/the Argan Oil.  </li>
      <li>Loss of elasticity, loss of volume, fine lines and dehydration are the culprits that I’ve been challenged with - it has been a process.  </li>
      <li>I’m a huge fan.  </li>
      <li>The difference is amazing - and much much cheaper than Restlayne, etc.  </li>
      <li>Just what I needed, It is light and refreshing, great everyday with a moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I put this on my deep lines (like marionette lines) and follow with a good moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>A great value for the price compared to other products.</li>
      <li>my experience has been that when I followed the application w/Argan Oil, the products works extraordinarily well together.  </li>
      <li>this is a great product, natural and cruelty free, and i definitely saw the results.</li>
      <li>I look far younger than my 60+ years, and I attribute much of my luck to this great product.  </li>
      <li>I used the product at first during the day and evening</li>
      <li>This can be used by itself, but it&#x27;s excellent for pulling other products down I to deeper layers of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use this product in the morning with a squirt of pure Argan oil.</li>
      <li>Thanks Watts.</li>
      <li>It really plumps my skin.</li>
      <li>absolutely adore this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this with high hopes</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s too early to tell how it will affect my eyes, but based on research and the ingredients, I&#x27;m certain the combination will help.</li>
      <li>I typically do not leave reviews on products unless one really rocks my world.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and my skin looks radiant when I use thus product,</li>
      <li>Soft and supple and NOT dried out.</li>
      <li>I was amazed and completely blindsided by its effectiveness.  </li>
      <li>This product did absolutely nothing to decrease or address my smile lines despite using it religiously for at least 3 months.  </li>
      <li>Normal moisturizing with heavy emollients is not enough in our cold, dry Montana winters, but by using this HA serum followed by the emollient cream, my hands are happy and youthful</li>
      <li>After applying this product on damp skin waiting for it to dry and then following up w/100% Argan Oil, I immediately noticed that my skin was supple, the fine lines were gone, the overall tone went from dull grey to a dewy sheen, and the volume increased.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ad just a drop of this product to my body lotion and I can see the improvement of my skin.</li>
    <li> What did it do?  I couldn&#x27;t detect in significant anything!</li>
    <li> only have been using this for a week but i can already see improvement in my skin. i actually reordered a bigger size</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of these.  Hyaluronic acid is in various facial fillers and draws water to it, plumping tissues.  I put this on my deep lines (like marionette lines) and follow with a good moisturizer.  The difference is amazing - and much much cheaper than Restlayne, etc.  Give it time to work - maybe 1 month and you should see a difference.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, It is light and refreshing, great everyday with a moisturizer.  I will purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> My crow lines and the line between my eyes have diminished immensely.</li>
    <li> Saw results within a week.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> After doing a great deal of research into what would be best to help my early fine lines around my eyes, I knew I needed hyaluronic acid, peptides, and retinol. I also knew I wanted NO parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely adore this product. It soaks into the skin quickly, and the best part is that the HA helps whatever product you use right after it to be pulled into the skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this to use as a daytime treatment for around my eyes only, but now I use it morning and night on all of my face, and even on my hands! In the morning, it goes all over my face followed by a gel moisturizer by garnier. At night, it goes around my eyes, followed by Watts Beauty retinol serum, and on the backs of my hands, followed by a cocoa butter moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too early to tell how it will affect my eyes, but based on research and the ingredients, I&#x27;m certain the combination will help. On my hands, however, I noticed a difference within just a few days! Normal moisturizing with heavy emollients is not enough in our cold, dry Montana winters, but by using this HA serum followed by the emollient cream, my hands are happy and youthful again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid to later your products!! This can be used by itself, but it&#x27;s excellent for pulling other products down I to deeper layers of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I purchased from Direct 2u Wholesale, and was very happy with their service. I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  My face hasn&#x27;t felt this good in years.  I don&#x27;t feel that awful winter dryness anymore.</li>
    <li> Really pleased...I mix it with their Argan Oil and it works great.</li>
    <li> Best product i have ever used. helps hydration and firmness. Helped firmed my neck and face. Will continue to buy.&lt;br /&gt;Love the product!</li>
    <li> The lady who did a recent facial recommended this product.  I had been using ROTH for 3 times the price.  I like the feel and I believe that it is giving my skin a nice glow while reducing some of my frown lines.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and my skin looks radiant when I use thus product, my deematmsuggested that I sue a product with hylauronic acid to help plump my skin and I like the watts beauty line!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have done a ton of research on the benefits of Hyaluronic Acid to lock in moisture as well as copper to stimulate collagen production.  I am 61, and suffered with extremely oily skin for decades. Now my skin is dry. I use this product in the morning with a squirt of pure Argan oil. Mix them together and apply to my face and neck. I love the way my skin feels and looks. .  Soft and supple and NOT dried out. Make up goes on well. I will continue to buy this product from Watts.  A great value for the price compared to other products. I don&#x27;t need a fancy label. I want the results for the best value. This is it!</li>
    <li> I used the product at first during the day and evening and then I tried using it just at night. It didn&#x27;t matter how I used it -it broke me out. Wasn&#x27;t for me. Each person is different so it may do well on others.</li>
    <li> This one I use as a non greasy moisturiser. It functions well for that. Not sure about anti aging effects.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this with high hopes but I don&#x27;t see any decrease of any lines on my face.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but it has to be applied to the skin and immediately followed by moisturizer or what ever cream you use for moisturizer.  This is because it holds up to 1k times its own weight in moisture.  I am on my third bottle.  I look far younger than my 60+ years, and I attribute much of my luck to this great product.  I tried it on my hand first to see if I would have a bad reaction to it-- I did not.  Hopefully I will be able to use it forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of serums but this one has the best texture and no smell. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing to decrease or address my smile lines despite using it religiously for at least 3 months.  It also left little white balls in the form of residue all over my face when it dried. Thus, I cannot in good conscience recommend it to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for some time and and love it! I use it a after washing my face before anything else. It really plumps my skin.</li>
    <li> this is a great product, natural and cruelty free, and i definitely saw the results. Lasts a long time. ordering my 2nd bottle of it</li>
    <li> I typically do not leave reviews on products unless one really rocks my world.  I am a typical late-40’s woman struggling on how to deal with my ever changing skin.  Loss of elasticity, loss of volume, fine lines and dehydration are the culprits that I’ve been challenged with - it has been a process.  Admittedly, I am a beauty product fanatic and after reading this product’s description - being made in America, 100% vegan, no parabens, etc., I decided to give it a try.  The results were immediate, and that never happens.  After applying this product on damp skin waiting for it to dry and then following up w/100% Argan Oil, I immediately noticed that my skin was supple, the fine lines were gone, the overall tone went from dull grey to a dewy sheen, and the volume increased.  I was amazed and completely blindsided by its effectiveness.  This product has been added to my daily skincare routine and I use it religiously.  It just keeps getting better.  One tip:  my experience has been that when I followed the application w/Argan Oil, the products works extraordinarily well together.  When I followed up w/my traditional crème moisturizers the results were still good, but not as good as w/the Argan Oil.  I’m a huge fan.  Thanks Watts.</li>
