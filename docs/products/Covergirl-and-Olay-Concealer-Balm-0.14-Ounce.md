      <li>Great price!  </li>
      <li>The shade is perfect.</li>
      <li>This is wonderful since it is designed as a Cover Up and not Lipstick since Lipstick contains fragrances, etc.  </li>
      <li>I used this as a cream countour stick and works awesome.</li>
      <li>my sister and I are both loving it!!!</li>

      <li>Great product...</li>
      <li>Great item</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say that I&#x27;ve found one.</li>
      <li>Its smooth and feels great on my skin!</li>
      <li>I love this concealer!</li>
      <li>Great easy to use - blended well</li>
      <li>Very bendable and very good color for countouring.</li>
      <li>I was worried about the cost because most cheap stuff doesn&#x27;t do a really good job but this cheap product here is amazing.</li>
      <li>I love covergirl concealer</li>
      <li>This item works perfect actually what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I really do love this product.</li>
      <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this product in stores before and fell in love with it that way.</li>
      <li>A combination of three different colors gets me perfect coverage that looks natural and stays all day.</li>
      <li>The concealer is quite creamy and very blendable, and I like to lightly run it over the hollows of my cheeks and the sides of my nose before taking a blending brush to soften out the edges.</li>
      <li>The color matches me pretty well... but not as lightweight as I&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>Been searching far and wide for a good concealer</li>
      <li>It conceals very well and covers up pretty much anything!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super excited to have found this product, I&#x27;ve been looking a long time!</li>
      <li>Super easy to apply, this concealer actually works as a contour for me since the medium is a couple shades darker than my actual skin tone.</li>
      <li>Its very smooth and long lasting , goes on so gently.</li>
      <li>Wish shipping wasn&#x27;t so high.</li>
      <li>So far, I have not run into any problems with the concealer after using it for the last couple months, and I will be sure to buy it again when my current one runs out!</li>
      <li>Only complaint is that it should be more sold in stores!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it on completely</li>
      <li>Thought it would come melted in the mail due to this hot weather.</li>

<li> Its my color, I have been looking for this product for so long after u saw it once at cvs</li>
<li> Actually, not at all, a few shades paler than my face, does not blend at all for me.</li>
<li> I was initially worried about purchasing because the colour looked orange in picture, and as a black female concealer is hard to find.</li>
<li> but I have this dark spot caused by a pimple on my face</li>
<li> Covers up my bags in dark spots underneath my eyes.  </li>
<li> and it was completely hidden.</li>
<li> It had a few &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34; beads, but after sitting on my porch all day (in the shade, however), it held up.</li>
<li> Kinda heavy, comes on a bit thick and hard to blend.</li>
<li> It looks horrible on the skin.</li>

    <li> Juct what I needed . Wish shipping wasn&#x27;t so high.</li>
    <li> The product is way darker than on the picture!</li>
    <li> Like my wife said, you always need a darker shade than you think.  This is wonderful since it is designed as a Cover Up and not Lipstick since Lipstick contains fragrances, etc.  Great product!  Great price!  Great service!</li>
    <li> I love covergirl concealer</li>
    <li> Best concealer EVER!!!! it has a creamy formula long lasting and provides medium coverage</li>
    <li> Great easy to use - blended well</li>
    <li> I just received this today. Packaging was beautifully done, it was in tact and came in perfect condition. I haven&#x27;t tried it on completely but I have this dark spot caused by a pimple on my face and I took it and passed over it and it was completely hidden. The shade is perfect. I really do love this product. I definitely recommend this product. Been searching far and wide for a good concealer and I&#x27;m happy to say that I&#x27;ve found one. I was worried about the cost because most cheap stuff doesn&#x27;t do a really good job but this cheap product here is amazing. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Great product...my sister and I are both loving it!!!</li>

    <li> Not quite how pictured. Actually, not at all, a few shades paler than my face, does not blend at all for me. May use for winter months.</li>
    <li> The product color was nothing like the picture. The actual color is a grayish tan. It looks horrible on the skin.</li>
    <li> Thought it would come melted in the mail due to this hot weather. It did not. It had a few &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34; beads, but after sitting on my porch all day (in the shade, however), it held up. Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;m already impressed it made the trip to my house!</li>

    <li> This concealer is perfect!  I bought two and it got here within a week of purchase and it fits and blends with my skin tone perfectly! I was initially worried about purchasing because the colour looked orange in picture, and as a black female concealer is hard to find. But once it arrived it&#x27;s not orange at all, and works just perfectly with brown skin tone!</li>
    <li> Its my color, I have been looking for this product for so long after u saw it once at cvs and i finally found it! Its very smooth and long lasting , goes on so gently. Only complaint is that it should be more sold in stores!😎</li>
    <li> I love this concealer! It conceals very well and covers up pretty much anything! Shipping was fast and came a few days earlier than expected! Its smooth and feels great on my skin! I will definitely be purchasing again!!!🙌</li>
    <li> I used this as a cream countour stick and works awesome. Very bendable and very good color for countouring.</li>
    <li> This item works perfect actually what I was looking for.  Covers up my bags in dark spots underneath my eyes.  Great item</li>
