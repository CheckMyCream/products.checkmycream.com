      <li>This is a great moisturizing sunscreen, I live in the desert, but even if I didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;am using sunscreen to keep my skin younger.</li>
      <li>The price was quite reasonable at $6.27 &amp; free shipping.</li>

      <li>;)  </li>
      <li>or otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t be willing to pay twice the amount of the cost just to get it...</li>
      <li>I was looking for a day lotion with SPF to wear under my foundation and this was pretty close to what my dermatologist recommended.</li>
      <li>Very decent price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had to buy Garnier Moisture Rescue Gel for Dry Skin (which is amazing, instant lasting relief) and then apply this on top for the SPF benefits.  </li>
      <li>I bought this lotion not expecting much at all.</li>
      <li>and  the price is very affordable.</li>

      <li>and maybe I don&#x27;t have much experience with moisturizers -</li>
      <li>I really like that it has the SPF 25</li>

      <li>For the price, I was very pleased and would definitely buy it again, especially compared to some of the department store brands I have tried that were 5 times the price and didn&#x27;t have the same results.</li>
      <li>I live in one of the coldest and snowiest places on the planet.  </li>
      <li>still like to use a la-roche posay moisturizer after exfoliating and in the drier months, but its so expensive I am glad I found a cheap moisturizer that can be used as an alternative.</li>

      <li>The dry patches disappeared after about a week and my skin feels super soft now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even though this is a facial cream, I use it lightly on my arms  &amp; hands besides using it over my regular facial moisturizer.</li>

      <li>I started using this in the summer and it worked very well, enough that I added it to Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>

<li> I have naturally combination skin that&#x27;s now basically very dry because of acne treatments.</li>
<li> This Lucian has a very subtle fragrance and is light enough to wear every day.</li>
<li> /&gt;Regarding the previous comments on being somewhat greasy: I hear yea, and yes, after applying it, it really is a little bit greasy on the skin, but as for me I can say that this greasy feeling disappears after about 90 seconds, so give the product time to be absorbed (or just use less?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> So if you have dry skin, which I&#x27;m guessing you do if you&#x27;re looking at this product, you might want to migrate to another product for the winter and come back to this in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
<li> The only negative is that it has the yucky chemicals and fragrances that the high end brands like la roche posay leave out....</li>
<li> you&#x27;re using as a moisturizer for dry skin, it&#x27;s not enough, but as an add on to other moisturizers, it does the job.</li>
<li> I found a replacement for apparently dry skin, but as soon as winter started I got a lot of really dry patches on my skin</li>
<li> oily t-zone, dry elsewhere)</li>
<li> I have EXTREMELY dry skin and have to put layers of moisturizer on my face to keep it from being dry and scratchy after I get out of the shower.</li>
<li> I even used it beneath my eyes (really dry) and it helped a lot there as well.  </li>
<li> While my skin did feel slightly smoother after application, that smoothness didn&#x27;t last as long as their Day/Night cream from this line.</li>
<li> My usual facial lotion is Olay which is somewhat thicker than L&#x27;Oreal but not enough to matter.  </li>
<li> and so I was in need of a product that could do what the other couldn&#x27;t: moisturize my really dry skin, even during winter.</li>
<li> BUT I also have to admit that I really don&#x27;t mind even if it would get hard and messy or</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great on ur face</li>
    <li> Love this Moisturizer!! It doesn&#x27;t make my pores clog up like other moisturizer and make me break out! Perfect Moisturizer!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion not expecting much at all. Especially since it was so cheap. I have EXTREMELY dry skin and have to put layers of moisturizer on my face to keep it from being dry and scratchy after I get out of the shower. I was expecting to need half the bottle of this stuff every time I washed my face but I was pleasantly surprised...this stuff moisturizes WAY better than I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like to use a la-roche posay moisturizer after exfoliating and in the drier months, but its so expensive I am glad I found a cheap moisturizer that can be used as an alternative. The only negative is that it has the yucky chemicals and fragrances that the high end brands like la roche posay leave out....but thats also why they are so expensive. For the price you can&#x27;t beat this L&#x27;Oreal moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizing sunscreen, I live in the desert, but even if I didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;am using sunscreen to keep my skin younger.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and is just what I was looking for- a lotion that would provide sun-protection that I could wear everyday. I wear this on my face whenever going out in the sun.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is just the right consistency- not to thin as to not cover, but not too thick and greasy. I really like that it has the SPF 25 so that I don&#x27;t have to put on &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; sunscreen under my make-up. This will definitely be part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> Even though this is a facial cream, I use it lightly on my arms  &amp; hands besides using it over my regular facial moisturizer. In the Denver sun, one needs sunscreen, and I have found it to be very useful.  Since I&#x27;m not out in the sun an awful lot, I like the lightness of this cream (not as heavy as other, higher SPF creams).&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using as a moisturizer for dry skin, it&#x27;s not enough, but as an add on to other moisturizers, it does the job.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s moisturizer - and maybe I don&#x27;t have much experience with moisturizers - but this left my face nasty greasy all day.  Would not recommend, and I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> This has been a nice moisturizer. Left my skin feeling good and I was protected from the sun.</li>
    <li> I have naturally combination skin that&#x27;s now basically very dry because of acne treatments. I started using this in the summer and it worked very well, enough that I added it to Subscribe &amp; Save. I even used it beneath my eyes (really dry) and it helped a lot there as well.  Now that it&#x27;s fall and the air is getting drier, it&#x27;s definitely not sufficient and too lightweight.  I&#x27;ve had to buy Garnier Moisture Rescue Gel for Dry Skin (which is amazing, instant lasting relief) and then apply this on top for the SPF benefits.  So if you have dry skin, which I&#x27;m guessing you do if you&#x27;re looking at this product, you might want to migrate to another product for the winter and come back to this in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, another reviewer said that this product is greasy and I somewhat agree. I equate its texture to Eucerin or Nivea, that liquid kind of \\&quot;coaty\\&quot; feeling that remains on the surface of your skin.  Blech.  I tend to hate products like that and have steered clear from Nivea for years just for that reason. However, this product absorbs pretty quickly and the coaty feeling goes away.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product.  I haven&#x27;t used it in years so I was quickly reminded how very little you need!  The first time I used it, my face was covered in white for 10 minutes while I massaged it in.  Next time, I remembered that I do NOT need a dime size.  ;)  It&#x27;s super moisturizing (I have combo skin...oily t-zone, dry elsewhere), I love that it has SPF in it, it&#x27;s refreshing and the scent is pleasant and not too overwhelming.  It&#x27;s very light and not super greasy.  And, I picked it up for a STEAL on Subscribe and Save!</li>
    <li> According to their description this product feels &amp;#34;clean and barely there&amp;#34;. For me however it is a bit too greasy and especially during sweaty summer days it can be uncomfortable. The other thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottle. I squeeze out too much every time and also due to it&#x27;s shape the bottle keeps falling over. Other than that the product is ok and  the price is very affordable.</li>
    <li> This Lucian has a very subtle fragrance and is light enough to wear every day. I was extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product after reading many reviews. The price was quite reasonable at $6.27 &amp; free shipping. I was looking for a day lotion with SPF to wear under my foundation and this was pretty close to what my dermatologist recommended. (He suggested an SPF of 30 &amp; this has 25). It feels good not greasy on the skin &amp; works well under my foundation and left my skin hydrated as it said it does. For the price, I was very pleased and would definitely buy it again, especially compared to some of the department store brands I have tried that were 5 times the price and didn&#x27;t have the same results.</li>
    <li> In China,this is differenct. I don&#x27;t suggest Chinese buy it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth for me. I like it. Very smooth and light weight I would like buy again.</li>
    <li> I like everything about this lotion except the cap.  It&#x27;s a little difficult to flip open.  It&#x27;s too tight.&lt;br /&gt; My usual facial lotion is Olay which is somewhat thicker than L&#x27;Oreal but not enough to matter.  Olay has a cap which is easier to remove than the flip lid on this product.  Even though this product does the job just fine, I&#x27;ll be going back to my usual face lotion.  It&#x27;s annoying to struggle with the cap every morning.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisture for face.  I have been using it for some time.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Just received my second bottle. Feels good and does what it says. Lasted me 3 months.</li>
    <li> Good moisturiser, like the SPF 25 factor, not greasy.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> What a great product and What a great price!  A very nice daytime moisturizer that is light and creamy. I apply it daily under my make-up. It has SPF protection.  Most moisturizers cost much more.  It was an add on item but that was easy for me since I shop a lot on Amazon. I was going to purchase it at the drug store but the one store in the chain that had it was a good distance away so I just had Amazon ship it to my door.</li>
    <li> I live in one of the coldest and snowiest places on the planet.  This lotion is a must for my daily routine!</li>
    <li> This lovely lotion is perfect for my normal to dry skin.  It has a bit more perfume than I would have liked, but he scent dissipates pretty quickly.  You can&#x27;t find anything better for the price!</li>
    <li> Great buy !  Very decent price. .... arrived on time .... works great.....i used this after i wash my face and it keeps my skin right through the day</li>
    <li> I am 72 years old.....needless to say, there&#x27;s very little lotions can do for my skin; but this lotion works marvels! I also bought it for my daughter, she loves it.</li>
    <li> Nice lotion. Decent size bottle for the price and it has an SPF of 25 to boot. My third bottle.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this, I really did, but I just couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination/extremely dry skin and was looking for a new daily lotion to replace Aveeno (I decided I wasn&#x27;t going to use Johnson &amp; Johnson products anymore and they own Aveeno.). I had heard good things about this one, so I thought I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the whole bottle over the course of 2.5 months and wasn&#x27;t a fan. While my skin did feel slightly smoother after application, that smoothness didn&#x27;t last as long as their Day/Night cream from this line. I tried this with a clean face, under heavy under makeup, and even under BB cream, and it made even the dry parts of my skin oily within 4-5 hours. I felt this was very heavy. It honestly was like sunscreen instead of lotion. It was thick, didn&#x27;t breathe well, and didn&#x27;t sink in like lotion. It wasn&#x27;t even like sunscreen lotion, it was like straight sunscreen in texture and application. This would&#x27;ve been something I could get over, I hardly wear makeup now (I just had a baby and pregnancy was amazing for my self esteem. I already didn&#x27;t care what other people thought, but now I like myself without makeup or my hair straightened.) so it wasn&#x27;t an issue there. But it didn&#x27;t even feel like it moisturized my skin. I felt the need to reapply it throughout the day, which if I was wearing makeup, would&#x27;ve been impossible without completely redoing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their Ideal Moisture Even Skin Tone Day/Night Cream is amazing though. I don&#x27;t understand how something from the same line can be so much better. Shame it doesn&#x27;t have an SPF in it, but then, after trying this, sunscreen would probably ruin the product they otherwise got right..</li>
    <li> I was looking for a moisturizer with a spf 15 or higher, since my old moisturizer had been discontinued in Germany. I found a replacement for apparently dry skin, but as soon as winter started I got a lot of really dry patches on my skin and so I was in need of a product that could do what the other couldn&#x27;t: moisturize my really dry skin, even during winter. *ENTER L&#x27;OREAL PARIS IDEAL MOISTURE* SPF 25? Awesome! Less than 10 bucks? Even more awesome! Baby soft skin with no dry patches at all even during winter? I love it! The dry patches disappeared after about a week and my skin feels super soft now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the previous comments on being somewhat greasy: I hear yea, and yes, after applying it, it really is a little bit greasy on the skin, but as for me I can say that this greasy feeling disappears after about 90 seconds, so give the product time to be absorbed (or just use less?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pray to L&#x27;Oreal that they will not discontinue this product, or I&#x27;ll be a really really sad costumer!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, about the bottle: I like the fact that it is not a jar, but still leak-proof so you can throw it in your purse and carry along. I don&#x27;t have any problem to adjust the amount, but on the other hand I wonder if it will get harder as you will need to squeeze harder once the bottle is almost empty, so we will see. BUT I also have to admit that I really don&#x27;t mind even if it would get hard and messy or whatever since I love the product and the outcome of its use so... obviously 5 stars! - and note: I am crazy enough to pay the 10 bucks for shipping to Germany, so yes, I totally LOVE LOVE LOVE this product or otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t be willing to pay twice the amount of the cost just to get it...</li>
    <li> feels very smooth on my skin, I will order again, very pleased</li>
