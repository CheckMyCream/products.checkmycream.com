    <li> Found this first at Bath &amp; Body Works in a mall.  Then came to Amazon to get more.  I LOVE this stuff!!  Wonderful lemon smell and great lotion.</li>
    <li> Sorry but I had to return it due to the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every thing I own has lemon scent.....perfume, room atomizers, body lotions etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but this didn&#x27;t agree with me :((</li>

    <li> The best lotion. BBW bring this one back!</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS STUFF! CAN&#x27;T GET ENOUGH OF IT! I HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO SELL THIS PRODUCT. DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT I WOULD SWITCH TO.</li>
    <li> Like the product and the price. Order came on time and was packed very well. Thanks</li>
    <li> My dog would lick this off my entire body if he could, and it smells devine. I&#x27;m giving this out as a stocking stuffer this year.</li>
    <li> My favorite and it smells so good. I can no longer get it at my local Bath &amp; Body Works</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a true fresh-lemon fragrance, but this body mist is not at all citrus-y. The smell is nice, but if you want something that smells just-squeezed, shop on.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is beautiful. It has a mild lemony smell and it does wake up your senses! I reach for this moisturizing lotion more than any other fragrance I have because it goes well with the fragrances in my hair conditioners and colognes and perfumes. I look forward to purchasing again on Amazon.</li>

    <li> Excellent . Shipping was quick. Product was exactly what I wanted. Unable to get product from bath and body works due to discontinued scent.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  B&amp;BW always has good lotion for the skin.  It&#x27;s long lasting and good for you, etc.&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have is that my skin always feels \\&quot;suffocated\\&quot; after I put on lotion.  And, I can&#x27;t stand&lt;br /&gt;fake, laboratory-smelling scents regardless of how \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; or \\&quot;clean\\&quot; they are said to smell.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion IS fresh-smelling, clean-smelling, and good for you.  And, although I am not a big believer&lt;br /&gt;in aromas as therapy, the smell does make me feel good....</li>
