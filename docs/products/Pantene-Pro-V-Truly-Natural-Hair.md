      <li>I have tried many, so  when it comes to my hair</li>
      <li>/&gt;Amazingly, \\&quot;PROCLAIM\\&quot; does the job and more than they proclaim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My curls are more defined.</li>
      <li>I love love love this stuff.</li>

      <li>if you aren&#x27;t sure it will work for your needs</li>
      <li>AS WELL AND SMELLS BETTER THAN THE HAND</li>
      <li>but I love the  curl definition that it gives my hair</li>
      <li>Like most products, it&#x27;s all about technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wish there was more</li>
      <li>So that is an option if you don&#x27;t love this.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite brand.</li>
      <li>I&amp;#34;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay a lot for it.</li>
      <li>I also use it and absolutely love it.</li>

      <li>otherwise love the product.</li>

      <li>I have many products that I have been trying</li>
      <li>smell was nice n clean too.</li>
      <li>But because I don&#x27;t love it, I use the redken styling pomade instead and its the best $22 ive spent for a custard.</li>
      <li>I maintained it by applying a light leave-in conditioner and Argan oil on top each morning.</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t like strong scents this may turn you off a bit.</li>
      <li>special made for hair like my grand daughters...</li>

      <li>THIS PRODUCT IS FANTASTIC~</li>
      <li>it is sooooo cheap</li>
      <li>The difference between this custard and a gel or mousse is that I get fabulous shine, hold and definition with no frizz and no flakes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nonflaky, light, and creamy.</li>
      <li>The Pantene Pro-V Truly Natural Hair Defining Curls Styling Custard works really good on my matural hair.</li>
      <li>I will definitely purchase more of this - in bulk!!</li>
      <li>Would recommend this to anyone who wants great soft curls</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be thrilled when amazon offers this product in bulk and hopefully, they&#x27;ll add Pantene&#x27;s Co-Wash, which is another fantastic product.</li>
      <li>It does not do anything special for stray bits of hair that aren&#x27;t curly though...</li>
      <li>Pantene is a great company, but it never really did anything for me.</li>
      <li>So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth.</li>
      <li>but it keeps natural curls quite nicely.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good for the entire week!  </li>
      <li>It defines my curl pattern &amp; I give it a true 5.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very coarse, dry, naturally curly hair so I need products that tame my frizz.  This product worked pretty well but it made my hair feel somewhat greasy.  It define my curls though so as long as I don&#x27;t touch my hair too much it&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> I love it when I find a great new product I have to thank amazon for bundling this with the shampoo n conditioner, I wear my hair in natural curls and this really enhances and adds shine... it also is great for setting hair if I braid it the night before for a curlier look!</li>
    <li> my hair really rebelled against this product because it was full of silicones, which isn&#x27;t good for natural hair.  i will not repurchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised to see all the negative reviews. I&#x27;ve had nothing but positive results with this custard. It actually gave me the best and longest lasting twist out I&#x27;ve ever had!! I used it to twist my hair and the twists stayed looking like new for a good 3 days. I then took out the twists and wore a twist out for another 4 days. The entire time, my hair had great definition, hardly any frizz and great shine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve included two pictures with my twist and one with the twist out. Here was the key to my success: I applied a hair butter first on damp (not wet) hair and then applied the custard on top. I also made sure to fully saturate each section of hair with both products. It was a mess when I was done, BUT once it completely dried (took about 24 hours) it was perfect. I did NOT have any crunch. My twists were soft and bouncy. I maintained it by applying a light leave-in conditioner and Argan oil on top each morning. I wrapped it up nicely at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls (once untwisted) stay put and only started to frizz up because I was running my hands through my hair since I&#x27;ve never had such great definition before - I couldn&#x27;t stop myself! If your hair has a natural curl pattern, then there should be no problem getting a well defined twist out with this. It can only define what you already have. I guess my hair doesn&#x27;t have an issue with silicones...... I will definitely purchase more of this - in bulk!!</li>
    <li> i like it, so far no cons.</li>
    <li> Love how this product holds and doesn&#x27;t dry my naturally curly hair out! It&#x27;s great. I can even mist my hair with water the next day and scrunch and my girls revive. Recommend. (And by the way I am caucasian--I couldn&#x27;t figure out if this product was geared towards african american hair or not)</li>
    <li> This has brought my natural hair too life. I use all the pantene products and can tell you they have some good quality products. This is my favorite brand.</li>
    <li> My daughter has dry damaged curly hair and this is the only product that tames her edges all day long. I also use it and absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> It took me almost 2 years of searching for a product that would define my curls and I&#x27;m glad to say this is it! Not to mention the price is amazing too. While conditioning my hair, I use a denman brush to de-tangle my curls and then I use a t-shirt to dry my hair. While my hair is still moderately damp, I apply the this curl custard to my hair in small sections with my fingers and my curls elongate, define, and after it dries keeps it in a firm hold for days! I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I recommended this to my mother and she loves it also! I can&#x27;t thank Pantene enough for coming out with a product that finally works for me and at a great price. Please try if you have unruly, dry, kinky hair, that you think doesn&#x27;t have definition. This did wonders to showcase my curl pattern.</li>
    <li> It did absolutely nothing for my hair.  It did not define a single curl. :(</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair very curly and curls galore!!</li>
    <li> not really what I expected. I thought it would be more moisturizing and enhance my tight curls more. It really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love this Pantene product and I&#x27;m so glad that I found it.  I have super thick, course and curly hair that LOVES to be frizzy whenever possible.  This curling custard helps keep the frizz down and hold my curl....a tight curl or a more relaxed wave.</li>
    <li> While this product does enhance/define your natural curl, I&#x27;m not a fan of crunchy hard curls. Not only were my curls hard, they were dry and felt filmy. Even after sealing in my own essential oils then applying the product, I just didn&#x27;t like the feel of my hair. I won&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at target for 4.99 at first it made my really soft then my hair dried up and had a bunch of flakes in it i will not be buying this again</li>
    <li> pantene custard is one of there newer products i wanted to try it because i use there other products i am very satisfied</li>
    <li> A) I love the way it smells&lt;br /&gt;B) It made my hair so soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;C) My hair retained its curl pattern and held it for days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never given a negative review. But I wanted to inform the public to exercise caution when trying new products.  As an African American, my hair is naturally curly to the point of being tightly-curly.  The product looked appealing and so that was why I purchased it. Prior to my recent experience with PANTENE, I also purchased the shampoo and conditioner for \\&quot;Women of Color\\&quot; a while back, and the product just made my hair rough to the touch after each time I applied the product.  If it wasn&#x27;t for \\&quot;Silk Elements\\&quot; Shampoo and Conditioner products, I might have been in trouble.  Well, yesterday I tried out the custard for Natural Hair Defining Curls by Pantene for the first time. My hair was already in the kinky twist, so I just dampened the strands as the product suggested to apply the custard to damp hair. I didn&#x27;t go overboard, and thank God for my sake I didn&#x27;t.  Point: The end result was dry hair. Since my twist was already curly, I didn&#x27;t see the improvement.  Thankfully I had \\&quot;PROCLAIM\\&quot; conditioner and hair-dress on hand to restore the natural softness to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly, \\&quot;PROCLAIM\\&quot; does the job and more than they proclaim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Case and Point: Unless you&#x27;re genetically mixed with a dominant type of gene, by nature, most ethnic (particularly African American) hair requires lots of moisture!!! I know personally from experience. You cannot successfully market products to the public without understanding the natural structure of ethic hair.  Non-ethnic groups somehow refuses to get this, or simply just aren&#x27;t adept to understanding the nature of ethnic hair-types. So that being said, unless you include moisturizer agents as a base ingredient in your products, you will not be successful in winning the majority of the minority population to highly approve this product or any other products for that matter without factoring in the fact that black people require lots of moisture!  End of point.  PANTENE always puts out ads of women with lusciously-bouncy and soft heads of hair for non-ethnic groups, (like Caucasians). I&#x27;m somewhat leery of the underlining effects it claims regarding those of us who aren&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t for me. I don&#x27;t know who created this for natural hair or maybe not for the thick 4B/C hair like mine. I&#x27;m getting ready to wash this stuff out of my hair right now. My hair is crunchy hard and curl is not defined as stated.  I have been &amp;#34;field testing&amp;#34; several products just to see what is out there (I have been making my own from scratch but been so busy lately) so I ordered this since the price was right. I&#x27;ll take this to work and see if any of the ladies could use it. I&amp;#34;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay a lot for it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice styling custard but a little heavy on the hair.  If your hair is very thick, natural, and long, this custard would work for you.  My hair is short and natural so weighed my hair down some.  Nice product though.</li>
    <li> When I first heard that Pantene was going to make a curly custard I admit I was a little skeptical about it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong Pantene is a great company, but it never really did anything for me. I tried the co-wash and I absolutely LOVED it! I finally got to try the custard and I am very happy about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pointers:&lt;br /&gt;Please make sure that you don&#x27;t use a lot of the product. Why? Because that is what makes the flakes happen. Just like any other product out there if you&#x27;re heavy handed then you will get the flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it with damp hair and completely dry hair. I like it either way, but the curl is even tighter with damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like strong scents this may turn you off a bit. I will say that the scent didn&#x27;t last long though. It is just the initial hint of it then it goes away. And again you only need a little bit of it anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOOOOoo will I buy this again? Definitely. I love the fact that I can buy this for 5 bucks and have it last a long time. I only have to use a bit of it to achieve what I want. My curls are more defined. My hair felt moisturized and without even trying I was able to keep my curls defined even longer.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly 3 a-c hair and this product left my hair hard, dry and frizzy. I used a leave in conditioner before and a little oil after and it didn&#x27;t matter. The jar is still sitting in my closet because I don&#x27;t want to throw it away because its paid for, lol.</li>
    <li> Defines curls, the only downside is the crunchiness but it leaves a gorgeous shine. Perfect for a wash n go or even a twistout!! I&#x27;m AA with 3c/4a/4b curls</li>
    <li> A lady stopped me in the hair isle and suggested I buy this product along with the cowash. She said it would help with the frizz I was experiencing during these hot summer months. I have many products that I have been trying and I didn&#x27;t expect much. I applied this product on wet hair since I don&#x27;t mind shrinkage but love very defined twist outs. I sat under the hairdryer for fifteen minutes just to set it. The take down was mind blowing! It wasn&#x27;t hard or crunchy but very defined. I was amazed at how well my hair took to this product. The next night I only re twisted and bantu knotted. I got so many wonderful compliments at work about my hair....I&#x27;ve added this as a staple.</li>
    <li> I like the look/curl pattern this product gives.  However, I do not like the crunchy/hard feeling my hair has.</li>
    <li> Kinda thick, but perfect for taming wild curls in thick,thick hair. After this you don&#x27;t need any other products - it&#x27;s a frizz taming leave in conditioner and hold all in one</li>
    <li> Prior to using Pantene my scalp was very dry but when I tried to moisturize it my hair would become oily and heavy. This product allows me treat my scalp and leave my hair light and soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome it works like a charm love it!!</li>
    <li> This was such a disappointment. Leaves hair dry and looking lifeless, stringy. It&#x27;s even worse when hair dries! I  even tried using it with other products to create moisture - just don&#x27;t bother!</li>
    <li> This was a really good and price efficient product for me.  My hair is very tightly curled and thick even 4b in some areas.  I used this on both wet and already twisted damp hair and the results were wonderful.  This product did exactly what it claims for me and I highly recommend it for the price.  Everything is not going to work for everyone but this was a good one for me.  It really super defined my twist out..gave it shine and hold...it wasn&#x27;t hard.  I didn&#x27;t use a lot per section.  Maybe people are putting too much..smell was nice n clean too.</li>
    <li> I have very soft, curly hair and this product helps me create gorgeous twist outs. It&#x27;s nonflaky, light, and creamy. Best results when used on damp hair.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because I have come to trust this product.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it was formulated for natural hair, and I will recommend this product to anyone who wears their hair natural. This product does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I had to go through 3 jars to finally resolve this product won&#x27;t work for me. I love And trust Pantene products. When I went natural I wanted something that would keep frizzes down, curls tight, and moisture high. I applied light amounts and even tried medium amounts. It dries hard like a gel, it flakes, it has a high moisture robbing effect, which was horrible for my natural hair, and last if I used a color rinse, even 2 weeks later, this product would strip the color. The worse thing that happened is every shirt of my husbands that I laid my head on the stains left by this product DO NOT COME OUT AT ALL! I ruined his shirts, that&#x27;s when I gave up on it. Another product not for me</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me and I used it on both&lt;br /&gt;wet hair and on dry hair. I even mixed it with my favorite leave-in conditioner and still it left my hair feeling stiff and looking dull and dry.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product, I really did. My hair type is 3B and this product did not define my curls at all. I&#x27;m sure this product is for people with more tighter/coily curls.</li>
    <li> It gives me definition and hold with out dry crunchy feel. Works well in combination with the Hair Oil Crème Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love love love this stuff. It works great in my naturally curly but thin hair. It gives It thickness and volume and defines my curls. It works great in both my biracial daughter&#x27;s hair too.</li>
    <li> It is what it is- a styling custard, not a leave-in conditioner. Don&#x27;t expect this product to act as a moisturizer. You can&#x27;t use too much once it dries it feels sort of like a gel. When you&#x27;re putting it on it has the consistency of Elmer&#x27;s glue. I used it on my long curly hair once it was still very wet. Once it air dried it did define natural curls and I had zero frizz on a humid day. I will use this once in a while, but on a regular basis prefer a more lightweight, leave-in conditioner such as Shea Moisture milk, or Palmer&#x27;s coconut leave-in (can&#x27;t remember exact name of product).</li>
    <li> I tried the product several times before I got it right.  The first time, I used it with the wrong leave-in and my oil mix...I has great curls with great hold, but with unbearable flakes.  Then I tried it a couple more times with a different leave-in and a couple different moisturizing products.  SOME flakes after day one.  When you combine it with too much product, you can&#x27;t comb it (even after wetting) without it flaking.  I retwist every couple nights, so that didn&#x27;t work for me.  Then I tried it with the right leave-in (either Giovanni direct or Shea Moisture) and my oil mix and it worked perfectly! Both for a wash-and-go and for a twist/braid out.  Trial and error, indeed!</li>
    <li> I have curly/wavy combo hair and I love this product. It was one of the several prod&#x27;s I tried after my favorite brand was discontinued. I like that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> PROS - it indeed defines kinky coils &amp; curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: it leaves a white residue once dry :-(  and my hair got stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: by itself it&#x27;s a no go, because I do not want the residue. Mixed with gel or coconut oil, takes longer to dry but end result is ho flakes and soft hair.</li>
    <li> For a low end styling custard I liked this stuff enough to purchase it twice. Only thing is, with my curls it seemed like I needed a lot of it in order to achieve the style I was going for. Which is okay since its cheap enough to replace. Overall, its okay. Nothing to rave about. I never experienced the flakiness that other reviewers are talking about. But because I don&#x27;t love it, I use the redken styling pomade instead and its the best $22 ive spent for a custard. So that is an option if you don&#x27;t love this. And it lasts.</li>
    <li> I have used Pantene for years. This product is horrible. They seemed to have dropped the ball on this one.  It made my normally soft hair very sticky, hard and stiff. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.  This is the only product I had a problem with by Pantene. I still use their other products.</li>
    <li> very good for curling har</li>
    <li> Sorry didn&#x27;t like this product, didn&#x27;t do what the description said it would, product left my hair flakey, had throw it away.</li>
    <li> I like how this product gives me really nice curls! I would order this product again and I would recommend this to others..</li>
    <li> This is really good as my natural hair was very dry this product gives me lots - and I mean LOTS of curl definition and shines. The hair is non greasy and manageable and look healthy. Best curl locks ever.No more bad hair day.</li>
    <li> I love the Pantene natural products but this is just NOT good! It leaves your hair, dry, stringy, and STIFF! I even added oil serum to my hair to make it look glossy and it still looked a mess!</li>
    <li> When I purchased this product, my hair was in transition to becoming all natural. I used it in one of my transition styles and it felt fantastic on my hair at 1st, while it was wet. Very smooth and silky.  But once my hair dried, it felt dried out and brittle at the roots where my new, natural hair was growing in. I was not happy with the end results. But this product may work wonders for some. Everyone is very different. It just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Does not hold curls together for long.  Hair became very frizzy after affect was gone. Maybe better for straight hair that needs a little hold.</li>
    <li> It smells great and I now have the hang of spritzing my hair then applying this product. It does make your hair a little still but it keeps natural curls quite nicely. It does not do anything special for stray bits of hair that aren&#x27;t curly though...</li>
    <li> I read all of the negative reviews and found out that they were wrong.  I was trying all natural hair products for my bantu knots and my curls would not last but two days. But when I tried Pantene Pro-V Truly Natural Hair Defining Curles Styling Custard, my curls lasted for six days.  My hair did not flake or feel stiff.  I watched a young lady on Youtube using Pantene Pro-V Truly Natural Hair Defining Curls Styling Custard and she stated that you should not use a lot on each section of your hair.  You should use just a quarter size on each bantu knot.  When you use too much that is when you will get the flaking and stiffness on your hair.  So far this is a keeper.  It made my curls last for six whole days.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magical...brings my curls to new heights!  love it...Would recommend this to anyone who wants great soft curls</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews on this product and I disagreed with them.  I got great definition with the custard.  I made sure my hair was still wet when I applied it and then used a denman brush to help distribute the product.  My curls were nicely defined and shiny.  I always apply another product underneath my custards or leave-in&#x27;s which helps a lot.  I will use this again for sure!</li>
    <li> I have searched for something like this online and in stores til my eyes ached!&lt;br /&gt;JUST before I found this on AMAZON I paid over $20 plus shipping for some other &amp;#34;custard&amp;#34; special made for hair like my grand daughters...THEN saw this on AMAZON and for such a small price ordered it as well.....THIS WORKS AS WELL AND SMELLS BETTER THAN THE HAND MADE I BOUGHT!  Jordie&#x27;s hair is VERY  curly and I mean tight curl...it tangles easily and she has SO much hair, thick very thick..she is now 13 and we have &amp;#34;fought&amp;#34; with her hair for yrs LOL but no more!! THIS PRODUCT IS FANTASTIC~ it relaxes the curls and they hang longer and it is so much easier to keep tangles out...THIS PANTENE PRODUCT ROCKS!!!! I will absolutely keep buying this for her hair....if you aren&#x27;t sure it will work for your needs it is sooooo cheap just give it a try......this is awesome!</li>
    <li> Makes my curls pop and STAY popped in the humidity!  My curls are pretty defined in low humidity but I&#x27;ve had great difficulties keeping curls in my hair for weeks since the summer humidity came upon us.  I&#x27;ll have curls out of the shower but in no time at all because of the humidity I&#x27;ll just have a poof ball on my head!  I used to use a ton of hairspray to hold the curls.  That worked well when my hair was very short but that hasn&#x27;t really worked too well as I&#x27;ve let my TWA grow out some (approx 4-6 inches).  This does a much better job of holding the curls with my additional length.  I guess because this can be applied from the roots to the ends.  I applied it to my hair soaking wet right out of the shower.  I immediately noticed a positive difference.  I imagine like any gel type product, the more you use the crunchier your hair will be.  There is a feel of a product that is made to hold or set your hair but my hair was not too crunchy for me.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll even need it during the winter months but I&#x27;m definitely using it daily during the summer!  I co-wash and go each morning so I have no idea how long it would last or no idea about buildup issues.  I start fresh with my hair each morning and consequently use a lot of product, so the price is definitely right!</li>
    <li> It holds with a little shine does cause slight hardening of the hair so if you are looking for bouncy curls this may not be the product for you</li>
    <li> So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth. It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
    <li> Terrible!!! This made my hair so dry, it&#x27;s a mess. I&#x27;ve tried to add some oil to the custard, still very dry. I&#x27;m very disappointed and I want my money back!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff was the worst ever. Not only did my daughters curly mane frizz beyond belief (using the recommended amounts) but my daughter&#x27;s scalp broke out into these red itchy blotches. I immediately took this stuff back to Walgreen DON&#x27;T BUY this product does not define a thing.</li>
    <li> love it. it works wonders</li>
    <li> I did read some of the reviews on here stating that this product made their hair dry. but i decided to purchase it anyway considering i needed a substitute for the other product i was using. This does not moisturize the hair at all. In fact, it did make my hair dry and felt a bit brittle. I had remembered when I had my hair done, I was told to stay away from Pantene products and I should have known better.</li>
    <li> When it comes to Curl custards, curl cremes etc... I think I&#x27;m the Curl Queen.  I have tried many, so  when it comes to my hair I know exactly what I&#x27;m looking for in a product.  I&#x27;m happy to say that I have added Pantene&#x27;s Defining Curls Styling  Custard to my regimen.  Like most products, it&#x27;s all about technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need a creme that defines my natural curl and gives it a strong hold,  almost like a set.  A good custard will give me a set that lasts a week.  My hair is long and very curly.  I wear it long and curly with no frizz.  I apply a leave-in moisturizer and then this great custard.  My long hair air dries and is completely dry after only an hour and a half.  This is fantastic for me!  If I want to switch it up, this product is also great for me to sleek my hair into a bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is shiny, defined and set.  Once it&#x27;s set, I apply Pantene&#x27;s serum and I&#x27;m good for the entire week!  At night I put my hair in a high pony, during the day I release my hair, shake it out and that&#x27;s it.  With the use of some cremes/custards, my hair can take 6 hours to dry.  The difference between this custard and a gel or mousse is that I get fabulous shine, hold and definition with no frizz and no flakes.  It&#x27;s also very inexpensive and easily obtainable.  Good job, Pantene.  I&#x27;ll be thrilled when amazon offers this product in bulk and hopefully, they&#x27;ll add Pantene&#x27;s Co-Wash, which is another fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Love it... I wish there was more but I love the  curl definition that it gives my hair</li>
    <li> Smells good.  Thought it would hold a little better with my thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> This product smells awesome and it does what it says it will! I&#x27;m on my second jar. My curls haven&#x27;t looked better!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately leaves a white residue in my hair....smells awesome though</li>
    <li> product was ok it leaves white residue on your hair</li>
    <li> It leaves my boy&#x27;s curls well formed and natural looking all day. I have tried lots of products- cheap and expensive; but not comparison to this product.</li>
    <li> This works better than I thought! My hair curls like with any other cream and keeps it humected and protected and not too tight</li>
    <li> The Pantene Pro-V Truly Natural Hair Defining Curls Styling Custard works really good on my matural hair. It defines my curl pattern &amp; I give it a true 5. It may not work for everyone cause all types of hair are different I know it work on mines.</li>
    <li> It got hard which was not what I was looking for also it is very flaky. Save yourself the hassle, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Really brings out my curls</li>
    <li> Perfect product if flaky, stiff, and dried out hair is what you&#x27;re going for. It feels moisturizing when you apply it but once it dries, so does your hair! Might as well use an extra hold alcohol based hair gel as you will get the same result with this product. Pantene missed the mark with this one. They should do more research on coarse hair and test their products before putting it out.</li>
    <li> love this product! wish i&#x27;d used it earlier! Makes my hair shine and keeps the curls in place better than what i used to use.</li>
    <li> defines curls. after few days starts to flake around edges like a gel. otherwise love the product. Does not make curls hard or crunchy.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair that takes forever to dry. This helps keep the frizz away and dries into nice curls.</li>
    <li> Holds the curls in place without leaving your hair stiff</li>
    <li> I am AA and have 3c type hair. This is the only custard that I could use that will give moisture to my hair all day. It keeps my hair soft. It even works well when applied to dry hair, which is how I apply it daily; on dry hair. It leaves my hair soft and smells great!</li>
    <li> wife uses this for the kids daily, she loves it.</li>
