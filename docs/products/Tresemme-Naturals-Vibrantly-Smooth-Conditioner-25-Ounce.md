      <li>I love this conditioner I co-wash with it and mix my vitamins in it to make my homemade shampoo.</li>
      <li>Feels full and nice when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The TRESemme Naturals Nourishing Moisturizer with Aloe and Avocado is my favorite; but Vibrantly Smooth is a close second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced and a good quality product.</li>
      <li>ya get what ya pay for and it runs out of hair to easily.</li>

      <li>I have always loved the aroma of coconut and this conditioner not only smells nice</li>

      <li>it also leaves your have feeling smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>It is cheap.  </li>
      <li>It is great and a terrific convenient size for alot of use.</li>
      <li>Cheap conditioner that does indeed leave hair smooth.</li>
      <li>and I buy this because it&#x27;s cheap and works</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair clean, soft and smelling good.  </li>
      <li>I would rate this product higher if I thought it was environmentally safe.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s decent and I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s free of silicones.  </li>
      <li>IT IS GOOD FOR TRAVELING BECAUSE I CAN USE IT FOR MY CO-WASH, LEAVE IN, DEEP CONDITIONER.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different conditioners from curly hair conditioners to children&#x27;s detanglers, and this is my favorite to date.</li>
      <li>I do not use too much product when styling, nor do I part and apply like I have seen others do since my hair strands are fine.  </li>
      <li>you need a silicone free conditioner and you have fine curly white girl hair - I would give this one a go.  </li>
      <li>The old formula might have been better, but this formula is very drying on my wavy/curly hair.</li>
      <li>I love this product, definitely on on my staples for wash and go&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Highly appreciated!</li>
      <li>The price is so reasonable, it is worth it.</li>
      <li>At first, I thought it moisturized well.  </li>
      <li>but if you don&#x27;t have very dry/frizzy hair, this could work well for you!</li>
      <li>I decided to give it a try and so far I am very pleased with the outcome, so much that I have purchased it several times.  </li>
      <li>It works well and has great slip for my naturally curly, fine, thin hair.  </li>
      <li>I previous use Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner, and while that worked great when my hair was shorter, I found that as my hair grew longer and thicker detangling became more of a chore.</li>
      <li>i have really curly hair</li>
      <li>Highly Recommend this!</li>
      <li>I was expecting to get the Tresemme Naturals with the white top like in the picture, instead I received the bottle with the black top and the new formula.</li>
      <li>I do not want to weigh my hair down or look like I have ramen noodles on top of my head.</li>
      <li>I use this on my son&#x27;s hair who has super curly mixed Jewish/Black curls.  </li>
      <li>I am usually very tender headed and cant stand combing through my natural hair.</li>
      <li>iT LEAVES MY HAIR VERY SOFT.</li>
      <li>(I have long hair), I can comb through right in the shower.  </li>
      <li>After I shower, I add more conditioner (TRESemme Naturals), my homemade oil that includes avocado, jojoba, Shea and castor and a little vegetable glycerin, along with beneficial essential oils and finish it off with my homemade flax seed gel.  </li>
      <li>If you have sensitive hair, STAY AWAY.</li>
      <li>Use it as a co-wash and makes hair feel hydrated and soft.</li>
      <li>It detangles my hair and makes it soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>Still, points for no animal testing, natural ingredients and price/size.</li>
      <li>anything but natural.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as some others out there</li>
      <li>I was looking for another &#x27;natural&#x27; conditioner and came across this brand.  </li>
      <li>I have used other conditioners without success.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s still gonna give you major build-up.</li>
      <li>I wanted the product to be as natural as possible and to have a lot of slip in order to making the detangling process easier.</li>

<li> Will buy exclusively from now on instead of my usual conditioner.</li>
<li> Not sure how I feel about that.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really liked this conditioner at first.  It smells nice, and it has good slip for being silicone-free.  At first, I thought it moisturized well.  But after about two weeks, my hair started falling out in clumps and became incredibly brittle.  I cut out all silicones when my curls started thinning a couple years ago, but this was out of control.  I stopped using immediately and a couple months later, my hair seems to finally be recovering.  If you have sensitive hair, STAY AWAY.</li>
    <li> This is not quite as moisturizing as I would have liked.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as some others out there but it&#x27;s decent and I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s free of silicones.  Probably won&#x27;t buy again but if you don&#x27;t have very dry/frizzy hair, this could work well for you!</li>
    <li> I have always loved the aroma of coconut and this conditioner not only smells nice it also leaves your have feeling smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> I am a cowashing curly girl, and this silicone-free conditioner fits the bill beautifully.  I use it almost every time I wash my hair and I also put some in a spray bottle diluted with water, and I use that to refresh my hair and untangle it on no-wash days.</li>
    <li> I was looking for another &#x27;natural&#x27; conditioner and came across this brand.  I decided to give it a try and so far I am very pleased with the outcome, so much that I have purchased it several times.  It is smooth and awesome for curly hair.</li>
    <li> i have really curly hair and I Love this conditioner, its my go to.Perfect as a leave in too, leaves my hair soooo soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I was expecting to get the Tresemme Naturals with the white top like in the picture, instead I received the bottle with the black top and the new formula.</li>
    <li> I have natural thick hair 4a in front an a 4b or c in back this conditioner does wonders. Detangles nicely where i can comb out my curls without pain or hassle.</li>
    <li> I am super picky with conditioners as I have very long, very thick, curly dyed hair. This conditioner is amazing. It works great and the smell is lovely. I used it over 24 hours ago and I can still smell it when I move my hair. Yum!</li>
    <li> I use this on my son&#x27;s hair who has super curly mixed Jewish/Black curls.  This makes his hair so easy to comb through and smells great. I comb out his hair in the bath with the conditioner still in.  I have tried so many different conditioners from curly hair conditioners to children&#x27;s detanglers, and this is my favorite to date.</li>
    <li> Usually &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; means too much conditioner and silicone in the product to make hair smooth, meaning it would get dirty sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not with this.  Sleek and easy on tangles (I have long hair), I can comb through right in the shower.  Feels full and nice when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My neck doesn&#x27;t break out with this as with some conditioners.</li>
    <li> I wash with this conditioner.  It leaves my hair clean, soft and smelling good.  The price is so reasonable, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is awesome! I previous use Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner, and while that worked great when my hair was shorter, I found that as my hair grew longer and thicker detangling became more of a chore. I wanted the product to be as natural as possible and to have a lot of slip in order to making the detangling process easier. I am between a 3c and a 4a and this conditioner works great for me. Also I have colored hair --red to be specific-- if that matters at all. Highly Recommend this!</li>
    <li> But it&#x27;s still gonna give you major build-up. Still, points for no animal testing, natural ingredients and price/size. Seems to have been taken off the shelves too....</li>
    <li> Love it. Use it as a co-wash and makes hair feel hydrated and soft.</li>
    <li> Works great, has a good smell but not a fake/overpowering fragrance. Will buy exclusively from now on instead of my usual conditioner.</li>
    <li> THIS CONDITIONER IS EXCELLENT FOR MY 3C HAIR. iT LEAVES MY HAIR VERY SOFT. IT IS GOOD FOR TRAVELING BECAUSE I CAN USE IT FOR MY CO-WASH, LEAVE IN, DEEP CONDITIONER.</li>
    <li> This is a holy grail hair product for me. I just hope they don&#x27;t discontinue the formula anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I like to use this in conjunction with the &#x27;naturals&#x27; shampoo by Tresemme&#x27;. It detangles my hair and makes it soft and manageable. I am usually very tender headed and cant stand combing through my natural hair. I am AA and do not have any chemical in my hair. It&#x27;s reasonably priced and a good quality product. I also use this product on my synthetic wigs.</li>
    <li> My hair hates this product now that some of the ingredients have been changed. ;o(</li>
    <li> anything but natural. garbage cheap filler ingredients. ya get what ya pay for and it runs out of hair to easily. can get in Walmart for pennies.</li>
    <li> I used this before my washing hair. It helps my hair smooth and shiny. It was too big, I think I need a long time to finish this bottle.</li>
    <li> The old formula might have been better, but this formula is very drying on my wavy/curly hair. I have no idea how a sulfate-free, silicone-free conditioner manages to leave my ends so dry and brittle, but there you have it. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Just use according to bottle and works AMAZINGLY!! Highly appreciated! Only use conditioners that don&#x27;t have silicone. No silicone&#x3D; good hair</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner I co-wash with it and mix my vitamins in it to make my homemade shampoo. It is great and a terrific convenient size for alot of use.</li>
    <li> Cheap conditioner that does indeed leave hair smooth. Has a salon smell that stays on my hair for days. Not sure how I feel about that. It&#x27;s not bad or good. I would rate this product higher if I thought it was environmentally safe. I have a septic tank and I buy this because it&#x27;s cheap and works and it&#x27;s &amp;#34;silicone free&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m not sure that being &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; means it&#x27;s organic etc septic tank safe.</li>
    <li> I use this as my co-wash and leave-in. I love this product, definitely on on my staples for wash and go&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is the only place I can find this &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; of TRESemme Naturals.  I love this stuff.  It is cheap.  It works well and has great slip for my naturally curly, fine, thin hair.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hear greasy, but yet my hair feels moisturized.  I use it as rinse out conditioner, then put a pea sized squirt in my hair after my shower as a leave in.  I then style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a silicone free conditioner and you have fine curly white girl hair - I would give this one a go.  It smells nice too!</li>
    <li> The TRESemme Naturals Nourishing Moisturizer with Aloe and Avocado is my favorite; but Vibrantly Smooth is a close second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to wash my hair every other day; but now that I am training for a marathon, coming up in September, I work out 6 to 7 days a week for 2-3 hours at a time.  Because my hair gets literally soaked, I have to wash it everyday.  As such, I wear wash n gos.  This is where TRESemme Conditioner Naturals come in.  I use it as my styling cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair with As I Am throughout the week, condition and &amp;#34;detangle&amp;#34; with TRESemme Naturals and rinse well.  After I shower, I add more conditioner (TRESemme Naturals), my homemade oil that includes avocado, jojoba, Shea and castor and a little vegetable glycerin, along with beneficial essential oils and finish it off with my homemade flax seed gel.  Homemade flax seed gel is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair comes out curly, bouncy and gorgeous--even after it dries.  I have used other conditioners without success.  So, I am sticking to both TRESemme Naturals.  I do not use too much product when styling, nor do I part and apply like I have seen others do since my hair strands are fine.  I do not want to weigh my hair down or look like I have ramen noodles on top of my head. Also, the price is excellent.</li>
