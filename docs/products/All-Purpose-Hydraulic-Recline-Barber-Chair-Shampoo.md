<li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like so far is that it is hard to spin around.</li>
<li> Only flaw the rubber that is around the base is a little too short for the base and comes off from time to time.</li>

    <li> Great price for the chair...We use this for personal use only and have not had any problems with it.  It is not plush but it does the job.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this chair for my in home personal salon.  Looks great and was easy to put together. I love it.</li>

    <li> Love the chair except the rubber liner for the bottom of it doesn&#x27;t stay on and isn&#x27;t long enough to go all the way around. Mostly color resistant and comfy.</li>
    <li> I bought the chair because I needed a new one for my home. When the box arrived it was enormous of course. But then when I got everything out of the box, there were no instructions. If you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing or have never had a chair of your own. I&#x27;d suggest getting instructions before attempting a throw together chair.</li>
    <li> Awesome chair was shipped out really fast and it super easy to put together i love it!!!</li>
    <li> I chose this chair because of the recline feature and it&#x27;s red. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like so far is that it is hard to spin around. We are going to try some silicone type of grease to see if it helps. I would recommend this chair to anyone who has the patience for breaking it in.</li>
