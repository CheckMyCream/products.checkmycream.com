      <li>I love good bakhoor and this is great!</li>
      <li>i get a lot of patchouli/laundry detergent but not as pleasant of one I am used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even my husband loved that smell.</li>
      <li>So, I don&#x27;t know how good is this Oudh.</li>
      <li>It arrived in good time and the quantity and quality is good.</li>

      <li>honestly these have a foul after-smell.</li>
      <li>Love love love!!</li>
      <li>Very strong perfume smell, almost overbearing.</li>

      <li>I have received this incense as a gift from a dear friend of mine and immediately fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>I gifted this Oudh to one of my friend.</li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>I love the way it burns.</li>
      <li>great product, it made my house smell good and last even after it burns off .</li>
      <li>bought another scent by Nabeel which I find to be much better and more soothing and inviting.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Just love it and will buy again.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more like laundry detergent that is too strong.</li>
      <li>it isn&#x27;t good quality like the kind you can buy in the Middle East.</li>
      <li>Smells great, they come in small pieces and using it even once a week keeps the home feeling and smelling good.</li>

      <li>Super fast delivery.</li>
      <li>it is very earthy, woody smell that will leave you refreshed, calm and relaxed.</li>
      <li>So, I have ordered a second box : ))</li>
      <li>I got this for my mother and it reminded her of the Oudh she used to get back home, so I immediately bought four more.</li>
      <li>The oudh smells great and is long lasting.</li>
      <li>Not bad, but it isn&#x27;t like what we have in Middle East</li>
      <li>Fragrance is not strong or very sweet as I thought.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be a natural smell</li>
      <li>/&gt;more of a masculine incense oudh</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more and feel confidant enough with this brand/seller  to try other scents.</li>
      <li>The scent is strong, but not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Very nice at first but over a long duration can get sickening.</li>

    <li> great product, it made my house smell good and last even after it burns off . so happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The box just arrived. This scent changed my life. It is sublime. I can&#x27;t wait until It permeates my home.</li>
    <li> Love it! Ordered it Monday, got it today (Wednesday) smells wonderful! I love good bakhoor and this is great! Doesn&#x27;t leave a burnt scent afterwards.  I&#x27;m not great at describing scents so I won&#x27;t try. Great product and great shipping! If you like good quality incense, this is it! The packaging and container are great. They have modern stylish labels. I burn a few pieces on a charcoal disk and it completely fills a 1000 sq ft space. Love love love!!</li>

    <li> Wonderful scent, super fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery. Nice packaging. Not for those who are looking for a woody smell. It smells like super overwhelming perfume. Had to put into two zip-lock baggies to stop the smell. Of course, it&#x27;s all my fault, I had know idea what I was buying... The picture of reddish wooden chips made me believe that it was what i needed. Just keep searching and searching for Arabic (may be from Sudan?) sugar-coated wood chips (may be sandalwood?). They should be red in color...&lt;br /&gt;What happened to traditional sugar-coated wooden chips? Oh, I remember THAT smell, it was sooooo good! I am out of it, and hope to find it in the USA. Does anyone sells it???? without the perfume? THAT one does smelled like a wood! Even my husband loved that smell. Advice?</li>
    <li> Not as expected. Thought it will be close to powdered but just too rough like smaller pellets. Fragrance is not strong or very sweet as I thought.</li>
    <li> Great Bkhoor! No words to say!</li>
    <li> It arrived in good time and the quantity and quality is good.</li>
    <li> Iam a big fan of incense. That one is just the right stuff. Smell great</li>
    <li> I got this for my mother and it reminded her of the Oudh she used to get back home, so I immediately bought four more. The oudh smells great and is long lasting. Will definitely continue to order this product!</li>
    <li> Smells great, they come in small pieces and using it even once a week keeps the home feeling and smelling good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great bokhour I use it on daily basis. I will purchase it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> oh this scent is greatest I have used I burned some last night and its now next day afternoon the scent is still in the air. Just love it and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Very nice at first but over a long duration can get sickening. This is a powerhouse but its a nice scent just not the best or my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought another scent by Nabeel which I find to be much better and more soothing and inviting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I burn these on a candle warmer spread out on the plate and it fills a room quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;more of a masculine incense oudh i get a lot of patchouli/laundry detergent but not as pleasant of one I am used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad but I will try others before I am to purchase this one again.</li>
    <li> Quality charcoal pieces.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have received this incense as a gift from a dear friend of mine and immediately fell in love with it. So, I have ordered a second box : )) it is very earthy, woody smell that will leave you refreshed, calm and relaxed. It lifts up the mood, and it could be practically used to change the home odor after cooking, or cleaning. I love it.</li>
    <li> honestly these have a foul after-smell. it isn&#x27;t good quality like the kind you can buy in the Middle East.</li>
    <li> Beautiful fragrance.  I love the way it burns.</li>
    <li> One of the best. We all liked it a lot.</li>
    <li> This is not 100% oud. Very strong perfume smell, almost overbearing.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Nice quality. The scent is strong, but not overwhelming. I will definitely buy more and feel confidant enough with this brand/seller  to try other scents.</li>
    <li> Not bad, but it isn&#x27;t like what we have in Middle East</li>
    <li> Great for regular use.</li>
    <li> This product works as described.</li>
    <li> Blech!!  I thought it would be a natural smell but it&#x27;s more like laundry detergent that is too strong.</li>
    <li> my first oudh chips very nice will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not Oud, it&#x27;s somehow smell like a scent</li>
    <li> Reminds me of being back in The Kingdom of Bahrain. I love this particular oudh fragrance. Calming and clears out the energy of my place.</li>
    <li> I gifted this Oudh to one of my friend. So, I don&#x27;t know how good is this Oudh.</li>
    <li> Smells like home !! Better than I ever expected :)</li>
    <li> Cannot get enough of it. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Very nice and quality bukhoor. The way should be.</li>
