<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. Feels good in your hands/comfortable</li>
    <li> It O.k. for my wife she love it</li>
    <li> Perfect for doing your own manicures and pedicures</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so easy to used like it</li>
    <li> I use nippers regularly and the ones I&#x27;ve had for several years now started to get dull, so I chose these because of the great reviews. I&#x27;m returning them because they stick, once you make the cut, they stay together and you have to manually separate them, which is a pain and causes your skin to pull as well.</li>
    <li> Love it! Nipper is very sharp! Only reason why I give 4 stars is because the grippers weren&#x27;t very sturdy.</li>
    <li> My wife does her own gel manicures at home.  She really likes these cuticle nippers compared to the ones made in china.  These are heavier steel, very sharp, nice rubber grip handles, tension spring does not catch on the side and glides very smooth. The spring is new so it may be stiff at first.  Only design flaw is the rubber grips do slide around since it&#x27;s just a removable sleeve on the handles. My wife thinks these are great for home use. If you have these in a nail salon to use on clients, the rubber grips slide around too much and you nip your client! Plus, the tension spring is slightly stiff and can cramp up the hand if used all day.  But these are super sharp, wife loves them even without the grips.</li>
    <li> As soon as I received this cuticle nipper I used it right away and instantly I was so relieved that finally I found a good nipper! I love it because it easy to use, have a good grip which is very important and very sharp too! It can take out the smallest cuticle ever and sharp and pointy enough to dig unto to the hardened cuticle underneath the nails. Such a keeper! Highly recommended cuticle nipper!</li>
    <li> These work great! I have had other, cheap cuticle cutters because I figured they were all pretty much the same, so not true. For starters, the handle on this pair is comfortable and has a good grip on it but most importantly they are really sharp so they get the job done. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These look like your average cuticle nippers right out of the package. But everything ordinary ends there. These have a nice rubber grip wiich prevents slipping when cutting your cuticles. I believe the grip make these a big standout. I have owned many pairs of these over the years and I will no longer buy these without the grip handles. The tip is fine which is is easier to get in small areas.  This product was received by me for review.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. The clippers are&lt;br /&gt; incredibly dull which resulted in torn cuticles. Will never purchase again.</li>
    <li> The best pair I have ever own!</li>
    <li> its ok, not too great</li>
    <li> It has a very sharp point, so you can get a precise cut.  The tension that springs the handles back open after you squeeze them is nice and strong.  The one thing I would change would be the handle covers.  They are removeable so they twist a little.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife and she loves it very much! She said it&#x27;s very easy to use, not heavy and it doesn&#x27;t hurt her..very good quality and worth to buy! This nipper deserves a 5 stars! Thanks for the great product and quick shipping!</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as I was hoping for but they&#x27;re good and do they&#x27;re job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I didn&#x27;t invest in a cuticle nipper before now.  It makes clipping hangnails so much easier.  It&#x27;s also great for kids nails!  They&#x27;re easy to handle as well so you don&#x27;t have to worry that you&#x27;ll chop a finger off! :)</li>
    <li> Nipper size is perfect!  Unlike some others that seem too big.  I use this  nipper to trim my cuticles on my hands and toes. I also use it to trim dry skin on my feet. Work great and very easy to hold.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> received this for review.  Awesome nippers!</li>
    <li> Very nice nippers. They are comfortable to hold, lightweight and sharp. The blades are thin and can get into the corner to clean up cuticles vs the other pair I have that are a lot more difficult to work with. These will replace my current pair.</li>
    <li> This is perfect. The rubber handle kept my fingers from slipping and hurting. this one is easy to grip and VERY sharp.</li>
    <li> Well made, great non-slip and comfortable grip...and super sharp! Just threw my old ones away, as these are far superior.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for these from the reviews.  I have cut my kids&#x27; nails with cuticle scissors since they were babies and love the control.  So when I read &amp;#34;nail clipper&amp;#34; in the item description as well as the reviews, I thought they would be excellent.  They are surprisingly dull! I&#x27;ve never hurt my kids before and I have torn off a few nails and caused pain to them because these don&#x27;t cut their toddler nails all the way through.  Also, the rubber grip slides around with each squeeze and causes fatigue in my hand by the time I get to my 2nd child.</li>
    <li> Such a must have tool for anyone who takes care of their nails. These guys and big and sharp, comfortable to use and my nails look amazing now that all the overgrown cuticles are under control.</li>
    <li> Love love love these cuticle nippers! These are very sharp and cut on the first try. The handle is extremely comfortable and easy to grip. The handle is probably what made me love these cuticle nippers when I first saw them. Then once I used them and realized how sharp they were I really loved them. My last ones were starting to dull and just wouldn&#x27;t cut my cuticles or hang nails on the first try. These cut effortlessly and keep around my nails looking beautiful. While gripping they do not hurt my hand at all which is a huge plus. I definitely recommend these. I need to buy another pair to carry around in my purse and another pair for my husband because he has already tried stealing mine! *discount received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> Oh my!This is an amazing product.Compare to the nipper I&#x27;m buying in walmart and walgreens this is the best one.It&#x27;s so sharp and a high quality product.It really helps me to removed my dry skin in my cuticle and it&#x27;s super cute.I&#x27;m so thankful to the seller for giving me a discount in getting this product.This is really a high top quality cuticle remover!I will absolutely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> i love it. I bought at discounted price for review.</li>
    <li> this is a must have tools for those who loves to takes care of their nails.&lt;br /&gt;i love the handles and how sharp its blades. definitely recommend this one&lt;br /&gt;i love how it works on me.</li>
    <li> Great clipper, nice quality, love the grips on the handle.  Very happy with this purchase and would buy other tools from this company in the future!</li>
    <li> I am loving these cutical clippers. I own a few pairs but, these are my new favorite. They can reach what my other clippers cannot and they are sharp.</li>
    <li> what i like about this nipper is how comfy you can hold it on your hand. I guess the rubberized handle makes a big difference compared with an ordinary nipper. But sometimes the rubber gets twisted a little so i have to reposition it on my hands again. You just have to find put which position of your hand and fingers make you comfortably use this product. It is sharp as it it is new now but i am not sure how long it can stay that way or if i can have it sharpen or sinply just get a new one. For now, i will give it a 4 star since i still have to see how long i can use it but i am happy to be able to try this for a special price and i say it is a decent one to have.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for this item!the quality is great,i like how sharp it is and works really good..</li>
    <li> This product really let you get deep in the edges to get the dead cuticle I love this I have tried many different ones great grip on it</li>
    <li> There great for handing but there just not sharp enough. They snag instead of cut so a 1of 10 I give it a 4</li>
    <li> The box itself came a bit crumpled and the product was only in a clear thin plastic with no protector on the tip.  It actually fell off the box when I opened it and fell pointy tip first on my finger.  I thought it would cut me but my finger was okay which surprised me because it was supposed to be sharp.  So I tested it by cutting cuticles around my finger nails.  It&#x27;s not sharp as it should be.  I have to pull/tug on the cuticle which is a no no.  It is okay with cutting thicker skins around the nails but not good for cuticles.  The rubber grips are also not very secured.  It moves when you squeeze the nipper.  I&#x27;m disappointed because it looks like a nice product but failed on performance.  My cheap nipper from TJ Maxx that I paid $4.95 for is actually better in sharpness and comfort although not as pretty as this one.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed the box is a little bit crumpled,the nipper don&#x27;t have a tip protector and a rubber grip is not comfortable at all everytime i move the nipper the rubber will came off ,very dull, i receive this item in a very high discount in ecxhange on my honest opinon.</li>
    <li> My cuticles are always cracking open no matter what I do and these do a great job at cutting them because they are so sharp.</li>
    <li> This is a easy grip and sharp cuticle cutter. I like it used this and I loved the rubber on the handle makes it so safe to hold cause your hand won&#x27;t slipped. This is the result after look how cleaned the sides of my nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m prone to getting ingrown toe nails and have bought countless cuticle nipper and scissors but none have been as sharp and as easy to use as these are. The fit perfectly in my hard and are easy to use and handle. They are very sharp and cut with ease. The nippers are made of high quality materials.</li>
    <li> Big shock look at all these &amp;#34;discounted&amp;#34; reviews seems like every time I see high 5 star reviews this is the case it&#x27;s either &amp;#34;free or discounted.&amp;#34; If you want to keep getting &amp;#34;discounted or free&amp;#34; products would you write a negative view?</li>

    <li> It did not meet my expectations.  The grip comes off all the time and it doesn&#x27;t cut the tough nails.  I would send it back if I could.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement for an old cuticle nipper. I can&#x27;t stand having hangnails and this makes it a cinch to quickly clean my nails up. The blades are very sharp so one needs to be careful as to how much to nip, but the results are very neat cuticles. I have large hands and found that the grips helped considerably and made them very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and nail tech by trade. So, with part of my career I get a lot of interaction with tools for nails. The most important parts of a good cuticle nipper is the option to have a hinged handle, nice pointed sharp blades, a good sturdy construction, and lastly comfort handles. This protect has all the important things that I think a cuticle nipper should have. Very impressed!</li>
    <li> These are very sharp, which is exactly what I wanted. However, they fell off the counter and onto tile within the first 12 hours, denting the tip, and they can&#x27;t be restored to their original shape, so into the trash they go. The grip is really nice, so I&#x27;m sad about that. However, because they jumped up in price by $3 (25%) from my original purchase 2 weeks ago, I&#x27;m not going to be buying them again.</li>
    <li> biggest piece of junk u could ever imagine. Bought these for my girlfriend. The spring does not work and as u can see from the pic makes the device completely useless. I&#x27;m pretty handy and even I could not fix them for her to make them work. This item should be discontinued. SHAME ON U AMAZON</li>
    <li> Pretty disappointed.  This nipper isn&#x27;t cutting very well.  It pulls on the skin and takes a few tries of repositioning to make a cut.  Maybe mine is defective but it&#x27;s a lot of money to pay for something that works poorly.</li>
    <li> Crap.  I read a bunch of reviews but not good. They are not precise. Only bottom corner had a sharp edge. The rubber handles come off.  It&#x27;s just a cheap clipper with rubber handles added to it.</li>
    <li> Got it today I&#x27;m impressed sharp cutticle nipper I have I&#x27;m not good to use nipper but this is one good for me to practice I&#x27;m so happy have this use right clean my cutticle thanks a lot</li>
    <li> Good purchase! Its sharp and does its job! Very durable and soft on palm. It has rubbers on the grip so no more tired hands while cleaning nails. Good deal. Great purchase! Got this cheap in exchange of my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> These quality nail cuticle nippers are perfect for cutting and trimming cuticles and hangnails.  We purchased these clippers in a promotion for testing and review.  They are lightweight, durable and precise.  The stainless steel blade is very sharp, preventing tugging on sensitive cuticles.  The rubber handles are comfortable and make controlling the tool much easier.</li>
    <li> I was asked to review this product. I have terrible cuticles. I have to maintain my cuticles and nails weekly or I have horrible hang nails that will become very painful. The cuticle clippers that I have purchased in the stores are always dull. Let me tell you....if you have cuticle problems, these clippers are for you! Be careful, because they are sharp and you could do painful damage to your cuticles. I have been clipping my cuticles for so long I could perform this task with my eyes closed. I highly recommend these clippers. They worked very well! A+</li>
    <li> These are definitely salon quality. Super sharp, cuts through the most stubborn, thick skin. I love the extra protection of the grips on the handles. There&#x27;s no slipping or sliding when in use. They also come with a warranty, so you can send them to the company to be sharpened again and again. Highly recommend for cosmetology students, salon professionals, and nail techs.</li>
    <li> I dont go to salon to have manicure and pedicure cause I do it myself. I am so lucky I found this cuticle remover cause it it sharp, lightweight and durable. I can now remove my cuticle easily cause I love how the rubber comfort grip helps. I have tried some nippers without the comfort grip and they are hard to use and painful to the palms. The rubber really gives support making it easy and comfortable to use. Also, It is easy to clean or sterilize since it is rust resistant. Now my nails always look great!</li>
    <li> Love these.  Not hard to use, much better than the cheap cuticle rippers.</li>
