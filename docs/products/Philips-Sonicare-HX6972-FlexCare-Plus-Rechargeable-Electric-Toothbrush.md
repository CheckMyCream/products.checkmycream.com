<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If your budget is tight, just start with the sonic care brush. It really saves your teeth. I was going to have gum surgery but went full on with this brush and the dentist held off! You must use 2-3X/day and chg brush head every 3 mos. but the dental bills it saves are worth that. Truely!</li>
    <li> I bought this in February to replace our very first Sonicare toothbrush which was bought a long time ago.  That one lasted us over several years.  We just had to replace the brush heads periodically.  When the motor started to poop out, I figured I would simply replace with the new model and be just as satisfied.  I was wrong.  This one - the deluxe model with the UV sanitizer - has already started to lose power, and it isn&#x27;t even 4 months old.  I can only get a partial refund, since it&#x27;s been over a month, it seems, but I will definitely be returning it anyway.  I should have been warned when the unit I bought for my kids didn&#x27;t last much more than a year.  I expected better based on my original purchase of this product years ago.  I guess we&#x27;ll be switching to Braun or another brand, just not another Phillips brand.  Disappointed to say the least.</li>
    <li> For years, people have told me that having one of these would transform my life.  Sceptical? Yes.  But, after using the brush for six weeks, I cannot deny that it is transformative.  Life changing?  Too early to say, but definitely worth the not inconsiderable sum that I had to lay out to purchase this particular model.  There are multiple settings from sensitive to a quite-exhaustive gum care setting, and a UV light to at least make you feel like your toothbrush head is free of germs.  In short, I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone who can afford it.</li>
    <li> Seems to do a good job....at least my oral surgeon thinks so.  I like the timing device that lets me know I&#x27;ve brushed for 2 minutes.  So far, no glitches and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recomendation of my dentist, (previously I was using an Oral B). I have been getting small cavities and more sensitivities over the past 18 months, so he recomended switching a to Sonicare, as he said it was the best and only toothbrush he uses and recommends. I was skeptical of spending this much money on a toothbrush, but since I have started using this my sensitivites are less (not totally gone). My teeth also feel much cleaner than with my Oral-B Can&#x27;t wait until my next check up to see what the results are on the cavitiy front.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having trouble getting use to this, I tend to gag when using on back teeth so it&#x27;s a little difficult to use.</li>
    <li> If you want your teeth their absolute cleanest, healthiest, and brightest you have to get the Sonicare!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 of these models in the past and they both broke at exactly 30 months, 6 months after the warranty expired.  The first time with a faulty power, and this time with a faulty on switch.  Unreliable so expect to buy one every 2 - 3 years right after the warranty expires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it cannot be understated that this is very difficult to keep clean and free of mold.  The water seals around the head leak and water gets into a lot of crevices at the base of the charge which will keep growing mold, and is very difficult to clean and wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There just are too many crevices on the device where water will sit and stagnate.  It seems like it was not designed to be kept around water or kept wet.  Very unhygienic.</li>
    <li> The head keeps popping off no matter how hard I put it on the stem.  The last one I had never did that to me.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush while it lasts. I had mine for 3 years. It stopped working. My older model Sonicare lasted many years. I payed top price because this was the be model when I purchased. I will buy another Sonicare toothbrush because I swear by them. Hoping it lasts longer than 3 years for a $200 toothbrush!</li>
    <li> It cleans my teeth in an efficient way. When I used it for only one week, my teeth look more white. Comparing with the diamond one, this flex plus is not that expensive.</li>
    <li> Hubby complains about the clunking of brush on teeth!</li>
    <li> I thought my teeth were clean. I thought my teeth were white. Nope I was living a lie.  This product is amazing. The only problem is I can stop rubbing my tongue across my teeth. They feel so clean.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush and the sanitizer works great also.  Toothbrush is quiet and works very well.  I accidentally left mine in a hotel and ordered another one the second I got home.  I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush  - the heads seems a bit small but once you get use to it - it&#x27;s ok.  The only annoying thing is that when the system is on the charger it makes this high pitched humming sound!  Therefore, once it is charged I have to unplug it so the sound doesn&#x27;t annoy me......otherwise, great!</li>
    <li> My husband has been telling me for years that his Sonicare was superior to my Oral-B rotating brush.  When my Oral-B w as due for replacement, he assigned a brush head to me to try his for a few days.  I was sold within 3 days!  I tend to get coffee and tea stains on my front teeth that the dental assistant can get off, but I&#x27;ve never been able to keep them off until I tried his Sonicare.  I looked at many models at local stores, settled on this one &amp; bought it on Amazon as it was much better priced.  Loving the Sonicare and the built in sanitizer.  Even looks better on my bathroom counter than the old toothbrush.</li>
    <li> It works well, although I don&#x27;t think it can whiten your teeth (as some users claim). I used this product for about two month, so far I cannot say it whitened my teeth.    Problem of this product:  You cannot change the battery and the stuff would be a piece of garbage after 2 years&#x27; warranty offered by Philips (based on other reviews on Amazon, you know this product usually does not last longer than 2 years). Philips does this on purpose so you have to buy a new one after 2 years. Due to that, I have a very low respect for Philips. For other electrical appliance, I would avoid Philips if possible (ie. I chose Braun for my electric shaver).  Purely based on functionality, this product might beat its competitors, so I still bought this one this time (which I regretted!!! I would switch to Braun next time).    It is not a good deal to spend much money on a product that would die in 2 years.    PS. the customer service at Philips is the worst I have ever experienced in my whole life! I called them 4 times, asking them how to apply the $4 manufacturs coupon if I want to buy the brush head from amazon. None of the people had any idea... They all ended up saying one rebate form worth 4 dollars would be sent to my email but I have never received such email. It has been over 1 month and philips simply cannot help me use the 4 dollar coupon in an onlince purchase.  Shame on them!</li>
    <li> Grown son wanted for his birthday.  He has thoroughly enjoyed the quality.</li>
    <li> Broke way too soon. I&#x27;d never buy another Phillips mouth product.</li>
    <li> No more or less than advertised or as expected.  I need to replace the toothbrush heads on a regular basis.  Ergo, the order for new heads.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare!  What is there to say....it cleans your teeth like you have been to the dental hygienist!  Not only does it clean teeth beautifully it stimulates the gums and times the entire experience!  Philips stands by their products!  I am on my second Sonicare and I have purchased a Sonicare for my husband, my two sons and my daughter-in-law!</li>
    <li> Great set.  I use this with Diamond head brushes.  The illumination indicators was very impressive looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare should keep making more of these.</li>
    <li> Great product. 2 year warranty. Unfortunately it stopped working right at three years. Pricey but did a great job.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since 2010, and my teeth have never been whiter. The original UV light/recharge piece still work perfectly 5 years later as well. I have had issues with the toothbrush however, but customer service recognizes and fulfills the warranty of this product and sent me a replacement. Overall, this purchase, while expensive, is a great investment towards your appearance and oral health. Sonicare is a brand I can trust and I will be a lifelong customer.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best toothbrush I have ever purchased or owned. You would not be disappointed. The 2nd charger and carrying case adds convenience. .... I wrote this review after initially using the unit and I loved it .... However I bought it in June and it is now September and the unit completely failed. Now it is an utter disappointment and it has exceeded the time allotted for me to be able to return it. What a disappointment!!!</li>
    <li> I am a dental hygienist and I must say, this is BY FAR the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used personally, and I have seen awesome results with my patients who have them as well. I&#x27;ve seen big improvements in tissue tone and color, as well as less plaque, calculus, and stain buildup. However, my toothbrush stopped working literally 6 weeks outside of the 2-year warranty, and at first, Phillips would not do anything to help. I then contacted our office Sonicare rep, and (because of the issues with my brush)he sent me a new, BETTER model, free-of-charge! . I hope this review helps some of you trying to make the right decision!</li>
    <li> Great product cleans like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried. Leaves your mouth and your teeth as clean as a visit to the dentist.</li>
    <li> Cannot say enough about this toothbrush. At first i had a difficult time getting used to the style of brushing. Once this was overcome, I have learned to just love it. I had a small piece of skin that i scratched up somehow on my gumline that finally healed up after using this toothbrush over the 1st month and a half. I was told my old brush which turned in circles to brush was just messing it up more each time, this from my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging time is very impressive. Brush at night and the morning, i am getting about 3 weeks before I even put it back on the charger as it shows 1 light on the bard of 3 left. The UV cleaner; I use it once every couple weeks to give a good sanitary cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good piece of hardware, quality build.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for husband and he enjoys using.  I believe it helps massage his gums as well as cleaning his teeth.  Having trouble recently holding a charge.</li>
    <li> This product is a lemon, stay FAR AWAY !.  The toothbrush design is great except its prone to defects.  I love that it stays clean and doesn&#x27;t build up gunk (unlike the essence model I had for 8 years)  I replace it with the Flexcare Plus.  However,  my first unit within one year broke, when I went to pull off the brush head to replace it, the inside metal piece that holds the brush head came out of the socket.  It was replaced under warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 2nd unit less than one year broke.  There was water build up where the charging indicators lights are, it was replace again even though it was out of warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 3rd unit has the same problem within one year of use.  The water build up where the indicator lights are causes the unit to turn on and off intermittently.  It buzzes when charging on the cradle.  It keeps turning on/off by itself until its out of battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reached out to Sonicare with the problem.  They&#x27;ve escalated my problem.  Someone is suppose to call my back within 72 hours.  So far no call.  If I do have to buy another electric toothbrush it will not be a Sonicare.  This unit is defective and they don&#x27;t stand behind their product.  Its would crazy to replace $150 toothbrush every 2 years.  I have a bunch of replacement heads unfortunately if I switch to a different brand.</li>
    <li> Great device. Perfect cleaning, ergonomic and smart.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST toothbrush ever!  I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years, and always thought they were a terrific product, but this is the star of the line.  It is so thorough, has 5 settings to vary the intensity and length of cleaning, and it stays neat and clean in the holder.  I like that I can disinfect the brushes so easily (I used to soak them in mouthwash, which tended to wear them down too  quickly).  The brushes are compact, so they get into every nook, even the tight little spaces that shred dental floss.  The handle is slender, so it feels comfortable to hold.  I used to have trouble brushing my tongue, because it tickled too much, but with this system, I set it to massage and it feels heavenly.  I could not be more impressed!</li>
    <li> I used an Oral B electric toothbrush for 10 years and it served me well.  Eventually it began to give out and at that time, about 6 months ago, I decided to try Philips Sonicare as my dentist had been recommending it to me at every visit.  I was a little wary because it was more expensive in general, including the price of replacement brush heads compared with Oral B.  But I did some research and decided to purchase the Sonicare brush.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months and am now purchasing a new Oral B electric toothbrush.  The main thing is that I feel like it just isn&#x27;t cleaning my teeth as well.  I could easily reach the backside of my teeth with Oral B and I&#x27;m not able to do so as well with the Philips Sonicare. And now I can feel buildup on my teeth in between dental cleanings, whereas I usually had none or very little with Oral B.  In my opinion, I should have stuck with what I knew was a good product from the beginning which was the Oral B.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare Flexcare+ for the last 4 years, and the Elite for many years before that.  I just switched to the HealthWhite because the Flexcare broke--yet again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first Flexcare+ died about a month before my warranty expired.  Philips is good about warranty replacement, and I got another.  Almost eactly 2 years later, my replacement unit died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also somewhere along the way, the UV lamp went out in the sanitizer unit. The bulbs are not cheap, so I went without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my Flexcare broke, it left me with five of the Diamond Clean heads, about $50 worth of brush heads.  So, I got the HealthWhite, which is compatible with the same brush heads as the Flexcare, at a substantially lower price.  I wasn&#x27;t about to waste those brush heads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So consider your ROI: assume that in about 2 years, the unit will die and UV lamp will go out, and brush heads cost $7-9 each, to be replaced every 3 months, according to their recommended schedule.  Sonicare brushes will clean FAR better than Oral B&#x27;s.  Is your dental care worth spending roughly $120/year on average on a toothbrush?  Or, consider the alternative: brush with a manual brush ($3/brush every 3-6 months) and floss regularly, and see your dentist every 6 months?  You should floss and see your dentist, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HealthWhite is an excellent alternative.  What drives up the cost of the Flexcare is all that fancy cleaning modes.  In all those years I used a Flexcare+, I used 2 modes: Sensitive and Clean.  Never bothered with the others.  I don&#x27;t obsess about my teeth--I don&#x27;t have a cleaning schedule all laid out as to when I will go through all those modes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sanitize my brush head?  The brush was in my mouth and cleans only my teeth--there&#x27;s nothing on it that didn&#x27;t come out of my mouth or from something I put in it.  How did we ever live without sterilizing our toothbrushes???  Give me a break.  You only need this if you&#x27;re planning on using your Sonicare to clean your toilet or get the mildew out of your shower tile grout, and then want to put it back in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re like me, HealthyWhite is what you&#x27;ll end up with.  It&#x27;s half the cost, same great brush heads, same handle, motor and batteries, no UV sanitizer.  Even if it breaks every 2 years, your cost is about $60/year with brush heads.  Much better ROI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flexcare may fit the bill for some folks who need their gums massaged, but I&#x27;d rather save the money and get the rest of my body massaged.care to clean your toilet or get the mildew out of your shower tile grout, and then want to put it back in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re like me, HealthyWhite is what you&#x27;ll end up with.

    <li> This was purchased as a replacement unit. Our original unit went bad after about three years, and wife had to use conventional brush  until the new one came.  Every mornng and night she would comment on how she missed her Sonicare.  We see now why it was highly recommended by our family dentist.  The charging stand makes a perfect place to store it when not in use. The built in timer assures an adequate brush time is completed, and the brush design makes it easy to get to all those hard-to-reach areas with little effort.</li>
    <li> This is the product specifically recommended by my dentist. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. The service getting it to me wasn&#x27;t the best, a pain even. But I like the product.</li>
    <li> This thooth brush works even better then the other brush.</li>
    <li> The Phillips Sonicare was recommended to us by our dental Hygienist.  She assured us that it would do a better job of preventing plaque buildup than the vibrating toothbrush we were then using.  After two months with this product, it is readily apparent that she is absolutely right!</li>
    <li> Finally broke down and followed my dentist&#x27;s recommendation to get one of these. Takes a bit of getting used to the vibration in your head, and slowing down to let the brush do its work, but I will say it&#x27;s nice to wake up in the morning with teeth that still feel clean and fresh. :) The 30-second timer function really helps you pace yourself, and the multiple settings are nice, though I pretty much stick to the &#x27;clean&#x27; cycle. I&#x27;ve been using Diamondclean heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor design quibble I have with this is that it would be nice if Phillips would move the on/off button to the left side instead of the front; that way I could operate it with my forefinger rather than accidentally bumping it with my thumb at times.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with this product!!  It has some nice options to help you get accustomed to the product (slowly ramps up the speed etc).  The UV sanitizer is great, like a new brush head after every cleaning.  Really nice if you have used it through a cold \ sniffles since you can clean the brush heads.  The travel case is cool but there is no room for the charger (the travel charger), but its not a big deal because a single charge lasts a LONG time something like 3 weeks.  it is a good little system, doesn&#x27;t take up much room and makes your teeth and gums feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Does what it says&lt;br /&gt;easy to use&lt;br /&gt;cleans great&lt;br /&gt;UV sanitizer works quickly and easily&lt;br /&gt;Pauses for a 1\2 second to let you know when to change zones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Travel charger doesn&#x27;t fit in travel case</li>
    <li> I purchased this for myself.  My teeth feel cleaner than they ever have, and I&#x27;ve used electric toothbrushes before.  I had to purchase one for my mother and father, too.  Love this product!!!!  Anything I purchase from Amazon ships quickly!</li>
    <li> It feels so good only after one use, my only complaint is that the sanitizer is not working, making me not satisfied</li>
    <li> Gives a new meaning to a fresh feeling mouth. Works great and the timer really helps. The different settings and levels make it easy to brush</li>
    <li> Very thorough cleaning. I like this better than my previous lower level sonicare (more modes, cleaner design, and easier to clean).</li>
    <li> This stuff is very good. I&#x27;m thinking to order one more of this as my wife uses it with pleasure and I want one more for myself.&lt;br /&gt;And travel case and charger will fit me as well as I travel much.&lt;br /&gt;Try and you never forget how it works:)</li>
    <li> My previous electric toothbrush died. I replaced it with the Sonicare. My teeth and gums are much cleaner with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed at the length of the charge on the battery.  I also purchased the travel kit. The hard case in really nice. Jus t a great product overall.</li>
    <li> 1st sonicare lasted more than 10 years now I&#x27;m treated to a new design with&lt;br /&gt;great features and flawless performance.</li>
    <li> Our teeth have never felt better.  The device took a short while to get used to, due to the vibration.  But our teeth and gums feel great.</li>
    <li> mouth feels great after brushing but have a problem with the brush head coming off when in use after a few weeks , had to put brush head backwards to keep it locked in place, Think with the price of replacement heads it would be a better design</li>
    <li> I purchased this Philip&#x27;s Sonicare Electric Toothbrush to replace the one I had had for several years.  What a difference!  My oral health has greatly improved.  Even my dentist was impressed.  Well worth buying.</li>
    <li> Arrived right on time and met all my expectations.  Easy to use and even after 2 weeks of daily use, I can tell a difference in the condition of my gums.  Great investment if you want to grow old with your original teeth!  This brand was recommended by my dentist.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase. I recommend this brush to all my friends and family. Battery life is good so far as I can tell</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush two years ago.  A few weeks ago it started turning on by itself and finally stropped working altogether.  The toothbrush worked great when it worked, I definitely saw a difference going from a manual toothbrush to this one.  However, I thought it would last longer than two years.  I&#x27;m looking to buy a new electric toothbrush now but probably not a Philips brand.</li>
    <li> I do feel my teeth are cleaner. In 18 months, I have replaced two heads because it was making funny noises when placed on the charger similar to other comments listed. They were under the warranty. The Phillips rep told me that the seal on the handle may be broken and water seeps inside. I may be putting too much pressure on the head while brushing and this is causing the seal breakage. I noticed that the brush is tilted at an angle when placed on the head. This was not the case when the handle was new. I have to remember to let the sonicare do the work, not me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless the brush is in your mouth, there is a tendency for the toothpaste to splatter all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste buildup does appear between the brush and handle but I do not clean it frequently. However, I always rinse the brush and handle with water each time. Also yellowish buildup appears around the door of the cleaning apparatus and inside. I have to use my manual toothbrush or a qtip to clean it occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you rinse your toothbrush after each cleaning, when you place it on the charging base, water drips down and collects on the base. You can either leave it there or get a sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the Ultraviolet  light cleaning the bacteria, I do it once a week. How did we clean the bacteria off our manual toothbrush?</li>
    <li> Had this thing for less then 2 years and it already stopped working !!! For the price I paid it  should have lasted longer then this</li>
    <li> Works great.  Charge lasts a very long time.  My teeth feel very clean when I&#x27;m done and I got a good check up at the dentist!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moB3K27PRG9XTP]]Four months ago I would have given this brush 4 stars: buttons a little finicky and expensive but really cleaned well after 2 years and 2 months of service. Then the head started to get floppy and since I&#x27;d *just* missed the 2yr warranty window and there were no user-repairable parts in it I figured I&#x27;d use it until it broke and decide what to do then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that day arrived last week (2.5 years of use) so I opened it up--use a huge screwdriver and turn the base *clockwise* (opposite of what you&#x27;d think)--hoping I could tighten a screw or something. No tightening is going to fix this baby and if you look at the video I uploaded you&#x27;ll see that the chunk of metal that connects the shaft to the actuator is basically pot metal--not stainless steel as I had assumed. If you lookup \\&quot;flexcare shaft broke\\&quot; you&#x27;ll see I&#x27;m not the only one. You&#x27;ll also see that the attachment screw is rusted which defies explanation since that part of the toothbrush body is supposed to be sealed given that the electronics are just another inch further down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, buyer beware. I bought some JB Weld epoxy and I&#x27;m going to try to glue it together--what do I have to lose?</li>
    <li> have gone through a number of competitors&#x27; products - they seem OK, but don&#x27;t last particularly long. This one, I hope, will last, because the cleaning it accomplishes is almost like going to the hygienist. Almost. Funny, tickling feeling on the gums, at first, but they respond very quickly, indicating they likey.</li>
    <li> I am using this for some time now and I have to say the quality and the design are great. My teeth feel much cleaner. No more manual toothbrush</li>
    <li> My old Sonicare was damaged when I moved.  I did without it for quite some time, but in going to the dentist recently I realized that I needed to reinvest in a new one.  It makes a world of difference in how a person&#x27;s teeth get cleaned.  I&#x27;m happy to have Sonicare back in my morning regimen.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush.  I had the very very old one and this is so much better.  I can highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Cleaning teeth is easier and faster. Need to change brush heads about every 3 to 5 months. One of the best purchases I have made. I have not had a cavity since using it for about 2 years.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had several Soniccare products and this is the only one i can say actually seems like it&#x27;s more powerful and doing a better job. Cleaning and upkeep is easier too</li>
    <li> Engineers look at functionality in a simplistic mechanical way.&lt;br /&gt;Designers look for artful symmetry in design.&lt;br /&gt;Both failed to collaborate to design a functional piece that takes into account human anatomy as well as basic physics. To place on/off/change buttons at the singular location, the fulcrum of our toothbrush lever, which is where the human hand needs to balance the forces of pushing against the teeth while still holding, shows a lack of creative collaborative thought.&lt;br /&gt;Offsetting them slightly to either side would solve the problem of accidentally hitting those buttons. Having a programmable disable feature once brushing begins is another solution. Having buttons slightly recessed with a thin slide to cover is another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting that manufacturer testing &amp; research of how quickly the non-replaceable enamel is worn down by our now more abrasive head speeds that information is not being shared and makes me wonder what teeth will look like after years of use. Especially when combined with the more abrasive \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; toothpastes that have been out these past few years.</li>
    <li> It takes a while to get used to letting it do all the work but it does remove more plaque and improve the health of your gums.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on the recommendation of my dentist due to receeding gums.  OMG.  I wish I would have purchased it ages ago!  Since using it my sensitivity has decreased significantly.  Also, my teeth feel VERY clean after brushing - not like with a regular toothbrush.  This is one purchase that&#x27;s actually seriously changed my life!  The only negative (and it&#x27;s not really that negative) is that I don&#x27;t think the UV light cleaner is necessary or really all that useful.</li>
    <li> I have had problems with bleeding when brushing and gum sensitivity. This toothbrush using the sensitive setting has made a major difference. I am thoroughly pleased.</li>
    <li> I received one regular brush and one compact brush.  It turns out I love the compact brush because it fits nicely behind my molars without force.  My teeth feel really clean and I love the many settings.</li>
    <li> Pros: One of the best electric toothbrushes, cleans well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Pricey, brush heads don&#x27;t seem to last long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second Sonicare toothbrush, and the only reason I bought this one was because I gave my first one away. I like Sonicare toothbrushes in general and it does a great job cleaning. There&#x27;s a recommended method of brushing: 2 minutes total, 30 seconds on each side and the toothbrush pauses for a brief moment to indicate when 30 seconds are up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older model I had uses a nickel hydride battery, while this one uses a lithium ion, which in my book is a win. If you don&#x27;t know, nickel hydride batteries can suffer from the &amp;#34;memory effect&amp;#34;, which causes the battery to hold less charge overtime if charged when it isn&#x27;t completely drained. Lithium ion batteries are generally lighter, but the weight difference is negligible in a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t keep the toothbrush charged when I&#x27;m not using it; I only charge it when it gets low. From what I noticed, the toothbrush can fully charge overnight, so I&#x27;ve never had a problem of not being able to use it when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included UV cleaner is nice, but I&#x27;m not sure if it does anything. I&#x27;ve researched if using UV to clean toothbrushes does anything, and it seems like there are mixed reactions. I guess my take on it is it wouldn&#x27;t hurt so I just use it every other night. I&#x27;ve also heard that soaking the brush head in mouthwash (like Listerine) works as well, so if you opt to go with the model that doesn&#x27;t include the UV cleaner, it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for my first Sonicare Toothbrush.  It is a great product and suits my needs very well.</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare does exactly as advertised. Love the 30 second timer feature. My teeth feel like I have just visited the dentist.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush 3 years ago today.  It has worked great for me (until now) and I have been very happy with it.  About 1 year ago the charger bulb broke/wore out, and I was delighted that customer service mailed me the free replacement right away.  Now for the bad news....I recently called Philips customer service because my brush handle has become louder and the black rubber seal on-top of the handle has been deteriorating greatly.  Because I&#x27;m out of the 2 year warranty period, they could only offered me a 15% off code good for their website : /  This is a great brush, but very expensive!  EXPECT THAT IT WILL LAST ONLY 2 YEARS BECAUSE AFTER THAT IT WILL PROBABLY BREAK AND NOT BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY!!!</li>
    <li> Love it wish I had gotten it sooner.</li>
    <li> The best brush I have ever owned until it went crazy. My husband and  i woke up in the middle of the night because of loud vibration noise for a few days on and off and then behave ok for a few days... now it doesn&#x27;t work at all. It worked only for two years.... for the price, I expected more years of usage... a big disappoinment. Now I am hesitant to purchase one. Warranty was for two years and it happened right after that period.</li>
    <li> What a difference between this an my old Crest spinbrush!!! My teeth feel so clean and a recent dental visit proved that they were!!!&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is worth every penny!! I&#x27;ve now had it long enough to change the brush and so far it works well. It holds the charge for at least three weeks and when it begins to slow, I charge it.  I use the ultraviolet cleaner weekly and have not had any problems!! If I have any regrets at all, it&#x27;s that I didn&#x27;t purchase one of these sooner!!</li>
    <li> This thing is great and works really well.  My only complaint is how expensive replacement brush heads are; it seems like they are gouging on the price of those.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll love it.  i like it a lot feels like to just got out from the dentist with the uv light that&#x27;s even better.</li>
    <li> I have two brushes now, one for me and my little boy. He is more motivated to brush with the different settings and &amp;#34;best toothbrush&amp;#34;. It really does feel like you just left the dentist.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has a lot of bells &amp; whistles, but itsn&#x27;t worth sh*t. But I do like the UV sanitizer stand it comes with to sanitize the brush heads, which explains the 2 stars. The electric brush has a lot of fancy settings, which I never use. The 30 second timer (tells you to move to a different section of your mouth) and the small ergonomic design are awesome.    The electric toothbrush lasted 8 months and started to turn itself on automatically after leaving it on the shelf next to the charger stand. I thought that maybe it was another fancy feature to tell me that it needs re-charging, but after placing it on the charger the lights show that the battery is on max charge already.    I don&#x27;t dunk this thing in water and just rinse off the toothbrush head when I&#x27;m done brushing. I also do a wipe down of the toothbrush with sanitizing wipes on occasion. After 8 months, I noticed the rubber seal around the metal shaft on top has degraded and some type of white/black moldy substance has grown around there.    In conclusion, I didn&#x27;t bother to ask customer service for a return because they will just send me the same crappy replacement model. I also, don&#x27;t want to buy the competing Braun brand, because their toothbrushes are loud and make me feel like I have a jack hammer on my teeth as opposed to actually brushing them. Therefore, I ordered the Sonicare HX6511/50 with no fancy bells and whistles. There&#x27;s just one setting to brush your teeth with the 30 second timer and I can still use the sanitizer stand/charger and brushes that came with the other Sonicare HX6972/30 toothbrush, which I threw in the trash by the way.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush you&#x27;ll ever own.  If you have gum problems...it&#x27;s the one you want.</li>
    <li> it really helps cleaning and gums</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush in March, for a few months it worked fine. The only complaint i had was the button for changing the program (You hit it by accident all the time)  However starting a month ago (5 months after purchase) the brush started stopping and starting intermittedly. I&#x27;d like to replace it, but found only 30days for the return.&lt;br /&gt;There must be a better brush with a better warranty out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- One year later it is total dead. Philips should be embarrassed for its lack of quality. Less than 1 year after purchase $150 down the drain. Never a Philips again.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned. Works great and feels nice on your teeth and gums. Kinda promotes the want to brush often. Very easy to use and recharges fast.</li>
    <li> In August 2006, I bought a Sonicare Elite toothbrush and it changed my way of tooth care!  My dentist had recommended it, and he was right - it cleans like no regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was only one downside &#x3D; It was difficult to keep the two connecting parts clean.  Then, a few weeks ago, the waterproof membrane covering the start-stop switch gave up, began sticking and was no longer waterproof, so I bit the bullet, ordered this fancy new Flexcare Plus set. It is great!  Has more life in it than my old Sonicare.  It is lighter, so I have had to adjust to that, but it is a fine cleaning machine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And. Sonicare has redesigned the head with the Flexcare Plus, eliminating the old problem I had with my original Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIY&#x27;s TIP &#x3D; I trimmed that membrane on my old Sonicare so it will cut on-off, delegated this brush to my workshop for &#x27;sonic&#x27; cleaning parts in the hobby shop :)</li>
    <li> It is interesting that I should get this email today after coming from the dentist!  I REALLY enjoy this device, and the dentist and the technician can tell a difference in my teeth and gums since I&#x27;ve purchased and startied to use it!</li>
    <li> For years, my husband and I used the Sonicare \\&quot;Essence\\&quot; toothbrush.  It was great - and, so durable.  It never gave us any problems.  But, we decided to upgrade to this toothbrush.  The only reason why was because the \\&quot;heads\\&quot; of the toothbrushes were disgusting. They were impossible to keep clean.  I would actually remove the round part, dry it thoroughly with a towel, and beat the brush part on towel to remove water from the hollow \\&quot;cavity\\&quot;.  Also, neither of us ever left the heads on the base of the brush.  That all helped, but mildew and grime still built up.  It was so gross!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we went with this brush because the heads don&#x27;t have that round part, nor is the hollow \\&quot;cavity\\&quot; part as deep.  These are soooooo much more sanitary.  There is no build-up of mildew or grime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things to note that I wound up liking about this brush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The different brushing features are pretty nice; although, the only one aside from \\&quot;clean\\&quot; that I ever really use is \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot;.  I have sensitive teeth.  The \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feature is usually gentle enough.  But, sometimes, my teeth are more sensitive than usual and that feature on this brush is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  I really like the UV sanitizer.  So, here&#x27;s the thing, I have no idea if it really works.  I am happy to be blissfully ignorant of it so that I can pretend that it does :-)  Lacking any real evidence, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this brush for the UV sanitizer - but, it is a nice bonus considering it was about the same price as the brush without the sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The carrying case is much better than the \\&quot;Essence\\&quot; one.  It is more compact and allows for you to store 2 brush heads, which I love for when my husband and I travel together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered though, the fact that it is a Sonicare and that this model is much easier to keep clean than the \\&quot;Essence\\&quot; were worth the purchase for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for Sonicare, in general, they really are wonderful.  A few years ago I had my wisdom teeth pulled and had a bad reaction to the anesthesia.  The dentist took me off of all antibiotics fearing any additional reactions.  But, he told me that I need to be really careful with my oral hygiene to prevent any infections.  The problem was that I couldn&#x27;t use mouthwashes because he also took me off the pain meds and mouthwashes hurt too much.  So, I relied solely on the Sonicare.  When I went to my follow-up with him, the dentist actually said that I had the \\&quot;cleanest\\&quot; mouth of anyone else he has ever seen that just had their wisdom teeth pulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes (this model and the previous one I used) make your teeth and mouth feel so much cleaner.  Whenever I have to use a manual toothbrush, my teeth never feel clean enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: When I received my brush, the charging base made a constant high-pitched buzzing sound.  I contacted the company through the \\&quot;chat\\&quot; feature of their website and they sent a new one out within a couple weeks.  If yours does the same, don&#x27;t hesitate to let them know for a new one - just make it clear that it is the charging base.  The guy I was chatting with kept saying it was the base of the brush itself, which made no sense because when I unplugged the charging base the buzzing stopped.  It took a while for me to make him finally realize it was the charging base.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I ever owned. It was recommended by my dentist. I love that the storage box disinfects my toothbrush head each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, once you buy this... you will be spoiled and will never want to use regular toothbrushes ever again.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush. Love the fact that it can be disinfected after each use.</li>
    <li> Stopped working just beyond the warranty period.  I registered the product online so I got a 2.5 year warranty period. After 2.6 years the product stopped working. I don&#x27;t know if its only because the battery is dead or if its something else. I have ordered and new battery and will replace it when I receive it. The battery is not designed for replacement. I must manually De-solder the old battery and re-solder the in the replacement battery. I&#x27;ll let u know if the battery replacement solves the problem. This product should be designed for the battery to replaced. I will NOT buy electric toothbrushes in which the battery cannot be conveniently replaced. It insults my intelligence.</li>
    <li> This was my first adventure into electronic toothbrushes.  It was not for me.  However, I am sure it is a perfectly good product.</li>
    <li> Terrific dental care; easy to clean and to use.</li>
    <li> I had an Oral-B before this and loved it but it was getting old. I shopped around for months before deciding on this one but was reluctant to change, so it took another 3 or 4 months before I actually made the purchase. I was so glad I took a chance and made the switch - this one is ten times better. I wish I would have done it a year ago.</li>
    <li> Battery died after 16 months of use. Good electric toothbrush while it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed that the toothbrush only lasted me 16 months given I spent over $150 on it.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. So many settings! The Gum Care one is the one I like as it does job on the gums (which is important to prevent gum disease). Recharge life has been improved versus earlier models. Includes UV cleaner to help disinfect brush heads. My dentist noticed the difference during my last few visits! And it helps whiten better than any toothbrush I know, subject to the toothpaste you use.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner and my gums feel wonderful too. Just like I walked out of the dentists office everyday!</li>
    <li> This model is the current one of our old Flexcare model which worked for six or seven years, I think.  Very happy with it.  Like the new light window and lit handle.  Can see it better.  Had to go back to standard toothbrush while waiting for it and could really tell the difference.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I switch to an electric toothbrush for my gums.  This model was recommended by a friend who has used for several years.  Not only have gums improved, plaque is reduced and less staining.</li>
    <li> This item gets one star subtracted for defective parts and two stars subtracted for super crappy customer service.&lt;br /&gt;After about a dozen uses I removed the brush head and it came apart.  The end that attaches to the handle remained on the metal drive part.  It&#x27;s a little dome shaped piece that came off the brush shaft.&lt;br /&gt;So, I get into an exchange with Philips online chat:&lt;br /&gt;Me:  The book says to have a gap between the handle and the brush.  Maybe I put it on too far.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;James&amp;#34;:  It goes on tight to the handle.&lt;br /&gt;Me:  OK, you&#x27;re saying the instruction manual is wrong and the problem in not that I pushed the brush on too far.  So, how do I prevent this from happening again?  Why did it break?&lt;br /&gt;James:  I&#x27;ll send a new brush to you.&lt;br /&gt;Me:  I&#x27;d rather have a solution as all the brushes in the world won&#x27;t tell me how to avoid this in the future.&lt;br /&gt;James:  What&#x27;s your address?&lt;br /&gt;Me:  (I type address and say)  What caused the problem?&lt;br /&gt;James:  What&#x27;s your phone number?&lt;br /&gt;Me:  (I type my phone number and repeat)  What happened to the brush?  How can I avoid this in the future?  Just keep on replacing broken brushes?&lt;br /&gt;James:  You should have your new brush within two weeks.  Anything else I can help you with?&lt;br /&gt;Me:  You haven&#x27;t helped me yet.  Goodbye.&lt;br /&gt;  Anyway, you get the idea.  I swore off Philips products years ago, with good reason, and don&#x27;t want to get into it here but my advice is:  Steer clear of Philips and everything they sell.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush in 2009 for $150. 2 years later it quit working so I contacted phillips and they promptly sent me a new one. Now, 2 years later the replacement has also malfunctioned. When I complained to the customer support lady she told me &amp;#34;well, it is an electrical device&amp;#34;. When I asked her if she thought two years was an appropriate lifespan for a $150 toothbrush, she said &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34;. All I can say is that If I had been told the lifespan of the phillips sonicare toothbrush that costs $150 was 2 years, I would never have purchased it. Time to try Oral-B....</li>
    <li> Purchased for son, and he enjoys.</li>
    <li> The sanitizer doesn&#x27;t work, never has.  I decided I didn&#x27;t need it, so have passed on returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power button is in an awkward spot for me, at least.  During brushing, I find that a slight pressure unpowers it and I need to restart.  If you are using the timer (which is not a beep, rather a pause), this will foul you up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waiting for a few years to determine if it meets my life expectation.</li>
    <li> We replaced an Oral B that we owned for several years. I liked the reviews and yes, it is expensive. But, the first time i used it, it was like I had just left the dentist. It is that good. The UV sanitizer is a great addition. It is well worth the additional cost.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, vey nice machine.</li>
    <li> The best way to brush your teeth!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have one and purchased this one as a gift. The recipient is crazy about it!</li>
    <li> Wow…this was really expensive.  I previously used the Waterpik sonic brush.  I loved it; however, the brush head became lodged on the handle.  I couldn&#x27;t change them and needed a new one.  Also, my dental hygienist remarked that I needed a softer toothbrush and needed to focus more brushing time on the tongue side of my teeth.  Given that I was using the Waterpik twice a day for 2 minutes or more, I opted to buy one of the toothbrushes displayed in the dental office.  That was the Sonicare Flexcare Plus.  I like the built in sanitizer.  I purchased the Ultra Soft Brush Heads as a side order and really like them.  We will have to wait and see (next anointment 6 months) if my teeth improve.  By the way, I also purchased the Sonicare Flosser.  That was probably a waste of money but I&#x27;ll continue to use it because they hygienist recommended it.</li>
    <li> Based on other reviewers&#x27; suggestions, I purchased this brush rather than the DiamondClean brush, but I&#x27;m using the DiamondClean heads (based not only on ratings, but my Dentist&#x27;s recommendation that the DiamonClean heads perform better than the ProResults heads). I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this combination. The brush works great, and I like the added UV sanitizer in this package. I also like the controls on this brush and the compact storage method. The diamondclean seemed a step backward with the reduced buttons and therefore functionality/operability, and the tumbler storage vessel was just overly large. This brush&#x27;s storage unit may not be as modern, but it is more compact, and in my small bathroom, that makes it a winner. The inductive charging is pretty cool (yes, this is my first electric toothbrush, so I&#x27;m sure the fully sealed inductive charging is not new to most, but I thought it was pretty impressive regardless!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend. And if you are on the fence of which to buy, I highly recommend getting this brush to use with the DiamondClean heads.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had an electric toothbrush, so I was hesitant. This far exceeded my expectations! Great product! Feels like a dentist clean. :) I will definitely recommend. Only downfall is the cord is short.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush!!!! i have only used a manual brush before i got the sonicare+, and after the first use i could feel how clean my mouth was.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto. La batería le dura mucho tiempo es muy fácil de desarmar y sobre todo limpia tus dientes muy bien.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this!!</li>
    <li> I have never had a toothbrush this nice, and I actually love it.  Recommended by my dentist, I find it is so pleasant to use, that brushing teeth is not a chore.  Seriously!  I do replace the brush heads more frequently that &amp;#34;recommended&amp;#34;, but that is fine.  It&#x27;s totally worth it because gum and teeth health is very important, and this is a small investment to make towards that effort.  Great quality, and very nice presentation.  I was going to get the diamond version, and if stylish counts, then diamond is the right one in that category.  Otherwise, you cannot go wrong with Sonicare - fantastic quality and excellent results.</li>
    <li> I chose the Philips Sonicare because it was recommended by my dental hygienist. I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks and I can see a difference already. Also, it is so easy to use. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My teeth build tarter faster than Trump builds office buildings. After my last cleaning, I purchased one of these. Each night and morning my teeth feel cleaner than they ever have with the OralB I used to use. However, they still build tarter between then - but much more slowly. Now, time for a Water Pik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews talked about reliability of the handle - I&#x27;ve used this for a month (as has my wife), and it just keeps on working really well. So far, no issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s actually fun to watch the little blue light come on to clean our brush heads ....</li>
    <li> Does everything as advertised. Makes your teeth feel like you just left the dentist. It has a nice travel case.which I am using now.</li>
    <li> GREAT !!! Enjoy this marvelous piece of toothbrushing technology!IT works a a a a a a a a a a a</li>
    <li> Can I just say that I feel like I brushed my teeth 5 times vs using a regular toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so let me first start off to say that I used to use a cheap $20 Oral B toothbrush.  This Sonicare Toothbrush blows that Oral B Brush out of the water.  The pulsation of the brush is amazing and you will never go back to a regular one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really use the Ultraviolet Cleaning Device (?) but if you like it, then sure.  I don&#x27;t think there are any alternatives if you want this specific brush.</li>
    <li> Mine broke within a year.  Started turning on in the middle of the night by itself, couldn&#x27;t find any way to fix it.  I contacted customer care (one week before the warranty expired), and it&#x27;s been almost a month now and the replacement part is still on back order.  After spending more than I ever thought I would on a toothbrush, &#x27;dI expect it to work properly and to be replaced quickly if it doesn&#x27;t.  Waste of money--go with a different brand.</li>
    <li> When I recieved this toothbrush I charged it the night before and began use in the morning.  The first time you use the brush, it takes some getting used to, especially if you are a bit ticklish, but after that your mouth seems to adapt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-My mouth feels cleaner, much more so than with other electric brushes (oral B)&lt;br /&gt;-The travel case and extended charge make this perfect for time on the road (I am a traveling salesman)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-I can&#x27;t really figure out the different modes, I don&#x27;t think they make too much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;-The toothbrush heads wear out relatively quickly</li>
    <li> I have not been a big fan or electric tootbrushes, and although my wife has used one, I have rarely participated.  Until now. We heard about this from our dentist, and my wife really wanted to upgrade from the one we had.  This is truely a unique, advanced, and effective instrument for cleaning your teeth!  You can feel the difference!</li>
    <li> I started using the Philips Sonicare Flexcare Plus system in 2009.  This is my second purchase.  I love the cleaning, massaging of the gums, and overall tooth and gum care provided.  I have used other electric toothbrushes in the past but none matched the quality of toothcare as the Philips Sonicare System.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush!  So far no problems and I really feel like l left the dentist after every cleaning.  The travel kit is a bonus and with all the settings, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but our teeth feel far cleaner then with the old &#x27;manual&#x27; toothbrush method.  My wife and I both share a separate head that fits nicely in the cleaner.  &#x27;Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The HX6972/10 was purchased in November 2011 and failed to operate the following June, 2012. At its purchase price, I would have expected greater longevity. While it worked, it did a good job cleaning my teeth. Sadly, I was pressed for time and failed to look into the warranty. Checking today, February 2015, Philips claims the warranty is two years for their Sonicare products. Why check this late? I bought a replacement handle (HX6511/50) in June 2012. Last evening it started turning on randomly by itself. The dog sure didn&#x27;t care for it and I didn&#x27;t either when she started barking at the toothbrush at 2:30 in the morning. Checking the Philips troubleshooting website, they have a category for this problem. Obviously it is common to this product. Having said that, the Sonicare product is the only powered toothbrush that thoroughly cleans my teeth and I have tried them all. Until someone makes a similar, more reliable product, you&#x27;re at the mercy of Murphy&#x27;s Law.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the toothbrush except that the UV lamp only lasted about 6 months and Philips was out of stock of the replacements.  I just recently noticed that Philips had the lamp in stock and ordered one for $20.94.</li>
    <li> I totally love my new Phillips Soncare HX6972 Flexcare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush with the sanitizers.  I would recommend this brush to anyone and everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
    <li> Battery not easily replaceable, not worth the investment considering the initial price and all subsequent toothbrush head replacements, would be better if more consumer oriented.</li>
    <li> I have had this item for just over 2 years. It just started vibrating on its own about a week ago. It randomly turns on and vibrates. When I called, they said it is probably water damage into the handle, but the only water I ever put on it is on the bristle. It has never been dropped, I only use it to brush and then put it right back on its charger. I am just outside the warranty, and they said all they could do is offer me 10% off the next purchase. WHY WOULD I PURCHASE YOUR TOOTHBRUSH AGAIN IF THIS ONE BROKE AFTER 2 YEARS AND I TREATED IT PERFECTLY. Until it broke, I will say that it was a perfectly fine toothbrush that I think worked well.</li>
    <li> Toothbrush was delivered quickly and undamaged.  Works great, and I will never go back to a standard toothbrush.  My dentist recommended that I get a Sonicare toothbrush to reverse the beginning of some gum problems.  Seems to have done the trick, and my teeth feel like I just had them cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office everytime I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely no problems with the seller, and I would personally recommend the seller and the toothbrush to anyone.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore the Sonicare electric toothbrush.  After only two months, my dental hygentist noticed improvement!  It is super easy to use, even though I&#x27;d never used an electric toothbrush in my life.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and what a wonderful product this is.  My teeth are much cleaner and tarter free.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  It is perfect in every way.  There are different brushing modes you can choose from based on your dental health needs.  I use it 3 times a day on average and my teeth always feel super clean.  I would recommend Phillips Sonicare products to anyone.  They are reliable and their customer service is excellent.</li>
    <li> I think this tooth brush is very nice. I also like the idea that it comes with a carrying case for travel and a charger as well. The ultraviolet bit I don&#x27;t really care about it does make it look a bit more sanitary I guess.. I was not sure what to think of the tooth brush initially. It took a few tries to get used to it, but now it just works for me and I am happy with the results. If anything it enforces brush times.</li>
    <li> After using another brand and type of electric toothbrush for years, I developed some dental problems serious enough to send me to a periodontist. He recommended that I switch to a Sonicare. After a month of using this one, my gums are already showing improvement and I will probably avoid having some laser treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Several settings, from gentle to intense, plus a shorter &amp;#34;touch-up&amp;#34; setting&lt;br /&gt;- This model includes a UV sanitizer for the brush head and a travel case&lt;br /&gt;- Really does seem to reduce gum inflamation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Battery charge does not last as long as the promotional materials claim&lt;br /&gt;- Start/stop and setting buttons are easy to press unintentionally while you&#x27;re brushing</li>
    <li> I like this brush. The &#x27;change spot&#x27; indicator while brushing could be a little more obvious as I sometimes miss it while walking around or doing other things, but otherwise is a helpful guide. I was concerned about this being harsh on my gums, but I never bled or felt any pain. This may have been due to the built-in ramp up period. The charge lasts more than a week, which is all I ask. Annoyingly, the travel case does not store the travel charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-1 star because the main reason I purchased this brush over others was the UV dis-infecting light, which broke after a few weeks of me owning the item. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try to get a replacement from sonicare, mostly because I don&#x27;t think it is the bulb that died but some portion of the electronics, based on the failure mode. In any case, thus far, my fault for failing to get it replaced, their fault for the original failure.</li>
    <li> So I bought this and it gave my teeth orgasm. just kidding. but thanks to this tb I now do not need to worry about brushing my teeth while blanking out.</li>
    <li> Updated 3/14/2015&lt;br /&gt;After two years this died. $80/ year is way too steep for a brush. Back to reg toothbrushes for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this because my dentist said I was showing signs of gingivitis and gum disease and strongly encouraged me to buy this.  I was skeptical but since I admittedly do not floss I figured I should do something more proactive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer is great - I never realized how briefly I was brushing my teeth until using this!  The timer is broken down into 4 30 second chunks, 1 for each quadrant of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts a long time - at least a week, probably longer but I throw it back on the base after a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a longtime heavy coffee drinker I was noticing my teeth getting more stained over the last 5 years.  However, since using this toothbrush I can definitely see some brightening of my teeth - added bonus.</li>
    <li> I could extoll the virtues of the product in this review like most people do, which I agree with, or I can talk about its durability. I&#x27;ve had the toothbrush for 13 months now and a couple of months ago, when I would take off the brush head, the silver part that holds the brush head would come off with it. Now I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m pulling on it very hard but considering there&#x27;s a UV sanitizer and different brush head sizes, basically inviting the brush head will be taken on and off repeatedly, you would think that it would be better designed to withstand the brush head being pulled off every day. I didn&#x27;t mind it at first, although it was annoying and I would need pliers to get that part out of the brush head, because I would just put it back in the brush handle and it would last about a week and then we would repeat this process all over again (joy). But last week I tried to reattach it and it would automatically fall out as soon as you turned on the toothbrush. I think something else may have happened but regardless, I don&#x27;t except a $150 toothbrush to fail to the point that it is unusable after only a year. It&#x27;s poorly engineered and designed. They should have made it so the silver part was unable to come off and was just a part of the toothbrush handle and maybe with a nice release button to help remove the brush head. The brush heads are also on the expensive side. I used to have a much older Sonicare model and when you took off that head junk was inside of the head and the brush handle which would cause it to smell and you would have to clean it. Apparently designing a decent brush head concept is too hard for Philips. I just ordered an Oral-B electric toothbrush and I&#x27;m hoping I will have better luck with it... at least the brush heads are half the cost.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush so much that when I got it, I couldn&#x27;t help but talk about it, and I think that says it all.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist has been after me to get an electric toothbrush for a long time, recommending either Sonicare or another brand. I finally relented and bought the Sonicare. I am an easy target for bells and whistles, so bought the fancy one. I must say that I feel like I just left the hygienist office every time I use the Sonicare. And I love all the options and features that prompt me to move on to the next section of teeth to brush. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Brush really cleans teeth thru vibration. takes a little while to adjust for this. battery life is extremely long. was gone for 9 days and did not recharge it once!</li>
    <li> I chose 4 stars because it&#x27;s a great product but as a converter seemed pretty expensive to me.  That being said though, it did help me improve the quality of my gum health within a few weeks as advertised.  It took a while to acclimate to using it but I can definitely tell the difference.  The price is probably worth it if you&#x27;re sharing it with someone (you can each have different heads).  The features are pretty neat and there&#x27;s a quick brush mode too for if you just want to freshen up in a minute instead of the typical two.  I&#x27;m not sure how often I will use all 5 though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product if you&#x27;re interested in improving your teeth/gum health.  My dentist strongly advised me to switch over and I&#x27;m glad they did.</li>
    <li> Nothing to complain about here. It&#x27;s a super brush and I wouldn&#x27;t change anything. Good deal, and it arrived on time.</li>
    <li> My toothbrush of choice. And my dentist&#x27;s and my periodintist</li>
    <li> I love that it is timed for each section of the teeth, no guessing. Teeth look whiter. Brush is easy to insert.</li>
    <li> After my last dentist visit I was told that my tooth sensitivity was a result of &amp;#34;aggressive brushing&amp;#34;. I purchased this toothbrush to help me brush more efficiently while also helping with my tooth sensitivity. It has done just that! I like the multiple settings and the compact design of the charger and UV sanitizer. Has left my teeth feeling very clean and I have already noticed a difference in overall gum health. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> My flexcare completely stopped working two days ago after completely normal use (of one person) and maintenance. I called customer service and spoke to an exceptionally rude floor manager. It is beyond my comprehension that the leading brand in the oral care market cannot stand behind a product they make when a device is clearly faulty, but it&#x27;s outside of 2 years (I was 3 months out of warranty). There should be a huge disclaimer on the box stating the product will only last 2 years, after which, buy another one. I would have NEVER spent $180 on this product if I knew this was the type of customer service and support I would be getting.</li>
    <li> Much better than Oral B version that I&#x27;ve been using for years.. Love that there is an automatic timer, so the two minutes that is recommended to brush your teeth is accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently bought the following upgraded version&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052JN7XG/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B0052JN7XG&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;derdigki-20&amp;linkId&#x3D;EPE3TRN4ICRZGTQI&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy brushing :)</li>
    <li> delivered exactly what it promised. I had a stain right on my front tooth for a while and it took it right off on the first brushing! absolutely love it</li>
    <li> This is my third Sonicare toothbrush all told, and my second Flexcare Plus. I was introduced to Sonicare by my dentist years ago and have relied ever since on it to keep my teeth and gums healthy and strong. I especially like the Flexcare Plus model, as it has separate settings for gums and sensitive teeth, as well as the UV feature for keeping the brush itself clean. Highly recommended ... Costly but well worth it.</li>
    <li> So, invested in this toothbrush as a replacement for an older one. Was super excited as it had some nice power to it and was working great until now every time I brush my teeth the head part falls of. Without fail, every, single time the stupid thing comes off. I have tried replacing the brush head,adjusting how it&#x27;s placed on, etc.&lt;br /&gt;If the tooth brush didn&#x27;t have this problem, I would recommend the brush to anyone looking. But as is I would say pass because who knows what will happen.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after owning a Sonicare Elite toothbrush for the last 10 years. Worked great up until the battery started to give out, which is expected after that long of use. I bought this after comparing it between the Flexcare, and Diamond model. I went with it based on the UV light cleaner. I know, really? But I must say that I didn&#x27;t think I was going to see much of a difference going from one model to the other. I was way wrong! Every time I brush I feel like I&#x27;ve just got back from the dentist. It comes with 2 brush heads. One head has a longer bristle area than the other. I assume for people with smaller teeth or children. It also features 5 different cleaning cycles: Clean, Gum Care, Refresh, Sensitive, and Massage. I really enjoy the ability to change these styles because sometimes my teeth are sensitive and this is a HUGE relief. It also comes with the base station that has the UV tooth brush head cleaner, a travel charger, and sleek looking case. I&#x27;ve never given much thought to how dirty your bristles can be, but do some research and you&#x27;ll understand why this is a must have for anyone who cares about their oral hygiene. After using this for a few weeks now, my teeth are looking brighter and brighter. My roommate has noticed a big difference with them as well. From being a previous Sonicare owner, I must say I will be a lifetime customer. Once you&#x27;ve experienced the cleaning power of these you will never go back to a manual toothbrush or any other brush.  Out of the box, it comes with a 10 day &amp;#34;ease in&amp;#34; cleaning mode which slowly increases the power of cleaning so you can get use to it. For anyone whose never used an electric brush before, it&#x27;ll feel like your mouth is being &amp;#34;tickled&amp;#34;. BARE with it, trust me! Once your mouth gets use to it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> The Sonicare toothbrush is probably one of the most ingenious and worthwhile inventions of the past 20 years. My wife and I purchased our first one in the mid 90&#x27;s. It did an excellent job at cleaning our teeth and removing built up plaque. Throughout the years, there have been various improvements, most notably in reduction of size and weight of the handle and brush. While there is no question that the toothbrush does a fantastic job at improving your dental hygiene, there is one very frustrating aspect of owning this toothbrush. The frustration lies in the fact that the rechargeable batteries last only a few years. Since my wife and I decided long ago that we each wanted our own unit, it becomes very expensive when it comes time to replace them. I own several other rechargeable devices, and all have a lifespan that is longer than that of the Sonicare. Between replacing brush heads every 6 months, and replacing 2 complete devices every few years, the expense gets to be exorbitant. Granted the toothbrush is great, but certainly the company could come up with a battery that would last at least 5 years. The bottom line is that there is nothing better on the market, yet in respect to longevity you&#x27;ll be sorely disappointed. I&#x27;m only deducting 1 star, as despite the short lifespan of these toothbrushes, they do a remarkable job at keeping your teeth healthy.</li>
    <li> this is my fist electric toothbrush.  I like it overall.  the reason I gave it \\&quot;4\\&quot; is because the soft material on the bottom has cracked and the dirt is getting under the material.  The performance is still good after over 8 months of use.  The only complaint is the look due to poor quality case material.</li>
    <li> The smartest investment my dumb ex girlfriend ever bought was this guy! I started to use hers(using the additional brush head of course) and I told myself &amp;#34;If something were to happen to this relationship, I&#x27;d have to get me one of these!&amp;#34; And so I did and it&#x27;s my &amp;#34;precious&amp;#34;! The uv cleaner works exceptionally well and it is certainly strong enough to clean my rims and tires! &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Used it now for a month. Had a little bit of a toothache on one of my teeth, which is pretty much gone now. Teeth feel clean and with the regular brush option it takes me a minute less. Not sure about the UV cleaner . Have used it twice. Never had any problems before with my tooth brushes, but now that i have this i will use it once a week just in case.&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is already worn after a month of use. The ,manual says exchange every three months. Will see if it makes it another two. Overall very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Update 2017: still using it daily and still works after 4 years of daily use. Just buy the non Philips replacement brushes. Saves you a ton of money and they are almost equally as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my review helped you in any way, please hit the &amp;#34;YES&amp;#34; below where it asks, &amp;#34;Was this review helpful to you?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought the Sonicare Flexcare in April of 2011 and initially the product was great. But after about 6-8 months of use, the brush-head stopped vibrating. I contacted Philips Support and their warranty policy was top notch. Without any hassle, they promptly sent me a new unit. This unit also lasted 6-8 months before exhibiting the same problem I had with the first set - one morning, the brush-head once again stopped vibrating. (I could hear the little motor with some weird clanging noises). I once again called their support department and within a week I had a new replacement unit. This morning (a year and 8 months after my original purchase), my 3rd unit stopped charging. I just got of a call with Philips support and they are sending me yet another replacement unit. This will be my 4th set in less than 2 years. One thing that concerns me is that their warranty period is for 24 months from the day you made your original purchase. That means that in 4 months from now, my warranty will be officially void and considering the current track record, I suspect this set too will fail within 6 - 8 months. Philips has stated that there are no known problems with this set, but considering all the other negative reviews with similar problems, I truly wonder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this purchase. I previously owned 2 earlier models. This is an improvement, except for the on/off button&#x27;s location. I sometimes inadvertently switch off the unit while brushing. Adjust your grip and you&#x27;ll be OK.</li>
    <li> It takes a little while to get used to the vibrations in your mouth.  The 30 second timer for each quadrant of teeth makes it easy to brush evenly.  You can feel the difference after only a few brushes.  Battery stays charged for several days even with 2 people using each day.</li>
    <li> The top piece of the handle that the brush head fits onto broke.  Something is very loose and the brush performance is about zero now. 2 people used it for almost exactly 2 years after looking back at my purchase history on amazon.  The thing was fine for the 2 years, but we&#x27;re going to try the Oral B 5000 this time.  We would have bought another handle if we could find one without the base.  Amazon seems to sell a handle-only product, but if you read the reviews they appear to be b-stock, knockoffs or refurbs... none of which we care to own.  $150 just seems steep for a new handle that could have mechanical failure in a couple years.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd one of the Philips sonicares and the 2nd of this variety,. I am still confident that they are superior to anything else available</li>
    <li> It was super awesome to get the product as fast as I did. I appreciated so much. thanks again Carlena</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week, but I can already tell a difference.  The most amazing thing is after I brush, when I floss, I get hardly any plaque.  Never seen anything like this.  I was extremely hesitant because of the price but I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance.</li>
    <li> My mouth feels so clean after using this.  Going back to a manual toothbrush would be like fighting a structure fire with a super soaker.  Yes, it is expensive for a brush but the dental benefits will keep you from having to get more work done at the dentist&#x27;s office which can be a lot more expensive in the long run.</li>
    <li> The thing is, I have been blessed with good teeth that have persisted while I have had a spotty track record of oral hygiene. This product has been my ticket onto the &amp;#34;good habits&amp;#34; path... and has helped tremendously. A must buy for anyone looking for a toothbrush you look forward to using everyday!</li>
    <li> Mouth feels cleaner than when using a regular brush or other electric brushes.  I planned to wait until my next dental check up to see if there was any clinical difference but decided no to wait.  If there is a difference, I plan to buy four more for family members.</li>
    <li> Sonicare makes toothbrushes that do a very good job of cleaning your teeth.  I purchased this to replace my previous sonicare elite which lasted me 9 years.  My trips to the dentist definitely got easier when I switched from a regular toothbrush to a sonicare; I consider sonicare toothbrushes to be worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is a bit lighter and smaller than the old one, which makes it easier to brush with.  The battery also lasts longer - over 2 weeks on one charge when new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got several different brush modes, but the only real differences are how long it runs before it shuts off automatically and how fast it vibrates.  It has 2 speeds - regular and &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34;.  If you use your toothbrush as a timer, you may find the extra modes helpful, but otherwise probably not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads snap onto the drive spindle rather than screwing on.  This eliminates the problem the old toothbrushes had of providing a nice place for bacteria to build up between the brush handle and the brush head, making it easy to keep clean.  However, it also means that the drive shaft is less protected, and every time I remove or replace the brush head I am worried about the amount of pressure it puts on the motor.  This design seems less robust than the previous screw-on brush head model, and I don&#x27;t expect this toothbrush to last as long as my previous one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush comes with a UV light sanitizer.  It might do something or it might just glow blue - no way to tell.  I avoid using it because you have to remove the brush head to use it; it takes a lot of pressure to snap the brush head on and off and I&#x27;m worried about the extra wear and tear on the motor from doing that every day.  Also, this model is easy to keep clean anyway.</li>
    <li> My old Sonicare quit holding a charge after many years so I&#x27;ve replaced it with this one and am very pleased with it.  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any better than the old one but rather it seems much the same with some added features.  I simply cannot live without Sonicare so I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has changed my life. I have had a sonic toothbrush in the past but nothing like this. It pushes the water between my teeth and moves out the particles that lie in there, making flossing much easier. I also LOVE the travel kit that comes with it. But most of all I love the UV sanitizer, it does a great job killing the bacteria. So I can use the brush when I am sick and then stick the head in the UV sanitizer and it&#x27;s worry free. I would strongly recommend this toothbrush to anyone who is serious about the health of their gums and teeth.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;m sure we all do, I&#x27;ve always brushed my teeth.  It was just something that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After talking with my dentist, the former President of our local ADA chapter, and expressing skepticism that sonic units actually did anything special, he convinced me to try this unit, which particularly appealed to me over the other options due to its UV head cleaner.  I&#x27;m fairly certain that it&#x27;s not placebo effect: I truly think that I have seen a very visible difference in the color of my teeth as a result of the increased time that I spend brushing due to the quad-pacer and due to the sonic technology.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I use a Phillips Sonicare for my receding gum problem.  I used it for two months and the next checkup showed that the condition had improved!</li>
    <li> I love that is rechargeable and it comes with a travel case and charger. The UV light is handy. Toothbrush cleans teeth well. Keep mouth closed while brushing, tooth paste gets &amp;#34;foamy&amp;#34; and can splatter or drip out of mouth.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 brush sets, that were used by 2 adults.  Each brush failed 2 times within a year and was replaced by the company.  The 3rd failure also with in a year they will not replace.  Each brush failed either with the on off switch, which worked randomly, or the motion of the brush seized.  Had a Oral B for 15 years before it died!  Will never buy a Phillips Sonicare product again.  These were not abused brushes!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product and the price was much more reasonable than what I found elsewhere. That is all.</li>
    <li> I have gone through two of these toothbrushes. I purchased my first about 2 years ago. Initially I loved it. Worked great. Loved all of the settings. Had great dental checkups with little or no plaque (This is saying a lot for me because I have extreme dry mouth). But then the toothbrush died and wouldn&#x27;t charge. Sonicare replaced it for me and I figured I just got one with a bad battery. Then it happened again a year later. I just think for such an expensive toothbrush this shouldn&#x27;t happen after 1 year. I intended to have this toothbrush for at least 5 years. Now Sonicare refuses to replace it for me. I will NEVER buy a sonicare product again and plan to tell everyone I know about my experience.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this toothbrush bought 2 each broke under a year. got both replaced under warranty and they too broke in under a year no more replacement since they say my warranty expired. My oral b lasted longer than I wanted to keep it</li>
    <li> Everyone in my family has a Sonicare toothbrush, however my wife&#x27;s stopped working after about 3 years.  I found this new updated one and she says it works so much better then the regular Sonicare toothbrush.  She also loves that you can UV clean it.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush head does not stay on for longer than 20-30 seconds. Very frustrating, and not what I expected for the price!</li>
    <li> Our dentist has been telling me for years that I should get an electric toothbrush. I finally relented and chose this one from among the fray. After the first time brushing, my teeth felt as if I had just been to the dentist! My gums are apparently healthier, too - since I had a tendency to brush too hard. Definitely recommend this one! It&#x27;s only getting 4 stars because it developed a funny humming noise after just a few months of use, which gives it some vibration that doesn&#x27;t seem to belong.</li>
    <li> Pros: My teeth are much cleaner&lt;br /&gt;Helps cut down on my brushing time&lt;br /&gt;Gums are much healthier&lt;br /&gt;Not drooling at the mouth every time I brush&lt;br /&gt;Brush heads tell me when to replace the heads(The colors fade after awhile)&lt;br /&gt;Multiple brush modes help me keep my teeth clean during the day&lt;br /&gt;Have not had to floss yet!(Though I do recommend still doing it unless you have the Sonic Care flosser)&lt;br /&gt;Awesome carrying case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Travel case does not have room for the travel charger.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I can have my gum care which I have problem.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the small little brush that I can use for special cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;It is completely different from another brand that I have been using up to now.</li>
    <li> After going to my last dental cleaning and having my dentist remind me about flossing, etc plus the warning of impending gum disease I decided it was cheaper to buy a really good toothbrush than give the thousand plus to the dentist....no offense Doc.  For the first couple of weeks my gums were still bleeding a little bit but now they don&#x27;t at all.  That makes me know that my gums are getting in good shape.  When I pass my tongue around my teeth I get that same feeling that happens after I have had a dental cleaning.  I love the fact that it has a mini timer in there to make sure that I get at least 30 seconds per quadrant.  I bet I was only doing about 30 seconds in my whole mouth with my regular toothbrush.  I used to have a battery operated brush and the different in speed is like the difference between dial up internet and cable speed internet.  It&#x27;s not even in the same ballpark.  If you want to save money at the dentist...buy this toothbrush</li>
    <li> This has to be the lightest and quietest electric toothbrush! This Sonicare replaces an Oral B that we had for a few years and the difference is amazing. This is the second Sonicare we have owned, we had a very similar unit prior to the Oral B and it only lasted a couple of years. Although the UV is superfluous I do like having a place to contain the brush heads and if it is disinfecting the heads as well, great! So far I am extremely pleased with this Sonicare and do hope to be using it for the next several years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this system for 2 years and 10 months. It&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for at least 30 years. I never get cavities and it takes about 20 minutes for the dental hygienist to clean my teeth every 6 months. Anyway, the UV light burned out yesterday. There are replacement bulbs available and it&#x27;s a cinch to change. My new bulb arrives tomorrow. I&#x27;m sure killing germs on toothbrushes is frivolous but I use it to make sure no mold gets in my brush heads. This is Florida and things are sometimes damp and get moldy. The UV light works for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/22/2014: The UV light arrived 5 days ago. I ordered the $9.99 bulb offered here on Amazon. It fits perfectly and was easy to install. So far it&#x27;s working as it&#x27;s supposed to work. No issues. I&#x27;ll update this as time goes on.</li>
    <li> Works well. Took it on a week-long trip. Held the charge really well. Like the fact that I can clean the brush heads.</li>
    <li> I bought this Toothbrush because it makes brushing the teeth easier and actually fun. It does a great job brushing.</li>
    <li> This unit quit working and began making a buzzing noise, and I was unable to shut it off. Finally it developed large burn marks on the sides and bottom. It is quite dangerous and could have started a fire. When I called their customer service they were very unhelpful and did not want to send a replacemente.</li>
    <li> Love the toothbrush. Died in about a year. Got a replacement. Died in less than a year. Now it is out of warranty and I am out of pocket. For this price this is ridiculous. Fix the problems.</li>
    <li> For years, I heard about how great electric toothbrushes are.  Dentists always seemed to recommend them. But I figured, if they were so hot, why did everyone I know own an ordinary toothbrush?  Well, after getting a new cavity and having to re-fill a five aging fillings, I decided to try something new. After all, toothbrushes are great if you know how to use them.  However, if you have the funds to try a new technology, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a strange feeling at first. Instead of vigorous and foamy self-brushing, you feel a subtle vibration. It&#x27;s hard to imagine that it&#x27;s actually working.  This particular model has  a timer so that you know exactly how long to brush. It even has different settings for different needs, like gum massaging, for example. This particular model has a beginner mode that warms up and speeds up as you get used to the vibrations.  It reminds me of the tooth-polisher they use at the dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I just got braces, I decided it was important to go the extra mile. However, I wish I had picked up one of these years ago. My dentist said the sonicare is far and above the cheap electric toothbrushes you can buy at the drugstore, the ones that cost only a little more than a regular toothbrush.  Best of all, with multiple heads and a cleaner, you can share this device with your whole family.  It does take up quite a it of space on the counter, and I now have it alongside a [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]].  Currently  my dental care takes up about half of the bathroom counter space.  But it&#x27;s worth it to have clean and sparkling teeth.  My teeth have never felt so clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you do hit your teeth with the plastic rather than the brush, you&#x27;ll get a bit of a jolt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only disconcerting thing is how the toothpaste drips out of your mouth as you brush.  Honestly, you want to brush first, THEN do your make-up. You won&#x27;t be doing this one at the office.</li>
    <li> its a great product. my teeth havent been as clean in years. used to haev a 20 dollar electric toothbrush from wallgreens. that was a sad joke compared to this.... get it.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric tooth brush purchase and I&#x27;m very happy with the product.  Takes some getting use to but it performs as well as the reviews I read said it would</li>
    <li> Depending on your expectations...we purchased this unit for $189 from Philips and it quit after 3 years (would turn on/off by itself in the middle of the night). Also, indicator lights malfunctioned after about 1 year.  No sympathy from the manufacturer and the warranty is for 2 years.  Was told there must have been a water leak.  Battery, etc. was fine.  This model seems prone to leaking as the rubber backing starts to come off after a while.  We had a less expensive model that lasted almost 10 years and merely replaced it as the battery was losing its charge.  I like the Sonicare product, not this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$190 product should last as long as the $90 product but alas complexity leads to obsolescence.</li>
    <li> I bought the FlexCare+ on the recommendation of my periodontist.  I felt like the brush did an excellent job of cleaning my teeth, &amp; both the periodontist &amp; my regular dentist found less plaque than I had when I used a manual toothbrush.  I didn&#x27;t particularly care about the sterilizing unit, but since it was there, I used it on a daily basis.  I found it very difficult to pull the brush head off the handle.  After about 50 weeks of use, the metal post pulled out of the handle.  I could reinsert the post, but it didn&#x27;t stay in the handle.  Whenever I brushed my teeth, the post + brush head would fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the unit was still under warranty, I called Customer Service.  Their response was everything I could have wanted: no argument, an apology, &amp; an offer to mail me a new handle.  All they asked was that I return my broken handle in the box, using the prepaid label they provided.  The handle was at my house in 3 days, &amp; they even included a new brush head, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was unhappy with the longevity of the original handle, I was extremely pleased with Customer Service.  I have now decided to sterilize my brush head only once a week.  The less often I remove the brush from the handle, the safer I feel.</li>
    <li> I just switched from manual toothbrush. Teeth feel beautifully clean, gums not bleeding and breath feels better. Wish I had switched years ago. If you can afford this, invest in it.</li>
    <li> I had an Oral-B Triumph before this.  I had a few of them over the years.  Never really thought about changing until recently.  We got this &amp; I would never go back.  We use the Diamond Clean brush heads with this.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful money-saving device.  My dentist recommended it as I am cavity-prone and this has saved me from needing more fillings.  It&#x27;s an initial investment, but totally worth it.  The multiple settings and UV brush cleaner are also big perks.&lt;br /&gt;It stays charged for travel trips as well--what a great product.</li>
    <li> Works just like my last SonicCare (which I don&#x27;t think they make anymore).  The only difference is that my old one came with two toothbrushes (not the brush itself, but the mechanical bottom) and this new one only came with one.  But, the traveling case went from a soft carrying case to a hard clam-shelled plastic one.  Not sure if that is an even trade off, but I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
    <li> My wife and I had an older model of this Sonicare brush since 2007. We have experienced excellent customer service when we needed a warranty replacement from Phillips. It was time to upgrade and this model is even better than our previous brush. Features plenty of modes for different brushing needs, small footprint in our bathroom despite the UV sanitizer, excellent battery life and hard case for travel.Teeth feel cleaner than ever (try the new diamond clean brush heads), and that&#x27;s really what matters!</li>
    <li> I´ve gone through most of what is possible to try when it comes to dental care, and to be honest I hate brushing my teeth, which I have taken the consequences of when it comes to money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently decided I´d rather go with one of these electric brushes since it is a lot easier and not as boring as the toothbrush. It´ll cost you more obviously, but to me it´s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this thing I brush every day, I just put it in and it does the rest for me (you gotta move it around obviously). It´s gentle, but strong at the same time cleaning the teeth really well, at the same time it doesn´t hurt my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought an Oral-B thing before this, but my dentist said that it ruined my gums and was way too rough for my mouth. He told me about that brush most dentists sell (something R), but when the nurse had left he told me about this one since this is the one he uses himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn´t be happier to be honest. My mouth has cleaned up very nice, my gums have definitely started to look nicer, and I don´t have any of the pain or bleeding I used to have when I brushed my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this 4 stars because it has that thing on the side for you to sanitize the brush, but that´s not working for me at all. If it did I´d give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> i believe this is a remanufactured product. The brush head does not fit securely on the body of the toothbrush and the motor does not appear to be strong and consistent in strength. My last sonic that at I purchased at Rite Aid drug store was the step down version from this one and I worked much better. I am thinking I should have saved some money and went with the same one I had before. Im very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> I had to come in here and write a review of my experience after owning this model for 2 years.... 6 REPLACEMENTS! It may have been 7...I lost count! I had 6 maybe 7 replacements in the 2 year warranty period! Can you believe that??? Atleast Philips honored the warranty, I will give them that. Now that my warranty has ended and the 6th maybe 7th replacement has just broke (3 months old) I need a new one and guess what! It WILL NEVER BE A SONICARE! STAY AWAY FROM SONICARE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S There should be a zero star option... In this case, it&#x27;s warranted!</li>
    <li> This unit replaces a Sonicare purchased about 6 years ago. The old Sonicare came with 2 complete brushes. When the battery on one needed a charge I used the other unit. The charge time was quite lengthy. The new unit charges quite rapidly compared to the old one. Battery technology has improved. I was so happy with the old unit, it wasn&#x27;t difficult, to chose another Philips Sonicare product. I also like the multiple options for dental care.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few of these or similar models of the same brand--which suggests that I appreciate the cleaning power of this product. HOWEVER, I had to send one back after just months for a replacement, and others only lasted a year or so. The problem with this design is that if you&#x27;re sharing a single handle with a partner--which means exchanging the brush part of the set-up often--you&#x27;ll soon find that the top of the handle BREAKS OFF, leaving the needle point inside the brush. When I called the company to complain, the woman I talked with couldn&#x27;t have been nicer--and the company sent me a replacement immediately. But it was clear that Philips KNOWS about this design flaw and is anxious to hush complaints about it through quick replacements RATHER THAN RE-ENGINEERING IT to make it hold up.</li>
    <li> I owned a similar model to this that did not come with the UV sanitizer.  It worked just as well as this one, but nasty gunk and bacteria would form under the toothbrush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned this for about two to three months now, and gunk has never formed as long as I have been consistent with putting the brush head in the sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that this brush does not do though, is during the thorough cleaning, it does not change up the rate of brushing vibration during the last 10-15 seconds for each quadrant.  In other words, the rate of the brush vibration remains constant throughout the entire cleanings.  It does beep to notify you to switch quadrants.  This is a minor inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I go to the dentist, I am out of there in about 10 minutes.  Prior to owning a toothbrush like this, cleanings would take about one hour.  You have to be consistent and do at least one full cleaning per day.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll use the quick cleaning mode in the morning, but I make sure to do the full cleaning at night.  Combine this with a good flossing routine, and your dentist visits should be a lot easier.</li>
    <li> This is probably the fourth or fifth Sonicare toothbrush (not counting the battery-powered travel ones.) that we have had over the last 10 years or so.  We have always felt that they were the best you could buy.  We noticed right away that this one just didn&#x27;t perform like the old ones did. We followed all the battery charging instructions.  But our teeth didn&#x27;t feel as clean.  So we have been using our battery-powered Sonicare.  Not sure what to do as far as returning product.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected and more.  Very impressed by the long battery life. Definitely recommend this device for avoiding gum issues.</li>
    <li> I have used sonicare for 12 years now. My first sonicare was a sonicare essence toothbrush that was given to me by a dentist about ten years ago. This toothbrush was great except for the mold build-up when you took off the head. However, this toothbrush still works today and the battery is going strong. We bought this toothbrush and gave my other one to my daughter. It worked well and the UV light thing was nice but within one year, the battery died! So I contacted Philips and they relented and gave me another toothbrush even though they felt it was no longer under warranty. The second one they sent lasted a little less than two years. It&#x27;s sad when companies sell out and start out with an amazing product but then turn to cheap production and cheap batteries. Why pay so much money for something that will be dead in less than two years, not to mention the cost of the brush heads! It&#x27;s possible they give dentists the good ones and then sell the cheap ones to consumers. In time, consumers are going to catch on and Sonicare is going to begin to lose their business if they continue to use cheap parts to make more money.</li>
    <li> I was replacing my original Sonicare that was probably twenty years old.  If I would have known how much better this was, I would not have waited for the old one to die.  My teeth feel just-came-from-the-dentist clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my last Flexcare Plus. Asd I was traveling for work, I happened to leave the travel case on the sink in my hotel. Of course maid services &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t find anything&amp;#34; in my room. Someone is probably using it - it&#x27;s a great toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While buying my replacement, I had the choice of either getting another Flexcare Plus or purchasing the newer Diamond Clean. Warning - I was already using the Diamond Clean brush heads on my Flexcare Plus brush handle. If you don&#x27;t already use these brush heads, you should get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While reading other reviews for the Diamond Clean brush handle, I decided that I like my Flexcare Plus just fine. Plus, I really wasn&#x27;t looking to spend all that extra money on the Diamond Clean. Bottom line is that the few days I had to go using a manual toothbrush - I would never fully return to using a manual again.</li>
    <li> great product!  no more bleeding gums and two separate dentists commented on how clean my teeth are and even after trying, they could not find anything urgent to rip me off for.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned. This is the 4th or 5th unit and I love the self-cleaning storage this model has. It does sanitize and keep the brushheads clean. The handle is lighter and easier to manage as well as clean.</li>
    <li> The Flexcare+ is a nicely designed brush.  Light years ahead of the old Sonicare brush I had decades ago.  Light, multi-mode brushing and three week charge for one charging.  My teeth feel so clean and actually are getting whiter each week I use it regularly.  At first the sonic action tickles and for some may be unpleasant, but the brush has an &amp;#34;easy start&amp;#34; feature that ramps up the sonic action slowly so you can get used to it.  There is a newer brush called the DiamondClean, but it is just a dressed up Flexcare+.  The Flexcare+ also has more value because it comes with the brush head sanitizing base, and the DiamonClean does not even have the option.  Save soem money and get a greater value by getting the Flexcare+.</li>
    <li> The price has come down since I bought it, but glad I did. It is the most expensive Sonicare you can buy but the features are also better. 5 modes on handle 2 chargers 1 with ultra violet sanitizer the other a small travel size. Also got 3 extra tips which were the larger brush size, plan on buying this size next year when needed. Also I drive a semi getting home on week ends, it holds the charge all week. will update after annual cleaning and share what the dentist has to say. Well worth the money my teeth feel clean all the time.</li>
    <li> This tool is a must have for overall health and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I am very satisfied with the product along with Amazon for making the online shopping experience easy and worry free. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this toothbrush for months now with no real complaints. I can&#x27;t really say how useful the UV part is, but I use it everyday, at the very least it makes me feel as though it is disinfecting my toothbrush. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the price, though it is in line with what can be expected for a rechargeable electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Has more settings than necessary (in my opinion) but it is better to have too many than not enough.  Forces you to brush your teeth longer and it works great.  The dentist says my teeth look much better.</li>
    <li> I ordered one for each of my immediate family for Christmas.  Everybody is loving them.  My brother n law said it is the best present he has ever received, and if he had gotten one 10 years ago his teeth would be a lot healthier &amp; in much better shape.  I did good!  ;)</li>
    <li> This is the best one out there!!!!!  LOVE IT!  Our dentist highly recommended it.My husband wants one now, but since it has multiple brushes,  the whole family can use it!</li>
    <li> I bought this at $138 and used for more than a year.  It was my first electric brush since my dentist recommend me to have one due to my loss of gum.  I brush my teeth too hard.  He suggests me owning an electric brush which can help me protect my gum. After using this one, my gum situation didn&#x27;t get worse.  But this tooth brush can be messy.  The tooth paste easily drips along the tooth brush head to the actual handle.  Recently, my dentist gave me the brand recommendation since he noticed that my gum situation was still not that idea. He recommend me Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  I got that one from Amazon as well for $105 dollars (33 dollars cheaper).  Now I can tell you the difference.  The Oral-B 5000 is the one!  Not messy and more powerful! With the smartguide system, it is much better than this Philips one.  I would not recommend anyone this product! Instead, get the Oral-B 5000.  The round head is better than the Philips Sonicare long head.  Hope this can help others to choose their first electric tooth brush.  Give 2 stars for attention purpose.  I could give it a 3-star review.  It is OK.  Not that bad.  Definetly not as good as Oral-B 5000 which is even $33 cheaper.</li>
    <li> This is a very, very, very expensive toothbrush recommended by many dentists and periodontists. I love(d) my Sonicare and I do believe it has helped me improve and maintain better oral healthcare, but I&#x27;m less enthusiastic about Philips lukewarm support of its products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my Flexcare stopped vibrating properly, I went to the Philips site and initiated a chat. Thinking that they would replace the base without much discussion, I was absolutely shocked when the representative told me that although &amp;#34;normally the unit lasts for several years&amp;#34; my warranty had expired and I would need to purchase a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I can understand it is quite disappointing, however, these are very rare cases where the unit breaks, there are numerous cases where the unit has lasted for several years.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phrases in quotation marks are verbatim, copied and pasted from my chat transcript. They expect the toothbrush to last several years, but if yours doesn&#x27;t, oh well...</li>
    <li> great product and Amazon packed and shipped perfectly again.  Only down side it Phillips does not &#x27;get you started with more than one brush.... greedy.</li>
    <li> I had been using a Spin Brush and thought it was doing the job.  When I began using the sonicare, I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  The timer lets me be sure to spend the same amount of time on each quadrant of my mouth and has additional time intervals for gums or &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34; brushing.  My teeth always feel as though I&#x27;ve just come from the dentist.  I can ensure tht there is no bacteria growing on the brush because of the UV bulb sterilization.&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I was gone overnight and used a manual toothbrush.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to get back home to my Sonicare.  i would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  It seems like a great product, but being my first electric toothbrush in years, I admittedly have little point of comparison.</li>
    <li> Ok, i bought this toothbrush in December 2012, despite some reviews that it broke after 2 years and 9 months which was after the warranty expired.  well today it stopped charging!!!  So I went to the Philips website and they had a 24 hour chat.  I explained to the person the problem and that it has not even been two years yet.  He took me through some trouble shooting steps and the tooth brush still did not work.  the charger was working because the sterilizer still works.  So they are sending me a new toothbrush handle!  Within minutes, I got the email for the order for replacing the handle!  I gave it 5 stars because I love how the toothbrush cleans my teeth and for the amazing customer service from Philips.  BUT...I do feel that the tooth brush should not have broken so soon.  So I will see how long the replacement brush lasts.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about Sonicare. This is our second Sonicare in several years. We come from a family with gum disease so we are very careful what we use because we need it to do it&#x27;s job very well. Any redness in your gums or bleeding will be gone in about 2 weeks. Your teeth will be as smooth as when they are cleaned by your dentist. We also bought the Jr. version for our children who now enjoy the same results we do.</li>
    <li> Been using this  for just a few days now and my teeth and mouth feel a gazillion times cleaner. No annoying difficult instructions to read and simple to use. Super expensive but I think well worth it b/c I truly believe I will have less trips to the dentist now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and appears to do a good job cleaning teeth.  Lights on unit allow for cleaning time choices.  Easy to pack up for travel as well.</li>
    <li> Great product - I really like the self clean feature, and the better quality brushing (as well as different brushing modes) can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Love my new toothbrush.  Got this model specifically for the gum care option.  The gum care is actually a few more seconds on the end of the brushing cycle.  Not sure it is worth the money to spend the extra money for this feature.  Will probably get a more basic model next time, but works great and I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Live it!, end of story!</li>
    <li> I am fully satisfied with this product. It is easy to you and after brushing I am feeling refreshed. !!!</li>
    <li> This is incredibly expensive for a toothbrush but I figured I&#x27;d give a try and my gums will thank me later. Do yourself a favor and buy a cheaper or older version of this one. The UV brush cleaning is ok, a bit of a gimmick and the console for it takes up a lot of room next to your sink, you&#x27;re better off using the smaller included console and forgo UV cleaning altogether. As for the brushing action and stuff, I have honestly used a half dozen electric tooth brushes that feel exactly the same way. The 4 quadrant alert brushing was nice at first but unnecessary, it rushes you to other areas if you happen to be focusing on a part of your mouth that feels unclean. You can simply do a better job yourself by brushing those areas until you feel happy and clean enough to move on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an electric toothbrush for years so I was very surprised at the far superior cleaning of this toothbrush.  I also love the uv light which makes every brushing feel fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t decide between the sonicare and oral b. but having bought the sonic I am very happy with how it feels and the way my mouth feels after I use it compared to the manual toothbrush. Very happy!</li>
    <li> We are both having a wonderful experience with our teeth and gums.  I purchased two.  I am not sorry plus it sterilizes the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This really cleans your teeth.  There is room for two brush heads.  There is a UV light which you can use to sanitize your brush heads.</li>
    <li> Works good, though I don&#x27;t think all the settings are necessary. Dentist only recommends this brush, and he says to use the lowest setting. It cleans just the same as the others, but it is less abrasive on your gums. So, according to him you really don&#x27;t need the more fancy brushes with tones of settings. The basic is the best.  Update Handle started to lose vibration functionality after about 2 year, but could be my fault.</li>
    <li> I have had Sonicare products for years. This new model works great. I haven&#x27;t tried all the features, but am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Ever since I had my first Sonicare I knew they had me for life. They literally take all the work out of brushing your teeth besides holding the handle. Your teeth feel so much cleaner than using a manual brush (or cheap, non-sonic electric toothbrush). The bristles vibrate so fast and really get into every little spot in your mouth. It is pricey up front but the long term benefits of getting such a good, dentist quality clean every time is totally worth it! I however couldn&#x27;t justify spending $80 more for the next model up that has the pressure sensor to tell you when you&#x27;re brushing too hard. I wanted that feature but not for the premium price they are asking ($240 is more than I&#x27;m willing to spend on any toothbrush!!!). However, this model is fairly priced and comes with the UV sanitizer which is nice! I can&#x27;t verify that it actually kills germs but they say it does! The charging base makes a weird high pitch noise when plugged in that is my only complaint! (Noise goes away when UV sanitizer is on. It is very noticeable though when the handle is charging and the UV sanitizer is not in use). I may contact Philips to see if this is normal or if they want to send me a replacement.  UPDATE 3/14/15: The price dropped to $189 for the Platinum model, I am returning this one and ordering the better one because it has the pressure sensor. It cost $240 before and I wasn&#x27;t willing to spend $80 more to get the pressure sensor. However I am willing to spend $30 more for it so I am haha! I recommend the Platinum if you can spare the extra $30, I mean come on you&#x27;re already spending $160 here mise well go up and know when you&#x27;re brushing too hard! (Hoping the new one won&#x27;t have any high pitch noise coming from it!)  UPDATE 3/17/15: After receiving the Platinum model and having both of them in hand I realized I like the Plus better! I am keeping the Plus and returning the Platinum after all, here&#x27;s why: 1) Pressure Sensor: It was the main reason I wanted the upgraded model. Afterusing it I realized I had to put so much pressure on my teeth and gums to get the sensor to go off that it will seem like a gimmick to most people, including myself. I will never brush that hard...ever. 2) Controls &amp; Display: The backlit display of the Plus model is much better than the Platinum! You can see and easily select modes in complete darkness with the Plus, but with the Platinum you need some light to read the words printed on the handle. The Platinum model has tiny LED&#x27;s and no backlit display. 3) Handle: The handle is bigger in diameter on the Platinum and much more comfortably small on the Plus model. The Plus has blue rubber on the back as a grip while the Platinum is just white plastic with bumps in it (much more prone to dropping it while my hands are wet) 4) UV Sanitizer: On the Platinum model the inside is all made out of dark grey plastic while the Plus has reflective chrome plastic. I think the reflective chrome mirror effect would help the UV light clean the whole brush better (front and back, not just the bristles facing the light) 5) Loud! The handle is so loud on the Platinum it is ridiculous! I couldn&#x27;t even use it at night because it would wake people up! It would discourage me from brushing because it was so annoying! After knowing how quiet the Plus was I knew for sure I liked it better. Both models have the same brushing power (31,000 brush strokes per second).  Save yourself the $30 + and stick with the Sonicare Flexcare Plus! (Make sure you get the newer version with the backlit display!) You can use the better brush heads like DiamondClean or InterCare on the Plus model so you get the best clean possible.  UPDATE 3/20/15: Philips sent me a replacement UV sanitizer / charger. I just got it today and it still makes a noise but not as bad as the first did. The first one was a high pitch noise this one is still there but it&#x27;s not as loud. I wish they would improve these and make sure they function completely quiet! I guess I&#x27;ll just keepthis one, still annoyed that it makes noise. Since I keep it in my room that means I&#x27;ll have to unplug it all the time because it&#x27;s annoying...</li>
    <li> I bought these for my adult kids as I just love mine.  They are thrilled and like me say their teeth have never felt cleaner and whiter!</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush with respect to cleaning teeth and keeping gums healthy.  I like this much better then Braun models.  There are several operating modes and each is useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is not manufactured to last, with a poorly designed seal at the top.  After about a year of daily use  the power button fails and examination of the interior reveals toothpaste and corrosion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement brushes are ridiculously expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I still like this toothbrush more than any other, but be forewarned that it is built to fail.</li>
    <li> This is our 3rd. Sonic care and it is the best one yet. Previous versions lasted over 7 years or better. This newest one is the best one yet. Every brushing leave you feeling like you just had a teeth cleaning from the dentist. Modern, sleek and compact. Travels well too!</li>
    <li> I moved across the country and have a new dentist and was there last week for my first cleaning with my new Hygienist when she highly recommended Sonicare. Her advice was that there wasn&#x27;t a need to buy one of the more expensive models as the underlying brush action is pretty much the same for all of them. The more advanced models just have more features (speeds/timers etc) and things that are included for convenience, so if none of those interest me, a basic model would still be a great investment. Of course, I like convenience and am perfectly willing to invest in my oral care, so I ordered up the Flexcare+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past year or so I&#x27;ve been using one of those other commercial electric toothbrushes that supposedly has a \\&quot;Sonic\\&quot; action, so I figured it would be close to what I had, but better. Man, was I ever wrong... the Sonicare is a completely different experience, but in a very good way. This thing is absolutely incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m disappointed about is that my old Hygienist never mentioned it to me.</li>
    <li> The product shipped from a company called K USA - I found out that meant Korea, USA.  The product shipped air freight from Korea and arrived in 3 days - I was impressed.  When I opened it, there were plug adapters in the package.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine why those were there until I opened the package and found out it is a Korean model toothbrush with Korean plugs - what they sent were adapters to use in US plugs.  Needless to say the product is being returned.  I think Amazon should do a better job vetting their suppliers to make sure we can get a product that is made for use in the USA.</li>
    <li> One would think that with the price point for this product that it would 1) work for a long time and 2) that barring #1, Philips would support the product.  Wrong.  Mine broke after one year, and they refused to replace it, based on the age of the item, rather than the date of purchase.  Worse, the representative to whom I spoke was downright nasty, which left me with a terrible taste in my mouth.  Pun intended.  Too bad, I liked the product, but now despise the company.</li>
    <li> Love all the features and speeds it offers!  My dentist has this toothbrush in his office. I always have great visits at the dentist.  They always tell me how little plaque I have on my teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Works great. does a excellent job at cleaning. The attached UV sanitizer you can do without.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product with many different settings</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is absolutely incredible! The initial investment is high when thought of as JUST a \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; but a sonicare is SO much more. This little device will keep your kids teeth so much cleaner, your dental bills will decrease if they use this. This model also has UV lighting compartment that will kill any nasty bacteria that a good rinse missed....I thought it sounded like overkill but it came as a package. You will not be disappointed that you bought it; trust me.</li>
    <li> I have not been using an electric toothbrush to begin with, so the switch from my basic manual toothbrush to this was drastic for my teeth and I saw the differences quickly. I had an issue with buildup inbetween my teeth (which is probably from not flossing enough...) but this definitely helped! It is a very expensive toothbrush though so I don&#x27;t know if the latest edition is actually worth it because my boyfriend uses the older edition (whom I learned about it from) and I&#x27;ve used his with a different head and it may be worth to pay $60 less to get the different version! The actual plus I like with this one is the sanitizer (which you can look into buying separately if that&#x27;s what you want)</li>
    <li> I ordered this on amazon and the first unit the toothbrush worked but the UV light did not.  I sent it back to Amazon and they immediately sent me a new one.  I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for 3 weeks and the new unit works great - both chargers, brush, UV light - everything is working.  I had used my parents old sonicare toothbrush for one summer 7 years ago.  For the past 7 years I was using an Oral B electric brush.  My Oral B died and I wanted to get back to Sonicare because even the Oral B didn&#x27;t compare to the old Sonicare I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new Sonicare is amazing and so much better than either of the 2 electric tooth brushes I&#x27;ve used previously.  Everytime I use the Flexcare Plus my teeth literally feel like I just got out of the dentist.  I love the quadpacer and personally I use the gum care so I can brush slightly longer than 2 minutes.  I have sensitive teeth so I was nervous about using this.  I use it with sensodyne or crest sensitivity and I haven&#x27;t had any problems and I&#x27;ve been using it 3 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes:  Keep in mind you can still use the diamond clean brush heads with this.  The travel case is also very nice and useful (my Oral B never had one).  It&#x27;s small enough to fit in my kit bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes this toothrbush is expensive but for the quality, performance, and accessories I would reccomend this toothbrush to anyone.  Especially if you like to glide your tounge over your teeth after the dentist - after brushing with the toothbrush it feels identical to that feeling.</li>
    <li> My sonicare stopped working about 1 year into the 2.5 year warranty.  I think the battery died.  Sonicare refused to honor the warranty even though I registered the product.  The best they would offer was a 15% off coupon to their store.  I won&#x27;t be buying another Sonicare.</li>
    <li> I have had cheaper Sonicare toothbrushes for about five years and my second one for two and a half years. It had become loose so I upgraded to this one with the sanitizer and timer. WOW! I can&#x27;t believe the difference in the feel of my teeth. I LOVE IT!!! I can&#x27;t recommend it more. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth now (dorky, I know). Also, I realize I was not brushing near long enough before. I just brush each quadrant until the beep and stop when it turns off. Effortless brushing.</li>
    <li> My Dentist recommended this tooth brush and I can honestly say my teeth feel a lot cleaner. I would recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> We replace our Sonicare about once every year (it&#x27;s a hygiene thing).  This new model is even better than its predecessor.  It is easier to use and includes a UV disinfectant system for the brush heads.</li>
    <li> This is a very flawed toothbrush design. I had the old version which worked for several years, but despite all the added bells and whistles this one performs the same, namely it vibrates up and down to clean your teeth. The problems start with the choice of the soft rubber cover which soon wears away and breaks off in chunks where it comes in contact with the recharging base. Also the rubber gets dirty with use, but one cannot clean it. So it looks grubby, not very desirable in a toothbrush.    I left the number one flaw for last, and that is that the darn thing just stops working. I paid a lot of money, and so will you, for a soon to be manual tooth brush that the dentist hands out for free. There are many other reviews saying the same thing. The smart thing to do is to read the reviews and pay heed to what us thoughtful citizens are telling you. Save your hard earned money. This toothbrush is a waste of it. Amazon should stop selling it.    Update, even though it&#x27;s well past the warrantee period amazon has gracious agreed to replace the toothbrush with a new one. This is an example of why it&#x27;s always a good idea to purchase thru amazon. They stand behind their products. I really appreciate it.</li>
    <li> Bought this one to put in my vacation house.  Have had one at home for many years, since the quad-pacer first came out.  It is still going strong, by the way.  Does a fine job, so says my hygienist.  Love the idea that the brushes are kept in a closed compartment and can be zapped to keep the germs at bay.</li>
    <li> Just what the dentist ordered.</li>
    <li> We purchased on the advice of our dentist. We have been impressed. Teeth are cleaner and whiter since we started using.</li>
    <li> I used my original Sonicare toothbrush, HX6030, for probably over 5 years. It became necessary to replace it, &amp; I ordered the one above, since the important features seemed to be identical. When my order arrived, it was not in the original packaging &amp; the toothbrush was a different model with fewer functions. It did not even match the paperwork/ owners manual provided. I felt I had no choice but to return for credit, since I did not get what I ordered &amp; paid for.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush works as expected.  It does a very thorough job of cleaning teeth.  I use the gum health setting and it seems that by gums have grown back a bit from where they had receded to.  I recommend this toothbrush to anyone who is looking for an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative that I have found is that I can hear a high pitched noise coming from the base.  It isn&#x27;t super loud but is present.</li>
    <li> Received my new sonicare yesterday and all i can say is WOW.  this thing is amazzzziiinnngggg.  The different modes you can pick are awesome, the sanitizer that ensures a clean head everytime you brush...it explains to brush in four quadrants of your mouth, one quadrant at a time and notifies you when to switch quadrants.  Brushed last night and this morning with it and my teeth and gums feel better than they have in a long time.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!</li>
    <li> Back in 2008, I took the leap from a craptastic Oral B electric toothbrush to a high quality one from Philips.  At that time, I had the HX6932, or simply the regular Flexcare.  That toothbrush was a workhorse, and lasted 4.5 years, before it came to its early demise.  The battery life was still great, thanks to careful discharges and maintenance on my part, but the vibrating motor had disconnected from the rod.  Hence, my purchase of the Flexcare Plus (HX6792) and this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I&#x27;m late to the party, seeing how there are hundreds of review on this, but I have to say, for just a few dollars more than the regular Flexcare, I am thoroughly enjoying this toothbrush.  For starters, it is quieter than the lower Flexcare.  And I like how the mode texts disappear when not in use, giving a cleaner look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the biggest compliments I have for the Flexcare Plus is the sanitizer.  Because my previous Flexcare had been in daily service for 4.5 years, that sanitizer&#x27;s door would get \\&quot;jammed\\&quot; once in a while, due to the push button mechanical design.  What I see here with the Flexcare Plus sanitizer is that the door latch is now magnetic, with no mechanical parts to get stuck.  That is a big plus, given the sanitizer lives in a moist and humid environment that is the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can clearly see improvements made on the Flexcare Plus over the previous generation Flexcare.  This is why I didn&#x27;t mind spending more money on this, when cleaning wise, they both performed the same.  Kudos to Philips, and 5 stars for their Sense and Simplicity!</li>
    <li> Owned two previous versions of Sonicare brushes.  This is superior in ergonomic design, installation/removal of brushes and in battery life.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had.  I use it with the LG (yes, LG) bamboo salt toothpaste and my mouth health has never been better.  I alternate between gum care and clean cycles.  The results are fantastic.</li>
    <li> Replaced my old Sonicare Elite due to crud buildup in the handle; it was several years old and weekly Q-tips in rubbing alcohol were no longer helping. Had bought the Elite when I went to grad school and had to give up my dental coverage. ( I honestly think it helped me avoid dental work during that time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush gives you that smooth-tooth feeling, along with happy gums that you have when you get back from the dentist every time you use it.  And the timer makes sure you&#x27;re brushing for at least as long as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to keep clean. Makes you smile like a goob after you brush your teeth. :)</li>
    <li> It will definitely take some getting used to, but this toothbrush revolutionizes how you clean your teeth.  I really like it!</li>
    <li> Great dentist recommended brushing set at a competitive price!!  Most economical package I could find for this gum saving set!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this overpriced short lived tooth brush. My third one just died, each lasting under a year. Philips does not stand behind their product. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is fantastic. I just got it yesterday and I&#x27;m very happy with my investment. I know it seems ridiculous to spend so much on a toothbrush, but the way my mouth feels is worth every penny. My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush after she noticed that my gums were beginning to recede from brushing too hard and fast. This was a good solution, because the vibrations do the work for you, so you only need to hold it close to the gum line. The timer is also very helpful, because it stops for a brief second to let you know to move to the next section of your mouth. I&#x27;m forced to slow down and be gentler, which is exactly what my dentist wanted me to do. I saved a lot of money going through Amazon instead of ordering through my dentist&#x27;s office, but I&#x27;m sure she won&#x27;t mind when she sees how nice my teeth look at my next appointment!</li>
    <li> Bought this in 2011 and been very satisfied with it. The brushing seems better than the rotary brush I had earlier and a variety of brush heads are available. I prefer the &#x27;compact&#x27; ones as they seem to do a more thorough job than the standard sized brush heads. Also, like the travel charger and the box that comes with it. Real convenient if you need to hope onto a flight somewhere. The battery life is decent and lasts over a week. I&#x27;d say you cant go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few electric toothbrushes, and this has been my favorite of them all. I like that it came with a smaller brush, which is exactly what I needed, along with the standard brush. I use the travel charger since I have a small bathroom right now, but it&#x27;s nice that I have the option of a bigger one or smaller one without paying extra.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m back to my regular toothbrush just for a week or so.  Be very careful....I let the brush touch my lower lip and it caused a &amp;#34;rug burn&amp;#34; which is taking a long time to heal and is painful.  Just be careful not to touch your lips.  I think this toothbrush will be fine though, I just need time to learn.</li>
    <li> Love that this offers a way to clean my brush head.  I worry about germs on my toothbrush and this allows me to clean after each use.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Love that there is an automatic timer, so the two minutes that is recommended to brush your teeth is accurate. Love that at 30 second intervals there is a warning so that you know to move to the next cleaning section, as in top front and back, bottom front and back. To extend the two minutes you only have to put it on gum care so there is the extra time to like do your tongue, after the two minute mark. The bad thing though is if you have any interruptions during the two minutes of brushing, you would have to either ignore the interruption, or start from the beginning again. Love this electric toothbrush, my teeth has never felt cleaner after a brush.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush works as I would expect.  I do like the different settings but the reason I did not rate it a 4 or 5 is the sanitizer feature.&lt;br /&gt;After about 2 months the &#x27;one touch&#x27; stopped working.  I found I could get the sanitizer to work most of the time by moving my finger around on the button, or holding it at different angles and/or holding my mouth right.  Finally it quit working entirely.  I looked for a replacement bulb, but since I could not find a number in the Phillips literature or website I had to take my best guess.  I choose the one that most looked like the one in the unit and was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;While waiting for the bulb I followed the instructions for cleaning the unit and when I plugged it back in it worked.  For about a week.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently the bulb loosens in the holder from just minimal movement of the charger.  I now have to take it apart about once a week and wiggle the bulb.  If I had it to do over I would not select the sanitizer feature.</li>
    <li> So far, so good! It tickles a bit but my teeth feel soooo clean and gums feel great too!</li>
    <li> Had one of these puppies for 3 years. It was great until it started randomly turning on. I called customer support with receipt in hand and they said it was due to a faulty seal on the bottom which leaked water into the base and broke it. Because it was past the warranty, the DID NOT SUPPORT THE PRODUCT and gave me a whopping 15% discount from their online store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No thanks Philips. Recall your product if it is faulty. Support it if there is a known issue. I will not be purchasing any more Philips products based on their absolute lack of customer service and product backing.</li>
    <li> I bought ours from Bed-Bath-Beyond and it stopped working almost to the day - 9 months. I just switched it on and the metal vibration seemed loose. Thank fully BBB also were happy to take it back and replace it with an upgrade. We also could have used our warranty insurance through our credit card (citibank). So in a negative experience there was a positive one!</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare!  And so does my dentist!  They barely need to clean my teeth!</li>
    <li> I replaced an older Sonicare toothbrush with this one.  It works great but that&#x27;s The problem it works no better than the one it replaced when that one was new.  However, the old one was the standard model that cost $80.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend paying extra for this model.  Go with the standard model and spend the savings on something else.</li>
