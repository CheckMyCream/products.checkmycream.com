      <li>I have some problems with my skin and finding a foundation that will cover the scars and yet look as natural as possible is important to me.</li>

      <li>At 38 years old</li>

    <li> I usually buy the Fit Me Foundation in this color.  I bought this stick because it was the only foundation in stock in #355.  It is obviously oil free and sheer.  I have combination skin, so this matte effect is awesome on my nose and chin area.  I added some argan oil to the areas of my face that I thought looked dry, and was pleased with the result.  This might be a good combo with your regular foundation for specific areas that you want matte, because it makes you matte and stays.  However,  I had to put on WAY more than I expected to get the coverage I wanted.  My skin requires full coverage foundation, so I added what it took.  My face was a bit dry due to the weather and it was a little hilarious how the makeup wouldn&#x27;t move around on my face. But my skin looked even-toned afterwards, and not cakey.  I would buy this again. I may end up using it just in my t-zone along with the regular foundation, or just continue to mix with oil.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have already purchased two more!</li>
    <li> I love it. Thank you so much</li>
    <li> I use this to contour my face.</li>
    <li> Great price online and the item arrived within a reasonable amount of time.  This is a really light feeling foundation and it doesn&#x27;t make me look like my makeup is caked on.  I enjoy using this product and it&#x27;s neat enough to use on the go.</li>
    <li> I have some problems with my skin and finding a foundation that will cover the scars and yet look as natural as possible is important to me. When I wear this product, not only does it keep my face from becoming oily, my friends and family don&#x27;t even realize I have on makeup, they want to know what I used to clear up the scarring. My only problem is that they do not have colors for brown skin that is darker than mine. Please make some soon!!!</li>
    <li> Okay so I hate my skin but this stuff helps me out a lot. At first I thought the color wasn&#x27;t good for me, but I was wrong. I just had to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Great for contouring if you have an olive complexion. Creamy and blends easily.</li>
    <li> used 355 coconut previously. this is a much beter match. thanks maybelline for creating a better match! prefer powders though</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very creamy texture foundation. I wear I everyday with the concealer and powder that matches. It does need the powder it gets a bit shiney</li>
    <li> I use this makeup daily…Doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin or leave that shiny look to your face after wearing it for hours. Very easy to apply and blends in beautifully with your own skin tone.</li>
    <li> This makeup goes on flawlessly and the coverage is amazing!  Blends beautifully and doesn&#x27;t cake up or dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought it because a Makeup artist recommended it on a Professional makeup Perfecting Class and she was right. It doesn´t shine or crease and it blends perfect with foundation</li>
    <li> At 38 years old im still a novice at applying makeup as I really only wear it when on special occasions. This foundation stick is literally the makeup for dummies! It goes on smooth and blends very easily and has a natural finish. After wearing it one time I have been hooked ever since. My coworkers knew that I was wearing makeup but said it looks very natural- Everything is just smooth and clear. Would highly recommend the stick over the liquid for the ease. Leave the liquid to the pro&#x27;s. Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I will review this item giving information on reasons why I wanted this item, delivery time, pros and cons, and whether I would recommend this to a friend and why/not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons why I wanted this item:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this because I needed a creamy product for countouring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery time&lt;br /&gt;It arrived really fast (less than 48 hours but please consider I have an Amazon Prime membership)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros and cons&lt;br /&gt;It is really pigmented and creamy. It is super easy to blend. I wanted a super creamy foundation that I could use to countour my face in the summer. The color is really dark but it&#x27;s just what I needed. Because the foundation comes in a stick, it is super easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;It fades away after a few hours. Nothing major, you either re-apply if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend because it&#x27;s a great quality product and very affordable.</li>
    <li> its far too orange, as I wanted to use it for contouring. Oh well.</li>
