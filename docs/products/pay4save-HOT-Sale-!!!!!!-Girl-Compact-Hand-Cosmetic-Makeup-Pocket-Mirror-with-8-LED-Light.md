      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>just enough light to use discreetly in public..</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t actually see what I&#x27;m doing in the mirror when they are on, but it&#x27;s better to have some illumination when it&#x27;s dark or the power is out...</li>
      <li>A little big for my purse but still love it and allows me to see in the night.</li>
      <li>I would send it back but it would be to much of a hassle</li>
      <li>Love the idea but the wiring for the battery sucks.</li>
      <li>I will bring this on trips to compensate for dimly lit motel bathrooms.</li>
      <li>The only slight problem is that the on/off button turns &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; easily.</li>
      <li>so excuse me for adoring me ...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If ur looking for a mirror to keep in ur purse this is it! looks as pictured I love it! lights up nice &amp; clear for those nights out.</li>
    <li> This is a great lighted mirror.  I can see blemishes on my face clearly while looking in the non-lighted side with the reflected light from the adjacent mirror&#x27;s LEDs.  I will bring this on trips to compensate for dimly lit motel bathrooms.</li>
    <li> Thin enough to fit in purse.  Great carry everywhere mirror for quick fixes!</li>
    <li> I was please. But one of my mirrors fell out when I open it. I think the glue was dried out. But over all ok.</li>
    <li> Love this compact...just enough light to use discreetly in public.. Love the size, just right for my purse..prompt delivery. Thanks</li>
    <li> Have not got this yet but can&#x27;t wat to put it in my prosper and look good and fill good...</li>
    <li> Nice my it is good for gift</li>
    <li> Made very cheaply lights worked for about 3-4 uses then broke</li>
    <li> I rated the way I dod because I was excited to give this as a gift and when I recieved the package everything seemed ok but when I opened the package inside and opened the compact mirror the bottom one was cracked. I would send it back but it would be to much of a hassle so I jus took the bottom mirror out.</li>
    <li> Received this and it is just what I thought it would be. The only slight problem is that the on/off button turns &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; easily. So it arrived &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; and there have been a few times I have found it in my make-up bag turned on as well. Assume I will replace batteries more often.</li>
    <li> Amazing mirror, I love the built in light</li>
    <li> Great compact. Great size. I haven&#x27;t used the light yet but I&#x27;m pretty confident it&#x27;ll work fine since it&#x27;s pretty seamless to use.</li>
    <li> Seems to close using magnets, but, unless you have longer fingernails, it may be somewhat difficult to open, as there isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;lip&amp;#34; to use for leverage. The LED lights are bright but distracting. I can&#x27;t actually see what I&#x27;m doing in the mirror when they are on, but it&#x27;s better to have some illumination when it&#x27;s dark or the power is out...than none at all. Power button for the LEDs is on the side of the hinge - they do not come on as soon as the mirror is open. No big deal, just informin&#x27;.</li>
    <li> well I didn&#x27;t know those was little harts for lights imagine my surprise .... it made a nice gift for my girl but I was looking for something for me .... yea yea yea im a guy buy im handsome so excuse me for adoring me ... hmph</li>
    <li> Feel Like a star... A little big for my purse but still love it and allows me to see in the night.</li>
    <li> OMG !!! The light did not work thats what I really like about the mirror and no Return slip either . Very Disappointed and upset.</li>
    <li> This is a great light-up purse mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a great little mirror that&#x27;s lighted (battery powered - batteries included).  Slim and can fit in most purses regardless of size.  I would definitely recommend and price was hard to beat. Definitely a winner.</li>
    <li> The mirror came off of the base it is only held together by double sided tape. I used some E6000 to glue it together and works fine only other problem is The batteries don&#x27;t last long in it, so carry extras with you</li>
    <li> At first I really liked it but a week later the battery died and the mirror came off. I changed the battery but it still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> low grade quality;  the LEDs are very bright though.</li>
    <li> This mirror works great and I love the LED light accent. I would buy more of this and give as gifts.</li>
    <li> Very compact and VERY strong lights!  The price was amazing!!!  Love this mirror!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time thinking the lighting will take you into 2-3 years. The light dies in. 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;WASTE OF MONEY.. Unless you need a large makeup mirror</li>
    <li> worked fine for the first week... then the light dimmed so much it was hardly worth turning on... i will be replacing it with a more local and quality one here in the usa</li>
    <li> I ordered two one was broken email vendor vendor sent out replacement next day. I and daughter in law love love mirror. Giving it 4 stars because replacing battery appears impossible without damage to unit. Hope it has good batteries.</li>
    <li> Lights worked for about a week, very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Love the idea but the wiring for the battery sucks. Every time I fold the mirror a certain way the light turns off. I had my boyfirend adjust the wire in the battery and now the connections just fine. its very fragile so I keep it at home but I&#x27;m overall happy with it.</li>
