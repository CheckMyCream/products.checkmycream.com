      <li>Stylish.</li>
      <li>I love these bracelets.</li>
      <li>Mostly mosquitoes.</li>
      <li>They are stylish AND functional.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
      <li>These are great mosquito bracelets and really do work.</li>
      <li>But overall it is a wonderful product and I will tell my friends and family about it.</li>
      <li>They look like a braided paracord type bracelet which is really nice because they fit an out doors type theme.</li>
      <li>Works most times but not all the time</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall they were great for this weekend, and I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>It is strong enough to keep the mosquitos away from you which is perfect.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t have too strong of a scent, so you don&#x27;t walk around smelling like a bug candle all night.&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
      <li>I really wanted this item to work, it seemed too good to be true.</li>
      <li>the basically free package of 10</li>
      <li>So, yeah, i am happy, because I got double the amount I thought I was getting.</li>
      <li>I live in a pretty buggy area and am very allergic to mosquito bites so these have been an awesome addition to my summer.</li>
      <li>The smell is strong, but not unpleasant.  </li>
      <li>I have small-ish wrists and they fit great at the tightest available option and tied a little looser, fit great on my husband&#x27;s larger wrists.</li>
      <li>Love these when I opened them..smells great and all natural so can be use so easy on my little grand daughter..great product..</li>
      <li>and I liked that they are natural and DEET free.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>These are really quite stylish....</li>
      <li>Overall the product did a wonderful job with the initial trial period.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re cuter, more stylish than the rubber/plastic similarly advertised bracelets.</li>
      <li>My daughter normally gets attacked by mosquitos, but with this she was able to go to Lake Tahoe and partake in outdoor sports for a week and not get bitten.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had them land almost on a freshly opened band.</li>
      <li>It’s a little big for my son’s wrist but fits perfectly for an anklet for a child.</li>
      <li>I am also a huge fan of the fact that they are DEET free, which is crucial with a baby.</li>
      <li>just leave it on for your whole trip!</li>
      <li>If my stomach finally feels better...</li>
      <li>They fit everyone in my family from my 2 yr old to my husband.</li>
      <li>but in the semi rural areas of Thailand and Laos wearing them was definitely better than not.</li>
      <li>These bracelets came in super handy, and not only did they repel the mosquitoes, but they helped repel other bugs as well!&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to put on, although if you can&#x27;t tie with just one hand, you may need help having someone tie it for you.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>I bought a couple of other kinds and while these ones weren&#x27;t as strong scented or effective as the ugly rubbery ones, they were a lot more discreet fashion wise.</li>
      <li>They seem pretty well made and are very adjustable.</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that the scent is pretty strong, but thats the whole point in keeping bugs away.</li>
      <li>If that were the only issue, it would be fine.  </li>
      <li>These worked very well for me.</li>
      <li>They also have enough length that it would easily fit around your ankle too.</li>
      <li>I really like these mosquito bracelets.</li>
      <li>I would definitely say these were worth the price!</li>
      <li>is always teeming with mosquitos and my son and I are considered a particular delicacy among the mosquitos.  </li>
      <li>The white and pink colours are kind of obnoxious though.</li>
      <li>I still got many bites while wearing it, even just a few inches away.</li>
      <li>simply don&#x27;t work, first day wearing it on the lawn,</li>
      <li>had ball tournaments all weekend, and in the heat, we were all getting eaten alive by bugs!</li>
      <li>Really not sure if it&#x27;s connected to the band (which by the way I wore on my ankle...very cute).</li>
      <li>Only up to a two star rating because it may reduce mosquitoes butting but certainly doesn&#x27;t stop all of them.</li>
      <li>Worked very well in back yard while on my hammock.</li>
      <li>We went on a walk through a local park area that is pesticide free and usually teeming with mosquitos, especially after it rains (and it rained the night before).</li>
      <li>I hate applying chemicals to my family and this is a great all natural alternative.</li>
      <li>two mosquitos bit me right next to the bracelet , wasted my money .</li>
      <li>I am still testing to see if they last as long as it says, so far 40 hours and still working.</li>

<li> They don&#x27;t have a really strong odor of repellent but a slight odor you can detect.</li>
<li> I saw a lot of positive reviews, so maybe I just got a bad batch.</li>
<li> If I was feeling self conscious about looking like a nerd I would want these over the ugly rubber bands.</li>
<li> Even had a few days so bad</li>
<li> And unfortunately it was.  </li>
<li> At least they aren&#x27;t terrible to look at...</li>
<li> Do not work was using in Jamiacia and mosquito repellent was useless</li>
<li> I was disappointed that they didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
<li> and you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing a mosquito repellent device at all!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> They look nice. Stylish. It’s a little big for my son’s wrist but fits perfectly for an anklet for a child. They are simple to put on. We went on a walk through a local park area that is pesticide free and usually teeming with mosquitos, especially after it rains (and it rained the night before). Mosquitos approached us. I was bit a few times. It does not entirely repel the mosquitos but they did a lot considering the area is always teeming with mosquitos and my son and I are considered a particular delicacy among the mosquitos.  Overall the product did a wonderful job with the initial trial period. They last for 200 hours, so that’s a little over 8 days. They are water resistant (children and water puddles). And they smell nice too. I would give them a 4 out of 5, since the mosquitos still came around. But overall it is a wonderful product and I will tell my friends and family about it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for us. We had a picnic on the lawn and these bracelets didn&#x27;t keep us from getting bitten. We ended up having to buy repellant from the store, which worked.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t even begin to repel Mosquitos.</li>
    <li> Got these a couple of days ago and like them already! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that the scent is pretty strong, but thats the whole point in keeping bugs away. I live in a pretty buggy area and am very allergic to mosquito bites so these have been an awesome addition to my summer. They seem pretty well made and are very adjustable. I have small-ish wrists and they fit great at the tightest available option and tied a little looser, fit great on my husband&#x27;s larger wrists. They also have enough length that it would easily fit around your ankle too. We went for a walk with our baby around a heavily wooded lake area near us and each wore one. I noticed fewer bites on myself and my husband had only 1. I feel like there are no guaranteed 100% options to keep bugs away in areas like that so I am happy with the way they work. I am also a huge fan of the fact that they are DEET free, which is crucial with a baby. I would definitely buy them again!</li>
    <li> Work great and are easy to use with kids</li>
    <li> It does not help at all</li>
    <li> After wearing theses bracelets for three days, the mosquitoes started biting me again.  It says you wear them up to 15 days, but it doesn&#x27;t work up to 15 days.</li>
    <li> This work great on myself and my son. My mom even really liked these and she works outside everyday and does a lot of yard worknon the weekend.I would definitely recommend this to a friend  (: and have already told my family about it</li>
    <li> Love this idea and can&#x27;t wait to try it!!</li>
    <li> I do feel they work quite well but have noticed an upset stomach ever since I started wearing one. Even had a few days so bad I missed work. Really not sure if it&#x27;s connected to the band (which by the way I wore on my ankle...very cute). Today I took it off and will try the experiment. If my stomach finally feels better...I will give it a rest and then try it again later.</li>
    <li> I have not used these yet, so if we come back from a few days of hiking and they do not work, I will update this.  I bought these from the seller Art Naturals.  I got 5 seperate 2 packs.  So, yeah, i am happy, because I got double the amount I thought I was getting. They also came earlier than expected. Colors not exactly as listed, I got 2 white, two brown, one gold, but I am not fussed about color, as long as they work.</li>
    <li> Still got a few bites</li>
    <li> These are great mosquito bracelets and really do work. Not only do they work well they are quiet fashionable as well. They are easy to slip on and off your wrists and they look great. They look like a braided paracord type bracelet which is really nice because they fit an out doors type theme. They don&#x27;t have a really strong odor of repellent but a slight odor you can detect. It is strong enough to keep the mosquitos away from you which is perfect. I received this product to share my honest thoughts and opinions about it.</li>
    <li> I love these bracelets. They fit everyone in my family from my 2 yr old to my husband. The colors are nice and the quality is great for the price. I hate applying chemicals to my family and this is a great all natural alternative. I would rate this at 80% effective . Everyone in my family has their own color and each bracelet lasts for days. Great product! I did receive this product at a promotional discount for the exchange of my honest unbias review</li>
    <li> Do not work was using in Jamiacia and mosquito repellent was useless</li>
    <li> Worked well to keep the bugs away</li>
    <li> My daughter normally gets attacked by mosquitos, but with this she was able to go to Lake Tahoe and partake in outdoor sports for a week and not get bitten.</li>
    <li> Works most times but not all the time</li>
    <li> They simply do not work. At all.</li>
    <li> The bracelets did pretty well, not sure fire but in the semi rural areas of Thailand and Laos wearing them was definitely better than not. Ended up wearing more than one (ankle + wrist) for better coverage. I bought a couple of other kinds and while these ones weren&#x27;t as strong scented or effective as the ugly rubbery ones, they were a lot more discreet fashion wise. If I was feeling self conscious about looking like a nerd I would want these over the ugly rubber bands. Got them wet and the scent definitely wore off after that so would try to keep dry if possible. I can&#x27;t remember how long the package said they should last for but I would guess around 5-7 days, with effectiveness tapering off the last few days of course. Definitely nice not to have to worry about constantly sweating off and reapplying mosquito repellent and I liked that they are natural and DEET free.&lt;br /&gt;For the basically free package of 10 I would definitely say these were worth the price! The white and pink colours are kind of obnoxious though.</li>
    <li> On day 3, there was a mosquito on my knee while I had the bracelet on my ankle only inches away...</li>
    <li> Only up to a two star rating because it may reduce mosquitoes butting but certainly doesn&#x27;t stop all of them. I&#x27;ve had them land almost on a freshly opened band.</li>
    <li> Love these when I opened them..smells great and all natural so can be use so easy on my little grand daughter..great product..</li>
    <li> These worked very well for me. The scent was pleasant. I recommend these.</li>
    <li> Worked very well in back yard while on my hammock. No mosquito bites. Will update after camping. Thank you for the discount to review product.</li>
    <li> I really like these mosquito bracelets. They are stylish AND functional.&lt;br /&gt;We had ball tournaments all weekend, and in the heat, we were all getting eaten alive by bugs! Mostly mosquitoes. These bracelets came in super handy, and not only did they repel the mosquitoes, but they helped repel other bugs as well!&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to put on, although if you can&#x27;t tie with just one hand, you may need help having someone tie it for you.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t have too strong of a scent, so you don&#x27;t walk around smelling like a bug candle all night.&lt;br /&gt;There are multiple colors, so if you have kids that fight over things, that will help LOL&lt;br /&gt;Overall they were great for this weekend, and I highly recommend them. I will be keeping some on hand at all times!&lt;br /&gt;I received these at a discount for the purpose of an honest review. My opinion is my own and is not influenced in any way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with these mosquito repellent bracelets! They are individually wrapped in plastic packaging. I received 5 gender-neutral colors...which is great because I have 2 sons and a daughter. These are really quite stylish....and you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing a mosquito repellent device at all! The smell is not overpowering either. I can say that these do indeed work -- we wore these in our yard over the weekend and noticed no mosquito bites. These would be ideal for camping, etc....just leave it on for your whole trip! They&#x27;re a great fit for children or adults because they tie on....you can even wear them around your ankle!! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
    <li> Does not work well at all. I still got many bites while wearing it, even just a few inches away. At least they aren&#x27;t terrible to look at...</li>
    <li> simply don&#x27;t work, first day wearing it on the lawn,two mosquitos bit me right next to the bracelet , wasted my money .</li>
    <li> These actually work, I do like the braided look.  I am still testing to see if they last as long as it says, so far 40 hours and still working.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this item to work, it seemed too good to be true. And unfortunately it was.  These bracelets did not repel any mosquitoes during my family&#x27;s use.  We had mosquitoes landing on us within minutes of being outside while wearing these bracelets.  I have tried other types of these bracelets, they didn&#x27;t&#x27; work either, but I was hopeful for these.  They&#x27;re cuter, more stylish than the rubber/plastic similarly advertised bracelets. I was disappointed that they didn&#x27;t work.  The smell is strong, but not unpleasant.  If that were the only issue, it would be fine.  But they simply did not work as promised.  I saw a lot of positive reviews, so maybe I just got a bad batch.</li>
