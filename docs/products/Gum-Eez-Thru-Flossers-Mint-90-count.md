      <li>Great price</li>
      <li>I have got these Gum brand flossers many times, and they are the best.</li>
      <li>This product is good but not as good as the ones I purchased in the store.</li>
      <li>Best flossers out there and a very decent price.  </li>
      <li>Very strong floss line and the mint taste is nice.</li>
      <li>These are strong and making flossing a breeze!</li>
      <li>These are nice and taut and make flossing easy.</li>
      <li>Love these flossers.</li>
      <li>and I love the family pack value</li>
      <li>These are my favorite flossers of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>We love these.  </li>
      <li>So I went online to get more.</li>
      <li>easy to use, ordered another pack.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and discard.</li>
      <li>Not as strong.</li>
      <li>Hands down the best flowers on the market.</li>
      <li>useful and strong strings!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried over a dozen brands of flossers and consistently come back to these as the best.</li>
      <li>and they just fit well in my fingers.  </li>
      <li>I purchased a small pack in the store and they were the best of this type.</li>
      <li>Accurate order, shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>My teeth are very close together causing most flossers to break halfway through the job.</li>
      <li>While they&#x27;re all superior to plain old floss wrapped around your fingers, these are by far the best flossers.</li>
      <li>I have ordered many flossers many different brands.</li>
      <li>Very durable and easy to hold.</li>
      <li>The string rarely shreds or breaks and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to rip through my gums.</li>
      <li>The floss is strong and won&#x27;t shred like most other products.</li>
      <li>Very wasteful and not very cost effective.  </li>
      <li>This by far is the best product - especially for folks who have tight spaces between their teeth.</li>
      <li>Actually received PROFESSIONAL CLEAN Flossers but, couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between the two(Eez-Thru or Prefessional Clean).</li>
      <li>I really like the hint of mint</li>
      <li>They slide easily between your teeth and unlike some brands the floss doesn&#x27;t break after a few teeth.  </li>
      <li>Never liked flossing but do now every day with those easy flossers ... and so much cleaner than the wrap around your finger and cut your blood circulation flossing string ....</li>
      <li>Makes flossing an option for busy people</li>
      <li>Price was reasonable and amount actually added up to equal amount if ordering the 150pk.(3).</li>
      <li>the handle is pretty much pointless; however, the narrow floss is so strong that it&#x27;s the only flosser I have found that doesn&#x27;t break when flossing my extremely tight teeth.</li>

<li> What I mean is that the other ones would floss no problem, but this one had a hard time fitting between some teeth</li>
<li> Have tried other brands but always come back to these.</li>
<li> The result in both cases is that the floss first becomes loose, then becomes very hard to use.</li>
<li> The only down side to the Gum flossers is the redesigned handle.  </li>
<li> It may not seem like a complicated product, but considering the pressure put on both the floss and the handle while flossing, you quickly come to appreciate how well-designed and -made</li>
<li> It seems so many flossers have loose floss that makes it very difficult to push down between the teeth.  </li>
<li> As in other reviews, they DO break immediately, at around 50% of bag.  </li>
<li> With other brands I have used, sometimes the plastic holder in the floss starts to bend.</li>
<li> The other brands is flimsy on the picks.</li>
<li> In other cases the floss itself might slip out of the plastic that is holding it.</li>
<li> They are stronger than other brands and do what they are supposed to.</li>
<li> And after years of using I still have not experience the floss getting stuck between my teeth like other flowers.</li>
<li> (On two occasions, when I ran out, I tried at least three other brands, and not one compared in terms of ease of use or durability.)  </li>
<li> Or at least 30 years.</li>
<li> I hate that Gum cut the handle length so much</li>
<li> It&#x27;s tough and hard to find in the stores</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using these guys for a couple weeks now and not one has broken.</li>
<li> I was tired of feeling guilty at the dentist for not flossing.</li>
<li> As someone who is obsessed with oral hygiene products I have tried almost every type of floss that is in the market.</li>

    <li> I have got these Gum brand flossers many times, and they are the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried over a dozen brands of flossers and consistently come back to these as the best. The string rarely shreds or breaks and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to rip through my gums. This is a life saver for me.</li>
    <li> I really like the hint of mint and I love the family pack value</li>
    <li> Great price for the floss</li>
    <li> Up until this recent order, I  would have posted &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34;   BUT&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;I think they are factory seconds that this company is purchasing and then selling   OR&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; this brand is now inferior!  As in other reviews, they DO break immediately, at around 50% of bag.  Very wasteful and not very cost effective.  I am going to buy a pack in the store and see how they work.</li>
    <li> I like use this , it is easier to carry</li>
    <li> I was tired of feeling guilty at the dentist for not flossing. These are strong and making flossing a breeze!</li>
    <li> useful and strong strings!</li>
    <li> Accurate order, shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> The only floss that i would use. The other brands is flimsy on the picks.</li>
    <li> We love these.  Best flossers out there and a very decent price.  We could no longer find them in the stores and what we could find were sub-par.  It seems so many flossers have loose floss that makes it very difficult to push down between the teeth.  These are nice and taut and make flossing easy.</li>
    <li> easy to use, ordered another pack. reliable seller.</li>
    <li> THE BEST FLOSS IN THE MARKET</li>
    <li> They are stronger than other brands and do what they are supposed to.</li>
    <li> Great price but this brand has different quality and the packaging all looks the same. I purchased a small pack in the store and they were the best of this type. So I went online to get more. This product is good but not as good as the ones I purchased in the store. Not as strong. What I mean is that the other ones would floss no problem, but this one had a hard time fitting between some teeth and it would starch out. Not a deal breaker I would still recommend them.</li>
    <li> Very strong floss line and the mint taste is nice. Easy to use and discard. Makes flossing an option for busy people</li>
    <li> I have ordered many flossers many different brands. These Gum brand flossers are the only ones that hold up to use. With other brands I have used, sometimes the plastic holder in the floss starts to bend. In other cases the floss itself might slip out of the plastic that is holding it. The result in both cases is that the floss first becomes loose, then becomes very hard to use. That ultimately causes the floss to fall out or break. Not so with the gum flossers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this time I have probably used about 100 Gum branded flossers. In all of that use, I think at most one has failed.</li>
    <li> Never liked flossing but do now every day with those easy flossers ... and so much cleaner than the wrap around your finger and cut your blood circulation flossing string ....</li>
    <li> These flossers work wonderfully. I&#x27;ve been using them about 2-3 weeks now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> The only down side to the Gum flossers is the redesigned handle.  I hate that Gum cut the handle length so much the handle is pretty much pointless; however, the narrow floss is so strong that it&#x27;s the only flosser I have found that doesn&#x27;t break when flossing my extremely tight teeth.</li>
    <li> My Dentist gives these out with his after cleaning kit.  I&#x27;ve tried to find them here in the Denver Metro area and no one sells them.  They are the best on the market.  They slide easily between your teeth and unlike some brands the floss doesn&#x27;t break after a few teeth.  I use the pick and the sides of the pick to scrape my teeth and they just fit well in my fingers.  Cannot recommend these highly enough.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite flossers of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s tough and hard to find in the stores so I bought enough to last a lifetime. Or at least 30 years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of flossers. While they&#x27;re all superior to plain old floss wrapped around your fingers, these are by far the best flossers. My teeth are very close together causing most flossers to break halfway through the job. I&#x27;ve been using these guys for a couple weeks now and not one has broken. I&#x27;ll definitely restock with these.</li>
    <li> Love these flossers. Have tried other brands but always come back to these. Very durable and easy to hold.</li>
    <li> As someone who is obsessed with oral hygiene products I have tried almost every type of floss that is in the market. This by far is the best product - especially for folks who have tight spaces between their teeth. The floss is strong and won&#x27;t shred like most other products. And after years of using I still have not experience the floss getting stuck between my teeth like other flowers. Hands down the best flowers on the market.</li>
    <li> These are the best flossers that I&#x27;ve found on the market.  In fact, they have proven to be the only flossers that I could use without a problem.  (On two occasions, when I ran out, I tried at least three other brands, and not one compared in terms of ease of use or durability.)  It may not seem like a complicated product, but considering the pressure put on both the floss and the handle while flossing, you quickly come to appreciate how well-designed and -made the flossers by Sunstar GUM are.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find the 150pk. for the GUM EEZ - THRU Mint Flossers so, decided to go with multiples of the 90ct.(5) Price was reasonable and amount actually added up to equal amount if ordering the 150pk.(3). Actually received PROFESSIONAL CLEAN Flossers but, couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between the two(Eez-Thru or Prefessional Clean). Great item at a great price! Would purchase again.</li>
