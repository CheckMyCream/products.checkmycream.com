<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> tis a very rare occassion to find a moisturiser that is not heavy and pore clogging... it is light and leaves my face soft supple and moisturised all day...! Love it</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this product is. My skin is much improved. It looks better and it feels better. Completely worth it and will be being again</li>
    <li> Does not have Sun protection.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best cream out there for moisturizing damaged skin! My daughter has had severe, 3rd degree burn type eczema all her life and after using the era Organics relief cream, finally cleared up. For the first time in 9 years she has perfectly clear skin! Now we use the Complete cream as a daily moisturizer and it&#x27;s wonderful! There are no perfumes/no smell, which is a GOOD thing! There are no alcohols and no chemicals! It&#x27;s so wonderful to find a company that actually cares about it&#x27;s customers and wants to help people by using all natural ingredients instead of the greed based corporations pumping chemicals and perfumes into their products. I feel so lucky to have finally found these products as my daughter is finally getting to do all the things she never got to do before bc of her eczema.</li>
    <li> For the money this product is amazing. It does feel a little greasy/maybe but work perfectly with my dryer side skin. Smells like so good.</li>
    <li> Great product!! I love it!! Cleared up my face and non irritating!! Seller is awesome and will answer any questions you have. I have been using for almost 2 weeks now and it made my skin feel amazing. Give it a try you will not be disappointed!!  Will definitely be purchaseing again!!</li>
    <li> Really saw a difference within 15 days!</li>
    <li> I am giving 5-stars because this is a great product. I have also purchased era organics face wash and dead sea mud mask. And I love all of them. My skin is clearing up and looks healthier and brighter. I&#x27;m to the point where I don&#x27;t feel like I have to hid my face with make up. Just a very light foundation is all I need.&lt;br /&gt;The only down side..this is a 2oz container..so it is very small and the 4oz is only a few dollars more..will be buying 4oz next time.</li>
    <li> I hate to be one of the few customers with a bad experience with this product but I have exactly the same issue as Angie (other 1 star review). I normally use other &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; creams after applying Retin-A for a cooling, refreshing effect and feeling but with this product I feel irritation and almost the same burning feeling as the Retin-A. I don&#x27;t understand why. Even without applying Retin-A now I felt the same burning sensation and redness specially around my nose and mouth. I will avoid using this product for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have delicate or sensitive skin at all and I don&#x27;t think this is related with any &amp;#34;blood flow&amp;#34; as they explained to Angie because what I feel is a burning sensation and I have flaking and irritation on my skin on the days after using this (without using Retin-A).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Manuka Honey: I don&#x27;t have any reactions with other Manuka Honey products I use for wounds like MediHoney (that I love to use!) so that is not the reason for my burning sensation/irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Angie I am wondering what ingredient is causing this because I used similar other products with a nice refreshing, moisturizing effect without the burning feeling as this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice light moisturizer. I always get excited when I can use an organic product on my skin because I know I am treating myself well.</li>
    <li> I have searched for a moisturizer that would replace the expensive discontinued Cle de Peau Creme Soyeuse. I have spent a ridiculous amount of money at the various cosmetic counters at Saks as well as almost every product one can find at a Walgreens, CVS and the like. All of them trashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product. Non-greasy. Light. I have very sensitive skin to where the first smear of a moisturizer can cause a rash. This did not. In fact, even after an entire day of wearing it, I did not feel as if there was a build-up of oils on my face nor was there the itchy feeling I get when my pores have become clogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works for me and I hope it works for others.</li>
    <li> Nice, mild facial moisturizer.  It goes on smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel behind.</li>
    <li> Quite possibly the best facial moisturizer I have used.  Don&#x27;t really like the smell of it but the results are what I am after.  My skin is both dry and oily, this hits a great balance of keeping my dry skin moisturized without my oily skin getting out of control.  I use this exclusively during the day and use it following a serum  on the nights i choose to use a vitamin C/HA serum.  Love it, will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Less fine lines and smoother skin. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> My daughter in law has a gluten allergy and this has really helped soothe her skin</li>
    <li> great product, great service</li>
    <li> Rich and thick, and no more alligator legs for me.</li>
    <li> I have the most sensitive and dry skin on the planet!!!!This cream is literally drenching my skin in much-needed moisture WITHOUT causing redness, irritation, or breakouts. I have searched for years for the &amp;#34;miracle product&amp;#34; and spent too many dollars to admit---but in this cream by Era Organics I do believe that I have found the cure. It is easily absorbed, unscented (unlike so many other natural/organic products) and simply glides on and m-e-l-t-s into your skin. Additionally, the customer service department is unbelievable; so willing to help, answer questions, and make suggestions. Prompt, professional and really knows the product. I urge anyone, problem skin or not, to switch from your current cream to this one,it is DEFINATELY  Worth it!</li>
    <li> This is the best facial moisturizer I have ever used. I have extremely sensitive skin and am acne prone. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and no break-outs and my skin has never felt better! It&#x27;s not greasy and it actually helps the way my makeup is applied and how it looks. I have finally found a moisturizer I love.</li>
    <li> Really moisturizes, gives me a healthy glow and love that it is all natural.</li>
    <li> Rich texture. Lives up to description. Only used for 3 days so far and it has significantly reduced the red, blotchy patches on my forehead and cheekbones. Will ABSOLUTELY be a repeat customer!!!!</li>
    <li> Normally I would never write a review for anything I buy but this item works miracles! I moved to an area where my allergies get really bad due to high level of pollen and a pet rabbit in the house (not mine). I would break out with rashes and dry skin which started to hurt. The old moisture I had was usueless so I decided to check good ol&#x27; amazon since they have everything and it brought me to Era Organics. I was hesistant at first bc of the price but decided to pull the trigger. It was the best decesion I&#x27;ve ever made. I could diffenitely see an improvement after a week. The thickness was kind of weird in the beginning but its all good now. Its been a couple of months since I&#x27;ve used it and there are no more rashes, dry or cracked skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, you can&#x27;t go wrong here for the price and quality of moisutrizer. I&#x27;m am officially an Era Organic user and will continue to use this product in the future. Great Stuff!</li>
    <li> Nice smell - yes.  Nice feel - yes.  Some magical healing and great moisture - not so much.</li>
    <li> Great product! If you are looking for a gentle organic cream...this is it! I love this product! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Absorbs well. Makes my face look like it has a healthy glow. I use it with the cleanser &amp; use the mask once weekly too. My face looks significantly better since I started using these products.</li>
    <li> Wanted to try this on my son because he has terrible eczema and its really hard to keep his skin from being itchy. He liked this because it was not greasy, it absorbed quickly and was not noticable to scent. I liked it because it was natural and not full of unwanted chemicals. I use this o my hands and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth. I have no skin issues to compare the relief to. I like this and it has so many uses with or without skin conditions.*product received for review*</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! The consistency is light and fluffy and smooth.  I love all of the beneficial ingredients in it as well and my skin is already looking better after a week of using it.  I will say that some people might not like the smell.  I had a stuffy nose the first few days I used it and when my nose cleared up I was like hmm what&#x27;s that smell?!  But it is a very subtle smell that dissipates quickly.  Nothing that really turned me off, just not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for sensitive skin.  Because it is a cream, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.  It goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly.  Leaves your skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite moisturizer ever! I got a great deal on this for a chance to review it and now I am addicted to it. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent. A little goes a long way too! It glides on so smooth you&#x27;d almost thing it was an oil and not a cream.  it is so lightweight that you don&#x27;t even feel like it is there. my skin is loving it!</li>
    <li> I think I am highly allergic to this product. When I first used it I thought there&#x27;s something wrong with my skin. I used it the second time even more, and not willing to recognize the effect it has on my skin. I used it again today and on my face and it wouldn&#x27;t stop itching... It also smells terrible. Maybe it&#x27;s the smell or I&#x27;m not sure but I know it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the great reviews but I don&#x27;t like the smell of it. Not going to purchase this again</li>
    <li> Great for my acne and for my baby&#x27;s eczema.  I liked it so much I ordered the 4oz &amp;#34;relief&amp;#34; jar.  And while writing this review, I saw they had lowered the price on the Relief down to $23! (I just bought it for $32), so I ordered 5 of them.  That is how much I like this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the acne, I had had a reaction (to who knows what) and had lots of shallow pimples on my cheeks (I&#x27;m a chronic picker, so bad I know).  I used a mud mask, then applied this cream along with some emu oil and the next morning they was only faint red marks of where the pimples had been! woohoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my 5 month old suffers from moderate eczema (elbows, feet, cheeks, and ears) that cause him discomfort from itching.  I apply this generously to those spots and it keeps the redness and irritation at bay (which then helps with the itchiness, which then helps the skin to heal faster).  I&#x27;d say it takes about 2 days (applying generously 2-3x a day) for a flare up to calm down with this.</li>
    <li> This cream is very soothing.  I have used it on my face which has dry spots due to the winter winds.  It helps to hydrate.  It really doesn&#x27;t have any type of scent to it.  It contains aloe Vera and Manuka honey both of which are very soothing.  The packaging was good, the entire package was shrink wrapped.  There were no issue with leakage.  It is hard to read the writing on the label as it is very small.  The cream is very thick but softens with your body heat and goes on nicely.  It does take a little bit of rubbing to get it to absorb.  A small amount goes a long way</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!!! I have super sensitive, acne-prone skin and while I&#x27;ve managed to get my acne under control, I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make my face break out - until now!! This stuff makes my face feel smooth and fresh, not oily or sticky, and absorbs perfectly without making me break out - I will definitely be buying again!!</li>
    <li> On the positive it is a very thick cream (not oily) and there&#x27;s no distinct smell. But I was not overall impressed with my results. I get eczema on the back of my hands a lot. For a few days I kept this in my purse and applied it a few times at day, mostly while sitting at work, and it didn&#x27;t really seem to help. The back of my hands were softer and not as red, But the scales were still there.</li>
    <li> Great lotion shipped fast</li>
    <li> took 3 days for red to go out.  applied thickly to most inflamed areas.  always apply sunscreen when going outside - makes a big difference with or without this product.    i still need something for my aging skin so i apply some collagen cream now 1st then smooth it with e-organics on top.    ps it absorbs nicely ;)</li>
    <li> this stuff is okay... i have relatively sensitive skin (not FREAKISHLY sensitive, but somewhat) and i was rly hoping for this to make a huge difference... it doesn&#x27;t and it kind of burns my nostril creases! it does smell good tho. i cld understand someone not loving the smell. if you&#x27;re familiar with lush&#x27;s original charity pot (now called Formulae Known As) it reminds me of that. has a greek yogurty texture&lt;br /&gt;anyway, four stars because it DOES moisturize my face pretty well, just not in the ~revolutionary way~ i was expecting it to... and that smell i love...</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin. Most products don&#x27;t cut it for me. This stuff is glorious! Moisturizes without leaving you one bit oily. Very soothing feel to my skin. This brand is amazing!!!! Thank you Era Organics!</li>
    <li> I like this skin cream, goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely.  Would buy this again.</li>
    <li> love.it.  This product had ingredients that were supposedly good for rosacea (aloe, shea).  The product has a great consistency and soaks in quickly without any greasy feel.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer after I have washed my face with the Era Organics Face Wash. It is not greasy or oily at all. It dries and you cannot even tell that you used it other than your skin is super soft! I love that it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance, it just smells natural, kind of like honey almost. My friend has even used it on her lips and says that it has really helped them. It is very hard to find an affordable all natural product that actually works but, if you are looking for a great moisturizer, this is it. I have very dry and also very oily skin and this has really helped me just in the couple weeks that I have used it.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I got very bumpy dry patches this winter, and this moisturizer saved my skin. I also find that regular use keeps the wrinkles at bay.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey, but face feels so soft and smooth the next morning.  A warning, it stings a little if you apply right after cleansing &amp; toning. I keep on my night stand and wait 20-30 mins before applying.  I have sensitive, acne prone skin, but dry! Love it!</li>
    <li> Just received this and I love it! Awesome texture, no annoying smell, and it goes on very smooth. I have been applying this to my toddler&#x27;s dry skin and feel great putting a natural product on his sensitive skin. I also feel the price is great for the large jar and definitely will reorder when I run out. I tried this today under my makeup and was pleasantly surprised with a matte appearance. I typically have oily skin from most moisturizers but deal with acne so I still need moisture.I also appreciated the personal message direct from the company following up on my purchase. I really love supporting small businesses. Very happy with my experience!</li>
    <li> Smells awful and made me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially very disappointed in this product as it had a very unpleasant odor and it caused my skin to breakout almost immediately.  I purchased this cream with high hopes as it is described as being good for highly sensitive skin and contains none of the chemical-laden preservatives to which I am allergic.  So, upon using it for the first time I was very disappointed and wrote a short, unflattering review.&lt;br /&gt;Upon seeing my review, the company reached out to me, in a very non-aggressive way, to express concern over my experience.  It was their contention that I had received a corrupted jar or their product and offered to replace it so that I might try it again.&lt;br /&gt;Well...I&#x27;m very glad they did!  The replacement jar had none of the unpleasant odor and a completely different appearance and texture.  So I gave it another try.  The scent is actually quite pleasant smelling faintly of honey.  The cream applies easily and a little goes a long way.  After application my skin felt velvety and all signs of dryness were eliminated.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot say enough about the customer service I received from this company!  They seemed truly concerned about my experience and have kept in contact throughout, but in a totally friendly manner.  I would definitely purchase from them in the future.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason that I gave this product only,four out of five stars is that, despite being advertised as suitable for highly sensitive skin, I have been experiencing hive from the day I started using it.  They started as a very minor issue, but have increased over the past several days of use.  I have extremely sensitive skin and many topical allergies, so I pretty much expect this type of reaction.  I had high hopes that I had finally found that special product which would allow me to indulge a bit.  Alas, this is not the case.  However, the rest of my family is enjoying it very much.&lt;br /&gt;So...the verdict is...definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. A little goes a long way. It leaves my face feeling soft and moisturized without feeling greasy.  The company is amazing and care about you and your experience with their products. Will definitely be buying from them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a week now and I really see the difference in my skin. It has a thick consistency, but my skin soaks it right up, and leaves no grease residue. I&#x27;m also using 2.5% benzoyl peroxide, which is very drying. This definitely helps with the flakiness that comes with the benzoyl peroxide. Definitely will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It&#x27;s non greasy, no greasy residue after you put it on. And the fragrance of coconut &amp; Shea butter is very light.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try out the product because of all of its natural and organic ingredients. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks. It does feel great after about 1 hr putting it on. However! the consistency is very thick! I looked at the images on amazon and it definitely looks much softer than the jar that I had for some reason. When I put it on, it does not absorb but rather sits as a film on my skin and just leaves random white marks all over my face. My acne has improved since I started using product but I started getting tiny bumps (4-5 of them) all over my face.</li>
    <li> Love this face cream, works well even for my sensitive skin. My skin is somewhat dry in this leaves it feeling perfectly hydrated while not greasy or heavy. The scent is mild, which is another plus, overall really happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Only rating 4 stars because their customer service is amazing but did not like product. I received a full refund because I did not like this product here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for over 2 weeks now and still have not seen results. The texture of the cream is like greek yogurt, it&#x27;s quite thick. I rubbed a small amount all over my face after I would shower and it would stay hydrated until after 10 minutes when I needed something that was more moisturizing. I feel like my skin has a hard time absorbing it. There would be times where I would apply it at night and then in the morning, I would rub my face a little and then the lotion would literally &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; off my face in little balls it was so weird honestly. The cream probably didn&#x27;t absorb and laid flat to dry on my skin to find out that it would come off even if you rubbed it a little. My skin is mostly dry and I thought this would help but it didn&#x27;t :( I was so happy that I got a full refund though! Their customer service is amazing and although I wasn&#x27;t happy with the product, I was able to get my money back.</li>
    <li> Arrived quick, I am happy with this product, so far it has my face feeling soft and lovely, i love the soft hint of cocoa butter and coconut oil that smell, usually I&#x27;m not fond of using the new products on my face because of my sensitive skin I took a gamble with this product and it turns out to be very good, I definitely recommend this product! so far I give it 5 stars</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer as it comes in a nice jar as well as the cream is thick but it goes on so smoothly and does not leave my hands greasy.  It also absorbs quickly once you rub it into your skin. We have really cold winters and my hands always suffer the most when it is winter time . I used this on my dry cracked hands and it left them feeling great. It also helped so that my hands didn&#x27;t hurt from the dry cracks and splits on my knuckles as well. There is no smell to it so that is a big plus in my book. I really enjoyed being able to try this product out for my hands that desperately needed it. I did receive this product on discount for my honest and unbiased review and thoughts. Thank you i will recommend this to all my friends young and old .</li>
    <li> This is a very nice cream, thick and nourishing but not greasy. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> The eracomplete cream is a good lotion for winter months. It is thick enough to coat your skin and protect it from the winter wind. It says that it will moisturize, nourish, repair, and protect your skin. I fully believe and agree with these claims after having used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of it is like a thick butter. It is soft and creamy. It absorbs easily in to the skin. It has the benefits of aloe gel, cocoa butter, manuka honey, adn shea butter as its most  prevalent ingredients. It leaves my skin soft and moisturized all day. You can up the moisture factor by applying to damp skin after a shower. It will lock in the moisture. It is unscented which is an added bonus for me. The lack of scent allows you to put it on with other items that have a fragrance without worrying about the fragrances clashing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really dry skin during the winter. I have been applying this after my baths and have notice that my dry patches are virtually nonexistent. I would recommend this for anyone with skin lol, but most definitely for those who live in harsh winter climates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion. All views and opinions are 100% my own and have neither been paid for nor sponsored.</li>
    <li> It don&#x27;t really feel as moisturizing as I had hoped. The smell isn&#x27;t really one that I like either but, if you like the spell of icing/frosting then this is for you.</li>
    <li> The product gets 1 star, but customer service gets 5 stars for refunding my money when I wasn&#x27;t happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this moisturizer for a couple of weeks and almost immediately it began drying out my skin--severely. I had hoped maybe something else was the cause since the other reviews for this moisturizer were so positive, but once I stopped using it, my skin cleared up. Just to be sure anyway, I tried it out again a while later and had the same problem. I couldn&#x27;t take the dry skin since it was causing me to itch, so I gave up on the product. Maybe it takes the pH a while to sink in, but I wasn&#x27;t going to suffer.</li>
    <li> great product does not leave a greasy feeling on your face. i will definitely buy this product in the future when i run out. for the price it beats all other crems with a mich higher price</li>
    <li> I have never wrote a review on any product before but this one is worth it. I have acne prone skin and  have not had any breakout&#x27;s from it. It also seems to be smoothing out my skin and it feels wonderful and has a glow. It is totally non greasy and seems to prevent my face from getting oily. Love, love ,love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this now for a few days, and I like it very much. It feels different than other moisturizers, it isn&#x27;t greasy, just soaks into my skin.</li>
    <li> If you have hyper sensitive skin conditions stemming from allergies, you may want to consider ALL ingredients before buying.  For the average person, this cream would be great; however, my skin just did not tolerate it well.  I think this is a wonderful product for most all skin types without added food or environmental allergies.  Wish I could utilize the simple, clean and organic base of ingredients.  Too bad for me!!</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s account. It was great as I have a combination skin and it is non greesy at all and also doesn&#x27;t dry out too, but after using for a couple of weeks, it broke me out! I am in early 30&#x27;s almost have a clear skin with little acne pores from teen age. Really disappointed with this. Returning to amazon..</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  I use it with the Era Organics Natural Face Wash and it has cleared up my breakout very quickly.  I will be buying it again!</li>
    <li> Super moisturizer! Makes me feel super refreshed. Smells great like it should be considering the ingredients and does not have that chemical smell. Almost done with my 1st one I&#x27;ll probably order it again.</li>
    <li> Really smooth. I like it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! A must buy for you and loved ones for sure!! Really nourishing on the skin is truly all natural....awesome!! Best of luck to Era Organics :)</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and use prescription creams for my face. However I had my 3rd baby recently and I don&#x27;t like using the prescriptions when I am pregnant or nursing. My psoriasis on my face got pretty bad this time (probably from stress of 3 kids!) and I was looking for a more natural solution. I am really happy with this product - it&#x27;s definitely the best I&#x27;ve been able to find. It has reduced the redness and patches and it feels great.  It hasn&#x27;t totally cured me, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to. I just ordered a second jar - I fully expect to continue using this even if I need the occasional help of a prescription from time to time. Highly recommend it if you suffer from psoriasis or excema and you are looking for a natural face cream.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my face feel. It feels like it is tightening up my skin as soon and my skin is always super soft.</li>
    <li> Great product, gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> arrived very quick........ great product</li>
    <li> This is one of the top 3 skin care products I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my mom who has rosacea and has been using metragel for a few years.  She said it helps her a lot by reducing redness, also keeps her face moist, it&#x27;s usually extremely dry.  Very happy, will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;My original package was lost somewhere in transit, so the company Era Organics e-mailed me a 30% off coupon for the inconvenience which was just soo nice of them!  Thank you Era Organics and Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I was recently diagnosed with Hashimotos thyroiditis and one of the major side effects of the disease is dry skin I also recently had a baby so I was suffering from lingering pregnancy acne at the same time. I could not for the life of me find anything that would help my acne and not dry out my skin even more. My skin was so bad it was inflamed and raw and flaking off. I went searching for an alcohol free moisturizer and came across era organics . I thought I would give it a try because it had such high reviews. I bought the cleanser and the moisturizer and within a week my skin was so much better. From day one the inflammation was gone and by the end of the week my skin was much softer and happier. I&#x27;ve been using these products for about a month and I no longer have dry skin. I use the moisturizer all over my body And the cleanser doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight but still cleans deeply. I won&#x27;t go back to anything else. I have never been happier with any other facial product before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to try several Era Organics products, and once again they have one that I absolutely love!  You can see from my photo that this is a nice thick cream, not runny or watered down like some moisturizers.  Now some thick creams or lotions leave your skin feeling greasy, but not this moisturizer!  It absorbs in beautifully to the skin quickly with no residue.  It makes my skin feel soft and smooth and even during this harsh winter weather prevents the seborrheic dermatitis on my forehead from getting dry, itchy, and flaky all throughout the day - in my book, that is a huge win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it is made with natural organic ingredients.  I&#x27;ve been trying for the last few years to limit my personal care products as much as possible to ones without harsh chemicals like parabens and pthalates that may potentially be able to disrupt your body&#x27;s natural hormonal system.  I can enjoy using any of Era Organic&#x27;s products knowing that they do not use any such ingredients!  Very glad that I was able to get this at a discount through a promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Great for my eye area and on my face smooth and seems to help texture smells okay !!</li>
    <li> Love it. It does have a bit of a smell but it isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s kind of an anise smell I think. I have used it for several months no love it! A little does go a long way so it will last!</li>
    <li> Nice stuff.  Thick but smooth.  I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is so great! Creamy texture with a great scent.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT moisturizer! I am so happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin that slicks up like a greased pan within an hour of moisturizing, but also gets so dried out in the winter time that my skin will peel in places. I was also blessed with giant pores that can be seen from space.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t break me out, clog my skin up, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and doesn&#x27;t make me look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I still have issues with greasy, but not nearly as bad as other moisturizers. I am SUPER happy with this.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is...organic-haha! It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily smell bad. I did a lot of research about the best moisutrizers and ingredients for skin care and one of the main reasons for irritation of skin is that of fragrance. I was told if it smells cirtus-y or fruit-y, it&#x27;s not good for your skin. I get used to the smell within about 30 seconds of putting it on, so it&#x27;s not that bad.&lt;br /&gt;It really does have the consistency of creamy icing. A little goes a long way and my skin just soaks it up.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in the way of evening out my skin texture or coloration, but I have a lot of work to do with my skin, so it may just take some time.&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I am so happy that I took the plunge and bought this. :)</li>
    <li> Goes nice and clear on the face it really works.</li>
    <li> Like it, it feels great on my skin, my face looked better after applying this n it smells good like Shea/cocoa butter, will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Works amazing! Will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It makes my skin feel like a rose petal! And it&#x27;s not greasy! Will definitely buy again! :-) Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love the fennel smell and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> Great stuff Soothing and moisturizing for my dry sensitive rosacea prone skin</li>
    <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CREAM!!  IT IS NOT GREASY SO I CAN WEAR IT UNDER MY MAKEUP.  A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.  I CAN SEE MY FINE LINES FADING!!</li>
    <li> love!! love!! love this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many creams and unfortunately have never had any luck finding one that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I suffer from rosacea and this cream was not to heavy and moisturizer without causing a flare up. So happy I found a great product that soothes my skin.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended to everyone with very sensitive skin. My mother is loving this light moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Great product for my skin.</li>
    <li> The product works well. Didn&#x27;t expect such good results. Highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> great for chapped face from winter it soothes it and makes it feel better</li>
    <li> I usually try to use organic products, but I have learned that not every organic product works well.  But this cream worked so well for me.  It does not smell at all, and it spreads on face very easily and it does not feel oily.  With some other organic products I had to wait for 30 minutes for them to be absorbed by skin before I could put my foundation on, but this cream absorbed very quick and I was able to put my foundation on in few minutes. Also I have dry skin and some creams are not moisturizing enough for me, but this one did the job!</li>
    <li> I put a small amount of this on my skin and within minutes it started tingling and itching. I have no idea what the irritant is in this product - that is a LONG ingredient list - but there&#x27;s definitely something in there that doesn&#x27;t work for every skin type.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream. It smells like honey and absorbs into my skin well. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d an e-mail from this company asking how I liked this product so far.  I have been using it about a month approx, both as a day and nightime moisturizer.  I have very dry skin.  Honestly, I have to say for me, it is just okay.  I was really hoping, I would like this product a lot and would order again.  I am not sure yet.  I am going to give it some more time.  I have about 1/2 jar left.  The contents of the jar does seem to last a long time.  I do like all the natural ingredients it has in it and that is one of the reasons I ordered this product in the first place.  It does not make under eye puffiness look better, although, I dont think any product can do that.  I will keep using until the jar is empty and may write another review if I decide to order again.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and very careful about what I use... and this was a fabulous surprise! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have only used this for three nights but I really love the feel of my skin. I&#x27;m quite happy so far!</li>
    <li> This is very gentle on my skin and goes on very smoothly.</li>
    <li> Thank you for an amazing deal!</li>
    <li> I have lots to say but will try not to make this too long. I ordered this product, as well as the eczema cream and natural face wash, because I was having trouble with a rash after surgery that started on my upper thighs and worked its way up my body to my face (ugh!). I was immediately impressed by the company because I received a welcome email from them after I received my products, thanking me for my order and supplying me with information about how to contact them if I had any questions or concerns. Several weeks later I wrote to them, asking for a refund, because I thought the cream might be causing a negative reaction and exacerbating my condition. Tyler wrote back promptly, sharing a lot of great information about skin, in general, and about detoxification; he agreed to refund my money if that&#x27;s what I wanted but at the same time encouraged me to hang in there and see if things got better. Well, I understand detoxification, and what Tyler said made perfect sense to me, so I continued to use the cream and I am SO glad I did. My skin not only improved but it&#x27;s doing really well - awesome, in fact. My Natural Skin Care Face Cream is now my favorite ever, and I am also using it as my eye cream. It has a pleasant aroma and is so creamy, too. I&#x27;m very appreciative that Tyler took the time to care and explain, and I&#x27;m so happy with this product that I&#x27;m encouraging my friends to use it, too!</li>
    <li> This is a very good moisurizer. It is quickly absorbed in the skin. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Hmm, I&#x27;m not sure what to say about this moisturizer. I wanted to love it. I wanted to replace the Collective Wellbeing calming lavender overnight cream that I use day and night. But it&#x27;s just so-so. It&#x27;s not as thick and creamy as I&#x27;d hoped, and it doesn&#x27;t absorb as well as the Collective Wellbeing. One good point: it did not bother my super-sensitive skin. It might work better for some folks than others. So I&#x27;ll give it three stars, but I won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
    <li> super product. works well on my face even though I have very sensitive skin. very soothing</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product, but for me personally it heavily lacked in moisturizing. Normally in an untouched state after washing my face my skin is dry, irritated, pink/reddish in some areas. I have very dry skin so most moisturizing products don&#x27;t do enough for me and unfortunately I have to add this one to the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a lot of people would like this cream, it&#x27;s lightweight, has no oily feel, absorbs quickly, very light fragrance, nice consistency, organic... But I think this is for people with normal to dry skin. Not for people with VERY dry skin. I typically resort to using coconut oil on my face because I have yet to find a moisturizer that works better, so I&#x27;m out of the ordinary and won&#x27;t knock the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this cream for a few days and it left my skin feeling dry and irritated, it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I tried using a little &amp; a lot, no matter how much I put on it wasn&#x27;t enough. If you have very dry skin like me I would not recommend this product but for people with normal or slightly dry skin I think this cream would be efficient.</li>
    <li> So far this item has been great, leaving my face soft and smooth. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> So far this cream has given me good results. It goes on smoothly and does not cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> So far I am pleased with this product. I was a little disappointed that the ingredients were printed so small. It makes it very difficult to confirm that the product does not contain ingredients on my watch list. I squinted and I&#x27;m pretty sure the ingredients are all good but I do need to take another peak with a magnifying glass.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product because of all the other great reviews, however I was sadly mistaken. The cream smells just awful, like some chemical product. Not to mention, the amount of product is so tiny for the price. The cream goes on well at first, smooth and consistent, but after 5-10 minutes, the product creates a film around my face that felt extremely tightening and drying. It didn&#x27;t absorb well even when I had cleansed my face prior and my skin felt very very dry.. even flakey! It was not what I had expected and it also made my face dryer, itchier, redder and rougher in texture. The moisturizing power is not strong at all and not suitable for very dry skin complexions. It is probably only suitable for people with regular, combination, slightly dry or oily skin. Definitely not suitable for eczema sufferers!</li>
    <li> broke me out. It&#x27;s very nice for an after shave lotion though</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing! Will be reordering.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! I love the fact it&#x27;s all natural and has aloe, which is super healing to the skin... It does not have any fragrance so people with allergies will find it very appealing. You won&#x27;t be sorry if you purchase this product :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing I just received it and used it this morning it&#x27;s now 10 hours later and my skin still looks and  feels amazing !!! Thank you so much I&#x27;m so relieved to find something organic and nutrient rich my skin is firm hydrated and radiant  ....I do wish you sold larger jars because I don&#x27;t use it on any singular area</li>
    <li> I really liked this cream, my whole family uses it. It is not oily at all and leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized. I recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Love this cream...the texture is great, it really feels good.  I use it on my face, hands and my elbows.  Recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> This cream is absolutely the best!!  It applies easily and NOT greasy at all which is what I look for in a product. I use it on my hands and face and what a difference. My skin tone has evened out with the first application. I use it under my eyes and it makes my eyes feel refreshed. Will use this product for a long time, my favorite</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer in the morning since I use wrinkle creams at night. The consistency threw me off a little bit... I was expecting something lighter and more liquidy. This cream is very heavy and has a firm consistency (it reminds me of Noxzema&#x27;s in the sense that you have to scoop it out with your finger and its hard) but it does do the job in terms of hydration (I have VERY dry skin) and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. What I didn&#x27;t like too much is that it leaves a little bit of film residue on the skin afterwards and the smell took me a while to get use to (it smell like a piece of Tootsie Roll candy, no lie, which is not what I want my face to smell like at all). I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks so I want to finish it before deciding to repurchase. However, because it is a natural, milder product and hydrates so well I might get passed the smell and purchase again.</li>
    <li> Creamy and only a little needed. I use on my neck and hands. Non-greasy. I love the Shea in the lotion.</li>
    <li> I love the ingredients of the cream but unfortunately it is not concentrated enough for my very dry skin.  My skin does soak this cream up really fast and what I do is add a few drops of marula or argan oil to the cream.</li>
    <li> This cream is it !! I love the texture &amp; it&#x27;s organic!! It made my skin feel renewed.. I love it ! Definitely perfect for sensitive skin!! Great product !</li>
    <li> but what&#x27;s the difference between this and the eczema relief one? I can&#x27; t even tell from the ingredient......</li>
    <li> awesome product...try it!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Keeps face moisturized</li>
    <li> so far I have been happy with this face lotion. I have sensitive skin and I am particular about what goes on my face. I do not wear foundation or any makeup on my face except for mascara and lip stick. This does have a faint honey smell, but it doesnt bother me at all. I use just a little and feel like it goes a long way. The lotion goes on smooth and absorbs into the skin without feeling greasy. i do not like things on my skin but this is so gentle it doesnt bother me at all. I feel like it is helping even out my skin tone as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great skin cream for very sensitive skin. It almost smells like chocolate. My daughter uses it every night and loves it.</li>
    <li> One of a kind! Love it! Feels so nice to apply, clears my skin pigmentation and acne scars. Very professional service and caring attitude from the seller. Definitely recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I just received this cream yesterday and therefore, I can&#x27;t say anything with regard to long term results. However, I like that it feels nice on my face, which always reacts to creams. It is cool and clean. And best of all, cruelty-free.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this is a great moisturizer.. !!! bought the face wash too.. also great!  no alcohol.</li>
    <li> My daughter had terrible eczema under her neck, elbow folds, and on her cheeks. Made me sooo sad. Everytime I use this it seems to calm down. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s in my head but this stuff and neosporin hydrocortisone cream is the ONLY thing that helps. I&#x27;ve used it all too.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I ever wrote a review for anything , meaning that this product is that good that it deserves all the positive feedback ! I have combo oily acne prone skin with scarring . The texture and feel of this cream is so amazing it gives the right amount of hydration without an oily feel, while helping heal my scars. I am so grateful to have come across this brand randomly and now I am completely devoted and recommend it to anyone!!! Even my friend with the most flawless skin swears by this stuff because it just makes you feel like you&#x27;re golden for putting such amazing ingredients onto your skin. This stuff really is a rockstar</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SMOOTH AND BRIGHT. GOES ON EASILY AND IS NOT GREASY.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited to have such a great lotion for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything (which is good for me) and is a good consistency!  My face is taking well to it so far!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful!  I love the way it feels.  I got too much sun recently and this is helping repair the damage.  I have sensitive skin and I must be careful what I use.  This is wonderful!</li>
    <li> love having organic skin products....so much better than the chemical laden ones</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer so much!  I have tried so many different products to help my facial dryness but nothing worked until I found this.  This product goes on smoothly and has a subtle lotion odor that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  It has not caused any breakouts or skin irritation.  I feel this moisturizer is very soothing and not greasy on my face during this brutally cold weather.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I like the ingredients in this moisturizer as well.  I prefer to use more natural products with limited safety concerns and I feel comfortable with this product.</li>
    <li> for anyone who experiences burning with this there is a good chance its the aloe, I&#x27;ve been having the same issue and only when I use products with aloe, it took me using just aloe to realize its the aloe, for some reason my face burns whenever I use it</li>
    <li> I received my Complete moisturizer this morning and immediately applied it&lt;br /&gt;with my morning skin regimen. Let me be clear, in no uncertain terms: I&lt;br /&gt;ADORE THIS CREAM!  I have lupus and there are so many products that I know&lt;br /&gt;immediately will not work on the rash prone skin. Complete is luxurious and&lt;br /&gt;feels so soft. My husband even noticed a difference tonight.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with your skin care cream!  Very moisturizing and it helped to tone down and eliminate some eczema flare ups that I had on my face.  Will purchase again, thank you!!!</li>
