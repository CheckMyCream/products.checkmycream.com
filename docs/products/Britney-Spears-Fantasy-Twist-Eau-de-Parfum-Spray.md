      <li>Just know she is a Super Star, and a Good Looking Woman.</li>
      <li>is a better size to carry in a purse.  </li>
      <li>Love both scents on my wife .</li>

      <li>That Old Sea Hag is still going strong.</li>
      <li>smells more like its meant for a pre teen or teenager.</li>
      <li>she gets back on top.</li>
      <li>It has the little heart charm on it which is nice.  </li>
      <li>my favorite is fantasy pink</li>
      <li>It was almost the same price as the large one.  </li>
      <li>i feel like it smells too young for me.</li>
      <li>One is sweet and the other is sweet but a little dark.</li>
      <li>Just as expected except the bottle we got appears to be a floor display model, meaning there is no charm on the bottle like normal.</li>

    <li> GOOD PRODUCT -AND GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY - I GAVE  THIS AS A  GIFT AND THE RECEIVED WAS VERY SATISFIED-I RECOMMEND IT --BOTH PRODUCT AND PACKAGING VERY GOOD</li>
    <li> 100% guaranteed, excellent gift.</li>
    <li> Just as expected except the bottle we got appears to be a floor display model, meaning there is no charm on the bottle like normal. I guess this explains the cheaper selling price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it was advertised as being the &amp;#34;floor display&amp;#34; version and &amp;#34;charmless&amp;#34; we still would have bought it and given it 5-stars.</li>
    <li> This perfum is not original. 100% fake</li>
    <li> Bought for my Wife and Daughter for Christmas.It is a very Nice Smell.Britney Spears is a Super Talent that hung with the wrong crowd.Easy to do.They are around long enough to Ruin your Career and take all your money.I wish her all the Best and prey she gets back on top.Look at Madonna.That Old Sea Hag is still going strong.Even after Dennis RODman ripped her up.You go Girl Friend.Get back on Tour.Never listened to her music .Heard some.Just know she is a Super Star, and a Good Looking Woman.I give her the Big Kielbasa…….</li>
    <li> i tried a sample in the store and liked it so i ordered it on amazon. i am 28 years old and now that i wear it everyday i feel like it smells too young for me. smells more like its meant for a pre teen or teenager. dont get me wrong it smells good but i just dont feel my age when wearing it.</li>
    <li> Love most of her fragrance, these two are my FAVORITES!</li>
    <li> 2 of her best scents together! I&#x27;m so glad for this. Both are fantastic. I&#x27;ve used them both in their original bottles and love their scents for years. Will be getting this again!-Brisce M</li>
    <li> This is an awesome idea to put two of the Fantasy perfumes together.  Some people think they are mixed-no, you get each perfume on each side of the container.  I can see how the description could be misleading.  But they are definitely separated.  You could always spray them together if you want a mixed scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is cute.  I love the colors of the container and the way the two sides come apart.  Mine was loose in the box, but didn&#x27;t break.  It has the little heart charm on it which is nice.  You get 1.7 oz. of each scent.  I got it on sale and it was a good price.  I also have the smaller version, the 1 oz., which is .5 oz of each.  It was almost the same price as the large one.  The 3.3 is a better value, but the 1 oz. is a better size to carry in a purse.  I guess it depends what you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great way to try each perfume if you are unsure of either.  Even better if you know you like both and want to be able to carry both with you.</li>
    <li> i loveee ittttt.. my favorite is fantasy pink</li>
    <li> cheap smell. I had not to buy he perfume before I tried it.</li>
    <li> everything was wonderful</li>
