      <li>Really works great on my hair.</li>

      <li>Love this brush.</li>
      <li>but they are comfortable and don&#x27;t hurt!</li>
      <li>Love that it comes in a mini</li>
      <li>It really IS as good as Rachel Whitehurst says it is. ;)</li>
      <li>The best way to get knots out of wet hair.  </li>
      <li>Great brush for me and my four year old who has tons of hair.  </li>
      <li>All he could say is \\&quot;Wow, what an amazing brush\\&quot;!  </li>
      <li>WE LOVE these brushes so much I had to write a positive review on my own website as well!</li>
      <li>Quickly became the favorite brush of those who used it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The little brush is perfect for a backpack or what have you</li>
      <li>The tiny brush is great for travel or on-the-go use.</li>
      <li>These brushes are the best, not only do they take out tangles really well</li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>
      <li>one for the Whole Family !!!</li>
      <li>Works great for my long hair that always gets tangled.  </li>
      <li>Have noticed a significant decrease in split ends since using this brush.  </li>
      <li>Great on DRY hair also!</li>
      <li>&quot; went right through my hair!</li>
      <li>I love these brushes so much that I give them for gifts all the time.</li>
      <li>Arrived exactly as advertised and very very quickly.</li>
      <li>Seriously the best brush when trying to grow your hair out and prevents breakage!</li>
      <li>Got one for my sister who is super picky about hair brushes and she loves it as well.  </li>
      <li>On day two, he tried \\&quot;The Wet Brush\\&quot; on wet hair after showering and he was even more impressed!</li>
      <li>but she now loves brushing her long gorgeous hair and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
      <li>It is great, and I feel like I have been experience less breakage on my fine/easily tangle hair.  </li>
      <li>The only aspect of use that is less than perfect is the fact that not EVERY mangled knot is 100% pain free...</li>
      <li>Great wet hair brushes with a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>The small size is perfect for my 4 year old.</li>
      <li>The small brush went to my daughter, but would also be a great purse or travel size.  </li>
      <li>So far works great with my long straight hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Works great on thick curly or straight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>ball tips are so gentle on scalp unlike the wire ones!  </li>
      <li>I have super fine hair and its the ONLY brush that doesn&#x27;t jerk my hair out.</li>
      <li>This brush really works!  </li>
      <li>This really detangles your hair and makes it soft and frizz free.</li>
      <li>These brushes really are infinitely better for your hair than regular prong brushes.</li>
      <li>We both had been using detangling combs that really didn&#x27;t detangle as much as they pulled our hair out!</li>
      <li>It works well with my hair, wet or dry, and I know many people who use this on their kids and love it as well.</li>
      <li>Maybe I just shed too much.</li>
      <li>and I just pray I don&#x27;t lose too much hair.  </li>
      <li>Highly, highly recommended!  </li>
      <li>This review applies also to the smaller version of brush, available on Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>She has curly hair and my husband is convinced that the brush uses witchcraft because it makes life so much easier on all of us, ha.</li>
      <li>Still pulls out my hair even when I&#x27;m extremely gentle.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite brush now and will not use any other brush.</li>
      <li>You save so much time and hair with those brushes, I highly recommend them</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a small size for my beach bag.</li>
      <li>I am going to order another one because we never want to be without this new miracle styling tool!</li>
      <li>This is an amazingly light plastic brush which detangles wet hair gently.</li>
      <li>Great Brushed to work through thick tangle hair without pulling or hurting.  </li>
      <li>love the combo as the small brush fits into my purse - to use when out and about</li>
      <li>Works well, but the smaller &amp;#34;squirt&amp;#34; brush is really flimsy and doesn&#x27;t brush well.</li>
      <li>Their soft rounded rubber (or nylon?)</li>
      <li>Brush\\&quot; on my dry hair first.</li>
      <li>My husband first used the standard size brush on his dry hair.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for anyone with long hair.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive scalp and was highly doubtful it would comb out my fine long knotted hair effectively and without pain.</li>
      <li>This is not my first purchase of the wet brush and it won&#x27;t be the last.</li>

    <li> WOW-- actually incredible!  Combs like butter through hair tangled from 2 days of camping and dancing (TomorrowWorld), and is a dream for every day use.  Much less hair gets stuck in this brush compared to past brushes, which will preserve the hairs on my pretty little head, which are already upset with me for dying them red.  The only aspect of use that is less than perfect is the fact that not EVERY mangled knot is 100% pain free... but the pain is much less than with any other brush.  Everyone should own one of these puppies.  The tiny brush is great for travel or on-the-go use.</li>
    <li> This brush is a must for all hair types! Love that it comes in a mini so I can bring it with me on the go.</li>
    <li> Arrived exactly as advertised and very very quickly. Both the large and small brushes seem well made and built to last. so far so good.</li>
    <li> Works great for my long hair that always gets tangled.  I keep these in my kids bathroom but always find myself reaching for it!</li>
    <li> Still pulls out my hair even when I&#x27;m extremely gentle. Maybe I just shed too much.</li>
    <li> Same feeling as with the small one leaves tangles at the very ends of hair.</li>
    <li> I will never use another brush from walmart of any beauty supplies. I have super fine hair and its the ONLY brush that doesn&#x27;t jerk my hair out. Seriously the best brush when trying to grow your hair out and prevents breakage!</li>
    <li> I have very thick and curly hair, and this brush is the only brush I can use with out crying as I try to detangle my hair. It works well with my hair, wet or dry, and I know many people who use this on their kids and love it as well.</li>
    <li> Great Brushed to work through thick tangle hair without pulling or hurting.  love the combo as the small brush fits into my purse - to use when out and about</li>
    <li> I love these brushes so much that I give them for gifts all the time. It&#x27;s nice to have a small size for my beach bag.</li>
    <li> Perfect combo...one for me and one for my daughter.  This brush really works!  We use after pool and shower time.  No more crying!</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best, not only do they take out tangles really well but they are comfortable and don&#x27;t hurt!</li>
    <li> It really IS as good as Rachel Whitehurst says it is. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical because...it&#x27;s a hairbrush. But it&#x27;s the only brush I use now because it just works so well for me.</li>
    <li> Really works great on my hair. No more pulling out hair in tangles. Would recommend over the other brushes you see advertised.</li>
    <li> Best purchase I ever made. I don&#x27;t know how I lived before without this brush!</li>
    <li> Works well, but the smaller &amp;#34;squirt&amp;#34; brush is really flimsy and doesn&#x27;t brush well. Should have only ordered the standard size one.</li>
    <li> Great brush for me and my four year old who has tons of hair.  It doesn&#x27;t pull wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> Used it once during hair washing. This is my favorite brush now and will not use any other brush. This really detangles your hair and makes it soft and frizz free. I use the small one for my children. It works great on them too. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Will definitely purchase another one in different color.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these brushes, one for my husband and one for myself. My husband has very thick, long hair that gets very tangled. I have thin, naturally curly hair which also gets very tangled. We both had been using detangling combs that really didn&#x27;t detangle as much as they pulled our hair out! My husband first used the standard size brush on his dry hair. He was stunned at how well it worked and it made his hair look great. All he could say is \\&quot;Wow, what an amazing brush\\&quot;!  On day two, he tried \\&quot;The Wet Brush\\&quot; on wet hair after showering and he was even more impressed! My husband rates \\&quot;The Wet Brush\\&quot; a 10! I tried the smaller \\&quot;Squirt Wet Brush\\&quot; on my dry hair first. I usually can&#x27;t get a comb or brush through my dry hair that has become snarled and I usually end up in the shower with lot&#x27;s of conditioner and detangling solution to get the knots out and I just pray I don&#x27;t lose too much hair.  To my amazement, \\&quot;The Wet Brush\\&quot; went right through my hair! Up next, trying \\&quot;The Wet Brush\\&quot; on wet hair. Again, I had no problem using it on my wet hair and I even used \\&quot;The Wet Brush\\&quot; to style my hair as I dried it with the blow dryer. My hair never looked so good! I also rate \\&quot;The Wet Brush\\&quot; a 10!!!!  WE LOVE these brushes so much I had to write a positive review on my own website as well! [...] -In conclusion, if you have hair that always gets tangled and you are sick of your hairbrush robbing you of your pretty locks, you MUST get this brush! You will not be disappointed! I am going to order another one because we never want to be without this new miracle styling tool!</li>
    <li> This brush came recommended by my stylist.  It is great, and I feel like I have been experience less breakage on my fine/easily tangle hair.  The small brush went to my daughter, but would also be a great purse or travel size.  I would definitely recommend this set.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift.  Quickly became the favorite brush of those who used it.&lt;br /&gt;The little brush is perfect for a backpack or what have you</li>
    <li> Perfect for me and my 3 year old!!! no more tangles</li>
    <li> You save so much time and hair with those brushes, I highly recommend them</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Finally got my niece to brush her hair. May sound crazy but she now loves brushing her long gorgeous hair and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  Highly recommend for anyone with long hair.</li>
    <li> It is Easy on the scalp, no tangles, and appears to be very good in quality.  I rewally like it!</li>
    <li> This is the. Best Brush totally untangles hair better then a comb&lt;br /&gt;Works great on thick curly or straight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought  one for the Whole Family !!!</li>
    <li> Keep the small one in my purse for windy days outside. The larger brush works as expected. Love it. Would recommend for detangling and hair maintenance.</li>
    <li> The brushes seem to work as the other reviewers posted. But they have a strong, unpleasant chemical smell. I was able to get rid of most of it by scrubbing them thoroughly with a dish brush and detergent, but it still lingers a bit after a week.</li>
    <li> The best way to get knots out of wet hair.  Have noticed a significant decrease in split ends since using this brush.  Got one for my sister who is super picky about hair brushes and she loves it as well.  Definitely recommend it for everyone.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best paddle brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I have fairly thick hair that comes to the middle of my back.  These brushes detangle my hair with very little effort whether it&#x27;s wet or dry.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair seems to have less breakage at the tips since I&#x27;ve been using the brush.  I leave the big one at home in my bathroom and keep the little one in my purse.  Great product and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is not my first purchase of the wet brush and it won&#x27;t be the last. These brushes really are infinitely better for your hair than regular prong brushes. The small size is perfect for my 4 year old. She has curly hair and my husband is convinced that the brush uses witchcraft because it makes life so much easier on all of us, ha. Get one!</li>
    <li> Great wet hair brushes with a reasonable price. So far works great with my long straight hair. Really love them!</li>
    <li> These things actually work. I have sensitive scalp and was highly doubtful it would comb out my fine long knotted hair effectively and without pain. It did. Also works with our 2 yr olds hair. Super awesome product.</li>
    <li> This review applies also to the smaller version of brush, available on Amazon.com. as well.  This is an amazingly light plastic brush which detangles wet hair gently. It has thin nylon bristles resting on a rounded springy foam (?) base. These very flexible bristles bend at their base as well as the brush is being used, and do not pull on hair. Their soft rounded rubber (or nylon?) ball tips are so gentle on scalp unlike the wire ones!  Both adults and children will love this brush! Great on DRY hair also! Highly, highly recommended!  Why then only 4 stars? Poor quality metallic paint flakes off on one of the two I have after a few contacts with either hand or wet conditions. Manufacturer should use quality rubberized paint on brush to help their product become THE BEST hair brush to own!</li>
    <li> The brushes are a bit too flimsy.</li>
    <li> Love it, I can&#x27;t believe I never found this before!</li>
    <li> Brissle are not strong enought to brush through thick hair. This is meant for a thin baby hair. A total waste of money!</li>
