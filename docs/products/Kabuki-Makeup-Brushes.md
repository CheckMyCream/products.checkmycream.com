<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I feel bad by giving only 3 stars for this review. However I just cannot get into these brushes, their beautiful soft brushes but they hold to much powder and therefore I cannot get an even finish on my face. It comes out real streaked and blotchy. Unfortunately I will be returning them. Sorry Malika.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush, a little shedding but it&#x27;s an awesome brush</li>
    <li> When applying makeup, everyone wants that airbrushed beautifully effortless and natural finish look on their face. And what creates that look depends on the tool used to apply the makeup. I vary between beauty sponges and makeup brushes, but in general there are some places that brushes are preferred and better in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When trying to reach a small area, brushes are better and provide more precise application. Brushes are also fantastic for blending, which is important for any powders, blushes, bronzer, highlighter, and/ or contouring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this flat top kabuki makeup brush to apply both my foundation and my contour and I was happy to see that my foundation was easily applied and looked just as beautiful with this brush as it is when using my beauty blender, but I felt like I used less product with this brush than my beauty blender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even used it yet an the bristles won&#x27;t stop falling out, will be returning this.</li>
    <li> Best brush found for my power foundation</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  Buffs out Foundation flawlessly.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really really like this brush...i have been searching for a makeup brush like this that works smoothly and is easy to clean up ...now all i have to do is fight with my daughter for it...lol...thanks</li>
    <li> love this brush it easy to hold</li>
    <li> This brush is my first kabuki brush and it is AMAZING! !! I would definitely recommend this tool to any makeup artist. It had a pleasant smell and feels like velvet on my skin. Application was easy as well. I love it and cant wait to order more Malike Jafrin tools.</li>
    <li> Great foundation brush. Soft bristles. Blends really well.</li>
    <li> My wife really liked the feel of this brush. She said that it fit better in her hand than her previous makeup brushes. The only problems with it was the minor shedding of the bristles. Also, the first couple test runs left blotchy makeup spots. After that, it was &amp;#34;broken in&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> What can I say, this brush is amazing. I have tried many, many, brushes, sponges, rollers &amp; puffs to apply my liquid foundation &amp; ended up throwing them all away, after a couple of uses- but this brush is fabulous. It leaves my liquid foundation/CC cream application looking FLAWLESS &amp; it takes no longer than applying with my fingers, which is a double bonus!! I will definitely be buying more of these brushes.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. I love this brush, it works well with dry and wet makeup. I love love it. I&#x27;m going to order more brushes from them. This is a makeup must have! Bought at a reduced price for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This flat top Kabuki makeup brush comes packaged in a sleeve to help keep the bristles from getting bent.&lt;br /&gt;That is also enclosed in a a plastic pouch.&lt;br /&gt;This brush is great for full coverage. I tried it out today with some powder and got great full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are nice and tight together, and feel really soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great brush, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I lover this brush. It is soft and has worked great in my set. I have not had any issues with hairs falling out and it is easy to hold and apply my make up. I use this with my powder foundation and it has worked very well with that application. It leaves and even coat across my skin and doesnt leave thicker areas than others. The shape of this brush is easy to hold during application. I am glad I was able to purchase this during a promotional period.</li>
    <li> I really love this Malika Jafrin Flat Top Kabuki Makeup Brush! It is smaller than the brush I was previously using but it works so much better! This brush is packed with soft bristles which feels very smooth on my skin. I&#x27;ve used this brush everyday for a few days now and I haven&#x27;t seen any bristles fall out which I love because I can&#x27;t stand when brushes lose their bristles! The brush glides over my face and applies my makeup evenly. This brush is also very easy to store in my makeup bag that I keep in my purse so I can have it with me at all times! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> *This review is for the flat top kabuki brush* This is such a great flat top kabuki brush. It&#x27;s very soft, well made, and a solid brush. The bristles are dense so they pick up plenty of product! I love how versatile this flat top kabuki is. I can use it for liquid foundation, cream foundation, powder foundation, mineral foundation, or blush. It doesn&#x27;t leave lines of my face when using it with liquid at all and creates a flawless finish. I love that this brush is vegan and the bristles are synthetic and cruelty free. The brush cleans nicely too and I did not experience a lot of bristle fall out while cleaning it like I do with other brushes I have. The handle is very comfortable to grip and the brush is a nice compact size. I notice myself grabbing for this brush a lot currently. I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of it. *discount received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> I am so amazed by the quality of this flat kabuki brush.&lt;br /&gt;I love makeup, and I have a huge stash of makeup, that I probably wouldnt finish for the next three to four years.&lt;br /&gt;I love discovering new tools and products all the time, I do not really care what brand or price it is, although, of course, sometimes it matters.&lt;br /&gt;They sent me a promo code to purchase this product so I can try and test it for review. And boy was I amazed of it.&lt;br /&gt;It is very very soft, it is also very dense. I use this to apply my foundation and it glides on to my skin smoothly, it applied the foundation very evenly as if it was airbrushed. The buffing technique is also perfect for this brush because it is very dense.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is not too long or too short, it is just enough to give my self proper control when using this brush.&lt;br /&gt;I have washed it for a few times now and it didnt shed at all. If youre looking for a good flat kabuki brush, you should try this one.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Ideal for Blending Cream, Liquid, and Mineral Cosmetics:&lt;br /&gt;The Malika Jafrin Flat Top Kabuki Brush is ideal for blending liquid, cream, and mineral foundation. Due to its shape, this  brush gives you incredible control when blending on any face shape. The flat top makes blending your forehead and cheeks a breeze!&lt;br /&gt;Made from High Quality, Vegan, Cruelty-Free Synthetic Hair, so you can use this awesome brush guilt free. Quality is evident when holding &amp; using this brush. The hairs do not come loose. This is a brush that is made to last. I was able to purchase this at a reduced price and I am so glad I was able to try it.</li>
    <li> Received my flat top kabuki brush yesterday and just used it for the first time. I have been looking at several different brushes at higher price points. I LOVE THIS BRUSH!!!! I used it with liquid foundation and to blend the foundation and concealer. Several of my beauty guru bloggers use this type of brush and it really helps. Follow up email from the company with instructions on washing the brush were timely and appreciated. Great job!</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  This is going to be my go-to for makeup brushes.  Very soft and the quality looks good.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days, so I can&#x27;t comment on durability, but the vendor is really proactive in telling you about the brush.  I liked that.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:48b35e4bea34f09f3a687013cc347441]]This is a very nice brush. The bristles are super soft. The handle is made out of wood and easy to grip. It comes in a zippered pouch big enough to add other brushes or make-up. This Kabuki brush is great for blending especially for the flat surfaces of your face. The soft bristles provides a full coverage when used with loose powder or liquid. Easy to clean and air dries fast, just don&#x27;t wet the handle because it is made out of wood. I purchased this item at a promotional price to product test. As a product tester, my reviews are based solely on my own experience and opinion of the item. This Kabuki Makeup Brush is a great addition to any make-up brush set. I gave it to my daughter to start her make-up brush and she loves it.</li>
    <li> First purchase with this Malika Jafrin- very nice feel and blends powdered mineral makeup well.&lt;br /&gt;Much softer then my other kabuki brushes and priced nicely as well. Will purchase more in the coming future :)</li>
    <li> I was surprised by the high quality of this product and mostly because of their customer oriented attitude. They even send me an email explaining that the brush may have a slight plastic smell but it goes away after a day. The brush comes inside a practical clear plastic sachet that can be reused for pencils, brushes or any makeup.&lt;br /&gt;And by the way, there was no smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic brush, great price.</li>
    <li> The results I had from using this brush were really great, I feel my make up was more even and &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34;, the fibers are very soft and nice quality. However, it was only my second time to use it and I broke the barrel right off from the handle when tapping water off from the bristles, opps. I feel like part of this is my bad, because I could have been a little too rough with it, but maybe this will be helpful for anyone else who taps their brushes on the sink after they wash it.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! It&#x27;s makes my makeup look so good. Highly recommend it!  UPDATE- Still loving this brush!! I wash it everyday because I am prone to breakouts so it is wearing pretty fast which is kind of a bummer, but I just ordered 2 more because I love the way it makes my makeup look and the price is not rediculous. &amp;#60;33</li>
    <li> I like to pride myself in my ability to apply makeup and keeping up with the latest beauty trends. This brush blew me out of the water. Until I received this I was using a beauty blender to apply my foundation. It applies so much nicer with this super soft kabuki brush. I washed it before use and did not see one hair shed. It is super soft, but not too soft. The flat top makes it easy to stipple the makeup onto your face and buff it in. It came in a nice reusable plastic zipper lock pouch and has netting to keep the brush hairs in place when not in use. My entire makeup game has changed because of this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> Very soft. Zero shedding, no odor, flawless coverage.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:fd4d34a1ddca97897072f9a911851ae4]] My Malika Jafrin Flat Top Kabuki Makeup Brush came in a plastic zippered bag with Professional Brush Kit information insert. Brush had an additional plastic sleeve over handle and brush protector over the bristles. Flat Top Kabuki Makeup Brush has very dense bristles, the hairs are very full and thick. Short hairs, very soft brush that feels good gliding across my face. Supposed to be good for liquid, and cream foundations. I would recommend not applying foundation directly to the kabuki brush, it will likely soak up a ton of product and be hard to clean. I poured a little foundation on the back of my hand (you can also dab it around your face). Stipple makeup onto brush and apply to desired area. Buff foundation in light circular motion to completely cover face. Makeup goes on very smooth. Leaves a heavier finish. If you see foundation past the white part of the brush, its time to wash.

    <li> I love this Flat Top Kabuki brush so much. I would really love to get all of the makeup brushes by Malika Jafrin after trying out this one, actually. The bristles are very densely packed which helps it pick up and hold a good amount of product. I was shocked at how soft it feels. It&#x27;s definitely one of the softest brushes I own. It feels so nice on my face and gives me an amazingly flawless application when I apply my foundation. The handle is thick making it really easy to hold. I could tell right away that this brush is very well made. It comes in a nice plastic pouch that slides closed for easy storage. It also has a clear plastic sleeve for over the bristles so you won&#x27;t have to worry about the bristles getting messed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I love my new Flat Top Kubiak Makeup Brush. The minute it arrived I instantly fell in love with it, the bristle are so soft and my makeup just glides on leaving a flawless look. Compared to my previous brush, that I spent a pretty penny for, my Kabuki outshines the others.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often and the last time I went to put some on, one of my kids ruined my old makeup brush.  I saw that this Flat Top Kabuki Makeup Brush was being offered at a great promotional price, so I thought what better time to buy a new brush than now.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a great brush. The bristles are soft and the makeup goes on evenly and doesn&#x27;t flake off while brushing it on.&lt;br /&gt;The brush came in very nice zipper pouch to keep it in so it doesn&#x27;t get ruined.</li>
    <li> amazing brush, applies foundation flawlessly with no streaks, will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Love it . will repurchase. It is very soft and flexible. I useit for foundation but this woiuld also be a great powder brush!</li>
    <li> This is by far the most amazing foundation brush I have ever used. This puts my current foundation brush to shame! I tend to use it sporadically, as it changes from my home makeup bag to whatever purse I&#x27;ve decided to tote around that day. It&#x27;s very compact, but still fluffy enough to get the job done. It&#x27;s VERY soft &amp; dense &amp; feels so good on my face. I love putting on my foundation because of this brush. This Kabuki brush does not shed like most brushes...really well made! I am loving this Malika Jafrin brush so much....I need to check out the entire line! I received a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this brush. It helps me blend my foundation very well. It is not true that you have to buy super expensive brushes for quality work. High recommend this brush &amp; great customer service and appreciation.</li>
    <li> Very good sturdy makeup brush blends makeup very well and evenly</li>
    <li> This Flat Top Kabuki Brush by Malika Jafrin is probably one of the best makeup brushes that I have ever owned (and trust me...I have a lot of makeup brushes!) It is soft, dense, and it doesn&#x27;t shed. The brush is about 6 or 7 inches long which is pretty standard with a good makeup brush. The black handle is made out of plastic with an aluminum piece that holds the bristles which are about 3/4 inch. This brush is &amp;#34;moldable.&amp;#34; You can use it to apply your foundation or if you squeeze the bristles you can create a great contouring brush. It applies my foundation flawlessly and it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks on my skin which is nice. This is definitely a great brush to add to your collection.

    <li> I have come to love flat-top kabuki brushes for applying my liquid foundation, so when I was given the opportunity to review this product in exchange for a discount, I was very interested!  I currently use a Coastal Scents BR-110, which is my holy grail flat-top.  Since that&#x27;s the standard I&#x27;m measuring against, I&#x27;m including pictures that compare this brush (left side) against the Coastal Scents brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE:&lt;br /&gt;Tie.  Malika Jafrin, $10.97 + free shipping, Coastal Scents $6.95 + $3.63 shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGING:&lt;br /&gt;Win.  Malika Jafrin comes in a plastic tube inside a zip-lock heavy-duty plastic case with a pink-and-white brocade insert that includes information about the brand and other brushes available from the seller.  The Coastal Scents brush that I pulled out of my stash is packaged simply in a foldover plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DENSITY:&lt;br /&gt;Lose: Coastal Scents has greater bristle density per brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOFTNESS:&lt;br /&gt;Tie.  Both brushes have very soft, pliable bristles, both of which are duotone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIZE:&lt;br /&gt;Lose.  Coastal Scents has a slightly longer brush head, although the handles are approximately the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would repurchase this item because, even after washing, the bristles were lush and thick, and I didn&#x27;t experience any shedding.  However, I didn&#x27;t give these a perfect 5/5 because my current favorite edges it out with regard to density and size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  Bottom line, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush to use with liquid foundation and it works beautifully.  It&#x27;s soft, but firm enough to get a great application.</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for foundation application, not harsh on the face. Love it</li>
    <li> This Flat top Kabuki Brush is better than I expected. It is very soft but not flimsy and glides acrosss my face. I use it to put on my foundation and it spreads out the foundation as required and what you expect. I find that the brush is better than any other out there and for sure worth the money you spend on it. It even comes ina bag that is perfect for it to protect it from touching other stuff in my makeup bag. This brush gets in all the creveces on my face and evenly distributes. I love this and would reccomend it for all people that wear makeup. I loved recieving this item for review and it is my new addition in my makeup kit.</li>
    <li> Hands down best make up brush ever. Super soft came in time and works great</li>
    <li> when I receive this product I was a little disappointed I thought it was going to be a lot bigger but its small perfect for travel size so you can bring it with you and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of space, I like the hair its really soft and it doesn&#x27;t shed like other brushes. I wish it was bigger but I still like it, its awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I receive this product for free or discount for reviewing purposes</li>
    <li> Awesome brush! No shedding, super soft and affordable. Great purchase!! I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
    <li> i am so happy with this brush it is unbelievable, no fall out and is very dense. but i did have one question. i did not receive any guides for cleaning it. which would have been very helpful. im new to makeup brushes and i was just wondering if maybe you could give me a quick run down on how to clean it.</li>
    <li> This brush is too soft for good coverage. It absorbs a lot of product and doesn&#x27;t distribute foundation evenly.</li>
    <li> I have not fallen in love with the brush, I&#x27;m a f-80 person Sigma brush for now.</li>
    <li> This foundation brush is very nice very soft and blends well with no shedding.  Price was great for this product.  Definitely recommend this seller will buy again from them</li>
    <li> Excellent brush for applying my liquid foundation.  The brush is soft and my foundation glides on like silk.  I&#x27;m so pleased that I found Malika Jafrin&#x27;s products.  Thank you Malika.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. I use drug store liquid foundation and this brush makes it blend so beautifully with minimal effort. I have never used a foundation brush that helps me with my foundation application like this one does. It is awesome and the price is awesome. So glad I found this brush.</li>
    <li> I am comparing this brush with the one I have had from ulta and loved for years. I was not sure if it would work as well. The first time I used it to blend my foundation I was in love! I threw my ulta brush away without a tear! Finally a great price and brush that will leave me at ease that if I lose it, break it or it gets worn out I can replace easier and faster!</li>
    <li> This brush far surpassed my expectations!  After buying many top tier brushes...some worked, some not, I now know where to go for quality and price marrying up.  An added bonus is the personal touch Malika generates.  I received a lovely email after placing the order thanking me for my business...good info there as well.  She just may be the &amp;#34;Apple&amp;#34; of makeup brushes!&lt;br /&gt;Sylvia Zalagenas</li>
    <li> I loved this brush! It is much smaller than my full size Kabuki Brush. It wouldnt make sense to bring such a big brush when I travel. So in order to keep my makeup bag smaller (if thats even possible) I will pack this brush. It does make foundation application a breeze. It is much easier than using your fingers. I pump a full squirt of foundation right on the end of the brush, it stays there very nicely. Then I buff it into my skin. I use a cc cream that is packed with all sorts of good stuff so you dont feel bad buffing it in. Then dab concealer for extra coverage on problem spots. Brush an over all powder to set your makeup and voila! You can easily do your full face of makeup in 3 minutes with this brush!</li>
    <li> I wish the bristles on the brushes  were a little firmer but the application is great on me and my clients so I&#x27;m keeping them</li>
    <li> I have never heard of this brand of brush but I wanted to give it a try.  This came quickly by mail and I was excited to open it.  I have always just bought the cheap-o brushes at the local pharmacy in the past and wanted to see what a better brush would be like.&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed is how soft the brush is, much better than my current brush.  I noticed it is for mineral foundation and I don&#x27;t wear foundation but I use these brushes for blush.  I just dipped it in my blush and tapped to make sure I didn&#x27;t have too much.  I used it on both cheeks and my blush was applied evenly and smoothly.  My friends swear by better brushes and now I can see why.  This is so soft on my face and does such a good job of applying my blush evenly.  Usually, I have to brush it on and then smooth it out so that my makeup is even but I just brushed this on and it was perfect. I also really like that this brush is cruelty-free and vegan.  This brush is also well made and durable which is great so it will last a long time.  Excellent brush and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> As a MUA I&#x27;m always looking for good brushes. I love the Malika Jafrin KF02 Flat Top Foundation Brush! It&#x27;s soft, glides smoothly across the skin, and blends flawlessly. It gets into all the small places of the face as well with no problem. Especially the nose area, inner V of the eye, cupid&#x27;s bow, and corners of the mouth. There was no shedding during application, or during spot and deep cleaning of the brush. I love that it came with it&#x27;s own plastic brush guard, which is very nice for keeping the shape of the brush. You can definitely tell this brush was handmade, and with love. The quality is right up there with more expensive, high end brushes, such as Mac, Sigma, and Bdellium. I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more brushes by Malika Jafrin for my kit.</li>
    <li> I have always used either my fingers or a Beauty Blender to apply liquid makeup to my face. LOVE this brush! I use it with Foundation, BB cream, CC Cream, and tinted moisturizer. and it looks so natural and soft.  It gives you flawless coverage, and the bristles are super soft, so even if you&#x27;re buffing in the makeup, it doesn&#x27;t scratch at your face. I would recommend buffing if you want a more shear coverage. If you want full coverage I would recommend really pushing the brush into your skin in padding motions. And it&#x27;s a breeze to clean! No shedding whatsoever. I recommend it! The seller is great! Packaging was simple and easy. Included instructions on the brush! Shipping was very fast, I received my order faster than expected!</li>
    <li> I received my Flat top Kabuki Makeup Brush and loved how soft the bristles were. A lot of makeup brushes are rough on the skin but this one is soft to the touch. It has a sturdy wooden handle to use, and it&#x27;s easy to grip and use. I like how I can apply my powder without having streaks of makeup on my face, it also blends the powder or foundation on your face well to. It looks great with blush on my cheeks. The bristles don&#x27;t fall out after uses like other brushes can. Great for all makeup uses</li>
    <li> This flat top kabuki brush is perfect it&#x27;s not too firm and not to soft. I use it to blend my mineral foundation and apply my setting powder it works great it blends my foundation in very well I would say that this brush works better with powder foundations than with creamy makeup. This is a well made kabuki brush the wooden handle is very sturdy and the brush is durable and super easy to clean. I have somewhat sensitive skin and I love that this brush isn&#x27;t harsh on my skin I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup often but when I do, I am pretty picky about how it looks.  The bristles exactly as the seller said and it allowed me to apply my makeup pretty flawlessly</li>
    <li> Great kabuki brush!  My old kabuki brush was made out of real hair and over time the hair kept falling out!  This one is made of synthetic hair which will last a lot longer and is said to blend better!  Super happy with the quality of the brush.  Had a strong durable handle and the bristles are smooth and soft.  This is one brush I am happy to as to my beauty regimen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*received for testing and review.</li>
    <li> Loveee it... i was skeptical at the beginning when i ordered it but now this is my everyday go to... buy it you will not regret it</li>
    <li> It is a very nice brush. The bristles are very soft that blends beautifully. It is perfect for liquid foundations. I did experience a little shedding when I first washed the brush, but it hasn&#x27;t shed since then. I totally recommend this brush to anyone who is a beginner at makeup and needs an inexpensive but excellent brush.</li>
    <li> I needed a brush to apply my liquid base, and this does a fantastic job. It blends well, and works just as well as my friend&#x27;s name-brand, pricy brush. It&#x27;s soft to the touch, and is very well made. I use it every day!</li>
