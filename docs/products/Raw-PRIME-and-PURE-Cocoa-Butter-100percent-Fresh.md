    <li> The picture makes it look like you&#x27;re getting raw, unprocessed cocoa butter. It actually comes in a bar. The cocoa butter still had a great smell &amp; worked for the lotion, sunblock &amp; chap stick I made. However, I would have preferred it unprocessed (not bars).</li>
    <li> I like the raw Cocoa butter</li>
    <li> This worked perfectly in my vanilla bean body butter recipe!</li>
    <li> Works well with my recipes.</li>
    <li> quick ship, good price!</li>
    <li> Yummy! but NOT FOR K9s (duh)!</li>
    <li> It worked well in the moisturizer bar recipe I purchased it for. I was a bit surprised that it came in wafers rather than the chunks that were pictured but it made for easy measuring.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for my order on the Raw Prime &amp; Cocoa Butter it works great! I love it.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and smells great!</li>
    <li> Great job,,, this product is fresh and works great in my products</li>
    <li> This product smells soooooooo good! I use it in combination with making homemade lotions and scrubs and it does wonders! I want to eat it! Great product and great purchase!</li>
    <li> This is my first cocoa butter purchase. It was liquid and doubled bagged, but it was 116 degrees in Yuma today. It had a very nice cocoa sent to it. The shea butter i ordered was very soft as well. I will be using this to make my first batch of soap.</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter is amazing, the smell is heavenly! It absorbs very quickly and is not greasy. I have used and ordered other cocoa butters but this is by far the best. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> So I am a freak and want to use real cocoa butter whenever possible in my baking and homemade health;/beauty stuff. We took a chocolate class at Greystone and my kids and I learned about what good chocolate was made from. The quality of this product seems legit. The price was great. My local healthfood store was selling a pound for 3x this amount that I got two pounds for. Will definitely buy again. I made THE best homemade lotion by melting 8 parts of this with one part coconut oil. I use it as a bath oil and put on right after a shower while I&#x27;m still beading. I smell like a chocolatey, coconuty tropical princess without all of the chemicals....and real ingredients! Can&#x27;t beat it for the teen in your life that wants to use baby prostitute spray from Bath/Body work and Victorianot a Secret places that are chemical filled.</li>
    <li> This is so amazing for your skin. If you have dry skin I highly recommend this over Shea or anything else raw or store boughten containing Cocoa butter. I made some lotion out of a couple different butters I purchased but love this one the best. It melts quickly in my hand and has made my dry troubled Minnesota skin feel amazing. Will continue to buy in raw form forever. Great buy super happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I received my product and I was very satisfied with it. I received my product in a plastic bag in chunks. It smells just like cocoa butter in the raw for not processed!!!!</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing! The lotion I have made with this is amazing!</li>
    <li> I purchased shea butter from here, so I decided to try there cocoa butter for my whipped cocoa butter recipe. All Smiles... Wonderful product</li>
    <li> I made some whipped body butters with this and it works great!  The cocoa butter was very fragrant, fresh and easy to use.  I was hoping for chunks of raw cocoa butter like in the picture but I got buttons which made it easy to use.  The description said, &amp;#34;raw,&amp;#34; several times:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;COCOA BUTTER, 1 OR 2 LBS, CHOOSE SIZE ABOVE&lt;br /&gt;RAW, ORGANIC COCOA BUTTER&lt;br /&gt;CERTIFIED ORGANIC&lt;br /&gt;FRESH, SEALED&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s processed into perfectly shaped buttons I&#x27;m not sure that they can be, &amp;#34;raw.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Product as described. I made body butter by combining with shea butter and almond oil.</li>
    <li> Fabulous! Using it in all our dairy free holiday goodies.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff. Smell is amazing, quality great and price is perfect. This is my 2nd shipment of this stuff</li>
    <li> Exactly as described fast shipping</li>
    <li> I was surprised when I opened the box and found the cocoa butter in small round disks instead of a 2 lb chunk.  I had no idea it was coming that way but it still worked at what I needed to use it for....actually probably melted down better than a large chunk as well.</li>
    <li> Came on time, and good quality!</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter has great color smell and texture. I am very happy with the quality of this! I will order again!</li>
    <li> Double bagged.  Shaves easily for melting and cuts with sharp knife.  No air bubbles.  Smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product for making high quality chocolate. I used it up in no time.&lt;br /&gt;Great value! I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I made a cocoa butter cream for my skin. The cocoa butter was very gritty, but once I mixed it with other oils the finished product was smooth.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with product, i order cocoa butter before unfortunately this time not from same merchant.&lt;br /&gt;This butter did not come in a natural unprocessed form, it came in hundreds of disc form with a funny smell.&lt;br /&gt;Very disaapointed and sending back asap.</li>
    <li> Good product and good aroma.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous cocoa butter for lip balms, body butter, whatever you might like.  It has a clean strong &amp;#34;chocolate-y&amp;#34; smell, as good cocoa butter should.  Will definitely purchase this again.</li>
