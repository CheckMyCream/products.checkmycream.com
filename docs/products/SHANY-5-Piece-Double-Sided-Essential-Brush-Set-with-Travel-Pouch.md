      <li>They shed too much and don&#x27;t feel as good of a quality as I thought they would.</li>

      <li>The carrying case is super convenient for one the go, but I prefer to use these at home.</li>
      <li>They come in a nice little travel case that&#x27;s an easy to clean material</li>
      <li>so international shipping is kind of a two week deal)</li>
      <li>It has many different size brushes and love the different colors :)</li>
      <li>The brushes are pretty soft, its an affordable beginners kit, I wish there was a little more variety in choice of brush type but still great.</li>
      <li>and it took the paint right off the brushes.</li>
      <li>great little travel brush set...great colors too!</li>
      <li>I have found that the makeup clings well to them and applies smoothly and, so far, I haven&#x27;t seen any shedding of bristles.  </li>

      <li>sizes are for eyeshadows and lips which is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My initial reaction was okay &amp;#34;this is taking forever.&amp;#34; The brushes seem to not cover</li>
      <li>I was hoping this would be a good alternative since it was small.  </li>
      <li>The SHANY 5 Piece Double Sided Essential Brush Set is a quality makeup brush set for an exceptional price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I guess the price should have been my first clue, but I expected a bit more.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect items, perfect purcharse! I&#x27;m completly satisficed.</li>
    <li> This set is Great! Its kinda small, but there are detailed pictures telling you the size, it think they are great for travel, and the little white bag is gorgeous, it came 5 days before I expected (I&#x27;m from Mexico so international shipping is kind of a two week deal) They came nicely packed. The texture of the brushes is soft and they have a great quality, Shany did not disappoint me. Don&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews for this product, they are about the size not the product itself, of course they are small, but functional and practical. (Here some photos, mini snickers to compare). Good Luck!</li>
    <li> cute set, too small, ended up giving them to my 7-year old niece to play with.</li>
    <li> Package came ontime..The brushes were smaller than expected.The brush hairs are soft  and very good quality.Im in love with the vibrant colors the brushes came in..The only issue I had  was the case(which is white)  it came in looked like something was spilled along the stitching where it zippers other than that Im satisfied.Its a great lil case to just throw in your purse when going out for the night or traveling.</li>
    <li> I love them! You can take it to go and great travel size☺</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a joke they expect you to use this for your face, like foundation or powders.&lt;br /&gt;The sizes are for eyeshadows and lips which is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;So for that it&#x27;s perfect, but you will need separate face brushes.</li>
    <li> I guess the price should have been my first clue, but I expected a bit more.  Just removing them from the packaging, the hairs were falling out everywhere.  I would hate to see how they would actually hold up to regular use. I do like the case and the colors, great concept but poor quality.  I would be willing to pay more for these brushes if they would make them out of better materials.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. They aren&#x27;t the best quality brushes but for this price, they are great as a traveling brush set. The bristles are very soft. I haven&#x27;t washed them yet, so I can&#x27;t comment on how they hold up during a wash. But I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding from using the brushes, which is good.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes nice quality.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive these brushed but when I got them I was a little disappointed. The packaging looked a little cheap and the brushed were a lot skinnier that I had expected. On a good note the brushes are very soft and seem like that would apply well. I will return with a review after I use them.</li>
    <li> The brushes arrived as expected. These are the perfect size to fit in my purse makeup pouch. The fact that they are double sided is also a great feature. They are really soft and work perfectly so far.</li>
    <li> The bristles are not the best quality, but it&#x27;s manageable. The case is small and decent size for a travel pack. Brushes are smaller than I thought they would be though.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for cost effective, adorable brushes look no further. These just came today and I love the set. It&#x27;s small enough to fit in my purse but the brushes are big enough to use comfortably. They come in a nice little travel case that&#x27;s an easy to clean material ( i get makeup on everything).  The brushes are double headed which gives you multiple sizes to use and the synthetic hair used is soft and even! Totally buying another set!</li>
    <li> A good selection but brushes are mini and not of full size. Thought about returning them. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again</li>
    <li> Got the product on time but it looks a bit cheaper than the picture shows</li>
    <li> I have availed the product on a discounted price. I like the packaging but I did not expect that they are very small. But size is just okay for me. Very handy and can be placed even in the pocket. I purchased this as a gift to my sister and she was very happy to receive it. She said she loves handy make up items. The feature that she likes most is that there are two brushes in one item. She said the bristles are really soft and do not irritate her face.</li>
    <li> this is small but I expected that already&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the brushes are good so far it only shed a little before I wash it.They are bright and colorful though which is good for travelling.&lt;br /&gt;It is so smooth good for putting eye make up but the one for blush is not really good for blush because as I said it is small so it will take time to apply the blush on but over all it is a good brushes mostly for the starters.</li>
    <li> This product brush is ok. I didn&#x27;t know it was that small.</li>
    <li> These were my wife&#x27;s purchase, she said these were just as great as any Sephora brush! She mentioned how she will no longer need to buy ridiculously expensive brushes again now that she has found these.</li>
    <li> I love these! Unlike some other brushes I&#x27;ve used before, these don&#x27;t spray your makeup all over your face. The bristles are really nice, not too soft and not too rough. The brushes themselves feel like they are built well, and will last a long time. The colors are super cute, and I love that they came with a guide to show you what they are for. The carrying case is super convenient for one the go, but I prefer to use these at home. I read some reviews that said they were really small, I didn&#x27;t have that issue at all. I thought they were perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the picture you can see these along with an EcoTools brush, for size comparison. Overall, a really great buy at a really great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I have received this product at a discount to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own.*</li>
    <li> I love them. Great brushes.</li>
    <li> Used an Amazon coupon and purchased these for a mere $5. Couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better deal or a better product.  I used them solely as eye brushes and they are perfect for precision application as well as blending and contouring.</li>
    <li> They shed too much and don&#x27;t feel as good of a quality as I thought they would. They are okay when you are in a pinch and have nothing else, for traveling I guess they&#x27;ll do, but I will still continue to look for a better set of quality travel brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift to give but now I want it, it is so cute and perfectly sized. The brushes are sturdy and made of quality stuff from what I can see and they appear that they will last. I haven&#x27;t used them because they are a gift but from what I can see these are amazing.</li>
    <li> I got this brush set for when I travel. I hate taken so many things with me. I was hoping this would be a good alternative since it was small.  When I went to Michigan last week I was excited to finally use these. My initial reaction was okay &amp;#34;this is taking forever.&amp;#34; The brushes seem to not cover and I was constantly reapplying in order to get the coverage needed.&lt;br /&gt;I continued to use them since this was all I brought with me. To my surprise, on day three of use the brush bristles started falling out. It was a huge mess. It was excessively and seemed to et stuck all over my face and it was all over my clothes. I was so upset and disappointed. The fact that they were small and double sided was a huge part of why I purchased, but the brushes are no good.</li>
    <li> too small, its like brushes for kids</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this set daily to apply makeup for work for about a week.  I love it.  I have more expensive brushes but I wanted something to keep in my purse and these brushes are performing as well as the more expensive ones!  Since they are also double sided, I have a much greater variety for different applications.  The brushes are perfect for eye makeup but you might need a separate bigger one for blush or powder.  It came in a cute white patent case but the only thing I don&#x27;t like are the loops in the case.  I find that when I try to reinsert one of the bushier brushes in the loop, it catches on the elastic so I have to leave the bigger brushes loose in the case as I don&#x27;t want to damage them.  I have found that the makeup clings well to them and applies smoothly and, so far, I haven&#x27;t seen any shedding of bristles.  Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> great little travel brush set...great colors too!</li>
    <li> only downfall the storage case is white and i put it in my make up bag got dirty super fast</li>
    <li> My sister in law loves this gift I gave her!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use Merle Norman Merle brushes, but I thought I would buy these as extra&#x27;s.  Since I haven&#x27;t used &#x27;cheap&#x27; brushes before, I really can&#x27;t say more than they are okay.  I have no complaints for the price.</li>
    <li> Got this little set for my granddaughter. She loves it! She tells me it&#x27;s handy and convenient. Small and compact and doesn&#x27;t take up much room. The quality of the brushes is amazing and she is now hooked on Shany!</li>
    <li> Applied my makeup and look bristles all over my face so I&#x27;m thinking as I&#x27;m brushing off my face, maybe because they&#x27;re new..... A week later second use and more bristles... Going back. Poor quality!!!!</li>
    <li> These are wonderful and affordable. The bright colors are appealing. My favorite brush is the tiny one that is perfect for applying eyeliner. I only bought these because there was a coupon, but I&#x27;ve actually been using them more than my more expensive set.</li>
    <li> cute and very convenient for the weekend travel we do during the summer.</li>
    <li> When I saw these Shany 5 piece double sided essential brush set with travel pouch I wanted them immediately.  What I did not know is that these were mini brushes.  These are so tiny.  I did not read the product details close enough.  The dimensions are 6 x 3 x 1 inches.  They are however cute,  and they come with their very own travel pouch.  I gave them to my daughter so she would have brushes she could take with her to camp.  She seems to really like them.  The style name is The Double Trouble:  Sable, Goat and synthetic bristles.  Includes powder, blush, foundation, bronzer, eye shadow, concealer and contour brushes.  Each brush is numbered and comes with detailed instructions for use.  I believe that you have everything you need to create beautiful makeup looks on the go,  and this set travels really well.  I got these at a discounted price for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Great brush set for the value&lt;br /&gt;- I love the colors of the brushes&lt;br /&gt;- The brushes themselves have worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The case is not the same as the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy a lot of brush sets to try with nail art. I will say that I did spill a little bit of nail polish remover close buy and it took the paint right off the brushes. This isn&#x27;t why I took a star off as this happens with most brushes. The brushes look just as picture however the case does not. The case is a cheap plastic like case and does not have the brand on it anywhere. I think this set would be 100x nicer with the case that is picture but for the price it still isn&#x27;t bad, the case is just not a favorite and may be a bit of an eyesore compare to the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case and brushes along with box are picture below.</li>
    <li> I purchased both the Double Trouble and the Luna brush sets.  They were very cute and inexpensive,  and I thought it would be fun to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both sets came in very nice packaging.  Each has an instruction sheet with pictures of each brush, it&#x27;s name, and a brief description of its function.  There is also a small pamphlet that pictures some of Shany&#x27;s other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both sets come with a carry case.  The Luna has a black vinyl roll up case that is secured with ties.  The D. T.  set has a white zip up pouch.  Both have elastic loops to secure the brushes.  (I think the D. T. case is the nicer of the two, by far.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Luna set has six double sided brushes for a total of twelve.  They have black handles and colorful bristles.  The appear to be well made.  These are not full size brushes.  They are obviously for travel.  I have not tried them with makeup,  yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The D. T. set is even smaller in size than the Luna.  This set only has five double sided brushes, totalling ten.  They have cute multi colored handles.  I have not used these yet, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just looking at the two sets, it seems like the Luna set would work better as a true travel set while the D. T. is small enough to fit in your purse to use for on the go touch ups.  Both sets are so small I can&#x27;t see them being practical for normal usage, especially the D. T.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try them out, at some point, and update my review accordingly.</li>
    <li> Nice for travel or to keep in purse. Mine had some discoration on the case, probably from the glue, nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush quality is very good, for the $5 price I paid I would recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a good set if you are going to travel. it is a little smaller then expected so if you have giant hands this might prove to be tricky using. But, for travel I think this is perfect. The brushes are pretty soft, its an affordable beginners kit, I wish there was a little more variety in choice of brush type but still great. The case for the brushes is really good for protection and is sturdy, it is white so you cant put it in dirt- but its a gloss finish so even if you do it seems it would be easy clean up. This is not a kit that will do everything but enough to help you get by.</li>
    <li> The SHANY 5 Piece Double Sided Essential Brush Set is a quality makeup brush set for an exceptional price.&lt;br /&gt;I love that they come with a &amp;#34;cheat sheet&amp;#34; explaining what each brush is for those of us who are brush challenged.&lt;br /&gt;As each brush serves a dual purpose, and the whole set slips into a zippered case, these brushes are perfect for everyday use or travel.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed no shedding, and it seems as if this set will have all of your makeup brush needs covered in one convenient package!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for evaluation and review, but I will be purchasing more, they will make great gifts!</li>
    <li> The pouch that come with the brushes has quite a strong &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; smell which go away if you air it for some time. Have not use te brushes yet but they look great.</li>
    <li> Perfectly compact for easy travel! Love how they are double sided and come in a zipped case! It has many different size brushes and love the different colors :)&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Not much more I just bought a discount to</li>
    <li> love how they work. I really thought they where not going to be all that great.</li>
    <li> Great brushes.  Loved them all.</li>
