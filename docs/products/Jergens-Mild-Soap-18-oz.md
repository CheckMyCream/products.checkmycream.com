### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Boy, was I very happy to see it on Amazon!!!</li>
      <li>This works wonderfully for each member of my family.</li>
      <li>Jergens neither dries out nor causes skin to break out; neither clogs the sinuses nor causes them to drain; while working beautifully for every family member from youngest to oldest.  </li>
      <li>but it cleans, and it&#x27;s great for me and my toddler.</li>
      <li>Great soap.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great value and doesn&#x27;t contain extras like deodorant, perfume or colors.</li>
      <li>It does a great job cleaning too.</li>
      <li>Great price for the amount of soap.</li>

      <li>Thankfully I found it on Amazon at a Better price so who could ask for more?</li>
      <li>I love Jergens soap</li>
      <li>Great item and fast service.</li>
      <li>What more can you ask for?  </li>
      <li>soaps you buy in the aisles of your favorite store contain the nastiest scents that the marketing department can invent.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of Jergen&#x27;s soap for many years.</li>
      <li>Now I know where I&#x27;ll always be able to get it.</li>
      <li>After trying many soaps over the years, my search has ended with this one.</li>
      <li>Great buy, hubby&#x27;s favorite and only brand of soap he ever uses, nice to get it here.</li>
      <li>Jergens mild soap works great, does not dry out your skin, and cleans well with a very mild pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>This is a REAL BARGAIN, you get 24 bars for a great price, and free shipping if you have Amazon Prime</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin like advertised.</li>
      <li>soap has a very mild scent if any.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent</li>
      <li>I love this Jergens Mild Soap.</li>
      <li>I love the fresh light fragrance and how smooth it is.</li>
      <li>It used to be available in ALL stores.  </li>
      <li>I like this mild soap.  </li>
      <li>Soap is mild and doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.</li>
      <li>When the soap arrived it had a slightly congealed texture as if it had been sitting in a very warm and humid spot for awhile.</li>
      <li>I now have several years supply of this good soap, thanks to Amazon.</li>
      <li>It is economically priced.</li>
      <li>(well worth the cost, trust me).</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected, on time and a good price.</li>
      <li>I also love that these are personal bar size soaps.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>Nice scent, especially since there are so many other soap scents I can&#x27;t tolerate.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave that scummy residue like so many other soaps do and it has a mild fragrance that my wife likes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just about the same as you find in high end hotels, maybe better.</li>
      <li>For the price it really can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
      <li>Very sudsy.</li>
      <li>The size of the 3.5 ounce bar is a good alternate to the large bricks typically sold.</li>
      <li>I thought the price was high and expected more in the package.</li>
      <li>Jergens is the only soap mild enough to keep his skin happy, and we use it year round.</li>
      <li>It goes through the drain extremely proficiently. !00% satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive.  </li>
      <li>The bars last a decent amount of time and the price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist recommended this bar soap 30 years ago for my sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had to peel the paper wrapper from every bar I&#x27;ve opened so far.</li>
      <li>This soap cleans well but is also gentle at the same time.  </li>
      <li>These bars are very mild and don&#x27;t dry out my skin like other soap bars.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but occasionally I become allergic to toiletries (dove soap, American Crew Shampoo).</li>
      <li>This soap is lightly scented, long lasting and does not seem to produce as much soap scum as a lot of the more expensive soaps, especially deodorant soaps.  </li>
      <li>24 bars is pretty heavy, so you probably don&#x27;t want to pay shipping on this.</li>

<li> It is hard to get the paper off though.  </li>
<li> It can be very difficult to find, so I appreciate Amazon distributing it, especially as Lily on Subscribe and Save.</li>
<li> Alas, it seems to be disappearing from stores.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, very difficult to find anymore.</li>
<li> I have used it for 35 years and have never been disappointed.</li>

    <li> Leave your skin very smooth</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for use on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this bar soap 30 years ago for my sensitive skin and I have been using it with satisfaction since then.  It can be very difficult to find, so I appreciate Amazon distributing it, especially as Lily on Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> Great item and fast service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Jergens for almost 30 years.  It used to be available in ALL stores.  Today, I can find it only at Dollar Tree or through Amazon.  Jergens neither dries out nor causes skin to break out; neither clogs the sinuses nor causes them to drain; while working beautifully for every family member from youngest to oldest.  In my life, Kirk&#x27;s Castile soap is for my face and hair.  Jergens soap is for everything else.</li>
    <li> I love this Jergens Mild Soap. Very sudsy. Nice scent, especially since there are so many other soap scents I can&#x27;t tolerate. This scent does not give me a headache. I can no longer get this soap at Safeway, and Target. I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in my town here in So. Calif. So glad I checked on Amazon to see if this soap is still being sold. Boy, was I very happy to see it on Amazon!!! Now I know where I&#x27;ll always be able to get it. Thank you, Amazon!</li>
    <li> My husband has dry skin that gets especially itchy during winter.  Jergens is the only soap mild enough to keep his skin happy, and we use it year round.</li>
    <li> Great price for the amount of soap. Great for sensitive skin like advertised.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for decades because I don&#x27;t want to use soaps infused with antiperspirants, breath fresheners, and all kinds of stupid chemicals and super irritating scents. Jergens mild soap works great, does not dry out your skin, and cleans well with a very mild pleasant scent. Alas, it seems to be disappearing from stores. It is gone from my grocery stores and drug stores. I have seen it at K-Mart, but not often, so I turned to AMAZON! Saved. This is a REAL BARGAIN, you get 24 bars for a great price, and free shipping if you have Amazon Prime (well worth the cost, trust me). I now have several years supply of this good soap, thanks to Amazon. 24 bars is pretty heavy, so you probably don&#x27;t want to pay shipping on this.</li>
    <li> Great value for a pretty good soap.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh light fragrance and how smooth it is.</li>
    <li> After trying many soaps over the years, my search has ended with this one. I use this in the shower daily and it never irritates. Smells good too. The bars last a decent amount of time and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Definitely going to be my go to soap for the rest of my life! I have been spending money on dove when they both do the same thing. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent but it cleans, and it&#x27;s great for me and my toddler.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and works well. Will by again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 20 years. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but occasionally I become allergic to toiletries (dove soap, American Crew Shampoo). So, I have stuck with this one because I like the smell and feel. It I hard to find in stores, except Kmart.&lt;br /&gt;On an off note, this was six bars. I thought the price was high and expected more in the package. The qty description was not clear.</li>
    <li> This soap is lightly scented, long lasting and does not seem to produce as much soap scum as a lot of the more expensive soaps, especially deodorant soaps.  It is economically priced. I have used it for 35 years and have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> These have a pleasant scent. These bars are very mild and don&#x27;t dry out my skin like other soap bars. My family used to use Jergens soap when I was a kid, so this brought back a lot of memories.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected, on time and a good price.</li>
    <li> Love this soap and so happy to have found it on Amazon.  My skin is very sensitive.  I can&#x27;t even use Dove soap.  This soap cleans well but is also gentle at the same time.  I also love that these are personal bar size soaps.</li>
    <li> Its just good, cheap soap!  What more can you ask for?  For the price it really can&#x27;t be beat.  Stock up!</li>
    <li> It is the best soap is far as I&#x27;am concerned. Started using this product about 30 years ago. It goes through the drain extremely proficiently. !00% satisfied with it. Ed</li>
    <li> This is the only bath soap my husband is not allergic to.</li>
    <li> Great buy, hubby&#x27;s favorite and only brand of soap he ever uses, nice to get it here.</li>
    <li> I like this mild soap.  It is hard to get the paper off though.  sometimes it sticks on and you have to spend bunch of time picking off the paper wrapper.  Also the die from the label seems to leak into the product (red) due to the moistness that seems to be how they make this soap.  I wonder if the dies are potentially harmful since this product is used to wash skin.</li>
    <li> all as described, only soap my skin does not react to</li>
    <li> I love Jergens soap but it&#x27;s getting harder to find so I turned to Amazon to order in bulk. When the soap arrived it had a slightly congealed texture as if it had been sitting in a very warm and humid spot for awhile. I&#x27;ve had to peel the paper wrapper from every bar I&#x27;ve opened so far. Not a huge deal but is I had a choice I would have opted for a &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; variety.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for years and when the store I bought it from stopped selling it I was lost. Thankfully I found it on Amazon at a Better price so who could ask for more? As long as they sell it I&#x27;ll buy it. It doesn&#x27;t leave that scummy residue like so many other soaps do and it has a mild fragrance that my wife likes. It does a great job cleaning too. It&#x27;s just about the same as you find in high end hotels, maybe better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Jergen&#x27;s soap for many years. it&#x27;s a great value and doesn&#x27;t contain extras like deodorant, perfume or colors. Unfortunately, very difficult to find anymore. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> A lot of soap for little money. Soap is mild and doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.</li>
    <li> Remember this from my childhood.  Great mild soap.</li>
    <li> Great soap.  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;Most soaps you buy in the aisles of your favorite store contain the nastiest scents that the marketing department can invent.&lt;br /&gt;This soap has a very mild scent if any.  The size of the 3.5 ounce bar is a good alternate to the large bricks typically sold.</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully for each member of my family. The soap moisturizes and does not affect our sinusitis.&lt;br /&gt;This is one we use all year round.</li>
    <li> Have used this all my life - - no allergies to it.  Not available everywhere.</li>
