<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Vale la pena... Me gusta bastante el perfume</li>
    <li> AWSOME FRAGRANCE.MUST HAVE SUMMER FRAG!!!!!!! For the aquatic lovers.smells so nice on my dad.</li>
    <li> This product is certainly for my personal use. I&#x27;ve been using this product since 2007. I have a lot of other products on same category as this Bvlgari Aqua for men Eau De Tilette Spray but nothing surpasses this one.</li>
    <li> Genuine product. Arrived on time. Smells really good</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It has a strange note in the beginning. But slowly tapers off. I think I may gift this to someone else.</li>
    <li> To all fellow Amazon shoppers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a very frequent purchaser from Amazon.com.  To their credit, I&#x27;ve given only one single review below 4 stars.  This is simply because I&#x27;ve always had very positive experiences with every order (which total at least 200).  Unfortunately, this past one was not a positive experience - not even close.  I have been wearing this exact brand of cologne for over 4 years now, and I can state with 99% confidence that what I received was not the genuine product.  The scent reeked of ethyl alcohol and wore off in a matter of minutes.  Like so many of you know, the genuine product lasts for many hours and has almost no scent of rubbing alcohol.  Furthermore, I was extremely annoyed to read that I would be unable to return this fake item.  My intention with this review is not meant to completely deter anybody from purchasing this product; rather, it is simply a warning to the prospective buyers.  The bottom line is this - just because the price is good does not give give ANY manufacturer or distributor leave to misrepresent their merchandise to the public.  The sad truth is that you could easily track down a similar imitation version at CVS, Walgreen&#x27;s, Rite Aid, or even a Dollar Store.</li>
    <li> I either got 2 bad batches, or the smell itself is incredibly faint. Let me preface this by saying that I am definitely not one of those people that douses himself in cologne. My normal scent is Green Irish Tweed by Creed, but I wanted something a little more summery, so I read some reviews on this one. When the product arrived, I thought I&#x27;d gotten a knock off. It smelled like someone had poured out the cologne, and put in rubbing alcohol. There was only the faintest hint of something else. I called Amazon, and they sent a new one. The smell was maybe only a little stronger, but still overpowered with the smell of rubbing alcohol. I plan on finding some at a department store to see if I got two bad knock-offs, or if the scent is just not for me.</li>
    <li> Bvlgari Aqva is a favorite.  We were very glad to find it at such a good deal.  We received our purchase in a timely manner.  The packaging was sufficient.  We would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Amazing.</li>
    <li> very good product , it was what I expected , I recommend hundred percent, I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Great scent! I had been hearing good things about this, so I went to a department store near me and got a sample. I tried it on and wore it the rest of the day to test it out. Unlike other colognes I have used, this one lasts very long. It is not overpowering or anything like that. This may be my new favorite fragrance. I am not very good with describing scents, but I would recommend at least going to a store and trying it on. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.     On a side note: Amazon offered this about $30 cheaper than the store that I tried it on at. It also arrived before the estimated shipping date with everything in great condition.</li>
    <li> very happy. item was as described and shipped well and quickly...</li>
    <li> I thought this would smell fresh water but it rather smells like pine trees. It smells okay but after 30 minutes of smelling this, I get extremely sick to the point where I want to vomit. I&#x27;d rate this cologne a 7/10 because it can pull off for a casual day. But I wouldn&#x27;t expect the ladies to leech on you though like at a club or something.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd time I have purchased this colone for my husband.  We first got turned on to it after my brother brought some back from Paris.  We can&#x27;t find it locally where we live so I was very pleased to see that Amazon carries it and the price was very reasonable.  My husband gets compliments on it pretty much daily.  People always want to know what he is wearing.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if its genuine....</li>
    <li> I usually hate cologne, but this one is very subtle and pleasant. Bvlgari also comes out w/ eau de vert, if you find even this one too strong.</li>
    <li> This scent is like Aqua di Gio.  Bvlgari is in great bottle-shaped.  I like this brand so much.</li>
    <li> Purchased this scent as a gift for my 28 year-old brother. Smells divine on him! Women ask him all the time what he&#x27;s wearing ... and of course, the name BULGARI means it&#x27;s expensive. This scent is strong though -- very manly and commanding. I know that fragrances smell different on each person due to different body chemistry. I recommend trying it first before purchasing a full size one. I am purchasing one for my husband, too, fortunately, it also smells divine on him.</li>
    <li> Since this cologne has gotten great reviews I decided to get one for myself.    I&#x27;m not sure if the one I bought was watered down or not, but this scent is not for everyone.  Im a young guy and I don&#x27;t think this scent is for me. Im surprised that the reviews for it are this high, since everyone else I let smell it, had the same impression.  Not bad but not like something out of the ordinary.  I&#x27;ll stick to Polo Blue, Black and Cool Water.</li>
    <li> Great quality, fits well.</li>
    <li> Excelente... 100% original</li>
    <li> This product is fake.My last one was from Sephora and I compared the bottles.The tip on this one is a softer plastic and it moves.That is why it is even cheaper than duty-free</li>
    <li> Item shipped very fast. Item was exactly as described. Very happy. No issues</li>
    <li> shipped fast &amp; great product</li>
    <li> I JUST received this amazing fragrance today and I fell in love with it at first spray. I have used several other brands before, like Boss, CK, Polo among others, but this is totally different and I will recommend to friends and colleagues.    thanks, Amazon, for your quick free delivery and good packaging.[[ASIN:B000C1UBFQ Bvlgari Aqua By Bvlgari For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces]]</li>
    <li> about few years i used bulgari aqua home and i use only original parfum, actually i bought it from duty free, but that bulgari which i bought from amazon llc is not original!</li>
    <li> This was as simple as can be.&lt;br /&gt;Was a bit sceptical at first as i never even smelled this one before and i am very picky when it comes to my cologne.&lt;br /&gt;But took a shot at it based on the reviews on multiple websites and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived very quickly and in a nice packaging.&lt;br /&gt;It does last and my lady loves it as much as i do.&lt;br /&gt;So i would say based on my experience it&#x27;s a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;Have a good day and thx.</li>
    <li> Before I had been using Armani Black, which was good but as more people kept buying it I became sick of smelling like every other male from ages 19-25. So on a whim I purchased Bvlgari Aqua and I&#x27;m happy to say that I have no regrets. While noticeable, Aqua provides a light and playful scent that could be worn daily if chosen to do so. Whether you&#x27;re going clubbing, dinner, or to an interview, Bvlgari Aqua is a great choice.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments from girls and guys alike about the smell. Sometimes when my roommates go out they ask to borrow it because it smells better than their colognes. I give this cologne my highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> 12/1/2014 update: I was looking at my original review of this cologne. I simply had no choice but to delete it. I remember being so impressed with the first 2 bottles of cologne I purchased. I have continued buying the product all these years(approx. i per year) and I have no choice but to post this disappointing update...which will apply to the last several 3.4 oz. bottles purchased, from 1/2012 to 12/2014.&lt;br /&gt;I had been giving the product the benefit of the doubt on this, since I don&#x27;t have a lot of faith in the sharpness of my olfactory senses. During at least the last 3 years, the product I&#x27;ve been receiving seemed extremely weak, and very watered down. The fragrance does in fact disappear soon after putting it on, as so many others have mentioned. Whereas before, 2 sprays would suffice for a scent that was quality enough to last for days...for 3 years now, I have found myself forced to apply at least 4 to 5 strong sprays(more than twice as much as before)only to have it vaporize into nothing in short order. I just couldn&#x27;t believe the disappointing difference in product quality! Before, as stated in my earlier review, I was getting numerous compliments and interest in this fragrance, but as stated...over the last 3 years, beginning rather abruptly I might add, all comments and interest vanished into thin air, just like this apparently watered down product. I thought it may have been me. As I mentioned, I feel like my olfactory senses aren&#x27;t the sharpest in the world...but this is just crazy! To think that someone would take such a quality product, dilute it to this degree, manipulate and rob the buying public, and even succeed in getting the fake item past the buyers at a corporate giant like Amazon, who no doubt has measures in place to prevent such a problem from developing, is nothing short of amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Well, to finish my story, it was time for me to buy this item again, but because of the ongoing problems I was experiencing with this product, I decided to return to the reviews section first, to see what other people were saying. I was SHOCKED to find so many others having the exact same issues! Incredibly disturbing! I will tell you, I am still completely SOLD on the REAL BVLGARI AQVA, but now I know why the comments have completely vanished, as if I was wearing nothing...because, evidently I&#x27;m not. Very troubling! I would love to see some lab reports on testing of this currently available product, compared to the real quality item. There is just no way this product is not a fake. I even have the missing label at the bottom of the bottle, several others have mentioned. Now it&#x27;s all becoming clear. I wonder if the consumer news fragment, \\&quot;Deal or Dud?\\&quot; or some other interested consumer awareness group would be interested in this obviously large scale, organized rip off?&lt;br /&gt;I will still be buying the product, but suffice it to say, I am concerned about further purchases from this stock, after the problem has been neglected for so many years. I am certainly a witness to that unchanging fact. Hope they get this fixed. It&#x27;s disappointing that Amazon has to take a hit on their reputation for debauchery such as this. There&#x27;s no way any major corporation would put their reputation on the line for something as obvious as this. I really don&#x27;t believe they are aware of the magnitude of the problem.d to return to the reviews section first, to see what other people were saying.

    <li> Been wearing it for years and it still drives the wife crazy... in a good way!</li>
    <li> Very nice scent, just can&#x27;t find words to describe how excellent is it. Definitely would recommend and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Good size,  great perfume I love it</li>
    <li> Totally loved it, just as expected or better. My son loved it. Good gift option. It lasts all day long</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t think this is the original Bulgari. Fragrance does not last for more than 1 hr.</li>
    <li> Very elegant fragrance not fruity. Exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Unique scent which absolutely delivers!  This one should easily crack anyone&#x27;s top 5!  Very refined and mature scent, but not at all overwhelming.  This cologne will elevate your game!  My 2 cents......not for a boy....great bet for 30 &amp; up crowd!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it as my daily wear, usually get compliments on it and I just love that smell that stays with you all day. I have no complaints. If you like more &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; style colognes, this will suit your taste. Maybe head down to your local Macy&#x27;s and give it a little test before hand, but I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Bulgari Aqua for my husband because a friend told me the smell was really good. I can say that I am very pleased with the purchase as is my husband. As always, Amazon delivered the product in time and I don&#x27;t have any complain. I recommend this perfume to anyone.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know this Bvlgari scent until my brother showed it to me and my son. It&#x27;s a very masculine and refined fragance, perfect.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. smells extremely manly. Everyone loves it.</li>
    <li> I dont know when I saw this one in mall it was awesome..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but this one the fragrance wears off soon. I dont like this, I am going back to hugo boss original.</li>
    <li> Aqua&#x27;s one of the best real aquatic fragrances made so far, in my opinion. Easy to request, but tougher to bottle the idea, \\&quot;make it smell like the ocean\\&quot;. Success. The spinoff fragrance &#x27;Bulgari Aqua Marine&#x27; is also very appealing to me, but I prefer Aqua&#x27;s stronger scent. Aqua is spicy and invigorating, even to those who aren&#x27;t fragrance enthusiasts like myself. The posidonia seaweed gives it a unique and distinctly ocean-inspired fragrance that lends legitimacy to its Aqua moniker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A true aquatic by scent, and not just by name, like so many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ocean breeze washing over a wind swept beach in a bottle. It hasn&#x27;t been around that long (2005), but it&#x27;s already an often imitated classic. Initial stronger citrusy notes fade a bit after an hour or so, leaving that oceanic posidonia more prominent. (sniff) Ah, nice. Overall longevity is good. Around 6 hours on my skin, 12 hours or more on clothes. Truly, a fine thing. Amazon pricing gives us this luxury item for much less than the mall.</li>
    <li> Great product and a great price. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> It is one of the best smelling perfume that is, is simply sensational. Recommend purchase if you want something really good and quality.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells like a lot of \\&quot;blue\\&quot; colognes which i&#x27;ve smelled over the years.  It&#x27;s a nice fragrance but i&#x27;ve now worn it off and on for 2 months and I don&#x27;t remember anyone ever commenting on it.  It sort of reminds me of an old Nautica cologne I used to wear when I was in my late teens.  It is a decent cologne and you certainly won&#x27;t get anyone telling you you smell badly- but if you spend $50 on a cologne you want it to POP a bit more than this one does.  That is my impression- maybe someone else will buy it and love it.  A few days ago, I bought Curve Crush on here for $26 for 6.8 oounces and i think I like that cologne more- it makes more of a statement and is a little more powerful and unique smelling.</li>
    <li> Great spring/summer cologne that brings out the ocean.</li>
    <li> this perfum is fake dont buy this. the box looks bad and the essence remains just minutes. ill never go to buy a perfum online.</li>
    <li> I just got the cologne its smell good and nicely packed ... Awesome</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking to capture the same smell that you get from Bvlgari bath products, this is the cologne you want. One word to summarize the scent is fresh! It&#x27;s got a very clean scent, just showered smell to it with a hint of musk on the finish.</li>
    <li> really nice scent- clean- stay on for a long time- good price and I would definitely purchase again- I just love this scent</li>
    <li> I like it! Use it, instead of deodorant!</li>
    <li> smells delicious! I always love this brand as for female and male. I hope that will be the prefect gifts !</li>
    <li> A new co-worker of mine wears this and every morning I would know when he arrived because I could smell it and it was awesome!  I bought it for my boyfriend and it is just as nice on him (thank goodness - ha ha!).  I can&#x27;t describe it - just go to the store and test it out, but buy it on Amazon because I priced it and found the lowest price here!</li>
    <li> This is not original!!!! The smell is not felt! Box is not original</li>
    <li> This perfume was one of the gifts I gave my husband for his birthday and he liked it a lot!I think its really good for the price!</li>
    <li> Now this is the boss, use just a little an it stay on forever on you or whatever you used it on</li>
    <li> Bought it for a friend. Definitely a great classic scent.&lt;br /&gt;It was a lot more cologne than I had imagined.&lt;br /&gt;He loved it!</li>
    <li> I love this Eau de Toilet it si so clean and refreshing and still is manly.This is the third bottle I have purchased.</li>
    <li> It smells fresh and good. Not something that would grab anybody&#x27;s attention. But the real minus is that it doesn&#x27;t last for more than a couple of hours. After that there is no trace of it.</li>
    <li> one of the best purchases I have made.. get amazing comments when I wear it.. smell is fresh and doesn&#x27;t overpower..</li>
    <li> Smell good but it doesn&#x27;t linger long enough</li>
    <li> I bought it for someone else, but i think i enjoy it more than they do...lol    it smells like heaven...</li>
    <li> Hate it. I got a fake one</li>
    <li> I am not sure if they have changed their scent, or if this is fake, but when i received the bottle, the whole plastic part came apart from the glass, then it didn&#x27;t smell anything like my older bottle which had a few sprays left, but clearly different and not very desirable. emailed the seller with no response. hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Another fabulous scent.</li>
    <li> as advertised on time.  all good</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne. :D</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne my husband has worn for the past 4 years since I gave it to him on valentines day 4 years ago. It has such a fresh smell and he has gotten compliments from other people on the scent as well. He goes through it very quickly and I&#x27;m happy to have found such a great deal on it on amazon!</li>
    <li> Great product came on time, the package really good, smells good and still all day, I recommend this product great for price</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for some time now and receive many compliments. It is not an overpowering scent but has a strong invigorating smell. The women seem to love the way it smells even when you first spray it on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really cool Men&#x27;s perfume and I like the shape of the bottle because it is so handy to carry when you travel. Amazon also has a good price on this, so that made the decision to buy easier!</li>
    <li> Bought it to my boyfriend :) and he like it. very nice and fast delivery ty!!!</li>
    <li> nice light fragrance, get a lot of complements on it.  Summertime fragrance for sure.  Ladies like men who smell good, get a bottle!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, and so will your partner. BUY IT!!!</li>
    <li> I always get complimented when I wear this. The smell lasts long but it is also subtle so you don&#x27;t become &amp;#34;that guy.&amp;#34; You know, &amp;#34;that guy&amp;#34; that reeks of overpowering cologne.</li>
    <li> I smelled it first in Beverly Hills, and is the sexiest smell. It smells like a natural aroma that good looking people naturally release from their body. It is proven that good looking people release a much nicer aroma when they sweat, than ugly people. And this cologne smells like a very hot friend I have after going to the gym.</li>
    <li> Great Men&#x27;s cologne.  The scent is great, not to overpowering and not too sweet.  Great price.  Checkout Macy&#x27;s or Nordstrom&#x27;s price then you will purchase from Amazonie.</li>
    <li> Having never used this product before I was not familiar with it. I noticed immediately that the scent did not last very long and up on investigating further I have come to the conclusion that this is a fake or beyond expiration date product. After examining the bottle I discovered that a small portion of the label on the bottle had been cut out and removed. This was discovered after reading others reviews of this product. I am extremely disappointed in this product since it was sold by Amazon. If I had discovered this earlier I would have sent it back to Amazon. One star is the least I could give, otherwise I would rate it even lower.</li>
    <li> I am a regular guy. This bottle put me on the hot list at work..This will let you get all the girls. You will smell great. You dont need a lot. A dab, will do ya. I bought this one and the extrem. Both will make you a GOD!! Ladies will talk about how great you smell. This is the good stufff Bothers. enjoy.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift for my brother on his brother and he loved it. The smell is such that it&#x27;s not for those too young but neither is it stuffy or over-powering like those marketed for older men either. Over all, a great purchase!</li>
    <li> If you want to impact a lady, this is the fragance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strong, classic and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this perfume for the night and weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A shame the packaging from amazon, because it spill it all over.</li>
    <li> Really is same that The store, the price is very good and the product too....</li>
    <li> Out dated product the fragrance is gone I will never buy this product from Amazon ever again.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve waisted my money</li>
    <li> well, everyone has a different taste i believe.&lt;br /&gt;but as a fragrance collector, i personally love this one, i have bought 6 bottles in less than three years. i can&#x27;t imagine not wearing it at least once a week.</li>
    <li> nice look, nice scent, price is right , so u cant go wrong with this. great everyday scent very long lasting.</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance, I use it almost everyday, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s in the same range as GIO and Versace, these are the basics that I use</li>
    <li> Smells very refreshing and crisp like a walk on the beach. Great cologne</li>
    <li> this perfumes is one my husbands favorite perfumes, and i can always find it here at a great price. :)</li>
    <li> I used this before. It&#x27;s pretty good and not overpowering. Although I like the Bulgari AQVA Marine better. It smells fresh, clean and light yet it last all day long. The price here is cheaper though.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, great price. \\&quot;Chicks dig it!!!!!\\&quot; Seriously though this fragrence is strong, but not over-powering  . Clean, manly and attractive.</li>
    <li> Great cologne, love it. It has a fresh smell yet a bit of mustyness , very manly smell but yet sofisticated</li>
    <li> The perfume is great as expected. last for couple of days. highly recommended. ... . ... .. . . . . ...</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff, and Amazon has it for a great price, but PRIME SHIPPING BONUS.  I&#x27;ll keep buying this for him on Amazon as long as it stays at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Bulgary is may second fragrance for men very good, totally recommended, like Carolina, both are excellent choices.  I recommend this fragance</li>
    <li> Never received my package~ please send me or credit my account!!!!!! Have no way of contacting you except this way!!!</li>
    <li> awesome smell ... and persist</li>
    <li> The product as stated. Simple as that. Nothing wrong with packaging or anything.</li>
    <li> I used to be an employee at a perfume shop locally and wasn&#x27;t too hesitant about buying this online. The only problem was not being able to see the bottle or smell it beforehand. I became really familiar with this cologne when working at the perfume shop, so I knew right away the packaging is exactly the same. The scent is amazing. It smells so good on my boyfriend! I really recommend it for someone who doesn&#x27;t go for the typical citrus or fresh scents that seem to be floating around in all colognes these days. This has a bit of a spice to it, but it mixes so well with the fresh scent it has. My boyfriend hasn&#x27;t had one complaint about it and it seems to last a good while on his skin. I don&#x27;t know why people say this is for a grown man. My boyfriend is 21 and I know lots of younger men who wear it. I guess it depends on your confidence in it!</li>
    <li> I switch perfumes after each one finishes, which is usually one every month. Well I have used this Bvlgari two consecutive months and I am going for a third which may be a record. This perfume is excellent. Gentle not overpowering, long lasting. Great smell.</li>
    <li> I love this colony  is elegant my husband  love it too♡♡</li>
    <li> I got this gift for my partner and they LOVE it! Every time I smell it I get turned on!! I would highly reccomend.</li>
    <li> Fan of different cologne products, and this is my first time trying out this product. Have to say I&#x27;m impressed, very laidback smell to it. Good for almost any situation, especially a bite out with the significant other.</li>
    <li> I am a 34 year old male who has been purchasing various cologne products since holding my first job at 16 years of age. Does that make me an expert? Of course not, but Bvlgari AQUA 3.4oz Eau De Spray for men, in the circular bottle, is by far THE best, and longest lasting male cologne I&#x27;ve EVER had the pleasure of owning. A day does not go by, whether at work or in public, without both men and women making comments and inquiries. Take a chance like I did in purchasing this cologne, and I promise, you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> The product is fantastic. I am loving it. Everyone loves it. It worths the money. It has become part of my identity. Infact Bvlgari Aqua is the best!!!</li>
    <li> Better than expected. Great scent and beautiful package. Here are a bunch more words to fill the required space k</li>
    <li> My wife specifically asked me to get a refill on this. She loves it and it makes her INSANE! ROFL.  How could I NOT give it a five star rating?????? great price too.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this Cologne! It&#x27;s become my signature scent from first use and I fell in love with it ever since.</li>
    <li> Spray: 1 Chest, 1 Neck, 1 ea. wrist and you cant go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this is more of a aquatic cologne and worn mostly in the summer season, Bvlgari Aqva can be worn as your signature scent. Projection is good, last 6-7 hours (on my skin). Sprayer can be a little tricky and reminds me of Thierry Mugler A&#x27;men&#x27;s cologne, which mean soft spraying will drip liquid, so spray hard.</li>
    <li> ... but at least I smell better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously the quality of a fragrance is very subjective.  But objectively this fragrance whether you like it or not (and I do, which is more important than what all those women rejecting me think) lasts the whole night out from the early evening dinner to early in the morning when the bars close and I inevitably go home alone.</li>
    <li> Ive read the reviews of other people and solely relied on them, I dont know what kind of taste do these people have, but I wouldnt rate this anything above mediocre.</li>
    <li> This is a classic scent perfect for men. Not too musky, not too icy, but distinct. I&#x27;ve likened it to be my personal scent and I always get compliments when I&#x27;m out and wearing this cologne.</li>
    <li> My husband love it! It is a fresh fragrance for winter. If you are looking for a pleasing cologne for men buy Bvlgari Aqua!</li>
    <li> ..clean scent; which seems to be appreciated by all so far?!&lt;br /&gt;Great scent.&lt;br /&gt;I think this may just be the perfect  &amp;#34;summer scent&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Nice big size! Came really fast, haven&#x27;t opened it yet as it&#x27;s a FD gift but seems to be fine</li>
    <li> Loved it and Arrived before time</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance but I have to say also that all the stuff Made in Italy is complitely different!This is made in Usa so...</li>
    <li> One of the reviewers here said they would not rate this cologne anything above &#x27;mediocre&#x27; but they still gave it THREE stars!!! Anyway, this is far from mediocre...it may not be the uber scent but mediocre, it is not. I agree that the stuff from Italy does seem more potent than this American made stuff but all in all, you can&#x27;t go wrong with any Bvlgari in your cologne rotation!</li>
    <li> This is the one I most like among the four although my wife prefers the Gucci.&lt;br /&gt;As with Gucci, I had never used this perfume before. But after having smelled it from a close friend of mine, It caught my attention and purchased to try. In fact it is amazing and I&#x27;m thinking of buying another one very soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Just the right scent for me not too thick and not too mild either.</li>
    <li> I like the way this shirt fits on me, I like a lot, the style is very good...only Nautica, I will get more</li>
    <li> Good scent and great price for the amount.  Highly recommended! I wish they sold an even larger container, but then it wouldn&#x27;t fit in my medicine cabinet!</li>
    <li> I should have done a little homework before I ordered this. Should have gotten Aqva Marine heard its noticed more with a sweeter after tone. This cologne is not very potent its scent isn&#x27;t bad though it smells like Bvlgari was a little puzzled with this one trying to go in a much different direction than other aquas. Marine should have been the finished product but that&#x27;s just from hearsay haven&#x27;t smelled it myself. Kind cautious to but marine I usually love Bvlgari colognes......cool bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for about 3 years and had to get a new one. This one is the same exact one as the one sold at macys or other stores.. This isn&#x27;t a knock-off. It came in the original packaging and costs half as less as the same one sold at a department store.</li>
    <li> A must have for any man. I get compliments on this all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several others but I keep coming back to this one.  I always receive compliments on this one. Will buy again if I don&#x27;t find something even better.</li>
    <li> By far the best cologne ive used, im a man who loves smelling good ALL the time. Got this as a birthday gift and the ladies LOVE the smell, every time i use it all ranges from young on to the older ladies(cougars) come up to me and compliment the cologne. must buy and its only $40!!!!!! i cant believe it. im looking at major retailers and they selling for 50 or 70</li>
    <li> Very  pleasant smell, not too powerful wears well through the day.  I get many complements from women asking what  cologne  I wear.</li>
    <li> I bought the Bvlgari Aqua Spray, for my husband, after reading about it in Janet Evanovich&#x27;s \\&quot;Ten Big Ones\\&quot;. Boy does it deliver. The spray and shower gel are now a yearly ritual. It is so rare to find a product that he can use and like, that also PLEASES me! I, sometimes, spray a bit on a wash cloth and put it in our towel closet or spray a bit on a pillow case, to be enclosed with our spare bedding. This is personal care product, that has traveled the world, with him.</li>
    <li> I like this smell, it&#x27;s like you got out of the shower and people will probably comment on it. They will also comment on it because the spray head sends out way too much cologne each spray. Normally you should only use half as much each time, so a lot of this stuff can get wasted. You really just want people 2-3 feet or so away to be able to smell.</li>
    <li> love it, amazing smell!</li>
    <li> Everything as promised. Shipping, product, etc. Great price as well.</li>
    <li> Good perfume and prompt delivery..</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied good buy, it&#x27;s a quality product. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> last long on my clothes</li>
    <li> Best smelling stuff on the planet. Any time I go out with this on, I get mad compliments. Its pretty much become the only cologne I use.</li>
    <li> great perfume ,great price, and i got it fast.i sopped for a couple of days and it was the best price around for the price</li>
    <li> This was a great find. I was looking for a change. I have used happy for years and was a great replacement. The size and the coast was more then I could ask for.</li>
    <li> Great! The Best price!!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell&lt;br /&gt;Blends perfectly with my body oils</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my love, I hope he likes it. Surprisingly this came faster then expected but I&#x27;m not complaining, LOL. The packaging was great, product was perfect just as described. Thank you....</li>
    <li> Very picky with cologne...&lt;br /&gt;got a free sample of this stuff and liked it so much i had to get a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;smells very good, get compliments all the time, and the best price on the internet&lt;br /&gt;heavy duty bottle and the button is sturdy and sprays like a champ</li>
    <li> Great value fo rthe money, prompt service</li>
    <li> My man uses this as a deodorant .. He hasn&#x27;t any body odor smells ever! Something about this products chemistry doesn&#x27;t allow  The older bacteria&#x27;s to smell.!</li>
    <li> My husband loved it!!!</li>
    <li> Smells really nice lots if compliments from he ladies yes I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Its Very Nice , Its Smell Great And Girls Love it</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and in proper order using Amazon Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this cologne, I&#x27;m sure to receive a compliment on how good I smell when I use this cologne and the scent lingers for quite some time. Definitely one of my first choices from my cologne section when going on a date or a night out. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Very nice.  I&#x27;ve received many compliments on this fragrance.  It is very clean and a very rich mixture of basic fragrances.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne on this site for a cheaper price and when I applied it the scent  only lasted  about 10 minutes. So I went and purchased it from a fragrance store it was totally different this is my favorite Scent i will never buy this particular cologne from this site I also had the same problem with , zegna and zegna extreme</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe you were sent a broken/leaking bottle of perfume, plus the perfume&#x27;s quality is so bad.  I have been purchasing this very same perfume for the last two years, and I still have an old bottle and the difference in quality between that one and your product is shocking.  The smell of the one I bought from you does not last for more than 20 minutes, while from the old one last for several days.  I suspect water has been added to the genuine product or this product is not from the original company at all.  I tried to send it back but then got stuck with the policy of no return for this kinds of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably my last purchase from you, and I want to leave this note so some one acts on it.</li>
    <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long</li>
    <li> Fresh at first, but not long lasting.</li>
    <li> this is amazing... love it!!</li>
    <li> smells good and I have gotten alot of compliments about it.....  I would just buy it iF I were you</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve purchased 100 ml/3.4 oz. Bvlgari Aqua By Bvlgari For Men Eau De Toilette from Amazon and had been slightly surprised then it came in huge 150ml bottle. definitely this cologne is fake, cause authentic one had never been produced in 150 ml/5.2 oz. but it still smells pretty pleasant and longlasting, so may be it&#x27;s not too much bad choice for a cost 36$</li>
    <li> Perfect transaction and i like the colonge</li>
    <li> 100 % real and authentic colognes and they are a fraction of the price cant go wrong here... I read complaints of fakes but have not had any bad luck yet and I know my juice is real as I compare everything to samples...</li>
    <li> Clean and refreshing. Perfect for wawe days</li>
    <li> Its exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Visually, it appears to be the &amp;#34;real McCoy&amp;#34;; however, olfactorily (is that a word?) the fragrance seems a bit weak and watered down.</li>
    <li> Transacci&amp;oacute;n R&amp;aacute;pida segura y confiable, buen producto y vendedor. El paquete lleg&amp;oacute; en el tiempo estimado de env&amp;iacute;o y en buen estado.</li>
    <li> el producto es la calidad que describen y el tiempo de llegada del producto es el estipulado en los parametros</li>
    <li> Exact same product from the department store! Very happy!</li>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t put it on a dead skunk, I think it must be bootleg crap, very unsatisfied with it.</li>
    <li> smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my son and he loves it. And I have to say he is very picky.</li>
    <li> We went shopping in the mall for a new cologne, and my wife wanted me to try this one. She really liked (said it works well on me throughout the day), so I found it for quite a bit cheaper here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture is a good representation of the product, and the quality is the same as what we would have bought at the store!</li>
    <li> Authentic, and as advertised!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It is exactly as I bought it</li>
    <li> It´s a good seller. Recomended.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a very nice perfume !</li>
    <li> GREAT fragrance for the first 4hrs.  I&#x27;d describe the opening as smooth, filled with the pleseantries of the ocean.  but after 4hrs it leaves a nasty sea salt skin cent to where ever you spray it. The fact that it&#x27;s natural plays against it in this situation. Just like after swimming in the ocean you&#x27;d have to wash the sea salt off of your skin, you have to do the same for this cologne. If you spray it on your neck, dont plan on having your girlfriend on that area later that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it weren&#x27;t for that 4hr later salty skin smell, I&#x27;d rate this producted a 10 out of 10!</li>
    <li> Warning! Just to let you know. i loved the smell of BVLGARI AQVA which i smelled in the retailer store, but guess what , this perfume smells but doesn&#x27;t last. i spray in the morning and even a minute later nobody can hear the smell. Smell doesnt last and i wouldnt recommend it. i am sorry to be writting this review because i have not written anything negative so far i am using amazon, but this time i am very disappointed and should tell you all, that it s not genuine and i don&#x27;t know why amazon lets this company to sell it on their site. Just dont buy it i would say.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband... and I loveee it!! Better price than in stores and smells so very good...&lt;br /&gt;LADIES! Highly recommend this as a gift for your male counterpart! You&#x27;ll enjoy it as much (or more) than he will!</li>
    <li> This product was a commission for a friend so I do not have much to add.</li>
    <li> I already knew this perfume and I really like it. It came at the right time.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected. Great product.</li>
    <li> smells fantastic and I love the bottle.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. Item as described.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this so I keep ordering it off of Amazon, great prices and it delivered to my home in atimely manner whats not to love</li>
    <li> My husband love it!!!! Exquisita!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father for Christmas a few years ago and he loves it. I buy it at least once a year now. I suggest that you try the scent in store before buying it on Amazon (cheaper) to make sure you like it.</li>
    <li> Great Perfume my father was STOKED when he got this Christmas and I&#x27;ve gotten to use it and it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s not just the smell but the amount of time that lasts that makes it awesome.</li>
    <li> I got for my son, he like this perfume..</li>
    <li> MY BEST BRAND EVER , SPECIALLY THIS BOTTLE .</li>
    <li> Wonderful frangrance. Amazing price.</li>
    <li> If you liked BLV then should also like AQVA with its fresh and long lasting fragrance. Switching from Bvlgari Black for the usual 9-5 to AQVA for after 5, you&#x27;ll be well positioned for making some positive impressions. In my opinion and a bit of personal experience you&#x27;ll have to try to be disappointed with Bvlgari.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my father, and after a few uses it smell like alcohol.</li>
    <li> ...but it has really grown on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened was, I tried on the Bvlgari Aqua MARINE version in an airport cologne shop, loved it, and when I got home I ordered this normal Aqua version instead, forgetting about the MARINE variation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this is quite a bit stronger and muskier than the \\&quot;Marine\\&quot; version which is sportier, cleaner and more soap-like in character.  At first I was really dismayed, but now I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and quite enjoy it.  It&#x27;s got a heavier but woodier and more masculine smell, IMO.  Have gotten a number of compliments on it.  I don&#x27;t overdo it, just a quick spray in my throat area, one on one wrist which I rub into the other wrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts about 4-6 hours.  This is to be expected with an EDT (Eau De Toilette) as opposed to an actual COLOGNE version which would of course be a good bit more expensive...something the other reviewers who are complaining about its short lifespan need to keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s replaced 212 Men as my favorite everyday scent.</li>
    <li> I often  buy my husband perfumes for gifts, this  time was  the  first time I bought a perfume online, without having  a chance to smell it first myself, basing my decision solely on other customers reviews. I dont think Ill ever take such chance again, but this time I was very lucky- this fragrance is beautiful, sexy, elegant and fresh in the same time, I sprayed it on my rist  in the morning and now, after 12 h I can  still smell it. I cant wait to give it to my husband tomorrow for his birthday, Im sure he is gonna love it.</li>
    <li> I had purchased a sample beforehand, and it lasts nowhere near as long as the sample I have. The sample lasts 7-8 hours and I&#x27;m lucky if I get 3-4 with this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I just got a sour product though and that it is not an imitation, as the packaging looks legit and it is factory shrunk-wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let my unlucky purchase deter you, it is a top-tier summer frag; and if you have a bad experience like me, just call their customer support and they will be happy to help you! It is Amazon after all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scents. When it comes to colognes and EDTs, it&#x27;s easier to describe these scents by what they&#x27;re not - exotic, flowery, spicy, incense-like, or very deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bvlgari Aqva definitely falls in that category. I won&#x27;t claim to have the mastery of prose required to describe my sensations if a cologne were to *actually* transport me to the beach, but I definitely felt a tad maritime afterwards. &#x3D;) And what more can anyone ask for?&lt;br /&gt;This is a very clean scent, not at all overpowering, if used judiciously. Burberry Brit, which is another EDT I&#x27;m partial to, has the scent of clean, fresh linen. Aqva has a mild citrus-ey, salty scent by contrast. This is not a very modern scent, but it&#x27;s a timeless scent (sort of like Ray-Ban aviators), you just can&#x27;t go wrong with this EDT. I have received a couple of compliments since I&#x27;ve added the Aqva to my repertoire, but in the interest of full disclosure, I always get complimented on my colognes. Also, my coworkers aren&#x27;t the final word on colognes and perfumes, they just know what they like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose Amazon as my seller, simply because I don&#x27;t want to deal with a third-party seller in case of fakes, or leaky/damaged bottles. You may feel differently. Prime shipping, as always, was prompt, and the item was well-packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good price point to grab this would be right around $35-37. So I recommend you add this to your shopping cart, and wait for the price to fluctuate in your favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something to consider - you can&#x27;t store this bottle upright. It&#x27;s shaped like a large, round pebble, of all silly things! Either you lay it on its side (larger footprint, wasted space), or you store it in its box (it&#x27;s a big honking box, so you waste premium space in your drawer or on your shelf). I was tempted to deduct a star was this, but what the heck ... it&#x27;s a great scent!</li>
    <li> Always get complimented on my smell when wearing this, I recommend it highly to any people out there looking to buy something that&#x27;ll do the trick giving them an extra edge over competition.</li>
    <li> You want your lady head to turn and want her to jump your bones this it. It is sexy, intriguing, your lady would love it. The best.</li>
    <li> Excelent Choice!!! Recommended 100%</li>
    <li> Great lotion at a great price</li>
    <li> This is one of the best scents that comes from the house of Bvlgari. I first bought this at a Duty Free boutique in the Philippines and it was the best one out of a hundred of fragrances that is in display. I&#x27;ll definitely will purchase another one as soon as mine runs out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne once, recieved a smaller bottle as a Christmas present two years ago, it lasted the whole year (the small bottle, not the 3.4 oz) It&#x27;s sort of my secret weapon, really the only cologne that smells the best on me. I&#x27;ve worn Playboy New York and Curve Appeal, the Appeal is another gem but never lasted more than 3 hours. Which is where my Bvlgari Aqua comes into play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT confuse this with &amp;#34;Bvlgari&amp;#34; OR &amp;#34;Aqua Marine&amp;#34; It&#x27;s much more of a light, sexy aquatic everyday smell, as the Aqua Marine is a little stronger, more of a &amp;#34;special occasion&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;formal&amp;#34; smell. Surprisingly not as aquatic as Aqua.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the review you came here for. What can I say about Bvlgari Aqua? Well, for one it has a crisp and fresh &amp;#34;awakened&amp;#34; smell to it. This is definitely one for the ladies, I get more looks as I walk within distance by a group of ladies then I did before. Mind you I kind of keep a semi-close distance, enough to leave a faint smell as i walk by without gagging them. This stuff is moderately strong if you load it on, but you really only need a small squirt or two so you don&#x27;t smell desperate, it lasts all day (and night if you catch my drift) and for the price that you can get it at straight from amazon. If you&#x27;re near a department or cologne store, go ahead and try a sample spray. 9/10 of the employees gave me the recommendation upon discovery of Aqua.</li>
    <li> It is a good product meets specifications, is good quality and best price is even worth it. Since I use has not presented any problems. Recommended 100%.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband without having smelled it, just based on the positive reviews.  First of all, it arrived beautifully packaged in the original box, in perfect condition.  Secondly, this stuff smells AMAZING! I can&#x27;t really describe it other than, WOW.  This may be TMI, bbut when he&#x27;s wearing this I can&#x27;t keep my hands off of him!! My favorite for years has always been Aqua Di Gio, but this FAR surpasses that.  This is definitely my new favorite! This would be appropriate for a man of any age and irresistible to women of any age!</li>
    <li> Not much of a cologne guy, but this one has a nice manly watery smell.  very little is needed, and the smell lasts all day.</li>
    <li> My favorite. Perfect for a night out.</li>
    <li> everything perfect I stay well, recommended seller 100%</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m very pleased with the product, just that i expected, very quick the delivery, thank you very much!!!! Almost forget...the price is...UNBEATABLE LOW...&amp; the cuality is very HIGH</li>
    <li> This seems to be a watered down version of the original that you get in stores.&lt;br /&gt;The scent does not last nearly half as long.</li>
    <li> Great smelling and long lasting Eau De Toillette. Recommend it to all men who want to smell good  at all times</li>
    <li> I had bought this exact same product from Fragrance.com a while back. This time, my wife decided to order it for me as a x-mas gift from Amazon. Not only the price was way bellow fragrance.com but it arrived sooner than I thought. I just love the scent and the hours the scent stays with you throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely a must buy. It stays on you for along period of time 6 plus hours. THANKS!</li>
    <li> this is one of my father&#x27;s signature fragrances.  he has been wearing aqua for years.  all he ever wants for birthdays and christmas is cologne.  the man has everything and doesn&#x27;t really shop for this type of thing!  if it doesn&#x27;t have a motor, he isn&#x27;t interested!  he likes his kids or my mom to get him cologne.  it&#x27;s been this way since i can remember, which is good, because we buy what we like and since he loads it on, we better like it!  it is great for all times of the year, it is crisp, clean, and smells so good.  he always gets tons of compliments when wearing it.</li>
    <li> Very fresh and nice eau de toilette !! I use every day. It is a great product. I love it. Quite different from others, I am very happy to buy it.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is that this is definitely not worth buying. Even though I bought it on sale it wasn&#x27;t worth it. Next time I&#x27;m going straight to Macy*s for my perfumes and cologne. I wanted to surprise my husband with it because this scent got a lot of great reviews on it. Turns out I was duked cuz it&#x27;s not even the real thing. A piece of the sticker on the bottom of the bottle was clipped. I couldn&#x27;t return it because by the time my husband stared using it, the 30-day return period was expired. Never purchasing perfume from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This is a subtle, unique, masculine, maritime-like scent. Ocean spray-like. Impressed in that it does not smell like everything else on the market. Fades too quickly on me though - that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars - but the scent is top drawer.</li>
    <li> One of my top five, I&#x27;ve owned this cologne for over ten years and will for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Timeless scent that will get you laid.</li>
    <li> Bvlgari Aqva has a strong, clean masculine scent designed for a mature man, confident in himself. I bought my first bottle in 2011 and used it sparingly because it has a scent that lasts awhile and fits certain occasions. This scent works best when wearing a suit, dressing business-casual or when you want the clean-outdoorsy aroma. A  must have in very man&#x27;s collection.</li>
    <li> Makes a great gift for your man, and he smells great to AAA +++ what women doesn&#x27;t want a great smelling man.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my husband for Christmas and it smells soooo good on him. He gets so many compliments at work on it as well.</li>
    <li> Well when I smell it I feel like smelling Armani Aqua Di Gio . This is tricky perfume . Sometimes I cant even smell it just after one hour on my skin. Sometimes I can smell it for some two three hours time . Its smells good but the longevity is poor and poor Sillage. Its not worth the money for me may be can do wonders on others skin . Thank You .</li>
    <li> Package smelled great only to find the box a bit soggy, the cologne bottle had droplet stains all over, and the bottle definitely did not look full. Slightly disappointed and given a bad first impression.</li>
    <li> This cologne has clean, fresh overtones making it an excellent fragrance for summer.  It also has a great counterpoint of spice, distinguishing it from the all-too-common Polo Blue and Aqua di Gio. The fragrance has good staying power; a single, well-placed application easily lasts for the entire day.  As with any fragrance, do yourself an immense favor and try it out at the store before buying it.  The point being that each individual has a unique body chemistry which melds well with certain scents.  After finding your scent, get it off Amazon and save yourself a ton off of retail.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells amazing and is quality. When my husband wears it, he smells fantastic all day. This was the cheapest I was able to find it.</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance, I don&#x27;t love it, would get something different next time, carries a premium price so I expect satisfaction</li>
    <li> wife bought me one, used it all up (plus everyone who came over).  Bought 1 for my father-in-law, he loves it.  So I bought one for myself and will keep it hidden for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Very quick delivery....</li>
    <li> Purchased from amazon smells of sea weed like sitting next to dark deep ocean with blast of citrus  last long time masculine would recommend</li>
    <li> BVLGARY AQUA IS A SOFT FRAGRANCE,MASCULINE AND STRONG.&lt;br /&gt;BEST PRESENT FOR ANY OCCASION. THE HINT OF WOOD AND EARTH MAKE IT THE BEST BVLGARY FRAGRANCE FOR MEN.</li>
    <li> The very best, I bought it to my husband and he loved it.  Go on and buy it. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Bvlgari aqua- Nice and refreshing fragrance that lasts a day.&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried it, it&#x27;s highly recommended to be tried atleast once.</li>
    <li> Perfume de hombre fantastico, que perdura aun cuando el usuario sea fumador. Recomendado por un conocido, es sin dudas uno de los mejores perfumes que compre hasta ahora.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from Macy&#x27;s a year ago and it was strong, lasting, and it elicited compliments from a couple of ladies.  Oh yeah, it was MADE IN FRANCE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just bought it from Amazon two weeks ago (their own inventory--Amazon itself was the seller) and the stuff lasts 15 minutes (really: LESS!) and then its aroma is 98% gone within 10 minutes.  Oh, and, this is MADE IN ITALY (as are the bottles currently selling at my local Macy&#x27;s and Nordstrom, as well as the sample bottles at each of these stores)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally, I tried the same test 2 days in a row--2 sprays EACH on both wrists, then I sniffed immediately afterward and noticed the nice, but barely noticeable, scent.  Then, 15 minutes later, after making sure to inhale some fresh air beforehand, I went and sniffed again . . . and the scent was only detectable--faintly at that--if I put my nose within 1 inch of my wrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only did the test because when I had sprayed it behind my ears on a prior day, I couldn&#x27;t notice it 15 minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, when I first used a sample of this a year ago, it was great.  But, this bottle from Amazon is worthless.  Totally watered down or in some other way just can&#x27;t last for even 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least, not on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE later the SAME week as above review: I just went today to both Macy&#x27;s and Nordstrom (in the same mall) and did the above spray test from THEIR respective sample bottles on my wrists--2 sprays in the same spot from one bottle, another 2 sprays on the same spot on the other wrist from the other bottle.  Both went on smelling faintly IMMEDIATELY, and were barely detectable at all 15 minutes later--and only when I put my nose an inch from my wrists.  The Nordstrom sampler&#x27;s spray lasted in a barely stronger way than that from Macy&#x27;s sampler, which I&#x27;d attribute to Macy&#x27;s probably having their sample bottle opened and in use longer (i.e., it was older).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On me, at least, this stuff is worthless, because it has barely a detectable scent, and then it disappears completely within a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I like it is very mild I recommended to any one with good test for&lt;br /&gt;a nice perfume, buy it you won&#x27;t regretted.</li>
    <li> This is my go to scent.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Very Nice fragrance. It has a mellow lingering scent, that permeates but doesn&#x27;t overpower like some other fragrances.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift for a friend.  After I smelled it I didn&#x27;t want to give it to him.  This is now my new favorite colgone.  I spoke with him the other day and he told me that men actually come up to him and ask him what he is wearing.</li>
    <li> This product is not genuine, the smell evaporates, have always used this perfume is the first time it happens to me. pure alcohol</li>
    <li> Great scent, very alluring. Been wearing it for a while now. It&#x27;s timeless, not Old Spice. Hugs are more of a \\&quot;can you handle me,\\&quot; rather than just a hello.</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  Long lasting</li>
    <li> I just love it when my husband uses this cologne. I love the smell and it was even a better buy with the price!</li>
    <li> Excellent scent, excellent price</li>
    <li> This is one of my favourite scents. The size of the product was great for the price. Great value for money.&lt;br /&gt;My friend loved it.</li>
    <li> I love it and so does everyone else. Sent lasts and you don&#x27;t need much. If you are looking for a manly sent that gets attention go with this or BVLGARI Man</li>
    <li> would recommend to friends and family. Getting complements from the ladies price was the lowest I found from box stores and internet</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume and the scent is truly excellent. Very soft but the scent remains for several days in my body. and the best part was the price.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne ever. Get tons of compliments</li>
    <li> excelent. thank you so much</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne from the reviews I thought I would be getting a great cologne and it is not! The smell is nice if you like cologne lasting for only 10 minutes! Do not but this cologne. I hope I can get a refund I already threw the packaging away!!</li>
    <li> I know, I know........fragrances are best determined by the natural oils in our body needless to say that as a cologne lover and collector this one can remain on my shelf. Scent is gone in like a minute and even then (That is like after 10 squirts) :(  bought this based on the reviews needless to say though the initial spray is very inviting and pleasurable. I think this fragrance just didn&#x27;t like me though.......Oh well on to something else.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best scents that comes from the house of Bvlgari.I bought this for a friend, and the first thing he said was how great the bottle looked.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived beautifully packaged in the original box, in perfect condition. Secondly, this stuff smells AMAZING! I can&#x27;t really describe it other than, WOW.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my favorite colognes. It&#x27;s not super strong but it&#x27;s strong enough that the others can smell it on you for at least 3-4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a chance.</li>
    <li> I really love this cologne.  It has a scent that stays with you all day yet is not overpowering in the least.  As if that wasn&#x27;t enough, the bottle is really cool.  I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the scent of the Aqva by Blvgari.&lt;br /&gt;Though the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Compliments were given by few friends when I wore this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price seems very reasonable for its size.</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne. My wife loves it, so I love it. It&#x27;s a clean smelling cologne that doesn&#x27;t over power</li>
    <li> For the price I thought this would smell alot better. Nothing like the first one but nice to add to my collection</li>
    <li> The product packaging looked original. However, the actual toilette spray had almost no scent. The spray seems highly diluted.  Recommend that no one else purchase it.</li>
    <li> I always have a bottle of this cologne in my collection, I love the smell and longevity of it....the blend in this cologne is perfect for my skin...</li>
    <li> I was using CK one before and after I switch to this, nearly every women I know complement about this new fragrance and get close to me to take a sniff :)</li>
    <li> This cologne is so much better than mediocre. My fiance loves this cologne, she got it for me on my birthday and have no plans of ever switching as long as they  keep making it.  It has a very nice smell to it and I have gotten a lot of compliments on how good I smell and the ladies at work wanted to know what I was wearing so they could get it for their husbands / boyfriends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who would think this cologne is mediocre seriously doesn&#x27;t know what they are talking about. you can&#x27;t go wrong with this cologne. If you&#x27;re looking for something that will attract a woman at work / school or ladies looking for something that will increase the desire for your man, this is the one to go for.  Like I said, my fiance loves it and she even sprays the sheets with it when I have to go to work :)</li>
    <li> Was excited to try this.  Regrettably, what I received has been disappointing.  First, it was packaged as if it were stuffed animals.  When I opened and sprayed it on a napkin, an immediate odor of alcohol permeated the area.  I have reviewed and used it countless times since receiving it a week ago.  Comparing it with a sample from Macys, either it&#x27;s fake or old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, Amazon has been exceptionally helpful and generous in handling matters, otherwise it would have been sensible to simply pick up said article from Macys or Nordstrom.  Good luck Macys/Nordstrom--Amazon ease and service are hard...very hard to match, let alone beat.</li>
    <li> I like,&lt;br /&gt;my husband loves this perfume&lt;br /&gt;not common among men so I gutta and liked him ...&lt;br /&gt;smells very soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shipping was fast even though I am out of the country</li>
    <li> I like it, it smells great, the packaging is pleasing, and the bottle itself is aesthetic.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a complete package.</li>
    <li> This Is a very attractive scent for a man!! Look out axe you don&#x27;t stand a chance</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m switching to Channel Bue for a switch.  Bvigary is a stupple scent and I loved using it.  Great Job</li>
    <li> I am not sure whether that one is original or not. I know Bvlgari Aqua is the best summer fragrance; however, that one doesn&#x27;t last long. It is vaporizing in a short time and could not smell it after an hour. That will be a fake one, be careful !</li>
    <li> I am using for the first time. I like it  Excellent fragrance</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived on time and intact. Great vendor (OxKom). I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Era ex acta memte lo q esta ba es per ando, total mente nuevo en paque te ori ginal, recomendado</li>
    <li> good delivery time and perfect product l 100% recommend</li>
    <li> Brilliant perfume! Love it!</li>
    <li> First rate product in a very convenient and attractive dispenser.</li>
    <li> Fast service. Loved the picture of this item, which helped me accurately pick the right fragrance. Will not hesitate to buy from Amazon in the future!</li>
    <li> The scratches on the box&lt;br /&gt;The printed name of the perfume is not fully displayed&lt;br /&gt;Not able to return it :(&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money, don&#x27;t want to open it</li>
    <li> Order arrived quickly and in good condition. I was concerned about the reviews saying it may be a fake but it has a nice scent and the bottle that it came in is expensive looking. nice gift. My husband wore it for the first time today and after several hours I can still detect the pleasant aroma. Good buy in my estimation.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, but some times I will try a different cologne because....well, a guy gets restless once in a while. But, no matter what I buy or try, Bvlgari Aqua is my favorite (and &amp;#34;the old ball and chain&amp;#34; likes it best too).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn cologne for more than 25 years and have had so many different kinds I can&#x27;t even remember them all. My last favorite has been Lauder for Men. That&#x27;s my more formal wear cologne and I&#x27;ve been looking for something manly, dark, slightly dirty and deep for my night time wear to compliment the Aqua Di Gio daywear. Well, here it is. Bvlgari Aqua for Men. The final chapter in my cologne trilogy. I&#x27;m covered for all occasions now.</li>
    <li> me gusto mucho el articulo y estoy muy sastifecho con el vendedor llego como lo esperaba y como estaba en la descripcion</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing this cologne! Great smell.</li>
    <li> An absolute BEST!!!! Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought it for dad.&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice ocean vibe</li>
    <li> My grandson loves this cologne.  It has a clean, light fresh aroma.&lt;br /&gt;He just returned to medical school in Colorado and took it with him.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and my significant other, who has been a fan of Hugo by Hugo Boss for years, finds that he might have a new favorite.  This is the toilette spray, which may explain why some people feel the scent is &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; (because it literally is).  The price here, however, is virtually unbeatable and I checked multiple sites before purchasing.  Delivery was lightning fast (even though I used super saver shipping) and the packaging was intact when it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the only complaint I can make is that the bottle, while beautiful, is a bit unwieldy and doesn&#x27;t sit on a dresser/counter/shelf very well.</li>
    <li> I have always liked this subtle yet clean smelling cologne.mi get a compliment almost every time I wear it from the ladies...</li>
    <li> Great cologne and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I have never taken a risk and ordered a scent for someone else without even smelling it before but I decided to order this as a last minute stocking stuffer for my son. I won&#x27;t bore you with the details but suffice to say that if you like a crisp fresh scent; somewhat citrus (light) overtone; with lavender and bergamot undernotes this is an excellent choice.  It is very masculine but not heavy like say Polo (which I also like). It is also not spicy like Polo. It is similar to the Gucci Guilty Intense which I had purchased previously for my husband and for me is a to-die-for scent. Good luck in choosing but I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed if you order this.</li>
    <li> So, it smells GREAT!  I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it is a really nice scent.  I actually bought it based on reviews alone (was lead to it by Amazons recommendations since I had purchased Curve in the past) and I have to say, it does not disappoint.  He immediately sprayed it on Christmas morning and it was a very pleasant but, a tad strong.  I would suggest no more than 2-3 sprays at a time.  With colognes like Curve, you need a bit more I suppose because it&#x27;s kind of a light scent, but this has more substance AND staying power.  It lasts all day.  I recommend it and so does the Mr. :)</li>
    <li> I am very grateful for this product because it had already time looking, thank you very much, keep it up</li>
    <li> Me sorprende la reproduccion del olor marino de este perfume. es super natural y salado. Me gusta muchisimo Aqva, espero aun recibir Aqva Marine....</li>
    <li> Everybody tells me that I smell like gods. I use it for my job. Is the best perfume in the world</li>
    <li> I really like this scent but never purchased it until I found it on Amazon. This is about half the price of a retail store, and no pushy sales person either!</li>
    <li> Exactly what my husband wanted!</li>
    <li> The fragrance as expected won&#x27;t last longer. You even don&#x27;t feel like using it within few minutes after applying. I feel like cheated and need my money back.....</li>
    <li> Meant to buy Bvlgari&#x27;s Aqua Marine, and got this on accident. Love the fresh scent of Marine, but this smells like a douchey nightclub.</li>
    <li> I do own multiple Bvlgari fragrances; not to mention they all last really long and smells great! Must to get!</li>
    <li> Packaging was in perfect conditions, I was a little doubtful when I first saw the cologne&#x27;s box, it seemed cheap and fake, the plastic was very loose and the glue turned white from aging.  I opened it up, the box wasn&#x27;t sturdy or thick as I expected so I did some research, looked up the bottle&#x27;s S/N and it all matched, 100% LEGIT! I love the smell, it stayed on me for over 24 hours.  I have amazon prime and was a little disappointed at how long it took, a little over a week but well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> This cologne is average upon application but by the end of the day is so alluring you&#x27;ll catch yourself smelling it multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t more popular but it is one that I&#x27;ve purchased over the years. Although my cologne has advanced to Creed brand colognes, this is one I still wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got this one for a friend and he enjoys it too.</li>
    <li> I think either they have changed the formulation, or this product wasn&#x27;t authentic? It&#x27;s ok, but just not the same.</li>
    <li> This is about my 2nd bottles.....I like the clean &amp; fresh smell of this. Will try the Aqua one next time but really likes the smell. Highly recommend this cologne.</li>
    <li> It smells really well, however it does not long.</li>
    <li> was expecting something a lot better after reading the reviews. i believe i may have had an old bottle because it smelled cheap. sadly, cannot return it as stated in amazon&#x27;s return policy for flammable materials. pay more and buy it in person.</li>
    <li> I love this clean smell of cologne on a man. It compars to Aqua Digio(sp) by Armani. Its a great gift!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected, Nothing special, Just another bottle of cologne.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my 19 year old and he loves it.  He says that it is mild and does not stay as long but that&#x27;s what he wanted.</li>
    <li> Great men&#x27;s cologne-seller is selling authentic product.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, reasonable price, quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Wow...this water is perfect for cleaning my glasses.&lt;br /&gt;attn all buyer if you need water spray for cleaning glasses or car side mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Plz buy this product.</li>

    <li> Top of the line for a GREAT PRIC E</li>
    <li> Brand new and sealed 100% satisfied</li>
    <li> Excelent!!! Very Good</li>
    <li> Great seller. Recommended 100%</li>
    <li> Smells so nice and we paid less for this size than we did for the size under it at scented monkey.</li>
    <li> I wasvery happy with this product</li>
    <li> I like the scent, but don&#x27;t buy it online because you may end up getting a fake one as I did.</li>
    <li> it is good, however, it is not my favorite, I would not buy it again.  it is expensive for the quality</li>
    <li> I bought my first bottle of Bvlgari Aqua about 10+ years ago and I totally fell in love with it.  My girlfriend simply loves the smell of this cologne on me.</li>
    <li> Works just like it should great smell!!</li>
    <li> Used this cologne for about 10 years. I love the dark wood scented original but love sweet scents like this one even more.&lt;br /&gt;Close to Armani Acqua Di Gio but more refreshing scent yet more longer lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Receive daily complements and this is my go to cologne on daily use until I feel like switching up every once in a while.</li>
    <li> This cologne has a great universal scent, and while probably more suited for a slightly younger man, could be pulled off by a man of almost any age. It might be a bit strong for an office setting, and probably better for a night out. Ladies will love it.</li>
    <li> My husband love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Its cheaper than discount perfume stores and received it faster than most websites. Love the the cologne and the price.</li>
    <li> Son loves this scent; very subtle yet masculine.  Priced at leading department stores, and found on Amazon for half the price they wanted.  Needless to say, he was delighted when he received as a Christmas gift. Smells really nice whether at work or play.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this cologne for 10 years because women tell me all the time how much they love this scent on me. :)  Delivery was fast and price was fair.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, sexy scent!  My boyfriend gets compliments right and left when he wears.  I highly recommend it for your special man.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad and he was overjoyed. I remember this was my dad&#x27;s favorite cologne 10 years ago! As a little girl, I used to go into the restroom and spray it all over the bathroom just  because I loved the smell. I remember feeling bad about waisting it all. I thought this would be my apology and the perfect present !</li>
    <li> I bought this as part of package deal with my wifes perfume because I needed some cologne and wanted to try something new.  I personally don&#x27;t like the scent but I&#x27;m picky.</li>
    <li> Just bought this cologne for myself a few days ago, tested it out last night when I went out and received lots of compliments from women about how great I smelled and asking what I was wearing.</li>
    <li> Nice scent. Not overpowering, but some said a bit too citrus smelling. It lasts for a few hours. Try at your dept. store before you buy.</li>
    <li> Fake, the bottle and the packaging are different than any other bottle I have seen (i&#x27;ve been wearing this for years and have gone through at least 3 bottles already), and the smell is off (via direct comparison with my nearly empty bottle... far weaker than a year+ old bottle, and just smells off and very alcohol-y)... Finally there is the small number on the back label that has been cut out with a razor blade! At least I noticed asap and was able to get it refunded by amazon...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also fyi I bought this item directly fulfilled by amazon</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband who is a cologne collector.  We both like the scent, although it is a little heavier than expected.  I tend to like his Galltier and Guerlain fragrances a bit more.  He liked the unique bottle also.</li>
    <li> Thant&#x27;s all. But I have to put more words even though my English is limited.@@. This one is so good for men.</li>
    <li> So this one is a difficult to review. I absolutely love this cologne. I have used it for 7 years straight and i have never had a problem. Everyone mostly women stop me and ask me what am i wearing. It is a magnet trust me. Amazing smell that lasts all day looonnnngg!!I ordered my refill again this year like every year and it was fake. Smelled like alcohol within 5 minutes and i couldnt or no one could smell anything 30 mins out. The box and the bottle look so genuine that i am surprised it is a fake. I told amazon customer care and they happily sent me another one. Guess what - fake again. Didnt last for more than 5 mins. I told amazon again and they gave me the money back. I love their customer service and i am such a frequent buyer so they honor that. However the cologne is a fake!! fake absolutely fake stock! I went to Macys and got myself a new bottle from there and also tried it in the store i could smell it for the next several hours. You must own this cologne because it is just Shakalakaboomboom! Keep in mind that there is a lot of fake stock out there.</li>
    <li> This was my second purchase of this fragrance.  Didn&#x27;t smell the same as the one I purchased at the department store.  Love the scent, but have questions about this particular purchase.  May have been an &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; batch, or may not have been genuine.</li>
    <li> The cologne came fast. I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great smell. My gf loves when I wear this. Good value! I will re-order as soon as the bottle gets low.</li>
    <li> By far the best Bvlgari cologne I&#x27;ve ever had!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful cologne which makes me to go back to it over and over. Clean, fresh, and not annoying to wear</li>
    <li> i love it and all...but &amp;#34;Eau De Toilette&amp;#34; means &amp;#34;Toilet Water&amp;#34;..</li>
    <li> I love the scent and packaging. I don&#x27;t know why some people say that it is not original. It is as good as my old bottle but much bigger! The price is awesome compare to other retail stores and the packaging and delivery was outstanding.</li>
    <li> Smells good.  It&#x27;s my dad&#x27;s favorite.  But there was a leak on the box and the pump was loosen.  It is for my dad&#x27;s birthday gift...  Not cool~</li>
    <li> Love the citrus like smell. Doesn&#x27;t last long, but is noticed when first wearing it. Became on of my faves.</li>
    <li> I sent this perfume as a birthday gift to my brother. The perfume is great, and it arrived at the promised time.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colognes. It&#x27;s not super strong but it&#x27;s strong enough that the others can smell it on you for at least 3-4 hours. Every man should give this cologne a chance. Especially at the price of $39.99 at amazon. Love it!</li>
    <li> The scent is great and not too over powering. The price is great too. Everyone comments on it! I would recommend it and am about to get it again.</li>
    <li> received, all right, thank you very much, the&#x27;ll take into account for future purchase</li>
    <li> Not too sweet smelling and not too &amp;#34;woodsy.&amp;#34; Nice clean scent. My wife found it at a cosmetics store and bought it the first time. Ordered from Amazon and paid less for the big bottle than they charged for the small one. The bottle is cool too. Lays flat.</li>
    <li> I read some reviews on amazon and bought this for the first time and I have no regrets. Smells amazing and lasts long.</li>
    <li> It has a nice, fresh smell. It is one my favorites to wear and can be worn for any occasion. Not for a kid trying to impress teenage girls but for men who appreciate a wonderful scent. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but the scent doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
    <li> Weak weak smell. Disappears almost instantly. Aptly name Aqua- it&#x27;s like spraying water.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money at all.&lt;br /&gt;Never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always a little suspicious when purchasing fragrances through online websites due to the high chance of getting a water mixed one (happened few times).  So the first thing when i receive this product, i checked to see if anything was previously unpackaged, then i put the fragrance on and checked to see if the product lasted more than 4 hours.  Just from my experience, any water mixed normally wouldn&#x27;t last more than 2 hours; 3 hours at the most.  Luckly my product was fine and it smells amazing.  very soft, yet heavy and soothing scent.</li>
    <li> recommend the product is absolutely perfect and original, responsible and sent within the stipulated time without any problem! thanks for serving</li>
    <li> The cents very good, but apparently it was not for my type of skin, it did not last like others.</li>
    <li> Ótimo perfume, a embalagem chegou em perfeito estado de conservação e dentro do prazo de entrega combinado. Recomendo a amigos.</li>
    <li> Holy Freaking Crap!!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is green magic in glass..&lt;br /&gt;I honestly put 3 sprays of this on yesterday.. and Can still smell it!!&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice aqua de gio reminence to it..&lt;br /&gt;Smells like you literally just walked out of the ocean.&lt;br /&gt;Best Reccomendation than alot of colognes i just purchased..&lt;br /&gt;This to me, is amazing..&lt;br /&gt;No Musk, Fresh and clean. Salty and magical</li>
