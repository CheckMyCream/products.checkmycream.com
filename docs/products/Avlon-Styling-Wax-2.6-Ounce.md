<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Yassss! Works wonders for my leave-out.  I am a natural 4(a) and currently am wearing a kinky straight textured sew-in. I have leave out on the top of my hair and I am trying my best to keep the heat out to avoid damage. I used this after straightening my hair (with an FHI Platform flat iron set at 390), on Saturday.  The only thing I used prior to a quick blow dry and then flat iron was the Kera Care leave in conditioner and Redkin&#x27;s pillow talk(or whatever it&#x27;s called) blow dry heat protectant.  Today is Monday and I have not flat ironed it since.  Not even my edges and I usually have to flat iron daily.  My hair simply lays.  Of course, I wrap it every night.  Before, I found blending was a chore, but now, this wax is the cure! Not to mention that I got this on same-day delivery - so, shipping was also A+++!</li>
    <li> Its ok, it doesn&#x27;t lay my edges down like people say. Delivery was prompt and on time.</li>
    <li> you only need to use a little on your edges.  I recently stopped perming my hair and my hairdresser was using this.  She said I had to stop using gel because it only breaks you edges and your edges will never grow.  I use this every other day and you only need a little.  I have now purchased 3 bottles.  I gotta keep it in stock.  Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Came in time &amp; in &amp; I love the product</li>
    <li> Hate it. Doesn&#x27;t lay my edges down at all. Just make my hair sticky. I want my $12 back!</li>
    <li> I really love this styling stick. I&#x27;ve used other brands (TIGI - Bedhead and a Paul Mitchell tea tree product), none of them compare to Avalon Keracare. I have naturally curly hair. However, when I want a straighter look; or just a little more contol for my curls, I use this styling wax. I&#x27;ve even used it one my eyebrows. It can be somewhat heavy, but if you smooth the wax on your fingers and finger style, you&#x27;ll get the look you want. The only drawback to purchasing this product is that given the price, you don&#x27;t get enough product.</li>
    <li> I have thick, natural, frizzy hair. I live in Texas, so none of this is uncommon. Every summer I am in search of a new product to tame my main. I can&#x27;t use just one product unfortunately because there are so many things that my hair needs that just one product alone cannot solve. This product is great though, it hold my edges back and keeps them from being out of control. I have natural hair so the edges are the first things to &amp;#34;go&amp;#34;. Great product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works well on pressed styles with short natural hair. Keeps the hair from reverting and smooths edges better than any edge control product I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> great product for the price best price I can find any where give it a try i liked it so will you</li>
    <li> Works wonders on fly aways and like magic if you are having trouble with blending hair when wearing extensions. Only need very little and it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. Will purchase again but product will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave white residue, lays my edges down with one quick swipe and a few minutes under a scarf. A god send!</li>
    <li> I cannot stand the smell. It smells like men&#x27;s cologne. I am surprised at all of the reviews that say it works on natural edges. It does nothing to lay down my 4B edges. Also, when applying the stick directly to the hair, the stick falls back down into the tube (maybe my tube is defective). Thumbs down for this product. I have no use for it.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations! The only thing that works for my fly-away hairs... Money well spent to blend my natural hair with extensions.</li>
    <li> I continue to buy this product and it never lets me down! The gels they have on the shelf now does not hold, but the Avlon Styling Wax does the trick!! This will hold you all night!!</li>
    <li> PKG CAME RIGHT ON TIME&#x3D;&#x3D;BUT WAX IS SO HARD I CAN&#x27;T EVEN USE IT&#x3D;&#x3D;CAN I RETURN IT?</li>
    <li> I was hearing so many good things about this product but could not find it in any of my local beauty suppliers and they have never even heard of it.  I am transitioning to my natural hair texture and this product makes it easy to lay the hairs that just will not behave.  It is a solid roll-on and just a dab goes such a long way...so it will take a seriously long time to run out.  I highly recommend this to anyone fed up the gel look.</li>
    <li> I love this wax! It tames frizzes, provides as sheen on the hair, and is very light weight on the hair. This is important to me because I am an African American with very fine hair. I have a short tapered hair cut and I love to apply it to the edge of my hairline and nap. I also sometimes apply it lightly through my hair to smooth ends...perfect! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is in a stick and difficult to get the last of it out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 4 years now and love it. I was hooked on hair gel till my hair stylist introduced me to hair wax...won&#x27;t use anything else now....no white residue from the wax.</li>
    <li> Pretty decent lays the hair down. Just a tad bit greedy. Other than that I love this product.</li>
    <li> I actually didn&#x27;t like the smell of this product and well, I am sorry to say that this stick didn&#x27;t work well with my hair.  All hair is different so just because it didn&#x27;t work well with my hair doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a good product.  I LOVE the &amp;#34;Beyond the Zone&amp;#34; Stiff head Stick, the Olive Oil edge control, Aragan taming gel...but that&#x27;s just me</li>
    <li> Hold My Hair Into Place At All Times I Love It ..I Call It My Hair Deodorant It&#x27;s Perfect Couldn&#x27;t Ask For A Better Product</li>
    <li> My hair is cut into a pixie, and it is sometimes a chore to get my edges and my &amp;#34;kitchen&amp;#34; to lay down.This is the perfect thing for me! Lost without it.</li>
    <li> smells good, but not worth the price. i didnt find anything spectacular about this an no i would not buy again</li>
    <li> keeps those fly aways down!!</li>
    <li> Works we&#x27;ll with heat. Definitely better than bed head.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It arrived a day earlier than expected so that was great also. It isn&#x27;t cakey, and hasn&#x27;t left any build up or residue .</li>
    <li> This is a great product, but the issue with this wax is that it applies wax to EACH hair strand, which causes strain and some breakage. As a rule, I use this wax ONCE when creating a pony-tail, and then when I need to freshen up my edges I brush with a wet brush and then tie a scarf around my edges. This stick does smell like cologne, so if you have a significant other, let them smell it so their won&#x27;t be any issues! Anywho, this is a great buy, but I am not sure if I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am 100% natural and this product has helped me a lot . In order for the product to work with less frizz, you need to keep your hair clean and oil free. I love this and will order again, you don&#x27;t need so much of it to work anyway. It should last you about 5 months.</li>
    <li> This really works for the girls hair.  Lays down the edges well enough, if you do not like using some of the other edge control products out here, due to build up.  Best for controlling fly aways.</li>
    <li> It works great on my hair and holds all of the loose strands down, especially for my sew ins :)</li>
    <li> This wax is heaven sent. I used this on my hair, it was smooth and sleek and blended with my weave. It provided protection against the heat of a flat iron and blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this stuff. It works very good on Natural and permed hair. Its not hard or greasy just perfect for styling and laying your hair or extensions flat.</li>
    <li> Worked well but the wax can get sticky and gross if not washed out each day.</li>
    <li> Love the product thanks!</li>
    <li> WORKS ON MY FLY AWAYS. IT&#x27;S VERY THICK AND TACKY ON THE HAIR. STILL SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING FOR MY EDGES THOUGH</li>
    <li> This product is very good. It lays my edges down well. Once applied that flat iron my leave out are snatched. I love the KeraCare wax stick</li>
    <li> I loved this product! It makes the hair super straight, and doesn&#x27;t build up after multiple uses. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT WORK. I was highly disappointed, a complete waste of money! If I could return the product, I would.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and undamaged. I applied it on freshly washed hair and was amazed at how straight and soft my hair was after flat ironing. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I receive the keracare wax stick within 2 days so shipping was extremely fast. Unfortunately The product was useless.It leaves a heavy build up even with small amount of product being used. It is also very hard, not smooth like I thought it would be. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I use this product to tame the few strands that are not willing to cooperate with the style of the day, and this wax helps to keep those unruly strands in place.  The smell is also pleasant.</li>
    <li> The best styling wax ever. I really dont need anything else. I thought it was not going to work for my hair but it does.</li>
    <li> this product is great! especially for a heat protectant on you leave out with extensions. its going to help me go natural so I wont have to use chemicals to straighten my hair. this is a great price its $25-30 in stores!!!!!</li>
    <li> Lays your hair down well especially if you&#x27;re natural</li>
    <li> omg this truly gets your hair relaxed or natural pretty flat... best use with a bristle brush!! It doesnt leave a white gel like residue but your hair feels moisturized</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you are using it for flyaway hairs, shine, or to keep your ends moisturized. It does not work in my opinion for your edges. I think the natural ingredients in the product will keep your healthy which is most important.</li>
    <li> AMAZING !!!! I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT! came a lil late but its alright. this is a great product</li>
    <li> GreAt product for weave, I don&#x27;t know about natural hair but it works wonders on this weave. It lays the hair down well</li>
    <li> It holds well but sometimes leaves a white residue in my hair, even when my hair is freshly washed. Very hard to scoop out, but all in all it does do what it says it will do: style and hold.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after viewing a youtube review as well as reading the reviews here to assist with managing leave out with my sew in extensions. Unfortunately, it did not do as well as I liked. I do however believe it is because I have natural hair which doesn&#x27;t blend well with sew in extensions. It was difficult to get enough of the product on my fingers to adequately distribute it. I melt it a little with a hair dryer which still takes a bit. It doesn&#x27;t flake which is great I just find it did not do well for what I was needing it for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok not really all the hype in my opinion</li>
    <li> I  love how this tames my hair without it being hard or  too stiff..especially compared to edge control or gel. Will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently transitioning from relaxed to my natural 4b/4c hair, so getting my hair to blend when I wear weaves has been an issue. My hair loves this wax! Paired with my Edgestick, my edges and leave out blend seamlessly with my weaves. A must have for transitioners!</li>
    <li> Love the product however applying too much will leave your hair looking very shiny and &amp;#34; heavy &amp;#34;. I do recommend</li>
    <li> Awesome product. It really works. I would recommend it to anyone who has problems with there hair laying down. Great!!!</li>
    <li> Product as described.</li>
    <li> This product truly does work the way it is suppose too.  It is something I can&#x27;t live without because my hair is natural.  This product slicks back my natural hair without any difficulty, would repurchase</li>
    <li> Product was okay. Nothing I have to buy again. This stick is only useful is if you wear weave all the time.</li>
    <li> Great product. Did the job wonderfully. It worked so well I had to hide it from my friend because she kept trying to sneak off with it. Lol</li>
    <li> Used it a few times. It holds hair down, as is the reason I purchased; but not for long and not without feeling &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I went to six  beauty supply stores for this product it was sold out everywhere, I purchased this product on Friday and it was on my doorstep Saturday.</li>
    <li> Product was packaged with care. Love the item. It was delivered sooner than expected. Great for edges,  relaxed or natural</li>
    <li> I bought this product to lay down  my edges because it was recommended by a stylist who swore by it.  We are both Black women. This was a waste of my money.  It did not lay my edges down, and this wax product is soft to the touch, thus making it soft on my hair.  It leaves a white residue as well.  I tried this product by putting it on using the push-up stick a few times, and I didn&#x27;t like the way it made my hair look and feel.  I then would stick my finger in the wax, and put it on that way.  Still, no deal.  I will not recommend this to anybody.</li>
    <li> sticky and too thick for me youtube reviews overrated.  won&#x27;t be re purchasing not worth it for the price I paid lots of cheaper stuff on the market that work better for my hair.  will give away to family probably.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT. IM A HAIR CARE PROFESSIONAL AND THIS IS A LIFE SAVER. SURPRISING TO ME IT WORKS ON COURSE NATURAL HAIR!!!!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure I would like this product, but my sister convinced me to try it and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I have biracial hair (mixture of curly and straight) and it works very well.  I don&#x27;t have to use much of it very often, but so far, I&#x27;m impressed.  Will purchase again.  Very fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my hair fly aways and my edges and it works well. Best to use before you flat iron.</li>
    <li> If anyone remembers KMS Stick It Wax, this is just as good. All the other wax sticks don&#x27;t work for me. I use it to lay my edges when  I wear my hair curly and top it with brown gel to counter-act the whiteness of the wax if I use too much. Also, I use it when my press gets old and I need to lay my edges. Don&#x27;t bother with the other wax sticks, they suck. Might I add, this is the best price I&#x27;ve seen on this product- especially considering it&#x27;s prime too. Local BSS sells for 17/pop.</li>
    <li> Horrible smell and not easy to apply at all.</li>
    <li> Smell is musky but it does help tame the flyaways</li>
    <li> It did everything I expected it too I&#x27;m very happy I did get a little heat damage but that was expected</li>
    <li> Excellent smoth my clients hair to perfection</li>
    <li> I have natural 4c hair that is lightly pressed.  This product holds well and keeps my hair smooth for several hours.  But I don&#x27;t like it for daily use.  It seems to leave a build up that is very difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> This product works very well for a while, but just like all the other it wears off throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I just received my Wax Stick, and tried it out. And honestly I love this product already. A little goes a long way so you wont need much, which is good since its a little expensive for such a small product. I will be buying again! :)</li>
    <li> This product did not work on my haird, and I have a relaxer. There are other products that work much better. I hate I wasted money on this one.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing it tames all my fly aways... And makes my pressing process extra easy since I have natural hair... The edge stick along with this product makes any hair style a shoe in for a flawless finish every time...</li>
    <li> Nothing slicks down unruly edges like this stuff.  I loved it so much I ordered another one for my mother and she loves it too!</li>
    <li> Great product got here way faster then I expected definitely will be purchasing again! For best results apply to your hair and rap it up. Your edges will be layed! WAY BETTER THEN OLIVE OIL EDGE CONTROL.</li>
    <li> I feel this product is just OK. It has a mild scent and very light hold. I&#x27;ve used this product in the past with much success, but I believe it was the old formula that came with a black top and red writing. This particular product feels more creamy than waxy and does not do as well of a job as I had anticipated on holding down the fly aways on my natural flat ironed hair.</li>
    <li> sometimes i like it, but other times it just feels like wax, and it breaks my hairline out so hmm</li>
    <li> My last wax stick was Giovanni brand which got discontinued.  I ordered this to replace that one because its almost gone.  The Avlon wax has a scent like womens perfume.  I&#x27;m a dude and so I don&#x27;t really like that smell on me.  I mean, I some in the hair and it basically works the same as Giovanni did but I am sensitive to smells.  I&#x27;m sending it back for a refund.  At least the company offers a satisfaction guarantee.  I am going to try the TIGI Bed Head wax instead which is supposed to smell like lavender, apparently.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with natural hair or anyone with hair that is coarse and resistant. This product has helped me STRETCHHHH that time in between relaxers like no other. No flakes, no mess, just slick edges that look like they have been freshly permed!!</li>
    <li> i like this product..iy really did slick my sides....the only thing ...it leaves a greasy thick residue after the third time you use  it....n it leaves a white residue if u keep using it....but other than that i still like it bc it slicks your sides down without making your hair hard like spritz...</li>
    <li> Love,love,love this product.</li>
    <li> Works great alongside the KeraCare cream press. Definitely holds down the hair and provides a nice shine to it. I thought it would also work as a edge control but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do that as good as taming my leave out but I definitely recommend to those with problems with fly aways due to the wind or just your hair being unruly!</li>
    <li> Great product for natural hair. Keeps my stubborn edges tamed.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Excellent product!, I looove it. I have relaxed hair and  a short hair cut. I use it on my sides to hold them in place as well as the top when curling or flatironing. This stuff is awesome. My daughter used it on her naturally curly hair and loves it as well. Plus the price was cheaper then in the store. I WILL be ordering another.</li>
    <li> This is junk compared to all the others on the market. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use gel to lay down my edges. 8 weeks post perm edges get dry and don&#x27;t lay as well. No worries. This lays down everything - hands down with no dryness.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best recommendation ever. LOVE! LOVE! I cannot believe I waited this long.</li>
    <li> THE BEST THING SMOKING! I am 100% Natural this is the only product that will give my hair a good press to blend in with my hair extensions</li>
    <li> Love this for applying to my edges then hot combing. Definitely will but again. Nice amount of hold and staying power. Hair didn&#x27;t revert.</li>
    <li> Love this wax stick it holds my edges down .  I am a natural person and it holds my edges . No build up not white stuff . It also smells good</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s one of the only things that keeps my 4c edges laid down. Work best for me when my hair is slightly damp and I tie a scarf over it for about 10 minutes. Doesn&#x27;t last all day but does the trick when I&#x27;m going out for 4-5 hours.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product for blending purposes.  It smells nice and it&#x27;s a great texture. I wish I had this years ago.</li>
    <li> Excellent product will purchase more in the future. Never purchased a product that blends hair so well...No build up residue, not greasy,,,, its simply perfect..Try some today</li>
    <li> This product unfortunately did not lay down my edges type 4C hair. It is helpful for managing fly aways though.</li>
    <li> I used this on my leave out for my tracks and it works better than reg curling wax (who uses curling wax anymore anyways? lol) I can never find this in the bss to I&#x27;m happy I found it via internet</li>
    <li> i enjoyed this product worked as advertised</li>
    <li> This stick is a hair edge&#x27;s savior!  Keeps them smooth without being clumpy or feeling waxy and best of all brushes out easily and keeps hair moisturized.  This is my second time purchasing it and won&#x27;t be my last!</li>
    <li> fast shipping, product smells amazing,doesnt really help with holding my edges down,im going to use it on my natural hair leave out for my next sew in to see if it helps it to striaght</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  I USE IT EVERYDAY.  IT SEEMS TO HOLD DOWN THOSE UNTAMED LOCKS OF HAIR - WILL CONTINUE TO USE</li>
    <li> Work great on my natural hair. Will continue to use</li>
    <li> Although I have not used this product to smooth my edges I have used it to flat iron my hair while stretching my relaxer. It works well for that purpose and resists humidity if you reside in a climate that is humid.  Now, that still comes with some limitations..I am relaxed and my new growth is curly and not real coarse. Hicks is best for edge control in my opinion..but this product is good for flat ironing leave out for extensions, it blocks humidity and protects hair from heat.  Gave three stars because off costs...would prob repurchase simply for my extensions in between relaxing.</li>
    <li> I heard rave reviews forms thomasadrianna and it serves its purpose works well but I like lusters wax stick better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an african american woman with very thick hair and have been natural for almost 3 years. I was looking for a product to hold my edges down without making them flaky (like gel does) in a couple hours and this is the perfect one! I have had this product for months because although I dont use it everyday, a little bit goes a long way and I am just now running out lol. It gives my hair a nice healthy shine and holds it in place. I will certainly be purchasing this again. FIVE STARS!!!</li>
    <li> Upon getting the styling wax, i researched the product and it seemed like a great tool. But when I received it I quickly noticed it didn&#x27;t not fully achieve its purpose with me. it did not hold my edges down for long and left this residue on my hair. Now to keep my edges right i combine edge control and this and that seems to work until I find one product to smooth my edges.</li>
    <li> Does nothing for my hair and is overpriced. Do yourself a favor and save your money. It&#x27;s also hard to get enough product off the stick to apply to the hair</li>
    <li> wonderful product!!! fast shipping excellent for use as a pomade for straightening hair flawlessly. In love!!! Use this right before you press/curl/wave your hair with a heating tool. You will look like you just left the salon.</li>
    <li> It was money well spent my hair laid down throughout out the whole day and no product build up and non greasy.</li>
    <li> Great product to keep those edges in control without greasy feel and no flaking! I bought 2 and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that great. I think maybe gel would be better for my aa hair.</li>
    <li> too heavy but smells great.</li>
    <li> OMG I was hoping this would work out great for me and I hate it I&#x27;m happy I didn&#x27;t pay the price they have in the store. I wouldn&#x27;t waste your time on buying this. I&#x27;ve had other that work out great that I love and I would just go back to that I was just seeing if there was something different out there and this is not it. Don&#x27;t buy, its mess, has a funny smell, and it makes your hair feel nasty. DON&amp;#34;T BUY</li>
    <li> I received my package within 3 days of ordering, it was packaged professional, also top was secured by tape in a bubble wrap packaging. I will order from this seller again. The product was exactly as the description read. It has made a huge difference in my hairstyle and the price was very reasonable. I have put a post on social media as well.....very satisfied!</li>
    <li> It works good on me and my childrens hair. They are natural and I am relaxed. I would definitely recommend this product for sure.</li>
    <li> Its a bit creamier then I thought which is fine in my book, nice smell to it. i honly only want it for fly aways. No complaints</li>
    <li> I have been natural for 3 years now and every so often, I like to wear my hair straight. My hair texture is about a 4b/4c (aka coarse) and reverts very easily at the slightest sign of moisture. When I tried this product in my hair, it kept it bone straight for a week! I honestly could have left it in longer, but I was starting to miss my natural curls. It washed out fairly easily and didn&#x27;t feel too heavy in my hair. It left my hair incredibly shiny as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint is that it didn&#x27;t keep my edges straight for that whole week, but I do work out a lot. Anyways, this is a great product and worth the money, especially if you have coarse hair!</li>
    <li> makes your hair dry! Didnt really like it to much. I suggest Organic Stem. This one leaves hair sticky .</li>
    <li> I recently got the top half of my hair bleached and colored, and that said I could not use a relaxer for a good bit until my hair grew out some. Which left me with a dilemma of wild unruly edges. I tried the ecostyler gel, organic root stimulator edge control,etc and while those things did work when i first put it on, about two or so hours later or after I bust a sweat my edges are making another guest appearance and this time even wilder than before. I was down to try anything at this point, so I read reviews on this product, watched some on youtube and decided that i had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived and i was in heaven with this thing. It smells delicious, it kept my edges manageable and down the whole entire day. This product is AWESOME!!! and it will be a staple in my hair regimne especially when i have not had a relaxer in ages. Its hard finding something that works agasint your hair reverting, but this wax does the job. I will gladly pay the $15 i did for this when the tube runs out, small price to pay to look kept up, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. I have a very short hair cut...and If I can&#x27;t get to the beauty parlor every week, I can slick this on my edges and they won&#x27;t stick out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on at night and put my scarf on. When I wake, I take my scarf off and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about two months and I still have a lot left...so, you only have to use a little bit in order to get the desired effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the price is good because I have never seen this brand in the beauty parlor, but it does work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a bit of a floral scent...which I don&#x27;t care for...but you don&#x27;t even smell it after you use it consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thin it is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It keeps flyaways at bay, and it has a moisturizing aspect to it too. A little goes a very long way. It has a waxy emollient feeling that I don&#x27;t mind because of the texture of my hair, which is super coily and dry when I wear it curly. If I wear my hair straight, it&#x27;s fantastic around the edges of my hairline because it will stay nicely moisturized and smooth without reverting.</li>
    <li> OMG I am in love with this wax.  I found out about it via YOU Tube and immediately ordered.  It lays down fly aways and does not build up on my hair.  I only have to apply it every couple of days.  This is a must have ....</li>
    <li> Very waxy and thick. Doesn&#x27;t hold hairline as described.</li>
    <li> Does what I need it to do. Definitely would purchase again if need be. Arrived in a decent amount of time.</li>
    <li> This stuff WORKS wonders. Good for Natural Hair or Relaxed hair. Also works great for taming your leave out (for Weave or Extensions). A little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> No sticky residue left behind works immediately would definitely purchase again only suggestion is don&#x27;t mix with other products. Love it!</li>
    <li> Does the job but is a bit heavier than I would&#x27;ve liked for fly always and not heavy enough for edge control..... So your application must be very deliberate on processed hair or straighter extensions if you don&#x27;t want ( as you shouldn&#x27;t) the hair to weigh down ad look shiny/greasy.</li>
    <li> GREAT... IT LAYS DOWN MY RESTLESS EDGES. WORKS WELL ON NATURAL HAIR, WHICH IS DEFINITELY A PLUS IN MY BOOK</li>
    <li> the keracare stick is my favorite I love the way ie lay my hair down will be buying this product again</li>
    <li> This product is good for natural girls. I used this when I was going out and knew my hair would frizz up. It did the trick kept my hair in place all night. Well that and some holding spray.</li>
    <li> best thing for pressing out my natural hair, love it</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it !!! Holds down edges and fly aways and is extremely easy to remove from hair when washing take my word for it I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews (:</li>
    <li> In the beginning it was nice but after the 3rd use it started to make my hair smell and i hated it. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great slick stuff. It works. It lays your fly-aways down and adds shine. I kinda don&#x27;t like it being as so wide. Makes it difficult to control in small areas.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave any residue in your hair and I honestly prefer it over their edge tamer. It&#x27;s perfect. really keeps my fly-away down</li>
    <li> I have natural and thick hair. This product help me to straighten my hair and greatly enough not have any heat damage.</li>
    <li> Another product I wish I knew about long ago. I&#x27;ve almost used the entire wax stick. Very handy and really works, especially with my few grays that refuse to lay.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!  My sister&#x27;s hairstylist use it on my sister&#x27;s hair and I just had to have it. It keeps my curls for days without the hard look and feel (some of u girls know what I am talking about) but be careful, it only takes a little. Using too much will make your hair waxing. I couldn&#x27;t find it in a store but I found it on Amazon. Oh yeah!</li>
    <li> This styling wax is a good product for smoothing down edges between touch-ups.  I did not give it 5 stars because the paste-like consistency does not &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34; into the hair as easily as I thought it would.  Because my hair is so dark if I am not careful you can see the product in my hair.  A better option is Avlon Keracare Edge Tamer.  It is clear vs. white, so it blends nicely into your hair.</li>
    <li> This product works perfect on blending fly away and smoothing your edges. . . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> It works on my hair. I like it</li>
    <li> I loved this product......but the price is very expensive for the amount.....it leaves your hair with a shine on top of a natural hold without the stiffness.....I use it on my edges.</li>
    <li> I Love this product! Doesn&#x27;t flake and works great with gorilla snot gel for those of us who are natural for edge control! (Apply styling wax brush in with brush then apply gorilla snot). I also recommend for fly-a-ways on sewins or wigs!</li>
    <li> This product ia great for edges that need touching up for weaves but I use it on my 5 year old too.  Im happy to get it at this unbelievable price too!</li>
    <li> Does not hold hair at all. I have natural hair and this product was a waste of my money. Additionally, they have a no return policy. If you have thick textured hair (race does not matter considering quality of product) this product will not hold your hair.</li>
    <li> You must be careful to blend this product in to your hair and to use a small amount, otherwise it can leave a white residue. It works relatively well for providing a flexible hold. It could work better for holding my relaxed 4c edges straight between re-touches. However it is better than nothing and it works a little better if I have straightened my roots first. It has only a slightly greasy feel, but it does not leave your hair itchy or overly oily. I will continue to use and I would recommend purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> I bought this to slick down my edges. It does not lay down my edges, so I just use on my new growth sometimes.</li>
    <li> This product works!! It lays down your hair and tames fly aways without leaving your HARD or GREASY!</li>
    <li> Its a good product helps with hair after and before straightened. I would recommend this product to other people interested</li>
    <li> Will buy this again. If you have natural hair that you flat iron or curl, this is a must product to have.</li>
    <li> My hair is 100 percent natural and nothing gets it straighter. This is a Must buy. I will keep buying this product. I only use it on my hair, so I still Have a good amount left over. If you want professional result this styling wax is a must have.</li>
    <li> Great price and awesome product for taming your edges if you have natural hair. Not sticky. Just have to know how to use it. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> overated product made my hair feel heavy and weighed down even if you use a little...its still too much......if looking for a stiffl look...get it</li>
</ol>
