      <li>And it won&#x27;t blend into my own hair, no way, no how.</li>
      <li>Although it came with a very strong smell (cause its synthetic).</li>
      <li>They also get tangled a lot and very easily.</li>
      <li>And I will order more for sure!</li>

      <li>I just wish it blended better and was thinner too.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I love it blends well</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s okay for it to blend in better.</li>
      <li>but its cute</li>
      <li>It feels great and it is very soft!</li>
      <li>This is a great product the hair is a bit shiny but it blends really well and the clips are really strong.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more excited to wear these.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It got tangled really easy</li>
      <li>The smell is too strong.</li>
      <li>in all.. for something like 7 bucks, these are MORE than worth it.</li>
      <li>they were so cheap.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t shiny, so they&#x27;re pretty believable, and they don&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
      <li>I came a whole month early the colors are great</li>
      <li>but overall is a good product.</li>
      <li>Overall I didn&#x27;t have a good experience.</li>
      <li>I will cut it and try to make a ponytail with it, it won&#x27;t be able to tangle so much.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
      <li>So many people gave these high ratings.</li>
      <li>though synthetic-- does a pretty good job to mimic actual hair.</li>
      <li>The color is nice and as I expected but gets tangled easily.</li>
      <li>Overall, I give the hair extension a 3 out of 5 because of the flaws, but the color and thickness is really nice.</li>
      <li>I got the right color.</li>
      <li>But for the amount of hair, amazing, It&#x27;s very thick and the color is amazing.</li>
      <li>The hair does tangle easy, but can be fixed.</li>
      <li>But it does get super tangley fast.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so pretty.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be purchasing more colors.</li>
      <li>overwhelming chemical smell that stunk up the entire room.</li>
      <li>I had to straighten the hair a couple of times with a flat iron and brush to keep the tangles in place, so it&#x27;s heat safe.</li>
      <li>but the image shows a deep teal to light teal and the product itself is definitely black to bright</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not toxic smelling or anything like that, and in the 10 minutes they&#x27;ve been out of the package, the smell is almost undetectable unless you put them right up to your face... who does that on a normal basis?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty new to extensions, so this is from someone who&#x27;s first impression of ANY extensions, are</li>
      <li>isnt real hair</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a very chemical smell that I can not get rid of.</li>
      <li>But 1 will do the job sence there really thicküòÅ.</li>
      <li>These extensions are actually pretty thick and nice feeling.</li>
      <li>If you try to dry it with a blow dryer, i strongly recommend either wearing a respirator or holding your breath, because it feels like you are inhaling cancer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also suggest for ALL extension you buy to line the net with fabric/seam glue because it helps adhere the hair to the net better and prevents shedding.</li>
      <li>Overall, pretty decent product considering the price.</li>
      <li>Color was exactly the same as in the picture.</li>
      <li>They are more of a Navy blue to teal, rather than black</li>
      <li>All the clips are secure, and clip in tightly.</li>
      <li>took forever to come..and smelled like a old tire..</li>
      <li>They are soft and silky.</li>
      <li>There really cute, I mean considering they came from China</li>
      <li>Has anyone tried to blow it straight or put a flat iron to it and does it work or melt?</li>
      <li>The hair does not look fake witch is very important !</li>
      <li>Pretty and came faster than expected.</li>
      <li>My one major problem with this product is the smell.</li>
      <li>No regrets buying this.</li>
      <li>It took about an hour to thin it and took a while to cut it down and try to make it look good with my layers.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Looks great, goes in easily and stays put.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product ! Although it came with a very strong smell (cause its synthetic). WARNING it is extremely long</li>
    <li> It feels great and it is very soft! It&#x27;s pretty long, and the light blue is tall, so the other reviews must have gotten a bad one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no navy/dark blue, instead it&#x27;s black. But that&#x27;s okay for it to blend in better. It&#x27;s thickish, but not as thick looking as in the picture. The clips are fine and they came in good shape!!!</li>
    <li> Smell horrible and tangles. Will not buy again, and I don&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> would give it zero if I could. overwhelming chemical smell that stunk up the entire room. contacted seller, but never got back to me. waste of money! in the garbage it goes!</li>
    <li> One of the clip broke after 2 uses but overall is a good product. The color is nice and as I expected but gets tangled easily.</li>
    <li> My one major problem with this product is the smell. It smells awful!&lt;br /&gt;It has a very chemical smell that I can not get rid of. I have shampooed the piece, sprayed it with perfume and left it outside overnight but nothing will get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;Also I know that the description says Black to Green but the image shows a deep teal to light teal and the product itself is definitely black to bright blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not my favorite product but definitely not terrible. I would probably buy another if it didn&#x27;t smell so horrific.</li>
    <li> His daughter bought it. &amp;#34;I loved it great hair. Color was exactly the same as in the picture. Takes a couple weeks to arrive. Defintely going to buy more. Great price.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Pretty and came faster than expected. very long.</li>
    <li> Looks amazing. I love it</li>
    <li> So many people gave these high ratings. I&#x27;m shocked. I looked at many different hairpieces before ordering this, and made a bad choice. It is one piece over 9&amp;#34; wide, with 5 small clips. The hair is very long &amp; heavy, as it is only one piece. I wish it were thicker and several smaller pieces.  I hate the crappy clips too, they pull a lot of my own hair out no matterhow careful I am with them.  Hair is shiny and looks fake, but not horrible fake. Unatural colors always looks fake! I got  lt purple to dr purple, the lt purple is actually magenta. A nice color, but not purple. The worst is the hair quality, I have never seen hair knot &amp; tangle like this before, and I am used to fake hair. Because of how badly it tangles, I don&#x27;t know how anyone could wear it. I was so dissappointed when I opened the package. It was cheap, but I hate to totally waste my money. I will cut it and try to make a ponytail with it, it won&#x27;t be able to tangle so much. I don&#x27;t see anyway to attach it w/o it turning into a nightmare mess on my head. And it won&#x27;t blend into my own hair, no way, no how. Waited so long to get it, and so dissapointed. Wanted for an occasion, now not enough time to order from a different company. I won&#x27;t order anything from them again, no matter how good the reviews people give. This is bad quality hair, peroid.</li>
    <li> I love this! I got black to green and it&#x27;s so pretty. It&#x27;s not shiney, and it doesn&#x27;t shed bad! But it does get super tangley fast. I won&#x27;t to cut it to match the length of my hair, but if I do I will lost the ombre color on the bottom! The hair is kinda heavy, so it will take a while to get use to. Yet, it came in five days! And I will order more for sure!</li>
    <li> My hair is usually pin straight and I am nervous to put heat to the synthetic hair, will it melt? It didn&#x27;t come with directions. Has anyone tried to blow it straight or put a flat iron to it and does it work or melt?</li>
    <li> Very beautiful. I just wish the clips were smaller because they really stand out no matter how hard I try</li>
    <li> I just got it today anf i am so happy with it i have no problems with the clips and the color is perfect. I got the navy to aqua colored one.</li>
    <li> it took a while for them to come, but everything else was good. It got tangled really easy and I cut them because they were too long for my hair but besides that it was good I love it blends well</li>
    <li> This is a great product the hair is a bit shiny but it blends really well and the clips are really strong.</li>
    <li> Amazing my friendster make a dreadlock for me</li>
    <li> So it came in today and it was the perfect length so you can adjust it to your perfect length but I had to edit this review because it took forever to make it look somewhat like my hair. It took about an hour to thin it and took a while to cut it down and try to make it look good with my layers. My family still tells me that just looking at it, it still looks fake and feels fake too. But it&#x27;s not bad for the price. I just wish it blended better and was thinner too.</li>
    <li> This hair smells really bad so bad I washed it 3 times and the stinks is still there. It leaves the stink on  anything it touches</li>
    <li> Honestly I was expecting these to be really great, but when I got the extension, they had a really strong and chemical smell. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s how they processed these but oh well, I&#x27;m currently in the process of washing them. Also, the extension that has the 5 clips, not the greatest quality ever. They seem loose, and don&#x27;t clip into the hair properly. They also pull at the hair very easily no matter what position I tried. The hair does tangle easy, but can be fixed. I had to straighten the hair a couple of times with a flat iron and brush to keep the tangles in place, so it&#x27;s heat safe. But for the amount of hair, amazing, It&#x27;s very thick and the color is amazing. Though, I do see sparse strands of the green in the black but that&#x27;s not very noticeable. Overall, I give the hair extension a 3 out of 5 because of the flaws, but the color and thickness is really nice.</li>
    <li> There really cute, I mean considering they came from China the shipping was good I got the right color. They are really long its a little hard to put on.They also get tangled a lot and very easily. But 1 will do the job sence there really thicküòÅ.</li>
    <li> Just got this item in and iam so in love!! I already have it in and I love it! No regrets buying this. The color is exactly the same in the picture and there is no damages or anything wrong with it. It look amazing !! And is not itchy. The hair does not look fake witch is very important !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty new to extensions, so this is from someone who&#x27;s first impression of ANY extensions, are these.&lt;br /&gt;First of all they&#x27;re GORGEOUS. They are more of a Navy blue to teal, rather than black and I&#x27;m actually GLAD they are. They are soft and silky. They aren&#x27;t shiny, so they&#x27;re pretty believable, and they don&#x27;t look cheap. All the clips are secure, and clip in tightly. I couldn&#x27;t be more excited to wear these.&lt;br /&gt;I saw some reviews that said they had a smell, but mine only smell very slightly of plastic, but that&#x27;s understandable, because a) they ARE plastic, and b) they were IN plastic. It&#x27;s not toxic smelling or anything like that, and in the 10 minutes they&#x27;ve been out of the package, the smell is almost undetectable unless you put them right up to your face... who does that on a normal basis?&lt;br /&gt;I will be adding a bit of glue to the underside of the netting just to stop any potential shedding, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be shedding, too much.&lt;br /&gt;All in all.. for something like 7 bucks, these are MORE than worth it. I will definitely be purchasing more colors.</li>
    <li> The hair piece was great I came a whole month early the colors are great this would receive 5 stars but one of the clips came slightly broken it can still hold in my hair but not as well and when I first got it it smelt pretty bad but the scent went away after one day</li>
    <li> The smell is too strong. Had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> I give this one star. I clipped this into my hair the correct way and everything, and it looked like they were hair extensions. Besides being the wrong color to blend (which was my fault) you could just see how it was clipped in even know it was covered. Overall I didn&#x27;t have a good experience. But X&amp;Y ANGEL are a good association.</li>
    <li> These extensions are actually pretty thick and nice feeling. The hair itself-- though synthetic-- does a pretty good job to mimic actual hair. However, the clips are sewn in very loosely. I feel like there&#x27;s almost no point trying to sew them tighter they were so cheap. But I feel like if one were to enhance the clips it would be perfect. I also suggest for ALL extension you buy to line the net with fabric/seam glue because it helps adhere the hair to the net better and prevents shedding. Overall, pretty decent product considering the price.</li>
    <li> It is perfectly bright and full and everything just like the picture (i got the teal). it smells soooo bad though, and the smell is hard to get rid of. If you try to dry it with a blow dryer, i strongly recommend either wearing a respirator or holding your breath, because it feels like you are inhaling cancer.&lt;br /&gt;seriously, lungs will hurt.</li>
    <li> CAN&amp;#34;T WAIT TO WEAR IT</li>
    <li> It smells really bad. We have washed it many times and it still stinks.</li>
    <li> Can I use Heat On them?</li>
    <li> I bought this when my hair was black...took forever to come..and smelled like a old tire..isnt real hair and it doesnt curl..but its cute</li>
    <li> Literally smells like someone with dry mouth. Like extremely bad breath</li>
    <li> The hair piece was very long and I had to cut it to blend with my layered hair. I used a little amount of heat on it... But, DO NOT USE HEAT ON IT!! Its a bit too shiny as well, but make sure to wash it before using o.e</li>
