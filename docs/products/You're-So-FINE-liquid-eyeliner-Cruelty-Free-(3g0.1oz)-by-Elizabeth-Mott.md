      <li>Not only does this one stay on all day, it also is quick drying and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I never thought I&#x27;d find an eyeliner for me, but sure enough here it is.</li>
      <li>First try:  </li>
      <li>I have very oily lids and haven&#x27;t had any success with eyeliners..until now.</li>
      <li>, First try:  beautiful thin line.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner-it is very fine and the brush is stiff enough where I make fewer mistakes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a wand I like so much</li>
      <li>Overall this is a fantastic product that I&#x27;m sticking to.</li>
      <li>Once dry it doesn&#x27;t budge and comes of easily with make-up remover.  </li>
      <li>I cant live without this product!</li>
      <li>I have monolid eyes and they are very oily making it hard to find any kind of eyeliner that stays put all day.</li>
      <li>Not what I was expecting I have the the black glitter one, and I love it</li>
      <li>This particular one is easier to open than the last one, but probably because I&#x27;ve been cleaning it more.</li>
      <li>Very sensitive to new products.</li>
      <li>I stayed away from liquid eyeliners because too many we&#x27;re taking way too long to dry and would end up smudging.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had to on for 18 hours straight with not a single smudge or chip.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, applicator makes it easy to control thin or wider line above eyelid.</li>
      <li>it tends to flake off in big chunks and falls into my eyes and really hurts when wearing contacts.</li>
      <li>(it is SO precise but it moves like a paintbrush which I love because it gives you so much more freedom) and the liquid liner quality is just insane.</li>
      <li>This one drys to fast, and the brush is way to thing than the black glitter one.</li>

    <li> Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
    <li> I just got this today.  Excited by the comments, what a disappointment.  First try:  It was a wide wet runny line.  2nd try:  Brushed the brush off the edge of the tube to get the least amount on it, again not as wide wet runny line.  Put the cap back on twisted to close it and the mascara just oozed out of the tube and ran all over the outside.  Thank goodness I ordered it thru amazon.  Its going back, with a full refund :)  I also ordered the Lorac, First try:  beautiful thin line.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply and create any liner look you desire.</li>
    <li> Incredible. Best I&#x27;ve ever used. Thin. Sharp. Doesn&#x27;t run. Sold!</li>
    <li> This is the only liquid eye liner that I have found that stays all day!</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, no smudge or crackling.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous liners that say that they are water-proof and smudge-proof and have not found anything that delivers until I tried this product.  I love it.  Once dry it doesn&#x27;t budge and comes of easily with make-up remover.  I will not be going back to any other liner out on the market.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelines! It glides on so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t smudge. I cant live without this product!</li>
    <li> Best liner!!! Must have</li>
    <li> I received this eyeliner in my sample IPSY bag and I loved it, so I re-ordered it on Amazon. This is my new favorite eyeliner. It&#x27;s easy to use and lasts all day!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner-it is very fine and the brush is stiff enough where I make fewer mistakes.  It dries quickly and looks great.</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner I have ever used. Easy to apply, applicator makes it easy to control thin or wider line above eyelid. Stays on all day and into evening. This product is definitely s &amp;#34;keeper&amp;#34; to keep in stock!!  Also love the &amp;#34;glitterati&amp;#34; option for special evening eyes!</li>
    <li> This is awesome. I have very oily lids and haven&#x27;t had any success with eyeliners..until now. This has been the only eyeliner that actually stays put through the ENTIRE day without ending up smudged! I never thought I&#x27;d find an eyeliner for me, but sure enough here it is.</li>
    <li> Very sensitive to new products. Love this one after receiving it from Ipsy. Continued purchasing.</li>
    <li> I have tried dozens of liquid eyeliner and this is by far the best. It is so easy to use, and literally stays on all day. I wear it every single day, whether I&#x27;m just hanging out, going out to the bars, or swimming and it stays on no matter what! Love this stuff so much!!</li>
    <li> it tends to flake off in big chunks and falls into my eyes and really hurts when wearing contacts.</li>
    <li> I first received this product in my ipsy bag and loved it. I have monolid eyes and they are very oily making it hard to find any kind of eyeliner that stays put all day. Not only does this one stay on all day, it also is quick drying and easy to apply. I stayed away from liquid eyeliners because too many we&#x27;re taking way too long to dry and would end up smudging. It&#x27;s also easy to take off with makeup remover. But like I said, the biggest perk is that it stays on all day. I&#x27;ve had to on for 18 hours straight with not a single smudge or chip. If it does come off, it&#x27;s because I touched my eye or didn&#x27;t put it on thick enough and instead of smudging off, it chips off. Overall this is a fantastic product that I&#x27;m sticking to.</li>
    <li> I love this brand!  The eyeliners actually stay put, last and last, and they don&#x27;t test on animals.  What else can you ask for!  If your hesitating about buying any Elizabeth Mott products, don&#x27;t.  They are wonderful.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting I have the the black glitter one, and I love it that&#x27;s why I decided to get this one. This one drys to fast, and the brush is way to thing than the black glitter one.</li>
    <li> applies smooth - lasts all day - really love it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely my favorite eyeliner by far! The eyeliner dries quickly and does not fade, crumble off, or smudge. Stays on all day and looks fantastic all night.</li>
    <li> VERY waterproof, I got splashed in the face a few times in the ocean with big winged lids and it didn&#x27;t budge!!! I&#x27;m so impressed. :) This is my second time buying the eyeliner, and again for some reason it&#x27;s tough to open after a few uses. I found cleaning the excess off the underside of the cap helps a little. This particular one is easier to open than the last one, but probably because I&#x27;ve been cleaning it more. It&#x27;s still worth the pickle-jar like opening experience-- I&#x27;ve never had a wand I like so much (it is SO precise but it moves like a paintbrush which I love because it gives you so much more freedom) and the liquid liner quality is just insane. It&#x27;s beyond worth the $$, I love this stuff so much I&#x27;ll be buying it forever and if I ever have female children they&#x27;ll be like, &amp;#34;mooooom I know this is the best liner ever stahhhp.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:) Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Love it and have reordered it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  It glides on very  easily ! It is not messy like other eyeliners I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works great and stays put!</li>
    <li> My favorite eyeliner now. I was always a Mac girl until I got this as a sample in my monthly Ipsy pack. Now it&#x27;s all I order. It&#x27;s amazing and once on does not budge. I got my coworker hooked on this product as well. It&#x27;s so precise with the fine tip you really can&#x27;t go wrong. BUY THIS EYELINER! You won&#x27;t be sorry :)</li>
    <li> If you have oily skin this eyeliner is perfect! Stays all day!!!!!!</li>
