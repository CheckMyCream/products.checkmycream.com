      <li>All your essential oils are great.  </li>

      <li>Very powerful.</li>
      <li>Oil quality seems very high and potent.</li>
      <li>Good quality essential oil.  </li>
      <li>I really have fallen in love with this blend, and will continue to order it.</li>
      <li>I have experienced extreme hypertension including hospitalizations.  </li>
      <li>so your brain can allow you to quickly fall into a relaxing sleep,</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll sleep like a baby, or take a quick whiff of it when you&#x27;re stressed at work or home.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this oil and plan to purchase more of it when I run out.  </li>
      <li>I really really enjoy this oil, out of all the different scents out there besides lavender this one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>It has a very strong scent that lasts for a long time.</li>
      <li>will for sure buy my 3rd bottle.</li>
      <li>The first one lasted me exactly a year.</li>
      <li>I love to diffuse, or even just open the bottle and sniff.</li>
      <li>but this was my first time using an oil blend.  </li>
      <li>smells pretty natural, not artificial</li>
      <li>100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.</li>
      <li>They are pure with no fillers.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I bought the whole pack of 14</li>
      <li>This is a very relaxing scent.</li>
      <li>[...] has a bigger selection and they offer free shipping on every order.</li>
      <li>I like using them all, but this one is by far my favorite essential oil blend.</li>
      <li>and I really like the new bottle they are using as the oil comes out much slower.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Relax Synergy to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fragrance is lovely and long lasting.</li>
      <li>I add this to the lotion that I make and a few drops is all you need and it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
      <li>I put a few drops on a cotton ball and stick on top of my heat vent in my bedroom at night....</li>
      <li>The scent is very relaxing and lasts long enough for me to fall asleep but is not too strong.  </li>
      <li>I recently discovered that if I put this in a hot bath and soak for awhile my pain is completely gone.</li>
      <li>The label cautions not to apply directly to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>only is it very relaxing</li>
      <li>I can say that I appreciate comforting natural aromas and scents of this blend.</li>
      <li>I would wake up still tired, but ever since I started diffusing this synergy at nights, I feel more refreshed and not tired anymore the next day.</li>
      <li>I achieve a relaxing calm JUST by putting a little of this oil on my finger and smelling it.  </li>
      <li>The product is not clean, not sure they add some chemicals to it as it is far from close to what a real, clean essential oil smells, feels and taste like.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I can say that I appreciate comforting natural aromas and scents of this blend. They give a lovely kind of euphoric burst of refined energy.</li>
    <li> My favorite relax or sleepy time blend. It smells great and I love the touch of patchouli. This blend is a nice subtle yet complex mixture. It is not chemically or perfumey smelling like some. another homerun by plant therapy.</li>
    <li> Loce love love the smell!! I know it is a matter of tastes, but I personally love it. I bought the whole pack of 14 and this is my favorite to diffuse at night. I would wake up still tired, but ever since I started diffusing this synergy at nights, I feel more refreshed and not tired anymore the next day. Before I would always squeeze a 2 hour nap mid morning but now I don&#x27;t feel like I need it! It relaxes me and helps me get a good night sleep.</li>
    <li> I was pretty wary of ordering oils online as I was concerned that they&#x27;d be artificial Glade-like scents or so diluted that they would be useless.  This oil mixture - RELAX - is really wonderful.  The strongest fragrance is of lavender, but you can also smell the other oils as well.  I burn this mixed with some water in an oil heater and it&#x27;s a great fragrance for relaxation.  The label cautions not to apply directly to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with this oil and would recommend it.  Relax and enjoy!</li>
    <li> I really really enjoy this oil, out of all the different scents out there besides lavender this one is my favorite. I put a few drops on a cotton ball and stick on top of my heat vent in my bedroom at night.... Love it!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this twice now, once the 10 ml size and now the 30 ml size. I think if they offered it in a larger size I would buy that. A few drops on the pillow or in a diffuser really helps the problems and concerns of the day melt away so your brain can allow you to quickly fall into a relaxing sleep, no pills necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it very relaxing but it also smells wonderful. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Helps me sleep :-).  Along w/ schiff melatonin plus.</li>
    <li> This scent is perfect for bedtime.  I mix several drops with purified water in a small glass spray bottle that I purchased on Amazon.  The scent is very relaxing and lasts long enough for me to fall asleep but is not too strong.  I highly recommend this oil and plan to purchase more of it when I run out.  However, it only takes a little so that will be not for quite a while.</li>
    <li> I love this blend. Great way to calm your nerves and induce relaxation. I use it in a spritzer bottle to spray linens or in the air to refresh the room.</li>
    <li> I add this to the lotion that I make and a few drops is all you need and it&#x27;s lovely. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle purchased from this vendor.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping is prompt, and the quality of the item is great.&lt;br /&gt;I use this oil in my bedroom using an electric aromatherapy diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;The oil creates great warm and calming air in the bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;You will get more than what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;I will for sure buy my 3rd bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this oil it helps me get to sleep at night. I put a few drops in my hands and pub it on the back of my neck, add some to my wrists, and then put some on the bottom of my feet.I have  diffuser and add a few drops to my diffuser.</li>
    <li> Great oil and use before bedtime and on grandkids when they spend the night to wind them down!</li>
    <li> I really have fallen in love with this blend, and will continue to order it. I use it in my diffuser every night.</li>
    <li> He does find it somewhat relaxing.  It just takes the edge off he says.  Will continue to use it and see if there is a more potent formula out there.  I have several Plant Therapy EOs and will continue to purchase from them.</li>
    <li> All your essential oils are great.  I use the synergy every nite before I go to bed.  I also use it in my oil diffuser, it is a wonderful product.  Sincerely, Rosalina Esposito</li>
    <li> Great smelling and worked great to help was the pain in my mom&#x27;s knee.</li>
    <li> I use this is my bath every night. The only downside is because it&#x27;s 100% it can make you dry out so I use it with a little baby oil.this is my second one to buy. The first one lasted me exactly a year.</li>
    <li> I often have difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep.  It has been very helpful to put a few drops on a cotton pad that I keep in a small dish next to my bed.</li>
    <li> I ordered a set of Plant Therapy synergies a few months ago. I like using them all, but this one is by far my favorite essential oil blend. I was in a bad wreck 3 years ago and still have a lot of pain on active days. I recently discovered that if I put this in a hot bath and soak for awhile my pain is completely gone. This blend can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> smells pretty natural, not artificial</li>
    <li> Really love the scent</li>
    <li> This smell was not good for me.  My daughter liked it.  I like Tranquil better.</li>
    <li> This was very pleasant for quite awhile. I purchased this in February &#x27;15  but recently it has turned green and has a very strong unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Only after learning, reading and researching I realized I made a big mistake buying essential oils from this company. The product is not clean, not sure they add some chemicals to it as it is far from close to what a real, clean essential oil smells, feels and taste like.</li>
    <li> Love Plant Therapy and this is one of my favorite blends. [...] has a bigger selection and they offer free shipping on every order.</li>
    <li> This is a very relaxing scent. I love to diffuse, or even just open the bottle and sniff. Oil quality seems very high and potent. Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Just love it!!! Very powerful.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand the smell of this, so it is not at all relaxing. I will go back to the essential oils I usually buy. They cost more but smell and feel wonderful!</li>
    <li> Good quality essential oil.  Strong fragrance.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an oil blend for your warmer that has a bit more complexity than lavender then give this a try.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many time I have reordered.  great brand.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this. It&#x27;s especially good for naps.</li>
    <li> Spray a little on your pillow and you&#x27;ll sleep like a baby, or take a quick whiff of it when you&#x27;re stressed at work or home.  A few drops in the bath will help you also!</li>
    <li> ILove Plant Therapy oils! They are pure with no fillers. This is one of my favorite synergies. This is the 2nd time I have purchased this mixture.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. I put it in my Aura Cacia Aromatherapy Room Diffuser each night before I go to sleep. It works well and I really like the new bottle they are using as the oil comes out much slower.</li>
    <li> This is a nice blend. I purchased it for my diffuser. The lavender is a little too prominent, the other oils are hard to detect.  But still good for relaxation!</li>
    <li> I bought the relax synergy essential oils for use in a diffuser at night.  It has a very strong scent that lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> This synergy blend is wonderful.  I use it in my reflexology sessions as well as diffused when I am giving manicures and pedicures.  My clients are able to reap the benefits of a relaxing session!!!!  Orders are always received well.</li>
    <li> We love relax oil. We have bought many times. Use in a diffuser, bath water and on skin. Our favorite!!</li>
    <li> I have experienced extreme hypertension including hospitalizations.  I bought this oil to supplement prayer and medication, medicine, DVDs, eggplant and cucumber in water, long baths and just resting to lower my blood pressure and relax.  I have used lavender oil in epsom salts for years but this was my first time using an oil blend.  I achieve a relaxing calm JUST by putting a little of this oil on my finger and smelling it.  I often just put a little oil on my arm or wrist while I&#x27;m watching television or listening to music.  It&#x27;s simply amazing to me.  I relax very easily with this oil.  I look forward to using it in a diffuser during my next bath or pamper session.  I highly recommend Relax Synergy to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the product I love  [[ASIN:B005VSXTNQ Relax Synergy (Mental Relaxation) Essential Oil Blend. 10 ml. 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade. (Blend of: Lavender, Marjoram, Patchouli, Mandarin, Geranium and Chamomile)]]</li>
    <li> Very nice to add to an epsom salt bath! The scent is soothing and very warm and pleasant. A nice blend and good seller.</li>
    <li> Transaction went well. Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered this blend expecting to help me rest better. I was pleased to discover this blend smells amazing but it instantly  relaxes me. A great product.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is lovely and long lasting. Good for sensitive skin! I order it all the time!  And give to friends!</li>
