    <li> I don&#x27;t see anything special about this product. It&#x27;s about the same as applying any other lotion. I will continue to use it and see if I notice anything different.</li>
    <li> I use only this lotion to heal as I have excema and most other lotions cause me to break out or have clogged pores.</li>
    <li> Keeps my new tattoo looking fresh!</li>
    <li> I just got another tattoo. My ink usually heals quickly and painlessly. NOT THIS TIME! I had my inner upper arm done. Four hour tattoo and it&#x27;s been a very painful healing. I ordered this and it feels wonderful. I put some on my older tattoos and they look great!</li>
    <li> Tattoo Goo Brand is the only product i use on my ink. Non greasy, non staining  and applies easily. No unpleasant odor.  A tattoo is a lifetime commitment and i want it to stay as beautiful  as the day i got it so i have no problem buying a specialty product to maintain it .Arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Great product, great seller, great transaction</li>
    <li> it came on time but I don&#x27;t notice any difference on my tattoos it is the same as any other hand and body lotion I have been bamboozled before and this won&#x27;t be the last time I am sure  I won&#x27;t be buying this product again you know what they say if something sounds too good to be true it probably is lesson learned.</li>
    <li> makes tat look like new</li>
    <li> No different then any other lotion</li>
    <li> I personally would not recommend wasting your money…appears to be just like any other lotion you can use, a bit glorified.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for tattoos. I use it up to three times a day, it moisturises, and brightens your ink.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with how well this product works. I have a tattoo that is almost 5 years old, and the lotion has really brought out the colors!</li>
    <li> I like to stop using AnD ointment after the first few days, and switch to lotion. This lotion absorbs well, and definitely gives your tattoos a bit of a shine.</li>
    <li> So far i only notice a small difference. Hoping it will get better as time goes on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good lotion.  It&#x27;s unscented (completely) which I like, it&#x27;s not greasy and goes on well.  It makes my skin soft and helps with dryness BUT it doesn&#x27;t make any real difference with my tattoos. I have to apply it a few times a day and who&#x27;s got time for that.  My tattoos are old, yes,  but I see no difference and in fact that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do is renew old tattoos.  Vaseline intensive care lotion would have done just as well on my old ink as this expensive bottle of lotion.  It&#x27;s a nice lotion but nothing grand.</li>
    <li> Works great. Really brightens up tattoos.</li>
    <li> Great product.  My tattoo looks great</li>
    <li> A nice lotion but needs to be constantly applied to maintain that brighter glow.</li>
