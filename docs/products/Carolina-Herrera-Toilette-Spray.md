      <li>I was very excited when I received the Cologne.  </li>
      <li>Very unique.</li>
      <li>Buy this item from Direct Street and you will surely get a genuine product.&lt;br /&gt;Unique but has a very good fragrance.</li>
      <li>It has a very pleasant smell...but its so lasting that it will continue through washes and build up strength...</li>
      <li>Es original, muy buena fragancia, compra excelente..</li>
      <li>Overpowering and sickeningly sweet, it leaves no breathable air in the room.</li>
      <li>Attentive very fast and son .</li>
      <li>Not as good as the first one I bought couple of yrs back.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I received a fake because I doubt there would be so many good reviews</li>
      <li>With overwhelming cymbal crashes of Fruit Stripe Gum and Baby Powder, this stuff is generic to the power of 2.  </li>
      <li>This was for myself and I like this 212 so much more than the regular 212</li>
      <li>is my favorite fragrance I use constantly</li>
      <li>to the point it will give certain people a headache.</li>
      <li>It honestly smells bad way to strong.  </li>
      <li>DONT spray directly on you or your clothing.  </li>

    <li> Carolina Herrera 212 VIP Eau De Toilette Spray for Men, 1.7 Ounce:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is absolutely dreadful.  With overwhelming cymbal crashes of Fruit Stripe Gum and Baby Powder, this stuff is generic to the power of 2.  Overpowering and sickeningly sweet, it leaves no breathable air in the room.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I received the Cologne.  From all the good reviews I read I thought I would like this Cologne but I didn&#x27;t.  It honestly smells bad way to strong.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I received a fake because I doubt there would be so many good reviews and I ended up not likeing it at all.  I tried returning it but I wasn&#x27;t able to since I opened it.</li>
    <li> exellent purchase!, I bought this for my boyfriend because I loved the smell, and I wanted to smell it on him! he absolutely loved it!! and I am enchanted! regarding to the seller, had no issue with anything, I recommend this seller if you ever want to buy this item</li>
    <li> excellent product. Recommended!</li>
    <li> Smells good! But it won&#x27;t stay for long!</li>
    <li> I like it.  It has a very pleasant smell...but its so lasting that it will continue through washes and build up strength...to the point it will give certain people a headache. When you approach them.  Apply to the counter and use a Qtip to dab some up and dot it on.  DONT spray directly on you or your clothing.  The metered spray is WAYYYYYYYYYYYY to generous.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because this is some of the best cologne I have ever purchased.  I would recommend this to any of my friends or family.</li>
