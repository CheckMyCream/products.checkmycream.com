      <li>Well, I appreciate the customer service and honesty, but most of all, the better price.</li>
      <li>latest handle is the sonicare Flex.  </li>
      <li>these cost a couple dollars more than the Pro Results brush heads, I was hoping for a better brush, with more cleaning power than the others I&#x27;d been using (which work fine).&lt;br</li>
      <li>Your hygienist will be pleased with your home care, as is mine.</li>
      <li>I came across these and found they work on most of there</li>
      <li>This unit is lighter, more compact, and seems stronger in it&#x27;s performance.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>Simply put the best brush heads on the market in my opinion.</li>
      <li>And I love my Philips sonicare</li>
      <li>I reached out to American Health Supplies, who distributed the product, and Jenn in customer service was wonderful.</li>
      <li>The stock brushes are going in the trash :)</li>
      <li>I love this brushhead.</li>
      <li>OK, so I have never reviewed anything before.</li>
      <li>this was a better price then everywhere else</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s real or perceived but it seems like this has now doubled the power of my already great brush.  </li>
      <li>They last 3-4 months and are some of the best sonicare brushes i have used to date.</li>
      <li>Aside from the looks of the tooth brush and the cool factor it has in charging, it is by far the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
      <li>These are definitely the best brush heads that are currently available.</li>
      <li>These vibrate much more fiercely, so there is a louder sound, with greater vibrations</li>
      <li>Make sure you read the fine print.  </li>
      <li>I bought the DiamondClean heads to use with this unit, and they work fine, also called Phillips to verify I could put DiamondClean heads in the UV sanitizer, they said it was OK.</li>
      <li>The price was better than buying them locally by a significant margin.  </li>
      <li>It seems like they clean better and make my teeth whiter..</li>
      <li>The Diamond Clean are much more smoother on your gums and your teeth feel more clean after brushing.</li>
      <li>I love these brush heads, they leave our teeth feeling so incredibly clean.</li>
      <li>These brushes are easy to change out.</li>
      <li>However, instead of ponying up the $200+ for a new toothbrush, I was delighted to find out that I could buy the replacement heads and use them with my existing Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>than that works fine</li>
      <li>Otherwise this purchase was fine for now, and to try the brush heads like I wanted to.</li>
      <li>They fit on the handle just fine</li>
      <li>I said again that the DiamondClean heads fit on the handle just fine, but I guess that by \\&quot;fit well\\</li>
      <li>This brush head gives a smooth, thorough cleaning.</li>
      <li>, that Philips says the DiamondClean fit but may not \\&quot;fit well\\&quot; on your FlexCare handle.</li>
      <li>So I called Philips, and after a bit of consultation off the phone the tech said \\&quot;although the DiamondClean works on your handle, it doesn&#x27;t seem to fit well for yours.  </li>
      <li>It has an improved \\&quot;DiamondClean\\&quot; brush head, primary toothbrush unit, charging stand, and travel case with USB charger.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;i think was free shipping</li>
      <li>they fit well and do the job.</li>
      <li>I also think the daily flossing does more good than any brushing technology ever will, my opinion.</li>
      <li>I think Philips must have tightened up the engineering of the head somehow, because these seem to move more intensely and clean better.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!!  </li>
      <li>The size is exactly what I want, better than the original one come with my Philip sonicare.</li>
      <li>It has a greater surface area of contact with your teeth which gives a more complete cleaning!</li>
      <li>This heads did not come in an original package.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a 3 months and seems to perform as the original.</li>
      <li>My original order was lost in the mail.</li>
      <li>Brush heads arrived on time and were just like the original brushes.  </li>
      <li>Moreover, there is no way to determine if these are original products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really leave your teeth feeling clean.  I think they even whiten your teeth on their own.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Sebago shoes for about 10 years and always purchase them when I visit Maine. I could not find them in any local shoe stores or outlets. I was pleasantly surprised that Amazon carried them. I ordered them Sunday and received them Wednesday in time for a weekend outing. I am very happy with them. They are comfortable from the first day that you wear them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my sonicare now for about 5+ years and I absolutely love it.  I started out with the old screw on brush heads with the older model and then moved up to the newer design where you just push them on.  Well, over the years I&#x27;ve bought various types of brush heads for it and most recently I bought one of those 5 packs from Costco.  I wasn&#x27;t thrilled by them and it just seemed like they were a little too soft and just didn&#x27;t clean my teeth as well.  Let me tell you that when I first put this brush head on my sonicare and used it for the first time, WOW, it was as if I had just bought a new tooth brush.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s real or perceived but it seems like this has now doubled the power of my already great brush.  At first I was spraying tooth paste all over the bathroom mirror, just like when I first got the brush.  I&#x27;ve had to adapt the way I brush a bit but it leaves my teeth feeling brand new.  I would definitely recommend this brush head.  It will make your sonicare feel brand new again.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. Much better than the older sonic care toothbrush. I don&#x27;t need to unscrew the top part to get rid of the water deposits anymore. My teeth feel much cleaner than before. I love the different settings. It delivered earlier than it stated.  I  highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I purchased these because I needed new brush heads anyway, and thought \\&quot;what the heck.\\&quot; I LOVE EM! I have some little tough to clean areas in my mouth and this brush head has been the ONLY one, including other Sonicare heads, to successfully get the build-up in those spots. I love this one so much that I look forward to brushing, and my gums feel good, and my mouth just generally feels cleaner. This product inspired me to write my very first review- thats how awesome they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t know what some of the dissenters are doing wrong, but the diamondclean bristles actually feel softer than the ones with the fading blue bristles. Which I like because I hate firm bristles, they tear up my gums. Im not gonna stop flossing, because my teeth are close together, but Im hooked. Unless they start making a brush head that gives you a neck massage while you&#x27;re brushing, I will be sticking with them. Also, the price was right for me. The Amazon store I bought them from had a very competitive price, shop around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the cleanest teeth ever!!</li>
    <li> Shipment is fast. And packaged well. The brushes are really soft. The size is exactly what I want, better than the original one come with my Philip sonicare.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try these as the standard pro head did not clean well between the teeth.  These vibrate much more fiercely, so there is a louder sound, with greater vibrations and it tore up my gums in delicate areas.  Really rough and still does not clean between the teeth.</li>
    <li> I love this brushhead. The fibers leave your teeth feeling clean and crisp! I&#x27;d never go back to the Proresults, unless I had to. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the Proresult heads are great, but this is a winner. Always looking for the best!</li>
    <li> It is nice to have the extra brushes. I love the toothbrush! I am now buying them for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> This product was not what I had expected.  I had to return it since I thought that I was getting the replacement brushes for my sonic care toothbrush.  These were for a different model.  Had to return and it was simple as pie to send them back. Product seemed very nice but not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Afte upgrading to a new Sonicare we were quite disappointed with the stock bristles on the brushes that came with the toothbrush (one long and one short).  After hunting online, we stumbled across these little babies. They fit our Sonicare perfectly and feel much better. You can just tell how much cleaner they get your teeth afterwards.   The stock brushes are going in the trash :)</li>
    <li> Work as advertised.  Good value for a product that is hard to find in local stores.  Will continue to use</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing Sonicare toothbrushes shortly after they became available to the public.  Each new one was an improvement over the previous version.  This newest Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 DiamondClean is a continuation of this tradition.  It has an improved \\&quot;DiamondClean\\&quot; brush head, primary toothbrush unit, charging stand, and travel case with USB charger.</li>
    <li> brush too hard. standard brush is better for me. 11 more words required. but this is all i am going to say</li>
    <li> For the price I wish these things would hold up longer then a month each...  Brushing the usual two times a day each brush head held up for about a month before it broke down/ didn&#x27;t work as well.  For as much as they cost I would hope that they just would last a little bit longer.  Thirty bucks for three brush heads is kinda pricy, in my opinion if that matters.  As far as I can tell these are the only option for that system.</li>
    <li> My family has been using Philips Sonicare tooth brushes now for over 5 years.  Since coming out with the new Diamond Clean brush heads, I feel like they do an even better job at cleaning our teeth.  They are not the cheapest brush heads out there, but so far they seem to be doing a fantastic job at cleaning our teeth.  I would definitely recommend them even at the current price.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from an older Sonicare unit whose battery would no longer hold a charge. This unit is lighter, more compact, and seems stronger in it&#x27;s performance. I&#x27;ve used it for about three weeks now on it&#x27;s initial charge, and I&#x27;m down to one battery bar, so it&#x27;ll need it&#x27;s first re-charge after about 1 month&#x27;s use. Don&#x27;t tell my dentist, but I only brush/floss once a day! So take that into account if your looking at battery life, mine may be twice as long as you twice a day bums! Ha! Still, at my 6 month dentist checkups/cleanings, the hygienist has very little cleaning or scraping to do. She always praises the Sonicare line. I also think the daily flossing does more good than any brushing technology ever will, my opinion. Overall very satisfied. I am never happy with the price of their units, nor the high cost of replacement heads... but it&#x27;s worth it to me. I bought the DiamondClean heads to use with this unit, and they work fine, also called Phillips to verify I could put DiamondClean heads in the UV sanitizer, they said it was OK. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great product received in a timely manner and in the correct packaging. The brush heads are a little over priced however this was a competitive price for the product (approx $8/brush head). I love these brush heads, they leave our teeth feeling so incredibly clean.</li>
    <li> Great brash head,on time no problem receiving ,I have good expirence with this seler I will buy And I love my Philips sonicare</li>
    <li> Great Product, I was wondering if the product was going to be worth the extra money....it was and I am very pleased with the product</li>
    <li> I believe it is better than the standard head.  I believe this will last longer as well.  I was never able to get 3 months out of the standard head, I am hoping to get the 3 months with Diamondclean</li>
    <li> My dentist recommened I purchase this product and it is works well.  It feels like you get better coverage with it than the standard brush head that comes with the unit.</li>
    <li> OK, so I have never reviewed anything before. But these guys and the Philips toothbrush have made me look forward to brushing.This is a great product. I also bought the electric flosser thing that they make about two weeks later and that combination is what prompted me to review! Awesome.</li>
    <li> I auto ship my brush heads and when reseach phiilips new line I came across these and found they work on most of there line why i cancled my auto ship on the old kind which was 2 for 18 and signed up for 3 for 30 on this type which will work for me till they make a few flagship that is not art deco like the diamond</li>
    <li> This brush head gives a smooth, thorough cleaning. I don&#x27;t have the diamond base, but used the diamond brush that came with the dual bases when purchased. My whole family has the same type of base and each uses the diamond brush - well worth the extra money!</li>
    <li> I have been using electric brushes since 15 years now. I have used several models of sonicare and oral-B. I like Sonicare&#x27;s vertical brush movement better than the Oral-B&#x27;s circular brush movement.&lt;br /&gt;My latest handle is the sonicare Flex.  I just got these brush heads.  My teeth feels much cleaner. The Brush heads seems to be more firmer, whiel stil being soft on the teeth. A must buy if you own a Sonicare brush head.&lt;br /&gt;I still have some unused sonicare pro-results brush heads left - I am not sure if I am ging back.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Sonicare DiamondClean brush head for about 1 month. After a couple of weeks of use the softer outer bristles began curving outward like the standard brush head bristles did after 3 months of use. The outward curvature prevents the softer bristles from going between the teeth. I am disappointed with the life expectancy of the diamond clean heads and will be going back to the standard heads. Oh, the DiamondClean stiff center bristles are doing fine.</li>
    <li> Perfect Replacements at a Reasonable Price.</li>
    <li> Who isn&#x27;t hesitant to buy these from somebody other than the manufacturer or retailer?  I assure you they are 100% the real deal, without the awful price tag of the ones you&#x27;d find in the store.  Mine came packaged loose together in a little zip style bag with a note explaining they were wholesale and because of this, they were able to provide them at a cost reduction.  They also offered a refund if I wasn&#x27;t happy.  Well, I appreciate the customer service and honesty, but most of all, the better price.</li>
    <li> This heads did not come in an original package. It is very unsanitary that somebody is bagging toothbrush heads and selling them pretending they are originals. I would have never buy if I knew that somebody hand -packaged this TOOTHBRUSHES!!&lt;br /&gt;This should not be sold like this. This is not right.&lt;br /&gt;This may be sonicare pieces but somebody handle them and bagged them this is just gross. I am returning this product! Should be ilegal to do this.</li>
    <li> Best price, just what is needed</li>
    <li> Good price and they fit in my Sonicare.  They seem to be exactly what I needed.  I love the Sonicare, but it&#x27;s hard to say I love the replacement heads. .. . . . . . .</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and just as described, thanks</li>
    <li> Perfect fit works great</li>
    <li> Philips Sonicare Standard Brush Heads are the best so far, it cleans my gum and teeth pretty much everyday. Better than other brand.</li>
    <li> I trust Amazon as everything I have purchased through them has been just what I thought it should be. This product is great and the price was right.</li>
    <li> I really like these tooth brush heads better than the other ones that came with the toothbrush... It seems like they clean better and make my teeth whiter..</li>
    <li> I thought each head had a different ring on it to distinguish who&#x27;s brush it is but other than that works fine</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing like being locked in to the only place you can buy refills - the toothbrush manufacturer! These are so grossly overpriced that they leave a very sour taste in one&#x27;s mouth, pun intended. Sonicare should be ashamed for such egregious price gouging. Performance-wise?  They brush your teeth. How exciting is that?</li>
    <li> These are incredible. I own a FlexCare Plus and my roommate has a HealthyWhite. Both of us just bought these new brush heads, and both agree that it&#x27;s like a new toothbrush entirely. Just awesome. I think Philips must have tightened up the engineering of the head somehow, because these seem to move more intensely and clean better. My teeth feel even cleaner than before; it&#x27;s like upgrading from the old-style handle all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have loved all my Sonicare products, but this one is at the top of the list. Sure, it&#x27;s a bit expensive, but I probably go through one 3-pack a year. If you&#x27;re looking for some added horsepower without spending $200 on a new brush head, this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I splurged and bought fancy Sonicare toothbrushes for my 3 children and I. Buying replacement heads is a considerable expense.I wanted the diamond head so I chose these and signed up for automatic shipping. It seemed to me that the brush heads wore out quickly. Also the automatic shipping didn&#x27;t come because there was no availability...btw I find I have to go through the cycle twice with the toothbrush to feel like my teeth are really clean.</li>
    <li> These toothbrush heads are great and do a good job of cleaning.  In the past with manual toothbrushes or the entry level Sonicare, I had a noticeable problem with plaque buildup on my bottom teeth - when using these brush heads and the Diamond clean brush, that problem is long gone.  These are a great deal with Subscribe and save, and I recently got an extra delivery ordered as the wife didn&#x27;t have any left for her Flexcare brush and stole one of my Diamondclean heads!  Her reward? I ordered another set of 3 and gave her another as a spare.</li>
    <li> Impressive:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Very through cleaning brushes!!&lt;br /&gt;2.  Work very well with Sonicare ProResults brush!&lt;br /&gt;4.  Mouth feels cleaner than when using ProResults Soniccare heads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To not be as pricey!!</li>
    <li> I expected the product to be in original packaging.&lt;br /&gt;But in the package you receive, the three brush heads are put in a small ziplock.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not even a sealed ZipLock. It&#x27;s a regular one. For a hygienic product, I don&#x27;t think this is a good thing to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Moreover, there is no way to determine if these are original products.</li>
    <li> Brush heads arrived on time and were just like the original brushes.  I like the diamondclean brushes so much better than the regular ones.  Good price also.</li>
    <li> Stumbling around Philip&#x27;s site, I saw that they&#x27;ve introduced a new model of Sonicare that uses these Diamondclean heads. However, instead of ponying up the $200+ for a new toothbrush, I was delighted to find out that I could buy the replacement heads and use them with my existing Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these heads work very well and with minimal effort, do a very effective job of cleaning my teeth, especially around the gum line. If you&#x27;re looking to take your Sonicare experience to the next level, give these heads a try!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out why, with these brushheads being so similar to the ProResults Soniccare heads, that they decided to remove any sort of individual identification of brushheads (ie color coded rings).  Every single Sonic model has color-coded brush heads, or color coded rings that you put on the brush heads .. that is, every single model EXCEPT their ultra-high end Diamondclean?  Doesn&#x27;t make any sense.  With 4 folks in our household using this brush, we need the color-coded brushheads to make life a lot easier.  EXTREMELY disappointed that this critical component is missing, especially since it&#x27;s always been on every single prior model.</li>
    <li> High quality product.  Lots of options on speed and pressure.  Quiet and travel-ready.  Just a bit pricey, but still worth it.</li>
    <li> I finally upgraded my ancient soniccare toothbrush to a new flexcare and decided to invest in these brush heads as well. These just seem to work a lot better than the standard ones that come with the flexcare. Teeth feel cleaner and after a few weeks, they seem whiter and all those little stains that have built up over years (I smoke and drink coffee) are mostly gone. Simply put the best brush heads on the market in my opinion.</li>
    <li> these were exactly what we ordered and the quality was as expected  would order these again if were available  good peoduct</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!!  Had a one of the older Sonicare systems, and the DiamondClean series is GREAT!  Teeth has the &amp;#34;just visited the dentist&amp;#34; feeling!</li>
    <li> I have a Flex Care + brush &amp; wanted to try a different brush head then the Pro Results I&#x27;d been using for a couple years now. These brush heads are not available locally so I can&#x27;t go out to the store and buy them. Ordering is my only option.&lt;br /&gt;Considering these cost a couple dollars more than the Pro Results brush heads, I was hoping for a better brush, with more cleaning power than the others I&#x27;d been using (which work fine).&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are not harsh on my gums (do not irritate them) and do clean well (about the same as the Pro Results)&lt;br /&gt;They fit well with a tiny gap between brush &amp; handle on my Flex Care + (not an issue for me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that these did not arrive in original packaging. It is like someone took them out of the box and shipped the brushes in the little sealed manufacture plastic they are originally in. They didn&#x27;t appear to be tampered with &amp; the shipping company said Sonicare. I&#x27;m confused as to why these are not shipped out in the manufacture box, but wanted to note that they do arrive in just the sealed plastic without the box. I have a UV tooth brush sterilizer that came with my Sonicare Flex Care + and used it on the brushes (ease of my mind at least).&lt;br /&gt;I do want to note that if this sealed plastic the brushes arrived in was tampered with, had a hole or even looked like someone had been doing something disgusting, criminal or otherwise unethical I would shipped them back immediately. All I wanted was the brush heads and it bothered me not to have them arrive in a manufacture box, but since they appeared to be not tampered with I kept them. Chances are I will find another seller to order from next time or go directly to Sonicare&#x27;s website and order. Otherwise this purchase was fine for now, and to try the brush heads like I wanted to.</li>
    <li> Great price and cleans so well my teeth feel like I have went to the dentist for a professional cleaning!</li>
    <li> We used to use the brush with a small rubber cleaner in the center of the brush. we loved those. can&#x27;t seem to find that tooth brush. So, we settled on these. they fit well and do the job. they are soft enough to not cause any discomfort, but strong enough to make our mouth feel fresh and clean. they easily last about 6 months for us.</li>
    <li> Deliver exactly whats advertised. best sonicare brush heads i have ever used. with my experience the head life is about 1-1.5 months depending on brushing habits.</li>
    <li> These brushes are easy to change out. They last 3-4 months and are some of the best sonicare brushes i have used to date.</li>
    <li> I bought the Sonicare toothbrush at the recommendation of my dentist. These brushes work are supposed to last 3 months but their effectiveness wears off in less than one. Very expensive heads and lose the blue color very fast.</li>
    <li> I think this toothbrush is great.  It seems to be a improvement for me over my previous Braun.  These brushes are the best brushes as well.  Get these.  Your hygienist will be pleased with your home care, as is mine.</li>
    <li> The brush heads were great. It&#x27;s always nice to have a new toothbrush as it makes your teeth feel so clean, and these brush heads are definitely raising the bar. I never had an electric toothbrush before, and the results are incredible. I can&#x27;t believe I was left in the dark for so long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real reason for the review is how well the company that distributed the product was excellent.  My original order was lost in the mail. (Literally. I have no idea where, but some lucky person has random brush heads. I hope he/she enjoys them!) I reached out to American Health Supplies, who distributed the product, and Jenn in customer service was wonderful. We took care of everything over email and I had a replacement set shipped to me at once. It&#x27;s always nice when you get taken care of, even in a disappointing situation as this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using both ProResults and DiamondClean heads on my FlexCare+ handle, but using the DiamondClean my handle makes a buzzing sound where the ProResults doesn&#x27;t (just the usual humming).  So I called Philips, and after a bit of consultation off the phone the tech said \\&quot;although the DiamondClean works on your handle, it doesn&#x27;t seem to fit well for yours.  We&#x27;ll send you some ProResults heads that you should use instead of the DiamondClean heads you bought.\\&quot;  I said again that the DiamondClean heads fit on the handle just fine, but I guess that by \\&quot;fit well\\&quot; she meant they don&#x27;t work well without making a buzzing sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a shame, since I do like the way the DiamondClean head cleans my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So heads-up, that Philips says the DiamondClean fit but may not \\&quot;fit well\\&quot; on your FlexCare handle.</li>
    <li> I had a difficult time figuring out which replacement tips to buy.  Hard to tell if they were aftermarket items.</li>
    <li> These work great, my teeth look great and stay whiter and healthier. Small compact heads get the tough to reach areas you may not be able to reach with a larger brush head.</li>
    <li> These are definitely the best brush heads that are currently available. If you are currently using the Pro Results, this is certainly a step up. The Diamond Clean are much more smoother on your gums and your teeth feel more clean after brushing.</li>
    <li> I was pleased that the diamond clean head was compatible with older sonic care brushes. It has a greater surface area of contact with your teeth which gives a more complete cleaning!</li>
    <li> it cam in as soft bubble package&lt;br /&gt;it stored in a box&lt;br /&gt;and it cleans like you would not believe&lt;br /&gt;i think was free shipping&lt;br /&gt;so how it came was great&lt;br /&gt;found it in my mailbox&lt;br /&gt;thought it was a an early christmas present&lt;br /&gt;and it was to me&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> These DiamondClean heads are noticeably better than the regular heads.  Only reason they didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is I&#x27;d like them to last a little longer than they do.</li>
    <li> The brush heads are great.  Generally last a few months depending on how many times you brush a day.  But overall very satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> I bought the Philips Sonicare HX6733/90 HealthyWhite 3 Mode Platinum Edition Rechargeable Toothbrush 2-Pack Bundle (2 Power Toothbrushes, 2 DiamondClean Brush Heads. These new style brushes are a definite improvement over the screw on type. They work!</li>
    <li> these brushes are just as expected. they work well. my teeth feel great. this was a better price then everywhere else that i looked</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed these already elsewhere on Amazon, but I&#x27;m too lazy to go find that review, somehow it seems less work to just write a fresh review instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are nice heads that seem to do a great job of cleaning, and last sufficiently long. I use them in my Pro-Results brush rather than on a DiamondClean brush, as I prefer the featureset of the ProResults toothbrush package. These heads work great in this application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be that it would be nice if Phillips would add the ability to have color-coded rings on the base of these brushes like they do for the normal ProResults brush heads. My wife and I share a single toothbrush system, and just swap out the brush heads, so it would be nice to have an easier means by which to tell the two heads apart. Add this feature back in, and these \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot;/\\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; heads will get a full five star rating.</li>
    <li> after long hours of reading reviews and researching i decided to go with these brushes, they are amazing set of brushes</li>
    <li> The brush heads seem to be doing a good job cleaming my teeth.My dental technician said I was doing a good job cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> They fit the base unit, my teeth are clean, I am happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are eight more words to complete review.</li>
    <li> My Sonicare was probably one of the best purchases I made all year. Aside from the looks of the tooth brush and the cool factor it has in charging, it is by far the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned. From the very first use, my teeth has never felt cleaner (except for when leaving the dentists office). With my personal preference of using Rembrandt products that has peroxide in it, my teeth has also gotten noticeably whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the downside though, relating to these brush heads specifically, they recommend that you change your toothbrush at least once every 3 months. This I understand, but when you brush your teeth at least twice a day as recommended, they tend to wear out a little bit faster then the 3 month mark. Heck, even faster than two at times. This definitely jacks up the price of replacements by a lot. The indicator on the brush heads tend to wear out a little more then half way after only about a month of use. I do feel as if its still definitely worth it but be weary of how much you&#x27;ll be shelling out a year on the cost of replacements alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m the only one in my household using a Sonicare, I don&#x27;t have to worry about any color coded rings to identify which brush head is mine, but it&#x27;s definitely a thought to consider on how much money you&#x27;ll be spending throughout the year if everyone in the house brushes their teeth 2x a day and all use the same types of brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to rate this 5 stars being that I actually do love the product but the star has to be taken off due to its fluctuating expensive price. As of 7/29/2012, retail is currently $29.99 off the Philips website for a 3-pack ($10/brush), Amazon is $35.16 (almost $12/brush) and Target&#x27;s website says $29.99 just for a 2-pack ($15/brush!) with the 3-pack being sold out. Amazon usually does have the best prices, is normally good with its stock and does an almost excellent job with its Prime membership so I have no major complaints about the price here.</li>
    <li> I will state that I ordered these through Amazon and received them ahead of the estimated arrival day and that they are in fact the product as described.  The price was better than buying them locally by a significant margin.  As for the heads themselves if you have a Philips Sonicare DiamondClean toothbrush get these!  Not sure if others would fit or not, but these do an excellent job!</li>
    <li> Sonicare is the best. The difference it has made in my dental checkups is amazing. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s disclosed, but I missed it!  Make sure you read the fine print.  Difficult to distinguish if this a grey market or 2nds/Blem item.</li>
    <li> Appear to be the exact replacement. They fit on the handle just fine and they work like the ones that came with it. It takes a moment to get used to new bristles if you have been using an old one for a while.</li>
    <li> the packaging is a little sketchy but they seem to be authentic. I&#x27;ve been using it for a 3 months and seems to perform as the original.</li>
