      <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
      <li>It is a very gentle soap that does not leave my skin feeling dry or &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; like many other brands.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s less harsh on your skin, and is even great as a facial soap!  </li>
      <li>It leans toward sweet, but a man could definitely use when it&#x27;s balanced out with the rest of his toilet i.e. shaving cream, deodorant and a dab of cologne.</li>
      <li>I use it has a soft milky, silky  feeling</li>
      <li>this dove seems to dissolve much faster than the other types I&#x27;ve used.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Hard to find in stores. Great item</li>
    <li> Love the new pomegranate and lemon verbena scent!!!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait for the next deal as I will be stocking up on this soap.</li>
    <li> Fresh summer scent and the wonderful soft skin I have come to expect from Dove over the years, nice to get it in regular shipments with the prime membership, never run out again.</li>
    <li> DOVE BEAUTY BAR HAS A REFRESHING SMELL AND GOES GREAT WITH DOVE REBALANCE BODY MISTS. I WOULD BUY DOVE BEAUTY BARS AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I use nothing but Dove Body Beauty Bar and I love it!  I use the White almost all of the time because the Revive Dove Beauty Bar can not be purchased locally so when I found it on here I purchased 2 packs with 6 bars each!  The price was cheaper than 6 bars of Dove at my local stores!  I will be back!&lt;br /&gt;The Revive smells fantastic and gives my skin that much needed moister for the winter months!  Love my Dove Beauty Bar bath soap! :)</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Dove and it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin. They never disappoint when it comes to quality.</li>
    <li> No complaints at all on this product. It&#x27;s awesome and the cost is comparative to most stores!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great deal overall!!!</li>
    <li> Bought two 6 packs of this and it smells great. I like the price as well, just hate that it&#x27;s an add on item.</li>
    <li> I think this is my favorite soap from the Dove line. Foamy and very moisturizing. Though it is a bit on the expensive side.</li>
    <li> Only soap I use. Great for women. This one revive tho is by far the best smelling soap I have ever smelled I love it and only use this kind now</li>
    <li> This is the only bar soap I or my family will use.  It does not leave a residue, but does provide additional moisture compared to other bar or body soaps.  It has a low pH so it&#x27;s less harsh on your skin, and is even great as a facial soap!  The pink is just a personal/aesthetic preference; the white bar has the same results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Pink Dove. It is a very gentle soap that does not leave my skin feeling dry or &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; like many other brands. There is no &amp;#34;soap film&amp;#34; left on my skin after bathing either. The scent is wonderful and it has always been very gentle, even on my sensitive skin. Unfortunately, an unrelated health condition has forced me stop buying this product. However, if not for that, I&#x27;d be using this soap til the day I die!</li>
    <li> I use these for hand washing delicate items, the smell is soft and gentle, and the soap is good quality</li>
    <li> This is the best soap ever it leaves your skin looking soft like a baby and smell good to I use deodorant</li>
    <li> Nice soap. Nicely scented.</li>
    <li> This soap smells so amazing. You open up the package of soaps and you can smell it without even opening the little box. Dove soap is my favorite soap.</li>
    <li> This is the only kind of soap I use it has a soft milky, silky  feeling and it smells so good.</li>
    <li> Love using this. Skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry. I also recommend the body wash as well. Love it??? A must buy again!</li>
    <li> Love it, smells great.</li>
    <li> this dove seems to dissolve much faster than the other types I&#x27;ve used. I do enjoy the scent and the quality seems good, but i bet the bar lasts only half as long.</li>
    <li> I only use Dove soap, and have tried virtually all of the varieties of bar soap the company sells.  This is my favorite.  The fragrance is soft, vanilla-like, and the soap has a perfect foaming and rinsing consistency.  Highly recommended.  And Amazon&#x27;s competitive price (lower than if you buy at Wal-Mart or K-Mart or Target), coupled with Prime free shipping, makes this a superb purchase.</li>
    <li> Very good fragrance. It is not too strong and unlike regular dove soaps,&lt;br /&gt;it does not leave that sticky or greasy feel after bath.</li>
    <li> the price is competitive low and the product is very good. the 6-count is economic. the smelling of the soap bar is very good and fresh.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap.  I love scented body washes and soaps but worry about the cheap ingredients found in many.  This is a fresh light scent and I still get to use the Dove bar I know is safe for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this soap.</li>
    <li> This was the only scent that could pry me away from the Wintercare Dove Bar.  That one smells very clean and prevents itchy, dry, winter skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Dove Revive bar though, smells awesome and I use it now.  Will probably switch back and forth between the two.</li>
    <li> This is yet another great Dove scent. My Dermatologist recommends use of Dove soap because it is gentle and moisturizing and I like the scent.</li>
    <li> I love love love the smell of these soap bars but I definitly got &amp;#34;the look&amp;#34; from my husband when I unwrapped the first one. There is no lingering smell after your shower so it&#x27;s not really a concern but I would not classify these as a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; soap. Lucky for me, I do all the shopping!</li>
    <li> It is soap what can I say very good price compaired to buying in the store wife uses this soap loves the soap and smell</li>
    <li> Family loves the scent.  Wife loves the moisturizing effects.</li>
    <li> I really like this Dove bar soap. It smells wonderful and my skin is soft. I Love Dove it is the best.</li>
    <li> It broke both me and my husband out and the scent doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin as well as other soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite body soaps! Love the delicate smell, Love the creaminess, Love the non-greasy feeling, Love the cleanliness (no residue)!!</li>
    <li> Best price I have found for the bar size and quantity.  I like the Dove products. I would prefer the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; or regular scent better as this has a floral smell to it, but overall I am happy.  It does make my skin softer without any residue like other soaps can leave behind.  It is moisturizing and non-irritating. Would buy again if I can&#x27;t find the white dove at a good price.</li>
    <li> Smells great, not too strong.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, moisturizing soap.  The pomegranate also smells beautiful!  It leans toward sweet, but a man could definitely use when it&#x27;s balanced out with the rest of his toilet i.e. shaving cream, deodorant and a dab of cologne.</li>
