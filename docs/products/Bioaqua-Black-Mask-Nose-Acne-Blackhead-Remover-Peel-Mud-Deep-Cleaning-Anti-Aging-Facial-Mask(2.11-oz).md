    <li> Just as expected! Great service and a great product!</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly . Service was fast . no complaints</li>
    <li> Hope to get many years from this, just have to locate the right charger for it.</li>
    <li> Not reversed polarity as stated. Needed a longer pos. Connection. Great value compared to others.</li>
    <li> Great Product and a great price</li>
    <li> My B&amp;S 15hp 10kw generator called for a reverse polarity battery. This one is an exact replacement at a great price. It worked perfect.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement for Troybuilt 8000 watt generator</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, worked perfectly, starts a big generator with ease !</li>
    <li> This battery was exactly the same I had when I purchased the generator.  It was fully charged, I installed it and worked great. I loved not only the battery but price also.</li>
    <li> The product fit well and works great.</li>
    <li> Again what can I say, its a battery.</li>
    <li> I ordered the wrong model battery (XRP) for my generator but by making a new cable it worked as it should.</li>
    <li> This was for my generator the one that came with lasted 5 years so I hope this one does as good fast shipping</li>
    <li> We looked everywhere for a replacement battery for our generator to no avail. Found it on Amazon good price with free shipping.  3 days later we needed to use the generator because power was out.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the speed of delivery with my battery . 1st one actually came damaged and with just a couple photos they had me another one within just a couple days . Recommend highly ...</li>
    <li> This was the answer I was looking for! It is for my generator which is used for my welder. Perfect! It is an exact match.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit, worked instantly</li>
    <li> it wasn&#x27;t what I ordered  the one I ordered was not reverse polarity, just a cp12180xrp .....was not usable at all in my generator.</li>
    <li> works as advertised no more hand cranking my generator</li>
    <li> The original battery was manufactured by Center Power Tech Co. LTD and shows the word &amp;#34;Vision&amp;#34;  on it which this exact battery is shown in the photo.  However, the battery I received apparently is not made by the same manufacturer and doesn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;Vision&amp;#34; on it but is the same model number and has the same specs.  I am not saying I love it just because the photo shows the original battery and the one I received is not the original one.  Other than that, I would love it though I just purchased it and haven&#x27;t been able to truly evaluate its performance yet.</li>
    <li> All is working well and it fit perfect.  We&#x27;ll see if it can last a winter thought.  Time will tell.</li>
    <li> Dropped it in my generator. Fired right up.</li>
    <li> If you own one of the larger Troy Bilt mobile power generators, this is the replacement battery to get it to start every time.</li>
    <li> The battery that arrived was the same as the battery that was pictured.  Works great! Recommended.</li>
    <li> Fully charged, perfect fit and FAST delivery. Everything we expected!</li>
    <li> works great for genarator. good deal thanks</li>
    <li> Exact replacement . perfect fit . Works .</li>
    <li> Its very hard to rate a battery. Its works. I received it much  sooner than expected from the suppler. But I won&#x27;t know how long it will last until it quits.</li>
    <li> As advertised, on time delivery, works just fine.</li>
    <li> fit like the original battery did.</li>
    <li> No problems. Very happy</li>
    <li> Perfect...the exact same one that came with my generator and half the price then at Home Depot</li>
    <li> Exact fit in briggs and stratton generator</li>
    <li> I got this as a replacement for a Briggs 7000W generator. It was the exact battery that I was removing. The old one last almost 4 years being left on float charge the whole time.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and fit perfect</li>
    <li> It was an exact replacement for my generator battery. The non-Reverse Polarity batteries would have required modifications to the wiring.</li>
    <li> This battery was the exact battery need and works great.</li>
    <li> Great Battery!!!!!!!!!</li>
