<li> The vinyl sleeve I do not expect to last long</li>

<li> I had one of these a Very Long time ago and TSA took it from me</li>
<li> I have only had for a few weeks with only minimal use.</li>
<li> This file is everything I ever expected in a nailfile....</li>
<li> it was to rough on her nails and tore them up...</li>
<li> I have two of these nail files and have been using these same two for the past 40+ years.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve never used any other file that compares to them.</li>
<li> Shipping was extremely prompt and packaged well.</li>
<li> you have to be careful using it, or your nails will be down to nothing in no time.</li>
<li> This was what I was looking for, except the sharp narrow end is still too wide.</li>
<li> This thing works so well, it takes almost no effort to file down a nail.</li>
<li> this tool is very sharp.  </li>
<li> The files that I have previously used always seem to lose their abrasiveness after a couple of uses.</li>
<li> This is just an additional file to keep at my desk, because I am too lazy to get up and walk to the bathroom to fix a rough nail.</li>
<li> A little small, but I like it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this file for the past 30+ years.</li>
<li> and it never gets dull.</li>
<li> I read all the reviews and was a little disappointed that one of the reviews read</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This was what I was looking for, except the sharp narrow end is still too wide.</li>
    <li> Files works great and the reviews I read I can see where it may last. I would have given 5 stars but I do not care for the point cleaner being on the handle. When I wish to use it I have to turn it around and hold it differently to avoid poking my palm which is not a big deal. The vinyl sleeve I do not expect to last long but I do like the file.</li>
    <li> Had a Diamond Deb nail file for years, but lost it. Was so glad Amazon carried them. Love it.</li>
    <li> It is just what I have been looking for.</li>
    <li> I had one of these a Very Long time ago and TSA took it from me</li>
    <li> Excellent, convenient product.</li>
    <li> Great nail file at an exceptional price!</li>
    <li> I have the 4&amp;#34; file and now I have this 6&amp;#34; file. Love them both!</li>
    <li> A nice, efficient file.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I have been looking for! Shipping was extremely prompt and packaged well. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Lost my last one and I had to get another. This is a great file!</li>
    <li> I like the design. It is very practical. I have only had for a few weeks with only minimal use. I am curious how long it will last.</li>
    <li> the wife would not be without this file. I purchased 3 of them. She carries one in the pocketbook and has one at the house. The third was a gift to the daughter in law and wouldn&#x27;t be without hers either. both the ladies are satisfied completely. A clean rasp on the nails and no snags.</li>
    <li> These are the only nail files to buy.  I have ordered before and this is the perfect size.  My hubby even loves them.</li>
    <li> This is the best one ever</li>
    <li> This file is everything I ever expected in a nailfile....and then some! I&#x27;ll want to order some more for myself and for gifts.</li>
    <li> So glad I found these!  They last forever and are awesome!!  I even bought one for my mother, who had had her old one for more than 5 years!!</li>
    <li> This thing works so well, it takes almost no effort to file down a nail.</li>
    <li> Very fine quality. The plastic case should be stronger though.</li>
    <li> These are much better than any other file I&#x27;ve owned. They last forever and file perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these nail files for 30+ years. So it was time to replace it. I read all the reviews and was a little disappointed that one of the reviews read it was to rough on her nails and tore them up... Well I decided to purchase 2 of these and give it a try. And I&#x27;m glad I did!! This is just what I was looking for. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Been looking for these for 20 years in stores as my two are that old.  Glad to find them.</li>
    <li> I like the 8 inch better and there not as good as the old ones made in the USA, still better than any I have found.</li>
    <li> Best file that can be found.  The only one my husband will use.  Old brand that has survived through the years.</li>
    <li> This is my second Diamond Deb Nail File.  I bought the first 50 years ago and I thought it was time.  I have to admit it isn&#x27;t quite as effective as it used to be so it will become my &amp;#34;purse&amp;#34; nail file.</li>
    <li> I just bought this to replace the last one.  Nothing compares!</li>
    <li> Happy to find on Amazon what I&#x27;ve been using for decades tho&amp;#34; the quality not quite as good since it was sold to another company.</li>
    <li> Fantastic nail file.  I have one that is 40 years old --- yes, 40 --- and still working!  This is just an additional file to keep at my desk, because I am too lazy to get up and walk to the bathroom to fix a rough nail.</li>
    <li> My aunt was complaining about her beloved thirty year old file getting smooth and emery boards just didn&#x27;t work. I asked her the brand name and after a minutes search I found this Diamond Deb  one on Amazon. She couldn&#x27;t believe they still made them. Now she is all set for another thirty years!</li>
    <li> Best nail files made, period.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different files because my nails are not in good shape and are so fragile. Of all the different files I&#x27;ve tried, including those glass files, I like this one the best and the pointed end for cleaning the nails is a plus.</li>
    <li> This is my third DD, and I truly love it!</li>
    <li> I grew up with my mother using the diamond deb. I remember searching for a replacement when hers got to smooth after more than two decades, it was a long time to find one before the internet. I have had many nail files but wanted a diamond deb so I went to Amazon and there it was. If no one borrows this one I know I will have it for a long time. Every woman should have this file in her purse.</li>
    <li> love it love it love it! I&#x27;ve been using Diamond Deb nail files for 30 plus years and still love them. they last almost forever and I&#x27;ve never used any other file that compares to them.</li>
    <li> Does the job well. I don&#x27;t know if it is actually really diamond though.</li>
    <li> The excellent file I&#x27;ve loved for years (but have had trouble finding.). Thanks, Amazon, for bringing back a superior grooming tool that once was available in stores everywhere.</li>
    <li> Just as I remember the nail files to be -- great.  Service from seller SUPER!!</li>
    <li> In comparison to other nail files, this is one of the best. I&#x27;ve been using this file for the past 30+ years. The diamond dust really helps to file your nails smoothly. There is no comparison to an emery board.</li>
    <li> Nice size. I have used it for a month and it is still like new. Yay!</li>
    <li> not anywhere near as good as the old ones made in the u.s.a.</li>
    <li> I have two of these nail files and have been using these same two for the past 40+ years.  They are great files.</li>
    <li> I am a guitarist who often plays fingerstyle, so I am always looking for any way that I can keep the nails on my right hand in top shape. The files that I have previously used always seem to lose their abrasiveness after a couple of uses. I read reviews on these Diamond Deb nail files, so I decided to give them a try. I am pleasantly surprised at how well they work. I can easily shape my nails to the proper length for finger picking the guitar, and so far they are holding up well.</li>
    <li> I used this growing up and it never gets dull. I bought it again and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> this tool is very sharp.  you have to be careful using it, or your nails will be down to nothing in no time.</li>
    <li> The only brand I will consider using!</li>
    <li> I play guitar and need a good file. This one fills the bill.</li>
    <li> This is one of those got-to-have-it-with-me-always products. Unlike the sandpaper kind, it never wears out.</li>
    <li> Still among the best nail files out there. Will last for years....</li>
    <li> A little small, but I like it.</li>
    <li> These are the greatest.</li>
    <li> I had Lacross diamond nail files for a while now, but decided to look for a stainless steel version of the diamond file due to sterilization problems with plastic-based files. This one is a winner! I have very sensitive nails (they start to break and peel from nearly anything) and this file works very well on them.  It&#x27;s very precise - you can really shape your nails by taking little off.  Very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> best finger nail file ever I have my grandmothers an it is still perfect</li>
    <li> Great product and even better price!</li>
