      <li>Love the idea of it, but it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Many people complain about the price.  </li>
      <li>On top of that, the product EXACERBATED a BO smell, one that I don&#x27;t even smell like when using nothing at all, and</li>
      <li>I think I bought it 6 months or more ago</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re slathering on way more than they should?</li>

      <li>Works pretty good as a deodorizer, however within two days of using this product the skin on my underarms was blistered and peeling.</li>

      <li>I love Nivea&#x27;s Aluminium Free Deodrant more than this.</li>
      <li>Love this product, wish it was available in retail stores.</li>
      <li>I was very satisfied the first time I bought it from the website , but not from amazon.</li>

      <li>the sooner my strong smell would start.</li>
      <li>Pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>This product smells delicious, but is extremely bulky (I&#x27;m a huge traveler, and a circular can of deodorant has no place in my minimalist bag).</li>
      <li>, I really wanted to love it!</li>
      <li>I think (although it wasn&#x27;t a huge inconvenience or discomfort for me).</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about 3 years now and have been aluminum free for about 15 years.  </li>
      <li>This deodorant fit the bill.</li>
      <li>Anyway, still a great price considering you only need 1-2 a year.</li>
      <li>I bought this because it had such great reviews, but it doesn&#x27;t quite get the job done.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I only bought this because it received good reviews from other people. It is horrible! I started smelling after 30 min. I have tried many deodorants and this one s definitely the worst!</li>
    <li> Did not work, it only gave a bad odor, OR SEEMS THAT SKIN REACTED TO IT GIVING A WORSE ODOR, seem that  not using deodorant worked better then using this. SO WHY IS THIS SOOOO EXPENSIVE??? CAN ANYONE TELL ME? RIP-OFFS!!! I WANT MONEY BACK!</li>
    <li> Just purchase two and wasted my money. It didn&#x27;t work for me nor my daughter. When applied it feels &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and makes your arm pits feel that way all day. Smells good when opened but does nothing for controlling under arm odor. Just wasted over $30! The quality of this product is definitely way below my expectations. Would never recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Was excited about this natural deodorant.  Applied after my evening shower, slept through the night, did house work the next morning and was kinda stinky.  I washed and reapplied thinking maybe I didn&#x27;t apply enough the 1st time.  Still kinda stinky at the end if the day.  Website says to try for up to a month before giving up, something about having to detox. When switching to all natural deodorant.  Okay...I&#x27;m giving this product 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Dissappointed.  It&#x27;s been over a month.  This deoderant does not work for me.  May work in the winter months when I am not working out.  This product is a called a deoderant....I apply this product (smells wonderful) and the smell does not last at all.  Maybe and hour or two max.  I have to keep reapplying to not stink.  Love the idea of it, but it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews on this product.It uses 100% natural and organic ingredients, with 2 pro-biotics and no aluminum which is the only thing that will stop sweating (which we don&#x27;t want to eliminate sweat anyway because it rids toxins from the body). They cannot guarentee if a natural product will work or not of everyone because natural products work with every persons body chemistry differntly. That said, I bought my deodorant off the website at first. It was shipped in the cutest packaging and they gave a card called a \\&quot;Pit Pointer\\&quot; for hot days. I have yet to have to use this tip because the deodorant works on me. It works so well on me that I have turned friends on to it and they love it too. I decided to see where else they sell and they happen to be at a Whole Foods in my area. I get it 5 buck cheaper and it has lasted me so long. I think I bought it 6 months or more ago and it is no where near gone. I like it and think its worth the money considering the pure ingredients and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this directly from the seller.  First of all it took over a week to arrive.  Secondly, it does not work.  By midday (or before) the deodorant has worn off and I had smelly pits.  To make it worse you cannot return this product once opened (supposedly because proceeds go to charity).  I was extremely disappointed especially given the price.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good on me and the ordor stayed all day. It doesn&#x27;t work with my body chemistry. jj</li>
    <li> Smells really good before you use it, but doesn&#x27;t last.  I used the product for 2 weeks and my body oder was very strong by the end of each day.  My boyfriend won&#x27;t let me use this anymore because it doesn&#x27;t work :(  Disappointing because it&#x27;s expensive and smells so fabulous in the tube.</li>
    <li> Pristine Beauty&#x27;s \\&quot;Take a Whiff!\\&quot; is a great smelling, all-natural deodorant. It does not have aluminum in it, which is great. Aluminum typically stops the sweating, so don&#x27;t think this is an anti-perspirant. It worked on me all day and smells so yummy!</li>
    <li> This product actually works ... It keeps me dry and odor free. However, I&#x27;ve used it three times (with baking soda as suggested) and I have now developed a severe rash under my arms - it&#x27;s incredibly painful and I can&#x27;t even shave for the next few days. It&#x27;s a shame because for an organic product, it really works. I however will NEVER use it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m trying to go all natural.  It smells really nice, but I get very sticky.  I tried using the baking power like suggested, but still sticky. It makes it really hard when I&#x27;m working out, I get so sticky that it starts irritating my skin.  I will probably keep using it until I find something better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for months, and purchased some for my mother in law who has cancer. I have been deodorant-free since 2004.  I have tried the rock salt deodorant, Toms, sea salt powder, and just about everything else. I was so happy when I used this product because I no longer had an odor mid-day. The scent is orange-vanilla and it is a real morning \\&quot;pick me up.\\&quot; I wish they sold a perfume to match. I also have the lotion from the same company which is the same scent.   A side note, I still sweat, this product does not eliminate perspiration (nor should it) so I wear a synthetic material I still experience an odor, as with other deodorants. However, if I use natural materials I am Oder free all day.</li>
    <li> This was my first attempt at using a natural deodorant and I wasn&#x27;t a fan. The product does smell nice right out of the box but did nothing to control my body odor and left my feeling sticky. It also gave me a rash. I will say that since this experience I tried another natural deodorant and had the exact same outcome.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years now and have been aluminum free for about 15 years.  This is the best product I&#x27;ve found that smells great and lasts all day.  Also it never leaves a film on my clothes. Don&#x27;t be afraid of the price as the product lasts over a year or a lot longer depending on how many times a day you shower.  This is something I use that makes me feel good about using it.  I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product and I rarely write reviews.</li>
    <li> in the container, this stuff smells great. i was wanting to use a nature deodorant, and i thought this was the ticket until yesterday afternoon, when in a new top, i smelled disgusting. now i am looking up ways to remove smells from clothes. super sad. i wanted this to work. no-go for me!</li>
    <li> For me this deodorant did not work.  It was sticky and did not help with odor.  It did keep me dry.</li>
    <li> THE BEST DEODORANT!! I run an urban gardening company in New York City, so every day I&#x27;m outside sweating on rooftop gardens. I&#x27;ve tried many, many deodorants, &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; and drugstore brands.  Take A Whiff is absolutely the best! My pits stay fresh, and on super sweaty days, if I don&#x27;t want sweaty (but still not-stinky) pits, I simply take a powder puff and dab the wee-est little bit of baking soda in my pits after applying Take A Whiff.  I even rode my bike from San Francisco to LA for a charity ride, and Take A Whiff kept me from stinking during the entire ride. I also have SUPER sensitive skin, &amp; generally have to use hypo-allergenic products, but I&#x27;ve never had any negative reaction to this product. People freak out at the price, but it lasts 4 times longer than standard deodorants--I generally only need 1 or 2 of these every YEAR. Plus, proceeds go to Breast Cancer charities, and the line of products was started by a small, woman-owned &amp; operated business. I don&#x27;t know why people say this stuff is &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;--maybe they&#x27;re slathering on way more than they should? I&#x27;m sure some people&#x27;s bodies may react differently than mine, and if you&#x27;re used to an antiperspirant or a deodorant with lots of chemicals in it, your pits may release a lot of that &amp;#34;backed up stuff&amp;#34; when you switch to this product. Let your body adjust, and I&#x27;ll bet you&#x27;ll be singing Take A Whiff praises too.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve been using natural deodorants for several years now, it took some time before my body/armpits adjusted to this product.  The first few times I used it produced a rash and some slight irritation. I took a week break from this product and tried again. Then, the product began working perfectly.  I have no rashes and I only have to use this every other day and it keeps odor away completely.  I am allergic to deodorants with synthetics and even natural ones with baking soda, clays, and other powdered products abrade my skin over time.  This one is pricey but it lasts extremely long.  I purchased mine from Whole Foods while visiting Winston-Salem, and it was quite a bit cheaper there.  I think it&#x27;s worth it, though, for a product that will last you at least a year.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product from the company before and when I wore the deodorant I did not smell at all. But now that I ordered this new one from amazon , the deodorant does not seem to last long. I was very satisfied the first time I bought it from the website , but not from amazon.</li>
    <li> I give this four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works instantly. You smell like an amazing cream-sicle! Like others said, it doesn&#x27;t last. It wears off mid-day. Also, if you tend to sweat, it makes your pits feel a bit sticky. The trick you must use is to dust some rice flour or baking soda and it will last most of the day with no sticky-pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it four stars because I&#x27;m not typically going to use the dusting technique. I have a natural deodorant that works without having to do that, however, this deodorant is the most effective &amp; convenient natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever seen (more convenient than the one I use in the morning). Also, when you&#x27;re wearing BLACK, this deodorant will not rub off on your clothes (in which case, I will take the time to use the dust technique).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for on-the-go, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will continue to buy. Not 5 stars, but its great as an alternative for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the hope that it would work for me, it does not. After one hour I started smelling a sweaty odor under my arms and I am not the type that sweats much. I have to say I am very disappointed and cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was interest in this product because it is all natural and doesn&#x27;t have alumiinium in it.  I have tried all natural products before and they did not work.  I will buy this again.,</li>
    <li> I have looked for years for a good, natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave me stinky by midday.  I absolutely refuse to use antiperspirant. I also don&#x27;t like a sticky feel!  I was at Whole Foods and asked one of the associates if she had any suggestions and she went right to this one.  I am so glad I bought it!  Of course, I was hesitant at first because of the price, but I am so glad I got it.  She made one suggestion that I have followed: tap the top of the deodorant in some baking soda and then apply.  It takes the stickiness away for me and I do not smell at all when I go to bed at night.  I am so pleased about that because with all the other deodorants I tried, I smelled horrible by nighttime. Never have to search again!!!</li>
    <li> Follow directions and use baking soda and it works great!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well, I had to reapply and the lint of my clothes would get stuck to my underarm. I live in San Diego and it is fairly warm here but not humid; I read a great review someone from Texas wrote and I thought if it worked in Texas it would work well on me in San Diego...but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m making my own deodorant now with coconut oil, arrowroot powder, and Young Living essential oils. Will be making a new batch to add beeswax and clay.</li>
    <li> It smells like a mosquito citron candle and did not last all day as advertised. Really disappointed with this. Not worth half the price!</li>
    <li> Love this product, wish it was available in retail stores.</li>
    <li> As a moderate sweater, this product is great for me. I looooove the smell and the fact that it&#x27;s made of natural ingredients. All of these products are a great value, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the owner seems to be a truly great gal.  Check out her website and videos (that&#x27;s where I bought my products) where she gives tips and tricks for using her products, especially if you&#x27;re a heavy sweater.</li>
    <li> This product was absolutely horrible..I will never purchase this product again..nor would I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE...I gave it to my teenage daughter and it didn&#x27;t even work for her,,,and she barely sweats..thumbs down WHIFF!</li>
    <li> It smelled okay as stated, which serves the purpose. However, it caused my skin under my arms to have a painful reaction to the product. It states that it is designed for odor, and that part worked, but the tip they give of using baking soda under your arms for dryness doesn&#x27;t work. Overall, if all you are looking for is odor control, this is a yes. If you have sensitive skin, I would pass.</li>
    <li> I heard over and over that \\&quot;natural deodorants don&#x27;t work\\&quot;, but this one got such great reviews that I figured I&#x27;d give it a try anyway.  Well, shame on me!  I spent a lot of money on this product, so I&#x27;m glad to read that it does seem to work for lots of other people, but I am not a satisfied customer.  It does smell nice, I&#x27;ll admit.  I found the texture to be a bit sticky.  I didn&#x27;t have wetness, but I definitely had odor by late afternoon (and it hasn&#x27;t been hot out).&lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d had a better experience with this product--for the price, I really wanted to love it!</li>
    <li> Does not work for me. I tried it for 2 weeks. But finally gave up. I do not understand why it was said the best deodorant for women</li>
    <li> Being a deodorant and not an antiperspirant,Take a Whiff only lasts a very short time before you need to reapply it! For the cost of over $20.00 I would recommend purchasing a regular over the counter deodorant or antiperspirant and save yourself the money!</li>
    <li> Product smells great and my underarm smelled great for a month. After my underarm adjusted to the product, it no longer worked the way it was supposed to. It could no longer prevent odors nor perspirations.</li>
    <li> Like all natural deodorants, this will not stop you from pitting out in the balmy heat of summer. HOWEVER, it will eliminate all odor. Seriously. I had my boyfriend &amp;#34;take a whiff&amp;#34; and it was totally odorless. Pretty amazing. You can try their &amp;#34;pit tip&amp;#34; of putting baking soda under your pits, which I found to be mildly helpful but definitely did not stop my sweat. However, since it no longer stains my clothes or smells, I don&#x27;t mind so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the rash some people report: I also got said armpit rash. However, it cleared up in a few days and since then, I&#x27;ve had no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a natural deodorant skeptic and now I&#x27;m totally on-board. I can&#x27;t imagine going back to the normal stuff.</li>
    <li> It smells divine, but it does not last very long if you are doing a lot of activity. For example, when I work 12 hours shifts in the hospital, Real Purity deodorant by Holistic Formula does a lot better job. But its smell is nice and I got it for a good price of only $8, would not pay $ 20 for it though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed because after a lot of consideration and reading SO MANY reviews, I bought this. It actually made me smell DISGUSTING! I can&#x27;t even describe the horrible smell. I guess it does work for other people, that&#x27;s why I bought it. But I&#x27;m very sad this didn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
    <li> Very excited to try a new this! Does not work for body odor or perspiration. I work in a controlled temperature environment, and still by a couple hours in, could tell this was not working. Save your money, now I wear scent free mens deoderant. Less expensive and more effective.</li>
    <li> Excellent - use for a few days before it really kicks in. Great for golf, hiking, daily use. Gentle, Fresh scent. wish there was a travel size.</li>
    <li> i really like this product. i works. i bought it when we had a 3 week heat wave, and i was starting a new job. with the heat over 100 degrees and the stress of starting a new job, this product kept me dry and smelling fresh.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST deodorant ever invented!  I am so happy with this product, thank you Pristine Beauty!  Works great for every day activities, hard core workouts and long hot days working out in the yard.  I do dust on baking soda for days I need to stay extra dry.</li>
    <li> From the reviews I&#x27;d read, I thought I&#x27;d be set in the deodorant department for quite awhile. But alas, this product does not work for me at all. In fact, somehow it makes me smell worse than when I&#x27;m not wearing anything. The scent of the product is nice at first, but when wearing it, it mixes with the smell that it somehow magically creates with my body chemistry and becomes hardly possible to stand. I really wish I hadn&#x27;t spent almost $25 on something I can&#x27;t stand to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product (purchased directly from Pristine Beauty website) for 3+ years now. The first two each lasted almost exactly a year but the last few about 6-7 months. No idea if there is less product in the container than in the past (probably not since other reviewers are saying it lasts a year for them). Anyway, still a great price considering you only need 1-2 a year. I started using the product in March so I wouldn&#x27;t sweat as much (like during a hot summer month) while my body adjusted to it. I&#x27;m surprised at the negative reviews expecting this natural product to work after one use (and expecting to have zero perspiration or zero odor after a full day)....seems like unrealistic expectations (for an all-natural deoderant, note product is not an antiperspirant). As noted elsewhere, it takes your body several weeks to release toxins built up from all those years of using toxic/non-natural products. So, best to start out in a cooler month I think (although it wasn&#x27;t a huge inconvenience or discomfort for me). I also use several other Pristine Beauty products and love them all. Great products!</li>
    <li> I wish I was able to write a wonderful review for this product, but unfortunately it just didn&#x27;t work for me. The smell didn&#x27;t bother me, creamsicles smell yummy. The product did keep me dry, but that has never really been the issue. I was looking for something that blocked odor. I put this deodorant on at night after my shower and then swiped a bit more on in the morning and went about my daily errands. By noon I smelled like I had skipped deodorant all together! I didn&#x27;t overly sweat or even make it to the gym yet. I wasted $20 to find out that $2.68 Mitchum works 100% better for me.</li>
    <li> Absolutely not worth the money. I spent $30 on this crap and not only does it not work, it made me sweat even more! it did absolutely nothing but make it worse, I actually didn&#x27;t smell fresh after only a few hours. Avon deodorant is only a dollar and it works all day long!!!!! Back to Avon I go, never again!!!</li>
    <li> Once my wife was introduced to this product she has never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife wanted to find an all natural deodorant that could last all day and not have her pits smelling. This deodorant fit the bill. One of the great things is it lasts a LONG TIME. She can typically use one for about 9 months. Deodorant that last for Nine months is quite a fair deal at the listed price.</li>
    <li> I wish i could have used this.  It worked great for about a week. I really liked the fact it was natural and smelled so nice. It worked as well as your typical store bought brand.  But in the end I had an allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> Love how it smells but is not long lasting. Got one for my friend and she said the same thing. She had to go buy a new deo in the evening as this one wasn&#x27;t working!</li>
    <li> I thought I finally found a deodorant that would work for me, but sadly I was mistaken. I don&#x27;t sweat a lot in the under arm area. Anyway every deodorant I have used causes me to get a really itchy rash like in the armpit area that gets really irriated. So I was changing my deodorant frequently and I haven&#x27;t found anything that helps. Until I started using mens dove non-irriatant. But after awhile that actually started causing a little bit of rash, and I wasn&#x27;t to fond of the cologne smell. So I came across Take A Whiff and thought maybe this will be it, because its an all natural deodorant and it doesn&#x27;t have all the harsh additives like the rest of the deodorants. I ordered the pricy product, but was okay with it because I just had hopes it would work. I finally got it used it and halfway throughout the day I had a smelly odor (nothing to bad) and I felt my armpits getting irriated. So I thought maybe I will keep using it because my body isn&#x27;t use to the natural deodorants, so I will continue to use it. Nope 2 weeks later still not working at all I find myself reapplying to keep the slight sour smell I get away. I really wish I could find a deodorant that really works, and I am pretty upset I spent 22 bucks on a deodorant that hasn&#x27;t given me atleast close to great results.</li>
    <li> Smells nice with an orange-y scent.  Nice consistency, very solid nice packaging.  Just doesn&#x27;t even cover up odor, much less prevent odor.  There are plenty of natural deos out there that work better than this.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant I ever used.  I did follow the baking soda tip and it certainly helps with sweat.  I will definately use this product again and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It was sticky and would not dry even with a hair dryer. I was so disappointed especially given the price!</li>
    <li> I ordered this all-natural deoderant back in the summer (5 months ago), and I had high hopes for it.  I began using it right away and noticed that it did very little to alleviate BO.  I had to reapply around noon and again later, if I had evening plans.  At first, I wasn&#x27;t too worried about it, as I am a stinkier-than-normal person.  I would just reapply as necessary, except when I forgot to bring it to work with me.  :o(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, after five months of use, I have recently developed a very itchy and oozing rash under my arms, so I will have to discontinue use of it altogether.  Sad that it did not work for me!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad as he has very sensitive skin in his armpits.  He has been using this following the instructions and it has not upset his armpits and is keeping his fresh all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you :)</li>
    <li> This product is different than traditional deodorants, but once you get used to it, it works pretty well. The first few weeks are an adjustment period, but be patient! For long days, it&#x27;s best to reapply.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it had such great reviews, but it doesn&#x27;t quite get the job done. I&#x27;ve applied this fresh after a shower and shave on hot and cold Arizona days, and by lunch I can smell the sweet smell of deodorant failure. It is literally sweet since this product seems to try masking the BO smell more than it prevents odor in the first place.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is great!!  Many people complain about the price.  I bought it in July of 2012, use it daily, and am just now empty and buying a new one.  At first I thought this deodorant was not working, but once I added the baking soda, I am completely satisfied.  It&#x27;s a 2 step process each morning....first the deodorant followed by brushed my armpits with baking soda.  I don&#x27;t ever have odor.  And, I am definitely a sweater, work out in the afternoon, not shower and continue on my day.  Way too much information, but I think this is a great product.  I previously had used secret clinical strength deodorant and liked that, but wanted an aluminum free product.  I tried Tom&#x27;s natural deodorant and did not like that product at all.</li>
    <li> It worked as far as keeping perspiration and odor under control, but gave me a severe rash under my arms where it was applied.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  Prefer tea tree oil deodorant, any organic brand.</li>
    <li> It smell wonderful, goes on clear and won&#x27;t damage clothes, and it will last several months. Unfortunately, this deodorant is not strong enough to control my strong odor. I&#x27;m not sure if being pregnant is making the issue a lot more difficult, so I&#x27;m anxious to try it again after pregnancy. As of right now, it only works for two or three hours and then it&#x27;s over, plus I noticed the more I used the deodorant the sooner my strong smell would start. So, I&#x27;m stopping for now, too bad I really wanted to love this product</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product, it does smell nice but it doe not work. I think it is too expensive for what you are getting.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this so that I could switch from Degree to a natural product. Unfortunately after a few days of use I had to stop use of this product and any deodorant. There must be something I am allergic to in this product. It caused a severe allergic reaction within a few days. I am still healing from a horrible reaction on my armpits. They became raw and irritated and look horrible and are really painful.  It looks like road rash. I have never been sensitive to hygene products and have never had a reaction to any other product. This deodorant smelt nice and seemed to work coupled with the dusting of baking soda as suggested by the manufacturer. However, the product becomes sticky even with the baking soda. I wonder if the stickiness caused friction which caused the reaction. I can&#x27;t wait till it goes away cuz I&#x27;m afraid to start reapplying my Degree until it heals. This product may work for some but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it.</li>
    <li> Winter deodorant, yes. Summer or when sweating? Not so much.</li>
    <li> hmm well i reasearched &amp; googled deoderant aftrer deoderant. this came up as the number one so many times. but it did nothing at all for me.. i felt sticky when i wore it &amp; i think that made it worse for sweating. not to mention whatever is in it made me smell worse then ever :( such a shame because the product does smell really nice.</li>
    <li> Not to say that it won&#x27;t work for you, though!  And if you don&#x27;t like sticky, you may want to try something else.  I&#x27;m all for natural, green, organic etc but I need something that works.  FYI -- thought I&#x27;d pass it off to the hubby and let him try it.  Oops!  Forgot to mention that it&#x27;s very sticky.  Definitely doesn&#x27;t do well with underarm hair LOL!</li>
    <li> It, to me, smells of baby aspirin. And, while I know I drink a couple cups of coffee a day, it just doesn&#x27;t mask things very well after a couple of hours, tops. Too, it was very sticky going on, which never seemed to go away. Shame, I was really hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After spending $20 on this deodorant, I had to give it another go! While the smell is not much improved, if you add baking soda (as suggested for extreme days on the label) it works much better. This also helps combat the stickiness.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome. Works pretty good as a deodorizer, however within two days of using this product the skin on my underarms was blistered and peeling. I&#x27;ve never had a similar reaction to any other underarm product. Such a bummer!!</li>
    <li> Product did not help to fight body odors! By the end of the day the smell was so bad it was as if I had no deodorant on. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this product but it doesn&#x27;t work for me. For those that are looking for something that will keep you smelling fresh, this isn&#x27;t it. I live where it is hot all year round and I need something that will get the job done and this did not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a label reader and am mindful of products I use on and in my body, living a holistic lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;This deo is fantastic in that every ingredient is carefully chosen to be beneficial to the body, and of course non toxic!&lt;br /&gt;To address some of the negative reviews:&lt;br /&gt;I find it helps me to apply multiple times during my &amp;#34;getting ready&amp;#34; time, about 4 good applications under each arm with a couple of minutes between applications.&lt;br /&gt;Then I set it with either baking soda, or a powder consisting of baking soda, cornstarch, and arrowroot powder.&lt;br /&gt;This prevents stickiness and keeps it working all or most of the day, depending on my activities.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t stop sweating, and isn&#x27;t supposed to. Just helps prevent odor.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been using conventional deodorants or antiperspirants, it will take a while for your body to detox and adjust to using a natural, healthy deodorant. Try to be patient; it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> Although this deodorant smells very good, it doesn&#x27;t work for me. I have used it over a month now and I have to say that I was satisfied only on the first day I applied it. On the next day the effect was almost gone, but this product is still a little bit better than other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve used before (e.g. christal deodorants).</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work.  Tossed it after a couple of tries.</li>
    <li> I spend 14£ hopeful to finally have right deodorant for me, because market ones never worked. So, this is more expensier and the same disappointment.</li>
    <li> This stuff does not work at all and actually created an unpleasant odor. I actually think no deodorant would smell better. I even followed the instructions from some reviewers to reapply throughout the day and try dabbing in baking soda. Take a Whiff of my Smelly Pits ..ugh</li>
    <li> Some reviews say this product is&#x27; active proof&#x27; it does work well, but isn&#x27;t a 24hr odor protector.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s absolutely the best aluminum free deodorant I&#x27;ve seen</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! I have used quite a few other products that have failed. So happy this product worked!!</li>
    <li> What a HUGE disappointment.  It got some pretty good reviews and I was hopeful, but it really did not work for me!</li>
    <li> Amazing deodorant. Works very very well. No deodorants work on me and this one does!!! I would recommend it to everyone! And it smells great!</li>
    <li> So Annoyed. Paid $22 for a deodorant that DOESN&#x27;T work! I was sitting in professional business meetings smelling like a hippie!! On top of that, the product EXACERBATED a BO smell, one that I don&#x27;t even smell like when using nothing at all, and not even my dry cleaner could get the awful BO smell stains out of my good clothes! GOOD designer name brand work clothes RUINED. Ruined. I smell better not wearing anything at all! I REFUSE to pay that much for a scam of a product. When I wrote PB to ask for a refund, Blaire (the owner, and apparently sales and customer service, who runs this \\&quot;company\\&quot;) responded by saying I&#x27;d only used it for 2 weeks, and that I&#x27;d have to \\&quot;keep using it for 2-4 weeks for it to start working,\\&quot; that i&#x27;m \\&quot;releasing toxins\\&quot; until it starts working, (**a disclaimer needs to be added to the website in that case warning people!). To top it off, I can&#x27;t even refund or exchange?? If that&#x27;s the case, how about I not wear anything at all, and you can refund my $ and I will \\&quot;release toxins\\&quot; without your ineffective product to help ruin my good clothes?? I shop everywhere. *I haven&#x27;t had to deal with such archaic out-dated business practices in YEARS!  What stores nowadays don&#x27;t offer refunds, exchanges or even a store credit for a product that is ineffective and simply doesn&#x27;t work (yes, they *even* gladly refund USED items Blaire. Welcome to 2012!)??!! What store or company doesn&#x27;t back their stuff up by ensuring a satisfaction guarantee policy? Blaire, NOT everything works on everyone. Blaire, is RUDE and out of touch with what 2012 shoppers look for. She needs to understand the importance of making customers happy. Not confident in your product perhaps? \\&quot;Take a Whiff\\&quot; by Pristine Beauty is AWFUL. Do not buy. STRONGLY DISLIKE!!! Sample face primer was sub par as well. #pristinebeauty</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this deodorant!  I had been wanting an aluminum-free deodorant for awhile now, after all these studies about the relationship between Alzheimer&#x27;s and aluminum.  However, this deodorant stays sticky for hours!  It also has kind of an odd smell, not a bad smell, just different from all the fresh smells of other deodorants.  Not sure if I will buy this product again or not.</li>
    <li> I had numerous allergic reactions to deodorants until I found this one. I only use aluminum free deodorants and prefer more natural ingredients. It smells like orange sherbet! I do have to apply at least twice a day during hot summer days to keep smelling fresh. The stick lasts for so long!! Remember, natural deodorant doesn&#x27;t stop your sweating, it just makes you smell better.</li>
    <li> I read this deodorant was amazing and was really excited to receive it.  After 2 days of use I had a horrible, burning, super red rash under both my arms.  It was so painful I couldn&#x27;t wear anything that brushed against my armpits til it went away.  I didn&#x27;t notice any better protection from this product than any other deodorant I have tried.</li>
    <li> After years of searching, this is the ONLY deodorant that works for me. It completely stops the stink.  I remember it feeling a little sticky at first, but I don&#x27;t notice it anymore.  If sweat is an issue for you, just dip it in baking soda like she recommends in the instructional video (I only do this during the summer).</li>
    <li> The first natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried that has actually done its job! The only reason it gets four (vs five) stars: my skin is now slightly discolored. Not sure why. But I&#x27;ll be sticking with this for a while!</li>
    <li> I tried this on the review of a co-worker. But this did not last a full work day for me. I am going back to Tom&#x27;s of Maine. :)</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to using a sleek but natural deodorant. This product smells delicious, but is extremely bulky (I&#x27;m a huge traveler, and a circular can of deodorant has no place in my minimalist bag). Back to Old Spice Sport Antiperspirant...</li>
    <li> VERY STICKY!!! I always gotta use the baking soda (not only for the hot summer days as suggested). My armpits are DARK and I peel about every two weeks. My skin is very dry now. I do not recommend it unless you only care for it being all natural and all. I sweat A LOT still! I thought that because it&#x27;s very pricy it&#x27;d be worth the price, but it IS NOT.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from Amazon and starting using it on 8/29.  At first when applied it felt very sticky even after applying the baking soda.  Then after a couple of days, my body got used it and Take a Whiff worked flawlessly.  Then however I started getting a really bad reaction around 10/12.  My armpits felt itchy and I had red bumps under my armpits.  It was complete torture!  I stopped shaving my armpits and didn&#x27;t use any type of deodorant for about a week.  I had to apply aquaphor to my armpits every night to soothe the pain. I went back to my old deodorant and my pits were doing well.  I must like to torture myself because I tried using Take A Whiff again on Sunday 11/2 and my armpits got inflamed with bumps and itchiness so badly it burned the next day (11/3).  So I have not shaved my armpits since Sunday and have applied aquaphor to soothe the itchiness and pain.  I DO NOT recommend this product.  I do not have sensitive skin, I can use any soap, detergent, etc.  Also I have not changed any soaps or detergents since I started using Take a Whiff.  If you decide to buy it good luck.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product as I&#x27;ve never tried a natural deodorant before. This deodorant goes on wet feeling, then dries. Not a big deal just different. On average I would reapply this product 3-4 times a day, and because of that I would use this on my days off. I work in a busy OR and reapplying deodorant just doesn&#x27;t fit into my day. Smell is pleasant. However I developed an allergic rash to this product, and will no longer be using this &amp;#34;all natural product&amp;#34;. Would I still be using this product if I didn&#x27;t get a rash? Yes but only on my days off, and only until the stick ran out. There&#x27;s got to be something better...</li>
    <li> After using it several times, I&#x27;m still confused how does this deodrant work. Early the day it works perfect, but as you reach to its middle you start smelling yukki. I love Nivea&#x27;s Aluminium Free Deodrant more than this.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was going to be a god-send.  I heard so many great reviews and it&#x27;s all-natural and doesn&#x27;t contain alumninum; it sounded great!  I received this product a few days ago and the weather has been warm to hot ever since.  On the first day I used it, it was warm outside, not too too hot and I combined it with baking soda to help fend off wetness like it says to do on the package.  It seemed to work ok, but, then again, I was wearing a black shirt so you wouldn&#x27;t be able to see dark underarm circles anyway.  Today, it was 81 degrees F and I wore a lighter coloured shirt along with this deodorant, within a minute of leaving my air conditioned room, dark circles appeared just as badly as my last deodorant which didn&#x27;t even have an anti-perspirant in it!!!  I came back to the room, dried off my underarms, reapplied and added the baking soda, again, within minutes my shirt was soaked through.  I just spent overr $20 on an antiperspirant that doesn&#x27;t even work!  I thought this was going to be a life-saver, but it&#x27;s just as bad as every other deodorant I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this until it is gone, it has a pleasant scent and I like that it&#x27;s all natural, but it doesn&#x27;t work.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  Save your money!  Also, it gives me a really bad B.O. scent.  On second thought, I probably won&#x27;t even use it again.  My sweat usually is just water and doesn&#x27;t have a scent unless it&#x27;s nervous sweat and I smell like a football team after a tournament!  AWFUL!</li>
    <li> I had to return this purchase because it was so bad.  Left me sticky.  My college age daughter tried it and it left her sticky too.</li>
    <li> This product works very well.  It may be pricey, but it lasts about a year.  It smells nice and lasts all day long.</li>
</ol>
