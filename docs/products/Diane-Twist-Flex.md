      <li>Easy to use and perfect for travel.</li>
      <li>The flexible rods were the perfect size and were easy to manipulate and use once I had some instruction.  </li>
      <li>Hair comes off the roller having a silkier, smoother curl when hair dryer is used, but it&#x27;s still good without heat-particularly when you are trying to avoid breakage.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not turning out to be good curls at all.</li>
      <li>My hair came out gorgeous curly and shines.</li>
      <li>After seeing the beautiful results they gave in many of the tutorials I knew I had to try this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they work great on thicker hair.</li>

      <li>when I got these, it was a nice surprise to see their size.  </li>
      <li>I have waver stubborn hair and these did not give me a nice curl.</li>
      <li>It gives nice curls.</li>

      <li>If I set them centered along my head, I get a good nights rest and fun hair all day!</li>
      <li>This is great for the stage when a girl wants to do her own hair HER way.</li>
      <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my flexirods!</li>
      <li>I love the rods because they curl my hair and are very comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>These curlers are okay.  </li>
      <li>but if you would like the curls to last longer I recommend leaving in overnight for best results.</li>
      <li>These are okay.</li>
      <li>I bought these rods to get more controlled curls in my unruly hair.</li>
      <li>I Love them and want more</li>
      <li>My hair came out better than using a curling iron.</li>

      <li>but I love these flexi rods.</li>
      <li>Maybe I just need more practice using it.</li>
      <li>The smell is what I was mostly bothered by.</li>
      <li>I wish I had bought more of them</li>
      <li>Love these flex-rods.</li>
      <li>Regular metal curling irons just give me split ends and wavy hair at best.</li>
      <li>What could be better?</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love what they do to my hair.</li>
      <li>These things are pretty neat and it&#x27;s nice that they don&#x27;t damage your hair with heat or anything, but like any new hair styling technique it&#x27;s gonna take some practice before you figure out what works best for you/your hair.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great way to style their hair while limiting heat.</li>
      <li>Perhaps my expectations were too high though, after reading all of the great reviews.</li>
      <li>These work pretty good.</li>
      <li>I would suggest checking out some You Tube videos if you want information on how to use them most accurately.</li>
      <li>More comfortable to wear than magnetic rollers that need to be secured with a pin or clip.  </li>
      <li>These work great for curly my natural hair.  </li>
      <li>Loved how fast I could put them in my hair.  </li>
      <li>bought two bags just in case, which was a good idea since I found out I need 8 to do my whole head.</li>
      <li>Great soft easy to use hair rollers.</li>
      <li>Great for a roller set or for an easy way to stretch natural hair.  </li>
      <li>Some videos suggest using damp hair, but I didn&#x27;t have to as my hair curls easily.  </li>
      <li>Easy to sleep in.  </li>
      <li>these are easy to use; basically wind hair around.  </li>
      <li>Easy use</li>
      <li>However,  the rods are really easy to use and they do not fall out or fall out of place.</li>
      <li>They seems strong</li>
      <li>Perfect option for those who want pretty curls without all the potential damage from heat.</li>
      <li>Other than that they work great for curling your hair without heat and the curls stay, very easy to work with.</li>
      <li>They couldn&#x27;t be easier to put in and they were cheap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with my rollers, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>Nothing about these rods are comfortable to sleep in.</li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t freely move without it feeling like my hair is getting tugged on.</li>
      <li>They are great for big curls!!</li>
      <li>These curlers produce curls that really just last maybe 3 or 4 hours at best.</li>
      <li>They make some of the most prettiest curls around and are very convenient since you don&#x27;t have to use heat to create a sexy head full of flowing curls and waves.</li>
      <li>They are safe and easy for her to use herself without needing too much help.</li>
      <li>Love the rollers but my first package came used.  </li>
      <li>I bought them for a very reasonable price and was very excited to use them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Ceramic curling irons produce gorgeous curls that last days for me.</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price though...</li>
      <li>The hair toward the top of my head looks more wavy than curly, and so the only true curls are toward the ends.</li>
      <li>The curlers were a bit hard to sleep in, and I would have liked more than 6 curlers, but they were pretty good and make pretty curls.</li>
      <li>If you want a quick curl without having to use heat, these work well.  </li>
      <li>it is a nice product, but i feel that pulls at my hair and doesn&#x27;t really stay on very well.  </li>
      <li>The rods are pretty cheap.</li>
      <li>The length is good for very long hair.</li>
      <li>This is the only product that has successfully curled my pin straight hair.</li>
      <li>the exactly how I wanted them to!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have not used these yet&lt;br /&gt;to give a proper review be&lt;br /&gt;cause I really like the bigger&lt;br /&gt;versions right now.</li>
    <li> Easy, great curlers.  Loved how fast I could put them in my hair.  Inexpensive too.</li>
    <li> I did not feel like these did much for my hair. I have waver stubborn hair and these did not give me a nice curl. They did not seem to stick very well. I have medium length hair and I am not familiar with how to get these things to work for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and alot of it! These work great!</li>
    <li> Love these flex-rods. Gives loose curls</li>
    <li> I love these!  More comfortable to wear than magnetic rollers that need to be secured with a pin or clip.  Easy to sleep in.  The flexibility allows you to position your rollers in odd positions when needed.  Works well on dry or wet hair.  Great for a roller set or for an easy way to stretch natural hair.  If you want a quick curl without having to use heat, these work well.  I love them and feel like everyone should have some in their hair arsenal!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a veeeeeeeeeeeeery great product,but girls u got to know your measurements,cause the ones i bought was too big for my natural hair,so i had to use it to curl my wigs,and bought smaller ones at my b.s.s.</li>
    <li> Love the rollers but my first package came used.  Amazon replaced it, but it still sucks- but yes- get it.</li>
    <li> Works well.  They are not comfortable to sleep in, unless you put your hair in a ponytail on top of your head and then curl the hair from the ponytail</li>
    <li> The product works great. They hold well and make nice curls that last all day with some mousse. They are not comfortable to sleep in so keep that in mind. I wish I had found a bigger size for bigger curls but these are nice.</li>
    <li> these are easy to use; basically wind hair around.  my issues is holding them in; I twisted the ends closed but a few still slipped out.  the curls looked great though!</li>
    <li> I like these flexi rods. They curl my hair great. A bit too tight, but not a big deal cause the curls will drop after a while. They last for quite a while. Perfect option for those who want pretty curls without all the potential damage from heat. I would order again, but the 7/8 size was a bit too big for me. Also, they are very uncomfortable to sleep in and take a long time to air dry.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these for my hair. What I got was mineral water facial spray... I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really even worth going through the trouble of sending it back but I&#x27;m pretty upset I didn&#x27;t get what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Easy use and I thought it would be difficult being I never used these before but the hair came out beautifully!</li>
    <li> Where have these been all my life! If you want a no heat way to create waves and curls then look no further, You now have twist-Flex rods to the rescue.  I Would highly recommend watching a youtube video for styling suggestions first. No more burning my hair with curling irons.</li>
    <li> I bought these flexi rods after I got a sew-in with 16 inch Indian Remy hair.  I was a little skeptical at first about the rods staying in all night and also using them in general for curls. However,  the rods are really easy to use and they do not fall out or fall out of place. I have even used the rods without setting lotion and my curls lasted all day. These are a great alternative to using a curling iron.</li>
    <li> The curlers were a bit hard to sleep in, and I would have liked more than 6 curlers, but they were pretty good and make pretty curls.</li>
    <li> I Love them and want more but it took a long time receive but they had great customer service and kept in contact</li>
    <li> Probably gonna receive poo-poo responses for my three stars, but here goes. These are too heavy (yes, I know they come in different sizes) and impossible to sleep with.</li>
    <li> These work pretty good. Need more!</li>
    <li> It smells weird and its hard to sleep on. It definitely ends up curling your hair in the morning but my curls always turn out looking funky. Maybe I just need more practice using it.</li>
    <li> These reflex rods come in totally different sizes than the 7/8&amp;#34;. Moreover, it totally over priced. I got 12 of these for 5 dollars a Ross store</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to bend these so that they stay in your hair. If you could get them to stay in, they would curl nicely, but I find them to be frustrating to work with.</li>
    <li> These curlers are so simple and more comfortable than any others I&#x27;ve used. They can make big curls or lots of waves or just great body depending on how you roll them and how long you leave them in. You can sleep in them..they are not so uncomfortable. But the only thing is they will never let your hair dry if you put them in while wet. I have thin hair that dries fast normally but I left these in with wet hair for 12 hours and when I took them out my hair was still wet and fell flat like a limp noodle. :p but that&#x27;s no problem...lessened learned. :) 5 stars for sure!!!</li>
    <li> Nothing about these rods are comfortable to sleep in. Definitely can&#x27;t sleep on either side unless I want rods jamming in my ear or face lol. Nonetheless, it does what it says it does. I have long thick curly hair and needed to buy 2 packs for my whole head. This product probably won&#x27;t work in shorter hair because the rods are so thick.</li>
    <li> This product is difficult to use, perhaps because I have thin hair. Waste of money. I&#x27;m sure they work great on thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple times to figure out how to use these suckers but I just can&#x27;t seem to do them correctly. Maybe it&#x27;s my hair and not the rods but it&#x27;s not turning out to be good curls at all.</li>
    <li> The rods are pretty cheap. They have a metal rod inside and plastic caps that hold them together. They are fragile but if the plastic caps break off you can still use them. The smell is what I was mostly bothered by. It has a horrible stench that wont go away. Other than that they work great for curling your hair without heat and the curls stay, very easy to work with.</li>
    <li> I love styling my hair in fun, different ways, however, often times, that requires placing stress on the hair: the number one enemy being heat. It wasn&#x27;t until I was surfing YouTube that I had heard about flexi rods. After seeing the beautiful results they gave in many of the tutorials I knew I had to try this. My natural  hair is short, kind of a bob and these are a little on the bigger side for my hair, however, I was able to play up my bangs and get beautiful bouncy curls. I recently had my first weave installation and have been using the flexi rods to style my hair. The results have been beautiful wavy curls that last the majority of the day and only start to loosen in the evening hours. They are not the most comfortable thing to sleep in, however, they are far better than sleeping in the traditional rollers, which I can certainly attest to. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great way to style their hair while limiting heat.</li>
    <li> Having used heat products to curl my hair and see how dry my hair turned out, I really wanted something that could curl my hair as well as heat products could, minus the heat. I saw fairly positive reviews of these rods, and I was very interested in trying them out. I bought them for a very reasonable price and was very excited to use them. However, my excitement wore off quite quickly when I realized how false the curls looked on me. The curls were very unflattering in my opinion, and my hair would not hold the curls for long at all.</li>
    <li> excellent. love them. they are long and exactly the thickness i wanted. I have ordered two packs butone is mire than enough</li>
    <li> I really like these, they work well, if you are unsure on how to use go on YouTube and watch videos.  Nice option for taking a shower before bed and having hair look good in the morning.  Not too uncomfortable to sleep on, I haven&#x27;t had a problem falling asleep or staying asleep.  Not as comfy as sleeping without, but that is to be expected.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered pretty fast. It gives nice curls. Just keep in mind that the longer you put these rods in your hair, the tighter the curls. The only problem was the smell. It has been three weeks and the smell is still on these rods...</li>
    <li> They are just flexi rods...they do what they are made for, lol. Arrived on time. I have no complaints about it.</li>
    <li> These curlers are okay.  They don&#x27;t absorb much moisture from my hair.  Your hair needs to be just barely damp for these; gotta get it just right- and, I just don&#x27;t care to worry about whether or not I got it just right.</li>
    <li> I love the rods because they curl my hair and are very comfortable to wear. They couldn&#x27;t be easier to put in and they were cheap. What could be better? They seems strong so I do expect them to last. I don&#x27;t curl my hair very often, but these fit the bill just right.</li>
    <li> The heading is self explanatory. I was pretty curious about purchasing some of these and I absolutely love what they do to my hair.</li>
    <li> Now I wanted wider curls, so I wanted to buy a larger diameter, but these just don&#x27;t bend and the little bend they have rebounds in a few seconds, so they are really not usable.</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 sets of the flex rods as I have moderately long, slightly curly hair.  I would suggest checking out some You Tube videos if you want information on how to use them most accurately. Some videos suggest using damp hair, but I didn&#x27;t have to as my hair curls easily.  The flexible rods were the perfect size and were easy to manipulate and use once I had some instruction.  Would recommend to seller/manufacturer to include instructions in with the product. Would definitely purchase again if there is a need.</li>
    <li> Purple, 7/8&amp;#34; Not very comfortable to sleep with. I would suggest these rods for people with really really long hair. They do give you natural looking thick waves.</li>
    <li> I work over 60 hours a week so I am always too tired to get up and do my hair in the morning. I put them in at night and it takes less than five minutes to take them down and make my hair look beautiful in the morning. Easy to use and perfect for travel. Wish I could find one size up but I love these flexi rods.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on you tube reviews. Wow.  What a great product. I used this with lotta body styling lotion. My hair came out gorgeous curly and shines. I love these. I will definitely be buying these for my daughter. My hair came out better than using a curling iron. You have to try them.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that has successfully curled my pin straight hair. I use a dollop of light mousse in almost dry hair, and use 2 to 5 of the rods. It may be straight, but my hair is thick! But using fewer rods does create larger curls, which I prefer. It&#x27;s a little tough sleeping in them, but it&#x27;s worth the result in morning. If I set them centered along my head, I get a good nights rest and fun hair all day! Such a simple product, but very effective. Check out YouTube for tutorials, there are a few. Atter a few tries, you&#x27;ll get the hang out it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my flexible rods for the longest and I love them! They are great for big curls!!</li>
    <li> Love these rods! My curls came out the exactly how I wanted them to! I wish I had bought more of them</li>
    <li> I kind of wonder how I ever lived without these. I use them nearly everyday now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two bags just in case, which was a good idea since I found out I need 8 to do my whole head. I have thick hair that goes right to my chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these work better if you use them while your hair is wet and then let it dry. Not only do my curls turn out more intense and last longer, but I find that it&#x27;s easier to wrap your hair around them when it&#x27;s wet. I also love that I don&#x27;t have to do little sections to get a curl. When I use these I part my hair in half, and on each half I do a section by my face and one by my ear, and then I part the last section on the back of my head in two and use two rods back there since, of course, hair is thicker in the back. In the morning when I take them out my hair looks kind of crazy, but it calms down nicely about half an hour later, then I hairspray, and the curls last all day. One time I even forgot hairspray and they still lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first few days sleeping in these were awful but I don&#x27;t mind them now. Even if I did, I would still wear them because the outcome is so pretty. I get complimented all the time. I could never curl my hair before because my hair is hard to curl- it either won&#x27;t curl at all, or it&#x27;ll curl and fall flat in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had these for a month now and the rods are still in usable condition. Since they get bent in the same spot every night they look a little rough there, but it hasn&#x27;t affected anything. My only complaint about these though is that the plastic at the end of the rods do stick out a bit now and my hair gets wrapped around and stuck around them, which is painful and hard to undo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these, they work wonders.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t hold that well</li>
    <li> These work pretty well when you want a lot of curls. They are not as flexible as they could be but I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> These were super uncomfortable and didn&#x27;t produce the look I was hoping for.  I&#x27;ll go back to old fashioned rag ties.</li>
    <li> PERFECT! I recommend this to anyone who want perfect bouncy curls! Great package, came in perfect timing. BUY IT NOW!</li>
    <li> This is great for the stage when a girl wants to do her own hair HER way. They are safe and easy for her to use herself without needing too much help. They help manage my daughter&#x27;s thick, curly hair. She sleeps in them often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to get enough to be able to fit thin amounts of hair on a roller-if you roll thick they take forever to air dry. Hair comes off the roller having a silkier, smoother curl when hair dryer is used, but it&#x27;s still good without heat-particularly when you are trying to avoid breakage.</li>
    <li> Love love love love love these rods. i use them every night with little to no problems. im about to order some more</li>
    <li> I bought these rods to get more controlled curls in my unruly hair. Sleeping in them overnight is tolerable though certainly uncomfortable. The length is good for very long hair. I usually put them into towel-dried hair and it dries overnight. It&#x27;s difficult to roll them up all the way to the base of the head (because you have to twist them to keep them in place), so the curls usually start a few inches from the top of the hair.</li>
    <li> I hate sleeping with these rods in my hair. They are soft....but bulky. I just can&#x27;t freely move without it feeling like my hair is getting tugged on. If you aren&#x27;t wearing them overnight  (or if you use a tight night cap perhaps) then no problem for you! They make really pretty curls that last. Also the discomfort of the rods hasn&#x27;t stopped me from continuing to use them, so obviously I still find it worth it. :)</li>
    <li> I ordered these last week and got them in a timely fashion. I&#x27;ve been watching youtube videos to try and figure out a hairstyle; the only complaint I have is that they are really uncomfortable to sleep in...</li>
    <li> Good for loose or tight medium to big size body curls and waves Use on hair when damp or dry within minutes your hair will form curls with these rods</li>
    <li> My hair was always tangled after using.  While it will curl be warned about tangles</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my flexirods! They make some of the most prettiest curls around and are very convenient since you don&#x27;t have to use heat to create a sexy head full of flowing curls and waves. A staple tool in my household.</li>
    <li> No product necessary but if you would like the curls to last longer I recommend leaving in overnight for best results.</li>
    <li> These things are pretty neat and it&#x27;s nice that they don&#x27;t damage your hair with heat or anything, but like any new hair styling technique it&#x27;s gonna take some practice before you figure out what works best for you/your hair. Just be patient!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still learning all the different ways to use these. They are very versatile. I had no issues with mine not bending. I purchased the 7/8 inch. (My hair is arm pit length).  They came in a timely fashion &amp; I had no issues with packaging.</li>
    <li> After a year, the white parts came out and it&#x27;s not as strong as it once was. Don&#x27;t really use it anymore</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair curls with the flexi rods!  The only challenge for me was keeping them in!  I felt like they slipped out a lot.  I might just need some practice!  Love them anyways!</li>
    <li> I have purchased other rods before so when I got these, it was a nice surprise to see their size.  They are much longer than the regular ones.</li>
    <li> Sometimes you can&#x27;t find this size in the beauty stores.  The rollers will give you nice big loose curls and you can put a lot of hair on each roller.  Easier to sleep in than hard rollers.  No pins needed.  Just bend or twist the ends and the roller stays in place.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my rollers, especially for the price. They don&#x27;t work as well on short, somewhat naturally curly hair as I had hoped, but they&#x27;re just fine and I use them often.</li>
    <li> These are okay. I think I would prefer a smaller size for my hair. These curlers are both too large in diameter as well as length (10&amp;#34;). I have medium to long  hair. (It goes about 5 or 6 inches past my shoulders.) The curlers only make about 3 or 4 very large curls on the ends of my hair. The curls, for me at least, don&#x27;t last very long. I have hair that is difficult to curl though, and I was excited to have something that might be a no-heat solution for me. It&#x27;s not one that I like very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I&#x27;m doing. (If anybody can suggest something different, let me know!)&lt;br /&gt;1. Brush hair with moistened hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply a small amount of gel or mousse in a section.&lt;br /&gt;3. Roll that section up and bend ends to keep in place.&lt;br /&gt;4. Repeat steps 1-3 as needed.&lt;br /&gt;5. Sleep overnight.&lt;br /&gt;6. Remove curlers, breaking each section into smaller ringlets with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ceramic curling irons produce gorgeous curls that last days for me. (Literally, if I don&#x27;t wash my hair on day 2, they&#x27;ll still be there until the day 3 morning.) Regular metal curling irons just give me split ends and wavy hair at best. These curlers produce curls that really just last maybe 3 or 4 hours at best. And they&#x27;re not pretty curls. The hair toward the top of my head looks more wavy than curly, and so the only true curls are toward the ends. It&#x27;s alright, but it&#x27;s just not what I was hoping for. Perhaps my expectations were too high though, after reading all of the great reviews.</li>
    <li> it is a nice product, but i feel that pulls at my hair and doesn&#x27;t really stay on very well.  Not bad for the price though...</li>
    <li> I am Black (African-American).  These work great for curly my natural hair.  The trick is to shampoo your hair, blow dry it, flat iron it, slightly dampen the hair, roll it and jump under the hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I  have only seen this product demonstrated by African American women.  I am caucasian and have medium to fine slightly wavy hair that can be frizzy in the humidity.  These flex rods did a great job and did not leave me with frizzy curls.  I bought two packages and they nearly covered my whole head.  I recommend these for a no-heat option when you want medium sized curls.</li>
    <li> Great soft easy to use hair rollers. The curls Last at least a day &amp; a half.  No heat required to get great brunch curls or waves!</li>
