      <li>i like the pumpkin renewal more than this one.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>The scent is by no means over powering like so many moisturizers can be.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it over a year now but was paying about $20 more in stores before finding it here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I just love this cream.</li>
      <li>Love this product, my face looks great and much firmer</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is smoother and more even</li>
      <li>I am glad that Amazon is listing this product as scented, because the scent really is fairly strong.</li>
      <li>It is especially great for dry and aging skin.</li>
      <li>I am falling in love with MyChelle products: I started with the Pumpkin Renew Cream and Fabulous Eye Cream, and now have added the Supreme Polypeptide as part of my night routine.</li>
      <li>Compared to other skin creams, this one seemed to work best in conjunction with NCN Pro Skincare Multi-Active Matrixyl Serum 25%.  </li>
      <li>when I opened the jar and smelled it, it was fine.  </li>
      <li>The scent is mild (although they do have an unscented version) and I love the texture of the lotion as well as the fact that my face absorbs it so well.  </li>
      <li>I used to buy from a retail store, but this is a huge savings on-line.</li>
      <li>It is light, but my husband notices it when I come to bed.</li>
      <li>It smells great and makes my skin feel younger.</li>
      <li>Great quality and only this price exists on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a lotion that moisturizes deeply, has great feel to it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light clean floral almost herbal smell.</li>
      <li>I love MyChelle products, and this cream certainly doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
      <li>This contains amazing natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>We are getting a full refund and will buy the correct product</li>
      <li>In either case, the polypeptide and matrixyl products do seem to work better than the drugstore and department store brands that do not contain much if any of these ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Also, this product does not have good stability and separates in the jar after a short time.</li>
      <li>Short and simple the best face cream I have ever used in my life.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this line but have had better results with cheaper natural brands.</li>
      <li>I am 70 years old and most people say I look like I am in my 50&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I used samples of this product last yr. and liked it.</li>
      <li>Made my face feel soft and love the smell.</li>
      <li>After it&#x27;s absorbed, it&#x27;s not greasy or shiny.  </li>
      <li>I am presently using another cream in conjunction with a 10% matrixyl serum and feel the combination is not so effective as MyChelle Supreme Polypeptide Cream and the 25% matrixyl serum.  </li>
      <li>Also I feel so much better putting something natural on my skin that I know will not harm my skin.</li>
      <li>but always sensitive with easily clogged pores.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 6 months pregnant right now and very sensitive to smells, and this does not bother me, unlike my daughters shampoo!  </li>
      <li>It delivers moisture that deeply penetrates to the source of your dryness while delivering botanicals that help skin maintain a healthy glow and build collagen production.</li>
      <li>Love all the products my MyChelle, especially the Fruit Enzyme Cleanser.</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference in the skin on my face within the first week of using it.</li>
      <li>Thanks for making this unscented Mychelle!</li>
      <li>It is reasonably priced and worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I used it on my hands and they are starting to look better too.  </li>
      <li>cause it&#x27;s most likely cheaper.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>(actually has its own naturally occurring, natural light scent, but UNscented means NO added scent by the manufacturer--</li>
      <li>It is too easy for products to be out of date, or second rate, and not be able to get  your money back.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only bought the scented versions, which is not that strong of a scent to me.</li>
      <li>It is an attractive scent, but never the less, wearing this product, even as a hand cream, makes my eyes red and</li>
      <li>I really like how this product feels - silky - on my skin.  </li>
      <li>, I thought I would try it (being on sale was also a factor, but now that I&#x27;ve found it on Amazon, I realize I paid way too much even on sale...</li>
      <li>even as a scented product, an anti-aging face cream for every day wear does not need to have this much smell to it.</li>
      <li>The smell is too much, it reminds me of my grandma and the product doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.  </li>
      <li>and it works really well under my sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I have purchased it from other sources and the quality was better.</li>
      <li>This cream (along with most other MyChelle products) is overpriced and overrated.</li>
      <li>but it is a great moisturizer without all the weird chemicals found in so many other products.  </li>
      <li>I use it daily and can tell such a huge difference!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Polypeptides are highly endorsed by skincare experts and I can see why.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and have been satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I have very dry, very sensitive skin, and live in LA which has only contributed more dryness to the equation.</li>
      <li>I have been using My Chelle for 9 months and already see a difference in my 56 yr old face!</li>
      <li>My skin does not dry out, is more firm</li>
      <li>It is a little more than a daily moisturizer but still not greasy, so I use it as a night cream.</li>
      <li>I have multiple chemical sensitivities and I am very senstive to fragances.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best facial lotion on the planet.  Great quality and only this price exists on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It smells great and makes my skin feel younger. Also I feel so much better putting something natural on my skin that I know will not harm my skin. I used it on my hands and they are starting to look better too.  The skin is tightening up and the brown spots are lightening.</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful product</li>
    <li> This cream is not too greasy but yet is moisturing.  I mix it with the Serum C and it is perfect!    Also, one jar lasts me for 3 months.  However, at night I allow my face to \\&quot;rest\\&quot; by not using any moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use this at night. It has a nice scent and it is a good moisturizer. 1.2oz might sound small, but you use so little, a jar lasts me 3 - 4 months. If you haven&#x27;t tried Mychelle products, I highly recommend them, especially the cleansers. They are non drying, which is the biggest problem I have with face cleansers.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 1 month now and my skin seems firmer. I have multiple chemical sensitivities and I am very senstive to fragances. Even though I don&#x60;t like the smell, it has not been irriating my airways or throat. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use it over the hyaluronic serum every morning and night.</li>
    <li> Product is good. Vendor is suspect. Last two orders were received with product previously opened and resealed with tape. Orders were stopped.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened. I used samples of this product last yr. and liked it. I just recently bought the regular size of this product and used it for 2 weeks and it dried out my skin, it also made my skin peel and feel very tight. They had to of changed the formula. Needless to say I am returning this product along with the Deep Repair and Pumpkin Renew which also dried out my face, made it peel, and broke me out. I am 49 yrs. old and have not had a problem with pimples in years until using these products.</li>
    <li> Awesome product it really hydrates my skin</li>
    <li> This is a great night cream. Use it regularly, every night, on your face, and on the top of your hands, and in less then a month, you will see re-texturizing smoothness!  Thanks for making this unscented Mychelle! (actually has its own naturally occurring, natural light scent, but UNscented means NO added scent by the manufacturer-- thank goodness as I have chemical allergies!)   ;)</li>
    <li> I love MyChelle products, and this cream certainly doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  I have sensitive, easily irritated skin, but this feels so wonderful when I put it on, and I love that is is all natural and still has peptides.</li>
    <li> will get the scentless tho if i order again...and don&#x27;t expect miracles with this costly product...but i do think it improves things a bit...and i like the quality of all MyChelle products i have tried</li>
    <li> Short and simple the best face cream I have ever used in my life. Good sheen, added softness and leaves face supple after a month&#x27;s use. Will not use anything else, anymore.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have very sensitive skin, sometimes combination, sometimes dry...but always sensitive with easily clogged pores. This contains amazing natural ingredients. No mineral oil, no chemical of petroleum based ingredients. It delivers moisture that deeply penetrates to the source of your dryness while delivering botanicals that help skin maintain a healthy glow and build collagen production. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I think I reviewed the unscented previously. I love this stuff. I am 70 years old and most people say I look like I am in my 50&#x27;s. I attribute that to the facial cream I use. I used to buy from a retail store, but this is a huge savings on-line. Sharon</li>
    <li> The product sent was not the same as advertised. It had the same name but different package and different ingredients. Other people have complained about the same problem but Amazon is still sending out the wrong product. We are getting a full refund and will buy the correct product elsewhere.[[ASIN:B000MASTN8 Mychelle Supreme Polypeptide Cream, Scented, 1.2 Fl oz]]</li>
    <li> I like this cream a lot.  Absorbs quickly, not too greasy.  Good for reduction of wrinkles and fine lines.  A bit expensive but good deals can be found on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful day face cream!! I&#x27;ve used it for years and it&#x27;s the best. Does not leave my face shiny at all. Made with natural ingredients. I have dry skin and it works really well under my sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I see little difference some days the wrinkles look a little better, and on other days they aren&#x27;t any better.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin. This product hydrates without leaving an oil slick. Also allows you to use sun screen without &#x27;balling&#x27; up,</li>
    <li> Great product..I use it daily. The fragrance is nice and the product is lightweight. I will re-order this when the time comes. A little goes a Long way.</li>
    <li> I have been using her products for years and they are the best around for having no chemicals and a good feel.</li>
    <li> Very effective with noticiable improvement in one week. I love it</li>
    <li> I do like MyChelle products, including this cream.  However, I don&#x27;t feel that the results are as optimal as the products which I order from an alternative medicine practitioner.</li>
    <li> I really like how this product feels - silky - on my skin.  It contains peptides which are supposed to help with &amp;#34;the appearance of wrinkles.&amp;#34;  It does that as well as any product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it daily and can tell such a huge difference! I have used Clinique in the past and always found I felt dry half way thru my day or when I woke up. Not anymore! This is a great product and will continue or use it for years to come. The seller and product are both 5 star!</li>
    <li> I believe this item has been shelved for a long time.  The color and consistency have changed. I have purchased it from other sources and the quality was better.</li>
    <li> I bought this someplace else, where they didn&#x27;t have the unscented version (same maker, blue label instead of purple), and it was very expensive even on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it said it had no added artificial or chemical fragrance added, I thought I would try it (being on sale was also a factor, but now that I&#x27;ve found it on Amazon, I realize I paid way too much even on sale... the Amazon price is 1/3 less than I paid on sale).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you have any sensitivity to floral scents, you should skip this one and try their unscented version of this same cream. I am glad that Amazon is listing this product as scented, because the scent really is fairly strong. It is an attractive scent, but never the less, wearing this product, even as a hand cream, makes my eyes red and my nose stuffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has some really good ingredients, so I am going to try buying the unscented version and find a friend to give the rest of this cream to, since it is too expensive to just throw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it three stars because a) I could not stand to use it long enough to see how well it worked, and b) the info on its box implied much less scent and smell than it has--even as a scented product, an anti-aging face cream for every day wear does not need to have this much smell to it.</li>
    <li> This cream (along with most other MyChelle products) is overpriced and overrated. I have never had an issue with creams making me break out, but this one did, and the claims/benefits are overstated. Also, this product does not have good stability and separates in the jar after a short time. I was excited to try this line but have had better results with cheaper natural brands.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. I have used it many times. It is especially great for dry and aging skin.</li>
    <li> I just love this cream. It is a little more than a daily moisturizer but still not greasy, so I use it as a night cream. It makes my skin feel and look incredible. The scent is by no means over powering like so many moisturizers can be. Polypeptides are highly endorsed by skincare experts and I can see why. It is reasonably priced and worth every penny. I finally found a winner!</li>
    <li> this one made be a little oily. i like the pumpkin renewal more than this one. its a good product thou</li>
    <li> Kind of expensive but it is a great moisturizer without all the weird chemicals found in so many other products.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Compared to other skin creams, this one seemed to work best in conjunction with NCN Pro Skincare Multi-Active Matrixyl Serum 25%.  Hard to testify to its effectiveness when I did use it with the matrixyl product.  I am presently using another cream in conjunction with a 10% matrixyl serum and feel the combination is not so effective as MyChelle Supreme Polypeptide Cream and the 25% matrixyl serum.  But what works on one person does not necessarily work on someone else.  I think individual chemistry plays a part.  In either case, the polypeptide and matrixyl products do seem to work better than the drugstore and department store brands that do not contain much if any of these ingredients.  However I have genetically youthful skin (inherited from father and mother) and I only started using skin creams when I hit my 70&#x27;s to retard the inevitable aging process of turning into a prune.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a lotion that moisturizes deeply, has great feel to it but that my face will actually take (instead of lotion sitting on the surface of my face).  This is the perfect cream!  The scent is mild (although they do have an unscented version) and I love the texture of the lotion as well as the fact that my face absorbs it so well.  It keeps my face youthful and moisturized looking without looking greasy or feeling heavy!</li>
    <li> The smell is too much, it reminds me of my grandma and the product doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.  In fact, it left gooey lotion &#x27;balls&#x27; on my jaw line.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer at a great price!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it over a year now but was paying about $20 more in stores before finding it here on Amazon. I noticed a difference in the skin on my face within the first week of using it. My skin does not dry out, is more firm and I literally find fewer wrinkles. This is the best face cream I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
    <li> my skin did not like this product - in part because it is scented, and I just missed that part of the product description! Also, it feels completely different from the product I purchased at Whole Foods. I am suspicious about its authenticity and MyChelle customer service was unable to confirm or deny that it was the real deal.</li>
    <li> I like the way it keeps the skin moist and subtle.  I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and have been satisfied.  Jean</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  This is a slightly thick cream that does take a minute or two to absorb into you skin but it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. After it&#x27;s absorbed, it&#x27;s not greasy or shiny.  I use this at night and it has worked well for me.  I have slightly sensitive skin and have never had any issue with breakouts from this.  I use this in conjunction with andalou serums, and they both work well together. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is smoother and more even and my age spots have lightened up.  I&#x27;ve only bought the scented versions, which is not that strong of a scent to me. It&#x27;s a light clean floral almost herbal smell. It is light, but my husband notices it when I come to bed. (A good notice, not bad)  It&#x27;s not strong enough to linger on my pillow or anything.  I&#x27;m 6 months pregnant right now and very sensitive to smells, and this does not bother me, unlike my daughters shampoo!  But if you are really not sure, test it out in your local organic, or whole foods stores.  Then buy it here cause it&#x27;s most likely cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have been using My Chelle for 9 months and already see a difference in my 56 yr old face!</li>
    <li> I am falling in love with MyChelle products: I started with the Pumpkin Renew Cream and Fabulous Eye Cream, and now have added the Supreme Polypeptide as part of my night routine. The Supreme Polypeptide has literally changed the moisture level of my skin overnight. I could not be more thrilled! I have very dry, very sensitive skin, and live in LA which has only contributed more dryness to the equation. I&#x27;ve used products from Kiehl&#x27;s, Malin and Goetz, Korres, Origins, Clinique, and countless others. MyChelle products quality is unsurpassed and not having to think about parabens, etc is a RELIEF!!</li>
    <li> Made my face feel soft and love the smell. Love all the products my MyChelle, especially the Fruit Enzyme Cleanser.</li>
    <li> Another excellent product!</li>
    <li> My biggest mistake purchase yet.  As a moisturizer it is ok, nothing great though.  However, the smell.  I read another review that spoke about the smell, unfortunately I didn&#x27;t listen.  I thought, oh, I&#x27;m really open to different smells.  Here&#x27;s the thing, when I opened the jar and smelled it, it was fine.  But then my sister (I bought one for her too) said her husband hates the smell and won&#x27;t kiss her when she wears it.  I couldn&#x27;t figure it out, until one day I was in a store and I happened to rub my face and got my hand close to my nose.  It smelled like baby puke.  Seriously!  The mixture must react with skin in some weird way that produces this awful smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for more sad news, I couldn&#x27;t return the product.  I went back and forth with the seller.  They said since it was used they can&#x27;t take it back.  I said that it is a defective product.  I won&#x27;t buy from the seller again.  And I&#x27;m not really sure buying cosmetics on Amazon is a good idea.  It is too easy for products to be out of date, or second rate, and not be able to get  your money back.  At a local store I could get my money back.  Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Love this product, my face looks great and much firmer</li>
    <li> I can see a change in my skin tone within in the first week and really think my slight wrinkles are minimized! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!</li>
