    <li> I&#x27;m so inlove with this color (Tickle my France)!</li>
    <li> very nice and it takes 1 week to peel off</li>
    <li> Received quick. Liked color.</li>
    <li> I like OPI colors because they stay on well and don&#x27;t chip easily like some others. This particular one is very true to the photograph and is a light brownish-pink.  It is more pink than any other color but it is very pretty on my nails. This is a more subtle color, not bright and not too light but a good color for spring and summer.  I like the mauves and browns, but not too brown, so this is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has its own really nice shine to it that hasn&#x27;t dulled over a couple of days.  I didn&#x27;t put a top coat on, which would help to keep the polish fresh longer and a higher shine.  However, it looks great the way it is.  I think you&#x27;ll like it if you try it!</li>
    <li> This polish seems to really last. No chipping in two weeks on toes.</li>
    <li> Combination of light rose and beige. It&#x27;s subtle and the finish is hard. It lasts with a base and top at least five days for me. It&#x27;s not pale or dark.</li>
    <li> I love this color.  Just two very light coats, and you look like you have naturally glossy nails.  What is even better is that when my fingernails outgrow the polish (because the polish never chips), the white tips of my nails make it look as if I have a French manicure!</li>
    <li> This color is perfect for me. Love OPI products. Will get this color again.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this subtle color and I am hooked on OPI.</li>
    <li> I like this color.  It&#x27;s not too light or dark.  Just right.</li>
    <li> I wear this when my nails are shorter, it is nice to have a touch of color but not draw too much attention to my shorter nails.</li>
    <li> A perfect Spring color!  It had a pink tint, but not too pinky!  It looks very complementary on my 53 year old hands.</li>
    <li> The color is perfect. I love it very much. It makes your nail look great and bright, but in a very nature way.</li>
    <li> Lovely color, and lasts for weeks!</li>
    <li> This color looks good with one, two or even three coats depending on your mood.  It is exactly as shown and fast delivery was great.  A real staple.</li>
    <li> What a great, rich neutral from OPI! I am so pleased with it. I can&#x27;t use more intense colors on hands yet, since I&#x27;m trying to grow out nails from a bad chomping habit, but this one works - it&#x27;s fine! Have always used OPI on my toes in every color, and was glad to find a neutral like this.</li>
    <li> I love this color. It&#x27;s natural. for the first time, this is really a nude color for women with olive skin. You can&#x27;t find an actual nude lip for dark lips. But, someone should get a standing ovation for creating this color. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Lovely subtle color! Matches great with my skin tone (I&#x27;m yellow). It&#x27;s my first opi nail polish; I&#x27;ve always heard that were good but I was always so hesitant to buy one bc they&#x27;re significantly more expensive than other nailpolishes that you can find for like a buck at the grocery store. But I&#x27;m so happy I finally bought one! It&#x27;s lasts so much longer on my nails and rarely chips. Also it doesn&#x27;t get sticky, goopy and stringy (at least it hasnt yet), like the cheap grocery store ones.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> Love the color, better than I thought.</li>
    <li> it takes many coats to get to a color slightly close to the picture. otherwise it is really not pretty.</li>
    <li> Love this color....not too pink...no too mauve</li>
    <li> I love this color, it looks just like the one in the picture. I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not new to OPI, but I occasionally buy cheaper brands, which is always a mistake.  OPI is reliable, easy to apply and stays well. No more messing around with inexpensive brands.</li>
    <li> Great neutral color that blends well for a clean &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely nude color and does not show chips as much as darker colors.</li>
    <li> I love the opi nail product brand.  The nail colors are nice and my manicure looks good.</li>
    <li> Love this color and fast shipping !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> this is the PERFECT nude. It does have a kind of blue-ish/cool undertone to it, but it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> A pretty nude/neutral.</li>
    <li> I ordered this online and hated the color when I got it, BUT when I put it on I was amazed at how elegant it looks with my skin tone.  For an old lady, I have had a LOT of men comment on my nails when I wear this color for some odd reason since the men are like in their 30&#x27;s and I&#x27;m almost 60.  I thought color was of the KaoPectate shade...LOL!  I have a very extensive selection of OPI shades and this is now one of the top 5 classics for me.  I have long natural nails and this color really looks best with long slender nails IMHO.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s another rather neutral color.</li>
    <li> Slightly purple-ish and gorgeous! This is the perfect color when you want something muted but not quite nude.</li>
    <li> No worries! Bubble wrapped. Quick delivery. Paler than expected. Nice neutral. Good for French manicure or  as is. The Hawaiian orchid is several shades darker, which I prefer.</li>
    <li> I usually love OPI products, but this one is okay. I love the color, but found that I easily peels off after a day.</li>
    <li> The perfect nude! I have yellow-toned skin and my mom has pink-toned skin and it works for both of us. It is not a nasty corpse nude, it is more of a mauve toned nude. With the OPI brush, it goes on smooth and streak-less and bubble-less and is almost impossible to mess up. You do not need a topcoat as it is already shiny but I do anyways. Two coats is fine but three coats is perfect! Beautiful for any occasions [Weddings, night out, work, just because :) ]. It also drys quick so that is a major plus if you always are running out the door.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time.  I love this color.</li>
    <li> Paint spreads easily. I love the formula. This nude is very beautiful.</li>
    <li> it has a purple shade under the natural light, under the artificial light it&#x27;s darker beige which I like much better</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty polish. It has a hint of lavender and looks very good on. This polsh drys quickly, doesn&#x27;t chip and has a great shine.</li>
    <li> Love this shade by OPI.  This might be my 4th or 5th bottle.  Great nude shade with a purple tone, very light.  Hope I am explaining this correctly!  If you love OPI and nude colors.  Try this one!</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish looks so simple and classy! And if stays on way longer than other nail polish brands.!</li>
    <li> Great color for all skin colors. Love it. Must have....</li>
    <li> I get lots of compliments on this beautiful neutral color! Thanks!</li>
    <li> YES I WOULD RECOMMEND OPI NAIL POLISH. MY NAILS LOOK WONDERDUL</li>
    <li> Pretty, neutral color.. Just how I like it.</li>
    <li> I love this color! It&#x27;s so chic and elegant; it really brings a little class to your overall look. I tried it out the day it arrived, and then bought another one for my sister-in-law&#x27;s birthday. I know she will love it. It&#x27;s a great color for any woman for a dash of understated femininity.</li>
    <li> Pretty, neutral, long lasting, strong chip&#x3D;proof.  This one has it all.</li>
    <li> nice neutral color, that last. It also drys fast, I have my manicure last over a week.</li>
    <li> Opi my favourite nail polish. This is a great taupe nude every day color which I so looking for! Need 2-3 coats to apply, but dry very fast. I will recommend it!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. Nude with a bit of flair</li>

    <li> This color looks great on someone with darker skin tones. I think its the perfect spring color that looks very classy and professional at the office, and feminine for date night.</li>
    <li> I have mix emotions about the his color, it is soft but under a good lighting I suppose.OPI Nail polish is truly amazing it drys fast it does not chip as a result it last longer.</li>
    <li> i LOVE the color and just like every opi nailpolish: great quality, great brush, im love.</li>

    <li> Pretty shade! Last over a week before a polish change. Love OPI!</li>

    <li> Very neutral. Love it</li>
    <li> I loved the color...will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Not quite the right color. Too light. Sadly, couldn&#x27;t tell by the picture :(</li>
