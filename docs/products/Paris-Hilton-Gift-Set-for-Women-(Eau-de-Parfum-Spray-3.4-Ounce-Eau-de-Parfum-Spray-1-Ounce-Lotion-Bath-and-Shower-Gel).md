      <li>I got so many compliments on it, I decided to &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; up and forget about who&#x27;s name is across the bottle.</li>
      <li>This is such a beautiful scent!</li>
      <li>Love Love Love this perfume.</li>
      <li>*:)</li>
      <li>This scent is unique in its own, but for my taste in fragrance, it stands tall and strong along side my two favorite perfumes.</li>
      <li>good product was exactly what I ordered</li>
      <li>I came across this perfume in a local store, and loved the way it smelled on me!</li>
      <li>Was so happy that I was able to find this set for my niece as a Christmas present.</li>
      <li>The best way I can impress upon this scent, is to relate it to the two fragrances I am most fond of wearing over the years, which are Very Irresistible by Givenchy &amp; Ed Hardy by Christian Audigier.</li>
      <li>The lotion in this set has a light shimmer to it, which is great for summertime and bare skin!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light not over powering</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light fruity/floral scent, but it lasts for hours on me.</li>
      <li>I am very particular with my scents, as most people are.</li>

      <li>Arrived on time, very pleased carefully packaged.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not one to like many perfumes, however I bought this as a present</li>
      <li>smells great long lasting</li>
      <li>Not into that whole thing, as I am 27 years old and a full fledged grown up ;)</li>
      <li>The bath gel doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as the perfume, in my opinion, but layering all of these products makes the perfume last longer than it already does.</li>
      <li>I bought the body spray a while back on clearance, because I needed a cheap fruity fragrance for work.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I really wanted the lotion</li>
      <li>and it came very well wrapped...</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
      <li>hopefully they give me a discount to make up for the old lotion…</li>

<li> Unfortunately at the stores they were all sold out for the price originally posted, but this one did the trick.</li>
<li> It is also very hard to describe a particular scent to others, since personal tastes tend to be somewhat subjective.</li>
<li> Not to mention, it lasts a long time with minimal fading.</li>
<li> Package arrived way before expected!</li>
<li> Just what I expected!</li>
<li> no quit use to perfume or don&#x27;t like the heavy scents.</li>
<li> shower gel was oozing :/</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve applied it before leaving for work, and the scent still faintly lingers by the time I go to bed.  </li>

    <li> 1 Of the best smelling perfumes on the market</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this perfume. I can&#x27;t live without. Everyone compliments me on good I smell. It&#x27;s light not over powering and you can&#x27;t even smell it on yourself but everyone does. This is prefect for some is no quit use to perfume or don&#x27;t like the heavy scents. Got my package quick. The only problem I had was that the body lotion smelled expired. I really wanted the lotion and I had to throw it away :- (&lt;br /&gt;I should of returned but I didn&#x27;t know I could. Any how, I think I will still buy with this seller hopefully they give me a discount to make up for the old lotion…lol</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.!! And it arrived to my house in a timely manner.. *:)</li>
    <li> smells great long lasting</li>
    <li> Just what I expected!</li>
    <li> Was so happy that I was able to find this set for my niece as a Christmas present. Unfortunately at the stores they were all sold out for the price originally posted, but this one did the trick. Thank you for saving my butt. I am still her fav aunt. Speedy delivery. Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to like many perfumes, however I bought this as a present and of course I had to smell it and it smells delicious! Packaging was bubble wrapped, came right on time! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have worn this for years, and hope they never discontinue it! It&#x27;s a light fruity/floral scent, but it lasts for hours on me. I&#x27;ve applied it before leaving for work, and the scent still faintly lingers by the time I go to bed.  The lotion in this set has a light shimmer to it, which is great for summertime and bare skin! The bath gel doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as the perfume, in my opinion, but layering all of these products makes the perfume last longer than it already does. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This particular PHilton perfume is the best choice of all the scents.It arrived in a timely manner and was packed well, so all bottles were intact/unbroken.Even if you&#x27;re not a big fan of Paris, the person, you&#x27;ll love this scent! Two words-Delish/Intoxicating</li>
    <li> You lost this item once and had to be replace and your UPS delivery man can&#x27;t follow simply instructions again  we asked if you guys could tell the delivery man to knock since I have no door bell and no one knocked.</li>
    <li> It was a perfect gift. Thanks😊</li>
    <li> Was a great gift for my mother in law</li>
    <li> the product is just like in the photo and it came very well wrapped... i was worried about the packaging but i received it in perfect conditions... just love it... 10/10</li>
    <li> Package arrived way before expected! Neatly packaged and not a knock off! Absolutely beautiful.</li>

    <li> Great Buy, Great Price,  Thanks</li>
    <li> Elmejor d los perfumes me encanta su olor , si te gustan los olores dulces este es el mejor perfume</li>
    <li> I loved this colony, came to Venezuela smoothly, deserves its 5 stars very good</li>
    <li> Like always, LOVE IT !! Arrived just in time !!</li>
    <li> good product was exactly what I ordered</li>
    <li> I bought the body spray a while back on clearance, because I needed a cheap fruity fragrance for work. I got so many compliments on it, I decided to &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; up and forget about who&#x27;s name is across the bottle. I got this as a Christmas present from my wish list. My only qualm is the lotion is sooooo glittery. Not into that whole thing, as I am 27 years old and a full fledged grown up ;)</li>
    <li> Ordered two and paid for two only received one 😔</li>
