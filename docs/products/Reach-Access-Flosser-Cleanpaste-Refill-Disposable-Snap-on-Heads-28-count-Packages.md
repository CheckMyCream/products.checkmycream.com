      <li>This product makes is MUCH easier to reach my back teeth.</li>
      <li>but they are just like the green ones (original color).</li>
      <li>A bit costly, and, disappointingly, over the years the floss has obviously been engineered to break more quickly.  </li>

    <li> These things are great!!  They really make it possible to floss your teeth quite easily.  Mind you, these are only refills.  You need to have the handle to hold them too.</li>
    <li> This product makes is MUCH easier to reach my back teeth. Several people use these in the household, so I am glad to find such a large pack. I wish they would make them without flavor. That is why I give 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great service and fair price. I finally found a source for these</li>
    <li> Makes regular flossers out of non-flossers.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fair price.  My local supermarket is reliably out of these when I need them, so I&#x27;m good for a while!</li>
    <li> These taste great, and a good buy for the money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered Cleanpaste flosser refills over and over but only in packs of 2.  This is a much better deal, with 12 packs of 28 each these 336 refills should last me awhile.  :-) I really like the Cleanpaste flavor.  The Reach Access Flosser works really well and the refills snap in and out easily, and you don&#x27;t have to deal with breaking off floss and threading it through your teeth (you should avoid putting your fingers in your mouth anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I see to the Cleanpaste refills is that they are not as strong as the unflavored refills (I wonder why that is), so break easier.  I might go through a couple at one flossing (my bottom teeth are really close together).  But I much prefer these to the unflavored refills and they leave a fresh taste in my mouth.</li>
    <li> I loves these flossers and felt this was a good price.  Always like to buy in bulk when possible.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Just a great product that is getting impossible to find in the stores!!! Really appreciate being able to buy it in bulk! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described, super fast free shipping, and GREAT price!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Reach Floss Stick for ages.  I recently ran out and had to use regular floss and my kids cheap-y floss sticks.  The floss gets stuck in your teeth or breaks before you&#x27;re done flossing with them.  The refills are getting quite expensive at the local stores.  I saved a bit of money by ordering in bulk on Amazon.  I love these because I can floss one handed and really scrub the sides of my teeth and gums.  My husband is disgusted by the fact that I floss in the car.  It is a floss stick, is it really that gross that I have great dental hygiene?  I think that you can never floss too much and these little babies are the best.  If you are not a dedicated flosser try these out!  I recommend using them every time you get in your car!  Your teeth and gums will be be delighted and you will not be able to go without flossing.  I think it&#x27;s time for me to get my floss on!</li>
    <li> Best price I could find</li>
    <li> Low prices and quick delivery. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I love this product and could no longer find it at Walmart.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this order, arrived on time, everything was as expected!</li>
    <li> The right product at the right price. I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping n great product for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find these and when I found them here, for the amount and for the price, I had to get them. I have very hard to floss teeth, so using this is a dream. Plus the mint flavored paste is a bonus. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Best way to floss.  Great control and ease of use.  A bit costly, and, disappointingly, over the years the floss has obviously been engineered to break more quickly.  Still, a great way to floss!</li>
    <li> Best bang for the buck out there!  Perfect, as described.</li>
    <li> This large quantity should last me a year or more. I use these till the thread breaks, which lasts me a few days even with daily use. They are blue instead of green colored but they are just like the green ones (original color). They work great. I hate using the spool of thread and trying to cram my fingers into my mouth. Reach solves that problem and now I have a huge supply! Great price! Prime shipping! What&#x27;s not to like about it?</li>
    <li> Better than expected! Good quality product! Thanks :-)</li>
