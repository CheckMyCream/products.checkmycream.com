      <li>I&#x27;d recommend you skip it and spend your money on something better.</li>
      <li>Use it most of the time.</li>
      <li>:) I have been pleased with this.</li>
      <li>It comes out mostly watery and takes time to absorb.</li>
      <li>Besides that, I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and if I was rating it on that alone, I would probably give it five stars.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice, light moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Lovely smell, quick and easy to apply and feels good on skin</li>
      <li>Senior Citizen with very dry skin, this is the easiest and best form of lotion I have found.  </li>
      <li>So easy to spray on</li>
      <li>Goes on easy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy on, doesn&#x27;t run and stays.</li>
      <li>The lotion absorbs VERY quickly and does not leave your skin greasy or sticky at all.</li>
      <li>I found the scent strong and overpowering, but the spray version was *</li>
      <li>The coconut and orchid scent is not too strong and provides a clean scent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that moisturizing, but it&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to see I had won, but when I saw the scent</li>
      <li>This is a must have for quick and light moisturizing.</li>
      <li>so my skin tends to get really dry, St. Ives does an amazing job at keeping my skin soft and it smells great too.</li>
      <li>much* lighter and more</li>
      <li>It goes on smelling quite sweet</li>
      <li>It is strongly scented when you first apply it, but it fades as it dries.  </li>
      <li>but I find that this spray lotion does not provide adequate moisturizing for my needs.  </li>
      <li>spray is a super neat concept.</li>
      <li>Just a quick rub in and it drys quickly.</li>
      <li>l love St. Ives product, but I wont be buying this particular product again.</li>
      <li>and it it is absorbed quickly.  </li>
      <li>This is one of several options I sought out to make sure I put something on, and I like it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very lightweight lotion, probably better for summer when you don&#x27;t need as much moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I received the Coconut Milk &amp; Orchid Extract Fresh Hydration Spray Lotion in the mail from the promo on the St Ives Facebook page.</li>
      <li>But, I may reconsider this decision since my simple and honest review is not allowed to be on their site.</li>
      <li>Wow, so quick and easy.</li>
      <li>I put it on right after my shower.</li>
      <li>It sprays out in an even mist and the bottle can be sprayed from any angle, which makes it very easy to reach your back.</li>
      <li>Great for everyday use in a breeze!</li>
      <li>The quick absorption is probably because it isn&#x27;t very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>But this is soooo much quicker and it absorbs really quickly.</li>
      <li>Easy to spray, not messy or greasy.</li>
      <li>Overall though I am pleased with my purchase and would (and did) buy again.</li>
      <li>This was my first time to try a spray lotion.</li>
      <li>Good moisturizer, but too messy.</li>
      <li>First, the positive comment:  </li>
      <li>It is quick and easy to apply but the doesn&#x27;t stay with me very long.</li>
      <li>I love this particular fragrance and will stick with the regular pump lotion since it does not have parabens.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry too fast to spread it around, but it dries absorbs faster than most lotions.</li>
      <li>It does get on the floor and make the tile very slippery, so I would recommend putting it on in the shower.</li>
      <li>Like real coconuts.</li>
      <li>Aside from that, it is very watery and the spray tends to go everywhere unless you keep it close to your skin.</li>
      <li>REALLY wish they would make this with SPF 30, as I will have to switch to something with sun protection</li>
      <li>Spray over your entire body and smooth out.</li>
      <li>A quick swipe of the hand will help it absorb &amp; dry quickly though.</li>
      <li>I simply said I was excited for this product, but once I realized it had parabens in it, I could not use it and  </li>
      <li>I recently reviewed the original bottle lotion of this scent on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I was dried and dressed super fast, huge plus.</li>
      <li>Kind of expensive for what you get, but it is easy.</li>
      <li>For lazy girls like me, this is an amazing feature.</li>
      <li>The scent is like classic Bath &amp; Body Works c. 2001.</li>
      <li>(I am somewhat particular to highly fragrant smells).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m willing to bet the next time I use it, it will go much faster.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You will still need a heavier lotion or cream for any very dry areas, but if they made it heavier, it would not absorb so quickly.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say I would pay the full $7+ per bottle for this lotion, but if it was on sale I would definitely purchase more, I&#x27;m curious how the other scents smell!</li>
      <li>The scent is pretty light, I can&#x27;t actually smell it after a few minutes, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was my first time to try a spray lotion. It smelled and felt so chemically. It was difficult to inhale while spraying it without feeling like I was getting a breath full of aerosol lotion.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like the spray lotion, but I love it! It is lightweight and sprays on evenly.  It makes putting lotion on your back a breeze.  The coconut and orchid scent is not too strong and provides a clean scent.  I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> A nice, light scent, and it doesn&#x27;t make me itch, as lots of products do!</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Terrific lotion! Oily lotion is my biggest pet peeve but this stuff is great! Plus is smells so good!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that moisturizing, but it&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
    <li> This smells divine to me. I have scent allergies but for some reason coconut is a smell that won&#x27;t give me headaches. I won&#x27;t day I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin since using this, but it smells good and moisturizes as you&#x27;d expect it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this lotion is that it sprays on. For lazy girls like me, this is an amazing feature. It doesn&#x27;t spray on thick and clumpy either, it&#x27;s a pretty even, thin spray that is easy to rub in. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> It is quick and easy to apply but the doesn&#x27;t stay with me very long. I do have dry skin so it might just be me.  Smell is mild not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of the spray lotion. You still have to rub it in and have to spray a lot. The scent is like classic Bath &amp; Body Works c. 2001.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. I have diabetes so my skin tends to get really dry, St. Ives does an amazing job at keeping my skin soft and it smells great too.</li>
    <li> Goes on easy but you still have to rub it in a bit or it won&#x27;t soak in. A quick swipe of the hand will help it absorb &amp; dry quickly though. Smells great!</li>
    <li> This really made my skin softer and moister than regular lotions. It stays on the skin and seems &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; without being greasy.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses them everyday.</li>
    <li> Lovely smell, quick and easy to apply and feels good on skin</li>
    <li> This smells nice but it almost has a weird smell to it. It&#x27;s also not very moisturizing. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Unless you are really lazy, I would recommend skipping this product entirely. It comes out mostly watery and takes time to absorb. I have to wait longer to dry off before putting clothes on than I do with regular lotion. It doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as the regular lotion either - its just weird. I did recently learn that these products, even though they are all natural DO test on animals. It just seems counter intuitive - you claim you are all natural but you are going to torture poor animals for your products, NOT COOL JERKS!</li>
    <li> I prefer traditional lotion after trying this spray-on type.</li>
    <li> I am writing my review here because the St. Ives website decided to &amp;#34;moderate&amp;#34; my review on their website and completely remove it. It was not vulgur or dis-tasteful, just honest. I simply said I was excited for this product, but once I realized it had parabens in it, I could not use it and  was very disappointed. I love this particular fragrance and will stick with the regular pump lotion since it does not have parabens. But, I may reconsider this decision since my simple and honest review is not allowed to be on their site. They aparently only want 5 star, glowing reviews in 2014.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the smell, however I don&#x27;t care for the residue feel that l  feel when l touch my skin, it&#x27;s not a soft feeling neither. l love St. Ives product, but I wont be buying this particular product again.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, light moisturizer.  I use it on my arms in the morning, when I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to rub in a heavy lotion.  You will still need a heavier lotion or cream for any very dry areas, but if they made it heavier, it would not absorb so quickly.  I just use something heavier at night, when I have time to deal with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY wish they would make this with SPF 30, as I will have to switch to something with sun protection come summer.  Too bad, since the coconut is kind of a summery scent.</li>
    <li> I have just started using this product and I love how it feels on my skin. I put it on right after my shower. I use the body wash in this line and also the lotion. I do find that I prefer this product to the regular lotion.</li>
    <li> I wanted a spray for my legs because I am 8+ months pregnant and bending down to apply lotion can be a challenge. :) I have been pleased with this. The sprayer applies it fairly evenly and the smell is nice (I am somewhat particular to highly fragrant smells). It does get on the floor and make the tile very slippery, so I would recommend putting it on in the shower. I gave 4 stars based on the fact that it didn&#x27;t last very long and is a bit expensive for the amount of uses before the can ran dry. Overall though I am pleased with my purchase and would (and did) buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this spray lotion. The scent is nice. It is strongly scented when you first apply it, but it fades as it dries.  It doesn&#x27;t dry too fast to spread it around, but it dries absorbs faster than most lotions.</li>
    <li> I ove this moisturizer because it lets me reach places I otherwise could not reach. It&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful and the feel of the lotion is so refreshing. This is a must have for quick and light moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I love this idea and the fragrance is nice. Easy on, doesn&#x27;t run and stays. St Ives products are always the best at the best price</li>
    <li> So easy to spray on and it feels and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Yes, you do have to rub this in a little, but far less than applying traditional lotion and it it is absorbed quickly.  The quick absorption is probably because it isn&#x27;t very moisturizing.  Pretty expensive considering the volume and moisturizing ability. I&#x27;d recommend you skip it and spend your money on something better.</li>
    <li> Smells Great and very easy to use.  Kind of expensive for what you get, but it is easy. I love the smell!</li>
    <li> My skin is so dry and flaky that I can&#x27;t use lotion because it&#x27;s still flaky hours after.  But boy does this do the trick. It has glycerin mixed in with the lotion and that&#x27;s why it works. Smells good also. Now I can put away the oils I use to rub on my skin that was making my skin dark. I&#x27;m African American; I don&#x27;t need a tan. Ships within 5-7days.</li>
    <li> I love the spray lotion.  I use it after I have a shower.</li>
    <li> This is so convenient and lives up to its claims</li>
    <li> Smells good, not for me through. I&#x27;ll stick with lotion</li>
    <li> This stuff smells AMAZING. I read that the Citrus scent smelled like a bathroom, so when OnTrac returned my delivered package with the Citrus scent to Amazon, they refunded my money, and I ordered the Coconut one. It smells fresh and delicious. Like real coconuts. It feels great on my skin. The only problem I have is how it is distributed when you spray it. It&#x27;s kind of one stream and doesn&#x27;t spread easily. Besides that, I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this out and I was pleased and also a bit disappointed.  First, the positive comment:  it smells wonderful!  I love the smell and if I was rating it on that alone, I would probably give it five stars.  The disappointment comes in due to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t actually moisturize all that well.  My arms are not overly dry but I find that this spray lotion does not provide adequate moisturizing for my needs.  Those who have oily or skin that is not at all dry might find this product works for them.</li>
    <li> I bought this to spray on the back of my hands when I need lotion, but don&#x27;t want to apply with my palms so they don&#x27;t get greasy. The sprayer doesn&#x27;t broadcast enough to cover everything evenly, so I end up rubbing the backs of my hands together to distribute. It&#x27;s a very lightweight lotion, probably better for summer when you don&#x27;t need as much moisturizing. The scent isn&#x27;t horrible, but I&#x27;m not a fan of it, either.</li>
    <li> Easy to spray, not messy or greasy. Just a quick rub in and it drys quickly. Great for everyday use in a breeze! Leaves skin smooth, smelling great n mositurized! :) A++</li>
    <li> I received the Coconut Milk &amp; Orchid Extract Fresh Hydration Spray Lotion in the mail from the promo on the St Ives Facebook page. I was so excited to see I had won, but when I saw the scent I was a little bummed. I recently reviewed the original bottle lotion of this scent on Amazon. I found the scent strong and overpowering, but the spray version was *much* lighter and more bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray is a super neat concept. It sprays out in an even mist and the bottle can be sprayed from any angle, which makes it very easy to reach your back. The lotion absorbs VERY quickly and does not leave your skin greasy or sticky at all. I was dried and dressed super fast, huge plus. I hate having my clothes stick to my lotioned body after a shower or bath. It took me the same amount of time to apply this spray lotion as regular lotion, but I&#x27;m chalking that up to being concerned about missing a spot! I&#x27;m willing to bet the next time I use it, it will go much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine this bottle will last as long as a normal bottle of lotion. I can see DEFINITELY this spray lotion being a staple in a gym bag! I can&#x27;t say I would pay the full $7+ per bottle for this lotion, but if it was on sale I would definitely purchase more, I&#x27;m curious how the other scents smell! Hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> I always feel rushed when I get out of the shower so I skip lotion way too much, which I hate! But this is soooo much quicker and it absorbs really quickly. The scent is pretty light, I can&#x27;t actually smell it after a few minutes, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to...it hydrates! Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Works and sprays well, pleasant odor and does not leave a greasy film.  Use it most of the time.</li>
    <li> ...when it comes to moisturizing after my evening shower. This is one of several options I sought out to make sure I put something on, and I like it! It goes on smelling quite sweet but I don&#x27;t hate it. I ordered the shea butter and oatmeal version to compare.</li>
    <li> I bought three of these and just realized they contain Parabens. Most of St. Ive&#x27;s products don&#x27;t and that is why I switched. I am truly disappointed about this. Aside from that, it is very watery and the spray tends to go everywhere unless you keep it close to your skin. Their other products I really like. This stuff is getting tossed!</li>
    <li> smells and feels great!</li>
    <li> After showering, I love this product for its simplicity and convenience. Spray over your entire body and smooth out. Wow, so quick and easy. I love the delicate coconut smell it leaves on my body. It&#x27;s a great addition to the gym bag, too.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer, but too messy. The spray function gets moisturizer all over the floor, leaving a sticky, slippery film on tile flooring. Not for me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t love,very little hydration</li>
    <li> Senior Citizen with very dry skin, this is the easiest and best form of lotion I have found.  No bending over to moisturize my legs.  Love it !!</li>
