      <li>Works fantastically well, Clinique is an amazing product all around and worth the expense.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, im a redhead, and this is a amazing product!</li>
      <li>The BEST time to buy this product is when they are doing their giveaway packages, then you get to try some of their other products.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and find it easy to use.</li>
      <li>Great product by Clinique, but my order came with the top just enough unscrewed to leak during shipping, and then leaked when I took it out of the box.</li>
      <li>I would use the strongest of the strong (PanOxyl) and it just kept any acne at bay.</li>
      <li>I never had the money, nor desire to believe it worked since the strong OTC face washes didn&#x27;t work that well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I feel that it is a really fine product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like it very much..comfortable to use it clean my skin in the morning and night...Great choice!</li>
    <li> Upscale beauty product - arrived in good shape and I would buy product again.  My favorite face wash</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I haven&#x27;t used soap on my face for years. I use this in the shower every day for my face. It&#x27;s great. Try it &amp; you&#x27;ll never use soap again.</li>
    <li> Good product, light and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or dry you out. Only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t really cater to any specific needs like acne or oily skin.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. caused horrible break outs.</li>
    <li> The Clinique Liguid Facial Soap is a must have for me because it leaves my face fresh and clean.  Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Perfect skin cleanser. Doesn&#x27;t sting or hurt my skin and leaves it feeling clean and fresh.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> My favorite face wash for my sensitive acne prone skin. My boyfriend uses it too.</li>
    <li> Still waiting on my order of this soap but have used it exclusively for years. Clinique is a quality brand of facial and beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;  Clinique&#x27;s liquid soap, mild, keeps my skin clear and clean. I follow it with Clinique&#x27;s other products like their toner and moisturizer. I also use the 7-Day Scrub Cream  a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;  Clinique is a great brand, and I am glad I found it at Amazon, as it is a little less expensive than ordering from Clinique suppliers.</li>
    <li> I have always problematic skin since I had horrible allergic reaction to Dermalogica problems. I still have scars from that reaction and ever since I have kept breaking out. I have not had acne problem last few years but my skin lost all its elatiticity and tone due to harsh treatments, including chemical peelings. I have begun using this product (triple with most. and #2 toner). Wonders! Its been only 3 weeks and I received so many compliments over my skin. My skin is toned, radiant and incrediably soft. I&#x27;d absolutely recommend this three products together. Its worth the money you pay.</li>
    <li> each time i try another soap, i always come to the conclusion the clinique liquid soap is the best. my face is clean and not dry.t really help my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for 14 years almost without interruption. Whenever I do try something different, it is just never as good for my sensitive combination skin. If you have been searching for a fairly light, mild face wash that keeps skin clear and consistent, this is the perfect product for you.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff</li>
    <li> I recently Hit the Clinique counter in order to graduate from drug store cosmetics to big girl cosmetics.  A recent change in my life has called for a need for me to be more polished and sophisticated.  And polished I am with Clinique&#x27;s skin care regime.  This facial soap is so mild, but so deep cleansing, you will feel clean, cool and refreshed once you&#x27;ve used this product.  Not to mention that this is such a thorough cleanser that you shouldn&#x27;t have to rinse and repeat, saving time.  It has a mild, almost neutral scent.</li>
    <li> i have combination oily T-zone/dry cheeks and this works really well for me. it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight or dry, however i almost always follow up with a moisturizer before i go to bed. My husband who usually never strays from his Cetaphil even uses it and likes it&lt;br /&gt;This product can be purchased cheaper at Sephora($16) - so the 4 starts doesn&#x27;t go to the product, it goes to amazon</li>
    <li> It cleans your face without that greasy or burny feeling.</li>
    <li> You can buy this for a LOT cheaper on Clinique&#x27;s website, FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone through SO many face washes in my life and it never got better. I would use the strongest of the strong (PanOxyl) and it just kept any acne at bay. I usually stayed away from brands like this bc I never had the money, nor desire to believe it worked since the strong OTC face washes didn&#x27;t work that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently bought the entire set (face wash, toner, and moisturizer); I don&#x27;t like applying too much product to my face, so I soon skipped the second and third steps to this cleansing system and would just stick with the face wash.  I used the face wash with a electric facial scrub brush (ULTA brand) and in a few washes my skin improved, and has stayed improved since using it. I can go a day without washing my face and go back to using the product and my face continues to look good.  I&#x27;ve misplaced this a time or two and have had to use something I could find, but alas, my face went to crap. Found my Clinique face wash and started using it again and my face went back to being better.</li>
    <li> Out of all the products I have tried, this was the best. I can see instant improvement and washes of smoothly. Definitely will use in my future for a long time.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this. It really did clear up her face in a few uses.</li>
    <li> This is one of the products on my new allergy safe list I got from The Mayo Clinic.  After using it my face feels clean and fresh, without feeling any unwanted residue.  However, it&#x27;s not effective at removing mascara, so I had to purchase another product.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this cleanser again after several years of using other things.  I was happy to find it on Amazon.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this soap it works easily, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and doesn&#x27;t leave residue! I love this soap and will buy it again- I have sensitive skin and this soap has been one of the only facials soaps I&#x27;ve bought, which doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry and cracked.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it is nice to be able to find it here and not have to deal with the snooty Dillard&#x27;s store employees.</li>
    <li> When I first bought it, I loved it but after a month it dried out my skin and if felt horrible, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for dry/sensitive skin, it would work best for people with oily skin.</li>
    <li> I did not like that it didn&#x27;t come in a box.</li>
    <li> Great item. must buy.</li>
    <li> mom has used it since it came out, what a joy to be able to get a 93 year old mom in a small town a big time product.</li>
    <li> clinique is just a great product</li>
    <li> I got it within three days, started washing in combo with 2 and 3.  LOVE IT!!!! Totally worth the money no more breakouts, softer skin, even tone.  I&#x27;m never going back.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin very opaque and takes away all the glow from it. Had to throw this in the trash.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing liquid facial soup.  Doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out or makes it irritated like many cleansing facial products.  Thank you CLINIQUE!</li>
    <li> My skin was a mess until I started using this. I am in my early 40&#x27;s and have always had problems with certain soaps. I have Seborrheic dermatitis  and sometimes get pimples. This has completely cleared my skin up. It cleans it without drying it out and it makes it so soft. I have been using it for over a year and will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I used to use the Acne Solutions body bar and wanted to try the liquid soap. Love it, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and prevents break outs. Started my 13 yr old with it also and she sees a definite improvement over the Proactiv she was using.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using Clinique&#x27;s mild facial soap. It&#x27;s gentle on my skin but gets it really clean. Many times, when using a facial cleaner, I have to use an exfoliator on top of the cleanser to make my face feel like it&#x27;s been cleaned, not with this soap though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is gentle on my face and doesn&#x27;t give it the harsh red tones that cleaners with peroxicde do. The only problem I have is that I tend to get dry patches on my face after using this cleaner. However I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s this cleaner in particular but just how my skin is. I use the Dramatically Different Moisturizer with it and my skin feels wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed, as some other reviewers have, that the pump lets out more soap thatn you need to use. So I use about a half of a pump instead of a full pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for a great price. The BEST time to buy this product is when they are doing their giveaway packages, then you get to try some of their other products.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, im a redhead, and this is a amazing product! Very gentle and a bottle lasts me three months! You only need a little every day! The cream also. Before I used to use simple products and was buying a bottle a month. The cream lasts me 6 months using everyday so more cost effective! I&#x27;m converted :))</li>
    <li> It is excellent, and I really love it. It is the same as the picture, and the quality is so nice.</li>
    <li> very good and last long</li>
    <li> I have been using this product faithfully for the past few months and my skin is smoother and I have been getting far fewer breakouts.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> When I use this one, my face feels burning</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my cosmetologist. Its works amazing and a must buy.. Gives a gentle lather and leaves the skin supple without leaving it dry.</li>
    <li> I have very problematic skin so I&#x27;m always trying out new products in search of beautiful skin.  My sister-in-law recommended Clinique&#x27;s line of skin care products, so I decided since I&#x27;d tried everything else, I&#x27;d give this one a shot too!  I have been so pleased with the results.  A lot of products can feel really harsh on my skin, but this one is nice and mild.  I feel refreshed after using it and the results are fantastic!  After about a month of using it, my breakouts are almost non-existant and I have fresh looking skin.  This is a great face wash and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!  They make different kinds for each individual skin type, so make sure you get the right one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beauty secrets:  Absolue SPF15 by Lancome, Skin Revitalizer by Relastin, and Melon Daiquiri Lip Shine by Philosophy</li>
    <li> The item was shipped in a an envelope which wasn&#x27;t enough to protect the fragile pump. The top broke off. I thought it&#x27;d be alright but it&#x27;s very messy to have to open and pour. I&#x27;m love the product but upset I didn&#x27;t send it back.</li>
    <li> Great product by Clinique, but my order came with the top just enough unscrewed to leak during shipping, and then leaked when I took it out of the box. Frustrating, when the stuff is so expensive!</li>
    <li> I love Clinque soap - I&#x27;ve used it for about 20 years my face doesn&#x27;t break out.  I&#x27;m not sure if the pricing is better on Amazon than in the stores, but this way it gets delivered to my door.</li>
    <li> Pro- I love this face wash because it removes all of my makeup. When I use my toner afterwards there isn&#x27;t a whole face of makeup on the cotton ball like with some cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con- the pump keeps getting stuck, which is frustrating.</li>
    <li> Clinique&#x27;s Mild Liquid Facial Soap is perfect for normal (dry-combination by Clinique&#x27;s definition) skin.  It&#x27;s best used in the whole 3-Step setup, but even used alone it&#x27;s okay.  Basically, this soap is not a makeup remover, but it will leave the skin feeling squeaky clean.  Use your regular makeup remover, then add 1-2 pumps of the facial soap to the palm of your hand.  Lightly lather in your hands and then apply to your face.  It has a light amount of suds and feels super soft on the surface of the skin.  While not drying, you still need to use a moisturizer after washing your face with this soap, just to replenish the oil/water balance to your skin.  Also, it&#x27;s fragrance-free!  Of course there&#x27;s a light smell to it, but it&#x27;s inoffensive and didn&#x27;t flare my ridiculous allergies at all.</li>
    <li> Hello, good morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow responses to questions from the satisfaction survey, I chose 3 stars because I&#x27;m using just 15 days. I&#x27;m enjoying the product and indicate to all people who like to treat the skin.</li>
    <li> From personal experience, this facial soap has been ideal for keeping my face clean and fighting acne from sweating. It is fairly expensive in comparison to regular bar soap and body wash, but I got what I paid for here.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE HAS BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS AND SHE CONVINCED ME TO TRY AND I CAN SAY I AM GLAD I DID IT CLEANS SO WELL AND THERES NO FRAGRANCE DO IT REALLY IS A UNISEX PRODUCT AND IT LEFT MY FACE CLEAN AND SOFT AND NOT DRY LIKE OTHERS, I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> i love it. it is wonderfull. it is my favorite. i use it every day. it is excelllent. i recommend it</li>
    <li> So mild and perfect for my skin type - love it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love ALL Clinique products, but this is one of the best.  It&#x27;s very mild and leaves the skin feeling smooth and soft.  It has a slight scent that is very pleasant and subtle.  Also, it lasts a long time, so the price may seem high compared to other similar products on the market, but, in the end, I think it isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever - I only use Clinique and i love my skin!</li>
    <li> I sometimes will go without wearing makeup, when I do that I will turn to my Clinique mild soap because it is great for keeping my skin clean without over drying.&lt;br /&gt;If you wear a full face of makeup (concealer, foundation, powder) you might want to go for a stronger soap.&lt;br /&gt;My husband borrows this face wash from time to time, it gives him a noticeable clean glow.&lt;br /&gt;This is a neutral smelling cleanser, perfect for me since I do not care for the perfumed soaps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m VERY picky with my face, face wash, and how I wash my face. With that being said, after only one use of this face wash, I noticed my skin felt so much softer. I feel like I so blotchy without my foundation, but today, I went natural today and didn&#x27;t really look blotchy.  I bought the matching face lotion today as well because what is a face wash without a great moisturizer? I can&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> I have used Clinique mild face wash for years and love it.  Even though this is the mild face wash, I find that it always leaves my face clean and soft not tight and drawn.  I feel that it is a really fine product.</li>
    <li> Living in the southwest, I already have dry skin. I don&#x27;t need a cleanser that adds to it. Clinique&#x27;s Cleanser is perfect for my skin type. It is mild, yet totally cleans my makeup and any mascara residue that my mascara remover missed. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and planned to continue.It&#x27;s a great value and a great product!</li>
    <li> I use this once a day most days and my face looks great. I use a tiny bit so this size of bottle  lasts me about 2 years or so.</li>
    <li> My wife love it this product</li>
    <li> The item came with no box (making me question its authenticity) and the cap was open.  There was soap all over the inside and there&#x27;s only 3/4 of the soap left in the bottle.  I&#x27;m going to figure out how to return it now.</li>
    <li> Definitely my favorite face soap</li>
    <li> The Product I received was exactly what I expected! It&#x27;s exactly what I bought At Macy&#x27;s but cheaper! I will always go trough amazon for Clinique products instead of Macy&#x27;s. I&#x27;m completely satisfied!</li>
    <li> I agree that it makes your (or my anyway) skin feel a bit dry but the reason I say it&#x27;s worth it is because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. it&#x27;s clinique.  The best skin care products I&#x27;ve been able to find over the years, for my skin anyway, which is combination if not leaning toward dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s gentle enough without being too gentle and what I mean by that is that if you went any softer, your face wouldn&#x27;t feel like it was getting cleaned - you&#x27;d feel like you were cleaning it with a lotion, e.g. as skin feels when cleaning with Cetaphil liquid soap.  All you need to do is put on your face lotion and/or cream when you get out of the shower and you&#x27;re good to go.  At times I forget to put on lotion and I do notice my skin feeling a tiny bit tight but within 20 minutes or so that feeling is gone.  I&#x27;ve also used \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; skin cleaning products that have herbs and or fruits in the products and they - each and every time - make my skin burn a little and sometimes even turn a little red.  My skin&#x27;s very sensitive.  Clinique doesn&#x27;t do that to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. For years I used the clinique soap in the bar form before this came out but I was always SO annoyed they were taking so long to come out with a liquid soap which would be so much easier to use.  Eventually I stopped buying the bars and kept trying different brand name liquid soaps but to no avail.  I was thrilled when Clinique finally gave us this quick dispenser pump soap cause it doesn&#x27;t get soggy in the shower or dirty from dirty hands (potentially)/cross contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: you only need a very, very little.  I usually put a tiny bit in my hands and then put a whole lot of water on my hands until the suds are pretty thinned out before putting it on my face.  VERY LITTLE needed - it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser it does a great job in removing dirt off your face that you think you washed it off good with other cleansers two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Really good product, work in my type of skin an is verry durable. I realle recomended!&lt;br /&gt;Clinique is one of my fav!</li>
    <li> Cleans your face without drying.</li>
    <li> I have used for years</li>
    <li> We are long term users of this product it is an excellent product. It was delivered timely and it is greatly appreciated among our personal care products. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Will buy again.  Makes skin feel and look great.</li>
    <li> The best portion of the Clinique 3-step bundle. I don&#x27;t use Clinique&#x27;s clarifying or moisturing lotion (I use Proactiv instead), but this face wash is awesome!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! SUPER FAST DELIVERY! THANKS!</li>
    <li> es un jab&amp;oacute;n espectacular para usarlo a diario, me retira todas las impurezas y me deja la piel muy suave la uso antes de hidratarme la piel del cutis</li>
    <li> Clinique mild facial soap is great for very sensitive skin. I use a peas size amount and mixed with a little water it lathers up and rinses clean!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face wash! It has a light scent and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth. A little goes a long way so the bottle lasts awhile. I like that you can turn the nozzle to lock it so when you travel no spill or mess from the pump!</li>
    <li> send as ordered like product</li>
    <li> 65+ - love this mild soap, it does a great job cleaning and removing make-up without stripping my skin.</li>
    <li> excelent product, I am very happy with this buy. I recomended a lot of a this shop. Thanks you so much</li>
    <li> I like the liquid facial soap v bar.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and find it easy to use.</li>
    <li> I got this for my pre-teen daughter.  It&#x27;s very mild and gentle.  I like the pump because it&#x27;s easy for her to dispense without wasting tons of the soap.</li>
    <li> EXCELENTE MUCHAS GRACIAS ;)</li>
    <li> Have sensitive dry/combo skin and have used this product for a few years. Works very very well. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have always had some degree of acne and combination, oily skin and this cleanser is the only one I have ever used that has been able to even out my skin and reduce breakouts. Every other facewash I have used cleans fine, I suppose, but does nothing to really improve the appearance of my skin over time. Somehow it manages to clean and dry out my oily T-zone area while still being gentle elsewhere. Completely worth the price, I will never use another cleanser. Also, one large bottle easily lasts 6 months to a year, even with everyday use. Each time, I only use maybe half a pump.</li>
    <li> I like the way it cleans my face and makes my pores smaller.</li>
    <li> great buy on this big bottle of face wash.  it is mild...but tough enough to get my makeup off.  it will lasts forever too.</li>
    <li> I use this morning and night and then use the clarifying cleaner and my face has never felt so clean and soft. I love Clinique! Best liquid face soap ever! Highly recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use everyday while I&#x27;m in the shower and I feel like when I use a facial mask this product prepares my face for the mask to absorb into my face. Anyways love the product but when using this try not to get this in your eyes. IT HURTS</li>
    <li> Love this product, love it being shipped straight to my door! No need to use my gas and car or get in traffic to get product I love, what could be better?</li>
    <li> Not a good product for me.  should have tried samples in the store.</li>
    <li> Clear up make-up at a time.</li>
    <li> This facial soap is the best. Works fantastically well, Clinique is an amazing product all around and worth the expense.</li>
    <li> Really love this face soap. Been using it for a long time.</li>
    <li> Clinique just can&#x27;t be topped for a mild product that cleans your skin. I have used it for ages, have gone to other companies only to go back to Clinique cleanser.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for last 2 yrs ever since my friend introduce it to me. Yes I agree that is mild and would not remove all your make up but it is mild to the skin and will not dry it .</li>
    <li> I have spent most of my life fighting acne.  Since starting the 3 step Clinique program my face is totally cleared up.  I can&#x27;t recommend these products enough!</li>
    <li> I have always like Clinique products and this is not the exception. I would totally recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> This soap leaves my face soft and humected. This is a great product for a great price. The use of this product in combination whit the other two steps of the clinique treatment ensures a better result for your skin face. Totally recommended</li>
    <li> I just love this soap.  It removes make up so quickly and gently.  My skin feels very good after use and this purchase was a re-order for me of this product which I plan to continue using.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Totally changed my complexion very quickly when using it several years ago. I&#x27;ve tried other products to see if they&#x27;d help, but I don&#x27;t get the same results.  Keeps my face relatively clear, but I don&#x27;t use the toner.  The gel lotion is nice to have as well but my skin is still shiny after.</li>
    <li> The bottle arrived open to my country apparently because of a problem with the cap. At that time, I haven&#x27;t removed the plastic which it was wrapped up. It&#x27;s a good product, but I lost some of this while I was travelling.</li>
