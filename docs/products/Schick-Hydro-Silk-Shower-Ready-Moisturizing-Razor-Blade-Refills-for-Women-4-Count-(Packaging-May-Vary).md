<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For a while these were working okay. They didn&#x27;t give the smoothest cut, but it was okay. And then I got ingrown hairs on my armpit.</li>
    <li> These refills are much cheaper to buy on Amazon than my local Target. The moisture beads on the razors are very hydrating therefore only minimal shaving cream is needed until the moisture beads run out. Would recommend to others, I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> When I opened the cartridge, it looked as though the while dots of moisturizer had flaked off into the casing. So I deduce that it&#x27;s been awhile since this set of razor heads were manufactured. After the first shave, both my thighs erupted with red bumps that feel like cuts, but don&#x27;t bleed. I&#x27;ve used the regular schick hydro 5-blade razor and thought I&#x27;d try the sensitive care version. I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this before, so neither the razor&#x27;s design nor my skin are the problem; it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;sensitive care&amp;#34; aspect. I would definitely NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The gel part started hanging after a single use. Otherwise a good one.</li>
    <li> Leaves legs feeling smooth. very easy and smooth shave. I do feel the extra &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; leaks out over a few showers in a gloppy mess but it doesn&#x27;t seem to hinder the shave.</li>
    <li> Great clean shave, no cuts.  Haven&#x27;t had to change the blade in months!  Great price too!</li>
    <li> Love, love this razor blade. Smooth and easy to use, no cuts. This invention is wonderful. The aloe that comes out as you&#x27;re shaving is pretty freaking awesome. Shipping was fast too.</li>
    <li> This really works it&#x27;s smooth it doesn&#x27;t hurt or burn or even leave razor bumps the reason I gave it to 4 stars because it&#x27;s way to expensive for just 4 razor refills ridiculous but just because it&#x27;s a good product doesn&#x27;t mean it has to be $13.00 for 4 blades . Highly recommend if you have dry or very sensitive skin it also works better with skinamate shaving gel</li>
    <li> I used to shave with the Venus razors, and would cut myself all the time. That hasn&#x27;t happened at all since I started using the Schick Hydro about 6 months ago. I will never go back to that other brand!</li>
    <li> Love tihis product! A Must for super sensitive skin! I will never use another razor! You have to try it to believe it!</li>
    <li> Generally, I hate shaving my legs. I&#x27;m a depilatory girl all the way. This razor has changed my mind. I&#x27;m inept but I&#x27;m yet to cut myself with this one after three months of use. The cartridges are long lasting. If you&#x27;ve got to shave, this makes it bearable. I got my first Schick Hydro from BzzAgent for free to try. I used those cartridges up and I&#x27;m still with it.</li>
    <li> This razor has 5 blades that give you such a smooth shave and great moisturizing. It leaves your legs feeling so soft even after the shower! The blades turn and form to whatever your shaving without any razor burn. I would recommend this razor to anyone and especially anyone with sensitive skin! #BzzAgent #GotItFree</li>
    <li> These are so easy to change out.  Just click and you are ready to go.  I would definitely purchase this in the future.</li>
    <li> Got the razor and the refill free from buzz agent I just love how it shaves. The cartridges are big and have alot of moisture to my legs when I shave. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I really love this! Even on my sensitive skin, it doesn&#x27;t cut/nick me. They last as long as other replaceable heads but work better in my opinion. Price is equivalent to other name brands as well.</li>
    <li> . Even though it is a little expencive it is worth it. The best shave and no irritation. I will but this again</li>
    <li> I received this razor/refills as a part of a BzzCampaign. I was very pleased with the way it made my skin feel. i dry shave often, and actually did not experience the rash or redness. I recommend this product to people that i talk to</li>
    <li> I received the razor and this razor blade refill from Bzzagent for free to try. I have mildly sensitive skin but this razor did not irritate my skin at all!&lt;br /&gt;It left my skin feeling smooth and clean. Definitely give it a try!</li>
    <li> This is the best shave you will ever get.Super close shave leaving skin feeling the smoothest ever. Safe for sensitive skin. You will not need to shave as much.There isn&#x27;t a down side to this razor.Try this razor and you will never use any other.</li>
    <li> a little expensive but these are the best razors i have ever used i love them and with coupons and price match it&#x27;s not that bad</li>
    <li> I have been using the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor  since I received it in a trial from bzzagent.com.  I was very pleased with the results and have since then purchased the refill razor blades a few times. I am amazed that the 5 blades can get such a close shave without any nicks or cuts. The hypoallergenic serum on the cartridge helps the blades glide effortlessly across my skin and provides added moisture.  I used the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor during the winter months and my skin was dry and in need of moisture.  These blades have visibly improved my skin and I continue to use them. I look forward to the weather warming up so I can show off my smooth, healthy legs.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor for sensitive skin. I received it free as a Bzz Agent and will continue to use it. Perfect razor for smooth skin.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using this razor that I received as part of a BzzCampaign.  Being able to get a close shave that lasts is important to me.  I found that these blades really glide great and are able to smoothly go over my uneven skin.  I never worried about getting any knicks.</li>
    <li> I received this razor with 2 refill cartridges for free from BzzAgent as part of a campaign. I typically used men&#x27;s disposables and refills in the past, as I never really got an added benefit to the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; attached to women&#x27;s razors. This was such a different story. The cartridge has the perfect amount of added smoothness, and I can use it without shaving cream and not have any trouble with my sensitive skin. Definitely my new razor!</li>
    <li> I received this razor and cartridge as part of a BuzzAgent Campaign and fell in love.  I normally settle for shaving cream and disposable razors, and since using this razor I have changed.  The quality of the blades last longer and the moisturizing strip keep my legs smooth without irritation.  Definitely see the value in investing in Schick Hydro.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you want a smooth, long lasting shave, try this product.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate skin and leaves legs feeling hydrated. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I always thought all razors were the same and shave numbs were something I just had to live with if I shaved my legs to close togather, like 2 days in a row! Not with this razor. I used it and it was good, then I used my old razor once. And realized just how good this razor is! Not irritated skin or shave bumps on my legs! So glad I got this as a free sample for BzzAgent!! This is my razor of choice now!!</li>
    <li> This razor works great. I get sure a close shave and with no irritation. I even use it on my Husband&#x27;s head - One of the best shaves he has ever had. Never going back to my old disposable razors</li>
    <li> I got to try the Schick sensative care as part of a BzzCampaign through BzzAgent.  This has to be one of the greatest refillalbe razors.  No razor burn, or dry skin and it cuts through hair like butter. Love! Must have!</li>
    <li> these are my favorite</li>
    <li> Been using these for years. Very happy with them. Long lasting.</li>
    <li> These razors are amaaaaazzing!  I love them so much.  They have five super fine blades, and they flex up and down and from side to side, so you can run over those ankles and knees, and...other delicate areas...really fast and easy.  I have been using this razor for probably about a year now, and I have never knicked or cut myself.  The serum on the top and the bottom of the razor is no joke either.  It is so gooey and silky and thick.  Sometimes, during your first couple of shaves, it is so thick that you can&#x27;t even tell if you&#x27;re actually cutting the hairs on your legs.  And it lasts for a long time too.  Not like those other razors with one moisturizing strip at the top that rubs off after about a week.  My legs feel so freaking smooth after I shave with these razors.  Usually when I shave, I am hopping out of the shower already running for the lotion, because my legs get so itchy from shaving.  But with these razors, I can actually take my time getting out and drying off, because the serum is super moisturizing. So if I&#x27;m not getting the aweful razor burn on my legs anymore, imagine what it does for other areas! The price listed here on Amazon is great too.  They were $20 and over at some stores I was looking for them!</li>
    <li> I received this razor/cartridge as part of a BzzCampaign, and I absolutely fell in love with it!! I was having a very serious, and embarrassing issue with razor bumps, but using this razor has seemed to cure that problem. My skin is very smooth and bump free now. I need this razor always in my life- its really that good!</li>
    <li> I received a refill for this razor through Buzz Agent along with a razor.  These refills last longer than any other razor refills I have used.</li>
    <li> Long lasting &amp; great for sensitive skin! Reasonable price too! Because they last longer then most razor refills, you have to refill less!</li>
    <li> My skin was left feeling silky smooth. Very easy to change the blade. We&#x27;ll worth the price. Love it lots!</li>
    <li> will definately be buying the replacements very soon, best blades for woman on the market as far as i am concerened</li>
    <li> Clearly a big fan of this product. will be using it more often. 5 blade technology is amazing and the grip on the razor is excellent.</li>
    <li> I received these as part of a Bzz Agent campaign.  I am thrilled with the razor.  I love the moisture strip as it is effective but not too slimy.  I only wish the blades lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Best razor ever! My skin is silky smooth, I don&#x27;t have a rash and I get a really close shave! GET IT NOW! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I received the razor and blades as a bzzagent.  I have sensitive skin and I love this razor.  Only down side is if you use in a really hot shower or bath it gets sticky or if you leave it blade side down on the side of the tub it will leak and get gunky. Otherwise it is great.  My legs don&#x27;t feel dried out and itchy afterwards.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite razor and refills! I will not use anything else again! Awesome moisturizing strips and thick head for better coverage!</li>
    <li> Love these razors , best smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time , won&#x27;t be using cheap disposable razors ever again</li>
    <li> I received this razor through BzzCampaign to try. I have used the Intuition for years. Well, no more. I get a really close shave with this razor and do not break out in unsightly bumps anymore. The handle fits in my hand great and it as not as bulky as the Intuition was. Great razor!</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Sensitive Razor complements of a BzzCampaign and I am SO happy I was able to try this free sample! I have never been able to get an extremely close shave without the use of shave gel and without have razor burn due to my sensitive skin. I am happy that Schick Hydro Sensitive Razor accomplished that and more! I now have the closest shave I have ever gotten, did not need to use shave gel or lotion afterwards and after 3 days my legs are STILL smooth and silky! I love this product and will continue to buy the refill cartridges!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you BzzAgent and Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive for a great product!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. I received it as part of my buzz campaign and it was just amazing.vit was soft and smooth on my skin. I felt like I didnt even need to mousturize after</li>
    <li> My first impression with the razor was the design. I love the design of the razor head. The head is equipped with two strips of lotion, which are activated when you put the razor under water. The lotion strips are my favorite part of the razor because it makes the shave much easier because it glides smoothly on my skin and leaves my skin feeling soft after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I used the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Care Razor, I used a disposable Bic razor. The Bic razor does not even compare with the Schick razor in performance, speed, and design. With the Bic razor, I was finding myself going over the shaving area multiple times to get a close shave. However, with the Schick razor, it only takes ONE sweep to get a close shave. With my Bic razor, I always had ingrown hairs even if I exfoliated. Now with the Schick razor, my ingrown hairs have been minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that after using it for a week, the lotion pads run out fairly quickly. This is the only bad thing I have discovered with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am loving using the Schick razor and plan to be using it for a long time. It’s the best razor I have ever used! I definitely recommend trying it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received this item for review purposes from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> Best blades every!  They cut super smooth and I don&#x27;t worry about nicks.  I would not ever go back to my old razot</li>
    <li> I love refill blades because it cuts down on throwing away an entire disposable razor.  These blades are easy to replace and compact to store.  The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because I think all refill blades are way over priced, but aside from that, I love them.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from part of a BzzCampaign and was very impressed by the smooth shave and how it didn&#x27;t seem to irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I received this free to try from bzzagent, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. I love the way my skin feels after using this razor, smooth and silky! I started using this to test it out but I have since replaced my previous razor. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get much easier than this! I love my Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor with refillable razor blades; they are easy to change and feel great on my sensitive skin! Thanks to Bzz Agent,  I was lucky enough to try it for FREE!!</li>
    <li> I too received the original razor as a part of a BzzCampaign and it has become my shower staple! I have been looking for a razor that gave a smooth, close, razor-bump free shave and I finally found it. Its a must have. Great for legs, underarms and bikini. TRY IT!!</li>
    <li> I love this razor! It is the only razor I will buy for myself and my daughter. I have really sensitive skin and it works great. It leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth. Great job Schick!!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor from bzzagent and want to report that it is the best razor ever.  These refills are by far the most awesome deal as they last for months and the lotion strip lasts just as long.  The razor is ergonomically made and the head doesn&#x27;t pop off very easily if bumped onto the floor.  The price is well worth it and I have to say it far surpasses any other razor I have ever tried.  These are worth the money!</li>
    <li> I was privileged enough to be a part of the Schick Hydro Silk Razor BzzCampaign recently and was happy to try this out. I have very dry, irritated skin when it comes to shaving. I was very skeptical at first, but once I tried it and saw that my skin was not irritated, red or dry after using the sensitive razor, I was ecstatic! This was much more then what I thought it was going to be after trying so many different types of ‘sensitive’ razors out there. I definitely recommend this product to any one and because of how well this worked! I wish the refills weren’t so pricy but since I got into couponing, I’ve been finding great deals and started stocking up.</li>
    <li> I love this razor and the cartridges that go with it. Excellent for super sensitive skin like mine. Highly recomended!</li>
    <li> I got to try the Schick Hydro silk Sensitive care razor for free during a bzzcampaign for bzzagent and this is now the only brand I buy. These razor cartridges last for such a long time and I shave often. The quality far exceeds my expectations. The moisturizing serum is great for sensitive skin and allows the blades to glide so smoothly over your skin. No more nicks or cuts!!! I seriously have never found a better razor yet and my favorite part is hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the back of the razor head like some other brands. Give it a quick rinse and the razor is as clean as it was in the beginning. Great quality and great on sensitive skin. This razor and the refill cartridges are a must buy!</li>
    <li> These are the best razor heads I&#x27;ve ever used.  I got them as a BZZ agent so I could try it and leave feedback.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use another brand of razor refills ever.  They&#x27;re so good with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I tried this razor as part of a BzzAgent campaign product that I received. I found that it worked well for my sensitive skin. No red bumps or shave marks when I used it. I found it just a little difficult to use for the more delicate bikini area though. I&#x27;d highly recommend the razor, the quality is good and it&#x27;s good for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> These are the only blades I&#x27;ve found that give me a close, LASTING shave without irritating my skin. My skin is crazy sensitive, but these razor blades are gentle enough even for my skin, while still giving a close shave that lasts for days after shaving. They stay sharp longer than most other blades I&#x27;ve tried, and the cartridge setup makes it easy to replace them on the razor itself. I tested them a little while back as part of a BzzCampaign for BzzAgent and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to my old razors.</li>
    <li> I received the razor with one refill cartridge as part of a BzzAgent campaign and I fell in love with the razor.  The cartridges have the moisturizing beads that help prevent irritation and it really works.  I have incredibly sensitive skin and I get less bumps when I use this razor and cartridge.</li>
    <li> I loved these razors as I have sensitive skin and these provide me that extra close shave without the nicks and cuts. They are awesome!</li>
    <li> I received the original razor as a part of a BzzCampaign. I love how simple and easy it is to attach the refill to the razor. Especially the packet in individual white pearls that release a heavenly scent! The amount of refills that come in the the packaging is just right.</li>
    <li> Got to try these razors as part of  a Bzz Campaign. Even though I got to try them for free, I am now buying them and have converted from anither brand. The razor pivots much better than other brands, and when you&#x27;re trying to shave over the bony part of your knee, the last thing you want to do is take a layer off skin with your razor. I have not cut myself once with these and I don&#x27;t shave any differently than before.</li>
    <li> I recieved the hydro silk sensitive razor and cartridges by Schick from bzzagent to try out and then give a review. I was not compensated at all ( only received the item itself to try) and these are my own words &amp; my own personal opinion. When I first received it I thought &amp;#34;great, I need a new razor anyway&amp;#34;. I thought it would work fine and that it would be just like all the other razors like this. I was wrong! This razor &amp; cartridges are the only ones I will now buy. It gave me the closest shave ever and left  my legs silky smooth. I used the razor the day before leaving for a 10 day vacation. I also packed it &amp; took it with me expecting to need to use it again. I did not have to re-shave my legs even one time during those 10 days b/c the didn&#x27;t need it. My husband was very curious after seeing my results that he also tried the razor and he LOVES it. He went and bought his own &amp; now we both have one. I know the cartridge refills are not the cheapest you can buy but the old saying is true &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;. They last longer than other cartridges I have tried, therefore actually saving money. I will not buy any other type or brand now. We are hooked on these. Worth the money for sure.</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Refill Razor Blades are long lasting a great value and great price and don&#x27;t dry out your skin. Most razors don&#x27;t have all of that in one! What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> I received refills for the razor from BzzAgent to review. They are great for sensitive, dry skin, and are very easy to use. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I hate to yell, but when I say &amp;#34;BUY THIS RAZOR&amp;#34; I mean, seriously, do yourself a favor and buy the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor, like TODAY. I received a sample through BzzAgent, and I fell in love with it the first time I used it. I have very sensitive skin, so I have to be careful what razors I use, and it was nice knowing I didn&#x27;t have to worry over whether this razor would make my skin look like that of a red, scaly lizard (like other razors have in the past). And I can go several days in between shaving because it&#x27;s a close shave that lasts a long time, and it also leaves your skin feeling oh so smooth and sexy. (Yes, my husband loved it too. *wink*) So yeah, I have to yell ... BUY THIS RAZOR!!!!</li>
    <li> I received the razor and cartridges for free from #bzzagent and its the best razor I have ever used and the cartridge lasts a long time so you will save money :)</li>
    <li> I received this razor/refills as a part of a BzzCampaign to try and then review.  I absolutely LOVE it!  It gives me a nice close, shave with no razor bumps or redness.  I have sensitive skin so that is important to me.  I also like how it has its own moisturizer so that if you don&#x27;t have enough shaving cream in one spot you don&#x27;t have to worry!</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing I received it as part of a bzz campaign and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a close shave with no irritation or bumps!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this razor blade to anyone looking for a smooth shave on sensitive skin.  Never will I ever go back to cheap disposable razors.  It was smooth gliding across my skin, didn&#x27;t leave anything behind and conditioned my skin.</li>
    <li> My legs are always looking good, without all the nicks and cuts of other razors. Smooth sailing from here! No other razor would i use again!</li>
    <li> I got this a part of a Bzzagent campaign and it&#x27;s by far the best razor I have Ever used. I have sensitive skin and this leaves no cuts or irritation</li>
    <li> This gives a close shave and is easy to change out. I feel it last a long time. I received this during a Buzz campaign.</li>
    <li> I used the Venus for YEARS - and this is now my new favorite!! I love these! Im ready for summer!&lt;br /&gt;I received the original razor as a part of a BzzCampaign</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I received it as part of a BzzCampaign (for free) but have continued to purchase them. It gives me a close shave without irritating my sensitive skin. This is a MUST HAVE for anyone with dry, irritated skin!!</li>
    <li> I got it free on Bzzagent and was overall pleased with the blades. They cut similar to a mans razor which was good for my corse hair. Moisture could have been more. But overall good product.</li>
    <li> Love this razor! I feel like it does a fantastic job at giving me a smooth, close shave without hurting my sensitive skin? I love the moisture activated beads that help the shave to be more smooth, but it runs out quickly! I will definitely plan to purchase these again!</li>
    <li> These cartridges are really amazing at giving an ultra smooth, super close shape. The only other razors I&#x27;ve used that accomplished this were men&#x27;s razors, which can sometimes be a bit harsh on the skin. I have sensitive skin and, although at first there was a bit of an adjustment where my skin was a little irritated, this razor has been great. I am glad I gave it the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONE complaint would be that if you leave it razor side down, the gel stuff that&#x27;s built in to help soothe and make the shave better will ooze out and get hard. So I think it&#x27;s worth knowing that, so you can avoid it.</li>
    <li> I am a convert. Cannot see why I would ever switch back to disposables. Got a free sample from Bzz Agent and have been experiencing the closest shaves I have ever had. Awesome</li>
    <li> This razor was so smooth, I had to check 3 different times to make sure I was actually shaving!  The shave was smooth and close and stubble did not grow back for 2 days!  This is huge for me since I see stubble the very next day!  I will never use another razor again....I am a customer for LIFE!</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing! I have bought the refills several times cause I will never use another razor again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my razor from BzzAgent and #GotItFree too! Be sure you buy the right razor when buying these razor refills cause the actual razor itself has a great handle and storage unit too! Here is a quick link for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00HT6E2JI/ref&#x3D;redir_mdp_mobile?ref_&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_product_top&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin like I do then you must buy and use this razor it will change you life! It changed mine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a huge Schick fan, but this razor is better than ones I&#x27;ve used in the past. It is very sharp and even with shaving lotion I still ended up with nicks on my legs, but it does give a nice smooth shave. The razors last a long time and stay sharp. If you&#x27;re in the market for a new razor, you may like this one. I think the thing I like most about this razor is the fact that I can keep the same blade for quite a few shaves before having to replace, unlike others I&#x27;ve used before. My only complaint is that the Noxzema razor I usually use never cuts me, so that really is my only complaint.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Bzzagent.com I was able to receive this razor and a refill for free. If you&#x27;ve never heard of it you should check it out!</li>
    <li> Great razor and great quality.  The blade actually last for more then one use and the strips kept me from getting razor burn.</li>
    <li> I got these disposable blades in a campaign on a site called bzzagent.They work quite well.i got a very smooth shave using these.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of my bzz campaign and love them! These are the only razors I will use! I no longer have razor burn and no more razor Knicks! I will never use another razor again!</li>
    <li> I love these blades. I am able to get a really close shave without the usual irritation I get from a razor. I would recommend this razor to anyone. There are a lot of products that claim to be helpful for sensitive skin but this is the only one I&#x27;ve seen that actually backs it up.</li>
    <li> I received my razor as part of a BzzCampaign, and have continued to purchase the refills. I have very dry, sensitive skin and was so excited that there was finally a women&#x27;s razor aimed at this specific need.  I&#x27;ve always found men&#x27;s razors to be better for my skin.  This is, by far, the BEST razor I&#x27;ve ever used! Not only does it keep my skin moisturized, but it&#x27;s so effective I only have to shave about once a week instead of every few days! As a working mom, any extra time I get is valuable, but it&#x27;s especially valuable when it keeps my skin so soft! I feel that the refills are a bit expensive, but for the length of time they last and how great they work, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing, i received through a buzz campaign and it was above all other razors i have used before.  These cartridges have a moisture strip that leaves legs feeling silky all day long.</li>
    <li> This blades glides smoothly and evenly, no nicks, or shaving bumps either! No skin irritation at all, My New FAV Razor! Decent price on them too!</li>
    <li> I loved this razor, and the best part was trying it all free from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;The refills last a good while, and they don&#x27;t dull too easy. I would use these again!&lt;br /&gt;I love the moisture they leave, I&#x27;ll always had dry skin and these make my legs feel great.</li>
    <li> I was able to try out the Schick Hydro Silk Razor using the BzzCampaign as a BzzAgent and I have been hooked ever since. It leaves my legs smooth and I have no issues with any bumps, razor burn or rashes from shaving. It is a life savor for my legs and under arms. I will not use anything else at this point. It has made me a true believer!!</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor Blade refill as part of a BzzCampaign and was pleasantly surprised at the close shave they provided as well as how long the refills last.  Just hold down the buttons on the razor handle, pop the old blade off, and snap a refill blade on! I never thought I&#x27;d give up my Schick Intuition razor, but after trying the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Refill Razor Blade, I&#x27;m a convert! The handle is easy to maneuver across my skin unlike the clunky Intuition handle, Plus I get an exceptionally close shave that leaves my skin silky smooth.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this razor and refill blades to anyone who has sensitive skin and wants to experience an exceptional shaving experience!</li>
    <li> Razor heads have a long life and are easy to attach.  Compared to similar products they are higher quality and better priced.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this new razor! I have been struggling with my skin, especially on my legs due to a auto-immune disorder for a few years now. I have had a hard time finding the perfect razor for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the moisture around the razor razors, along with so many other &amp;#34;sensitive care&amp;#34; razors. NOTHING COMPARES!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I used this new razor through a BzzCampaign!!!!, I was HOOKED FOR LIFE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new and will stay my GO TO razor of choice!</li>
    <li> This is a product you should get. I got it thanks to bzzagent. I tried it and love it you should get it.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free as part of a BzzAgent campain for my honest and truthful opinion. I knew some razors were better than others but when you got to this level of razor (vs a disposable) I thought they were pretty much all the same. I was so wrong!!. This thing is amazing!! I love the handle first of all. I always used to drop my razor and now this one fits perfectly in my hand. I love the serum that is right in the razor head. I don&#x27;t even have to use shaving lotion anymore! But best of all it cuts so close that I only have to shave every other day!!!! I suggested them to a friend she she got the same results!! I have always been a shave once or twice a day kind of person. Did I mention that this thing is awesome??</li>
    <li> These cartridges are wonderful for sensitive skin.  I tested this product several months ago for BzzAgent, and I have never stopped using it.  The moisture beads prevent razor burn and keep cuts away.  The five flexible blades glide effortlessly over the skin and never miss a hair.  This is the best!</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor&#x27;s with two blades as part of a Bzzagent campaign. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I&#x27;ve had expensive razors before and have always gone back to the cheap disposables because the expensive ones did the same job that the cheap ones did. I felt they were a waste of money. So I was a bit skeptical when trying the Hydro Silk Sensitive. This was the first time that I had actually used a sensitive razor. I always guessed maybe I needed one because of all the rashes and bumps that my legs would be covered in after a shave, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how that would go either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be happier. This razor gave me a rash and bump free shave that was so smooth and no cuts either! It wasn&#x27;t until I ran out of the two free cartridges that I had recieved did I realize that those $14 for blades was going to be worth every penny. I went back to my disposables and my legs are a wreck. Cuts, bumps, a rash and not even a close shave- yes, I used shave cream too! The next chance I get, I am running out and picking up another box of razor blade cartridges!</li>
    <li> my wife got these and they made her legs so much smoother then other she has used. less cuts also</li>
    <li> These are literally the best female razors I&#x27;ve ever used! They keep my legs smoother longer than other razors and the cartridges really do last longer.  I am a loyal customer and I&#x27;m pretty sure you will be too after seeing the difference in your legs. Happy shaving!</li>
    <li> The first few shaves are fine, however after the third time I went to shave the moisture strip was almost completely gone. The blades dull pretty quickly too. It does do well for not irritating my skin; I didn&#x27;t get razor burn on my thighs like I do with other razors. The moisture strips dissolving too quickly really isn&#x27;t worth it though. I prefer using the Schick Hyrdo men&#x27;s razor instead. The moisture strips last longer, the blades move so you can get around your ankle and the back of your knees better, it&#x27;s an all around better razor. Too bad they don&#x27;t make a razor head more like that for women because the men&#x27;s design is, well, manly.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive razor as part of the BzzAgent campaign a little while ago. Since testing it out, I haven&#x27;t used another razor, and this 4 count pack cartridge is great when you need to replace the blade. The blades on this razor have never knicked or cut me during shaving, and they also leave your legs feeling silky and smooth too!</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Bzzagent for review. I rarely buy a cartridge for my razor, normally sticking with disposables. This razor is a exception. For my sensitive skin I see a reduction of cuts, irritation and ingrown hairs. I highly recommend the razor and also the refill.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a bzzagent campaign and at first I was skeptical that a 5th blade would make much difference.  Prior to this razor I was using the Schick Quattro for women and I really liked that razor.  I have not picked up the old razor since getting this and in fact, I am on my second blade and considering purchasing the refills since I don&#x27;t want to go back!  My only complaint is that since there are 5 blades it is a little hard to get around your knee cap but otherwise, the shave is so smooth and nice.  Additionally, it seems to last longer than the shave I got with my old razor too.</li>
    <li> I usually cheap out and buy the crappy four blade razor refills because I never thought there was a difference between them and the razors refills I used to use (Venus Embrace). Once I got my original Hydro Silk razor free from BzzAgent, I was super impressed. The shave was way closer than usual, my skin wasn&#x27;t at all irritated (zero razor bumps!), and it lasted a bit longer than usual (okay, maybe that one&#x27;s just in my head...) I&#x27;ll have no problem shelling out the extra money to be buying these when I run out next time.</li>
    <li> I like this razor blade because it gets hair in tougher areas better than other blades.  I only wish it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Its like little pre-wrapped kisses for your skin. An easy refill. I keep a few on hand but they last so long even the softening strips. Gotta have smooth legs and this is my secret. Well it was my secret!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a Bzzagent promotion and I will never switch to any other razor!  It&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I received these cartridges to test on behalf of a BzzCampaign and I highly recommend them! The blades remain sharp a lot longer than other brands I have tried. My skin felt moisturized and smooth after shaving!</li>
    <li> usually my cartridges only last a couple shaves they get dry and dull but the Schick Hydro silk cartridges seem to hold their moisture a lot longer continuing to give me that close long lasting moisturizing shave every woman desires&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#IMABZZAGENT #IGOTITFREE</li>
    <li> I received this razor and cartridge free from Bzzagent and the review is 100% my own. I absolutely LOVE this razor system. This is the first razor that hasn&#x27;t made my sensitive skin turn red after shaving. I recommend this to anyone who has sensitive skin but wants smooth legs!</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Refill Razor blades as part of a bzzagent campaign, and combined with the razor handle, this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. The blades give a really close shave without causing any irritation.</li>
    <li> I first tried the Schick Hydro Silk razor and refills as a BZZ agent  and now it  is my razor and cartridge of choice. I get a clean smooth shave every time with just one swipe of the razor vs. repeat strokes over the same area with my old razor. For a clean smooth shave every time try the Schick&#x27;s hydro silk cartridges today.</li>
    <li> I received my razor as part of my BuzzAgent campaign - free to try out. The razor was free and coupons helped me to fill up with refills for future purchases. This is a great product that offers great results. The sensitive care feature is great for my skin. I have a hard time finding a razor that doesn&#x27;t give me razor burn and this one is great! A must have in your beauty routine!</li>
    <li> I wrote rave reviews about the razor and the refills will be the same.  Great razor and no irration on the skin.  I have also reviewed for bbzagent.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I love that this razor offers refilla because they stay good for so long I only have to buy refills every 6 months and.the price is great!!!</li>
    <li> The razor I received had two cartridges. One that came on it and one replacement. If meticulously taken care of, the razor can go for many shaves on just two cartridges. The moisture trip left my skin smooth and made for a close shave.</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome and I was so happy when I was able to purchase more with the help of Buzzagent I love them now I love this product for my sensitive skin needs! My one and only razor.</li>
    <li> got this amazing gift at bzzagent loved it thank you guys so much..... great on the skin and dosent burn or leave irruption marks</li>
    <li> Iam a Bzzagent and i recieved the Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor from Bzzagent for free i used to use disposable razors but since ive had the Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor the Refill blades last so much longer then a disposable one and leave my skin feeling smoothe and dosent leave razor bumps or irritte my skin or rust easliy i rate the blades a 5 star because of the quality of the product i recomend this to all women happy shaving everyone</li>
    <li> I reviewed these for BzzAgent and I was very impressed. I had no irritation at all afterwards and I felt like the moisture strip wasn&#x27;t JUST for decoration like on so many razors, it actually left My legs feeling nicer! Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great razor I had the pleasure to try by being a bzz agent. This is the only razor I have used since I tried it. The cartridges last longer than other razor refills I have used. You get a close shave and it leaves your skin soft and moisturized. The even better pro is that the moisturizing strips on the razor last at least 2 weeks, and I shave a lot!! Love this product, even if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin you should get one.</li>
    <li> I  received this as a result of a bzzagent campaign and I love them! They give me a close shave with little to no bumps!!!! The one think I don&#x27;t like about them is that they don&#x27;t last very long; however, I am willing to keep using them because this is the only blade that seems  to work for me. I highly recommend this to everyone with highly sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love this razor. Priced just right and got to try it free through bzzagent. My teenage daughter loves it also.</li>
    <li> I am completely impressed with Schick Hydro Silk Razor Blades! I will never purchase another brand! I was able to try this for free with BzzAgent and I am BEYOND glad I did! My legs have never been more smooth than they are now!! #gotitfree</li>
    <li> Received the razor and cartridge as part of my bzz campaign I participated in. Each refill lasted me about a month. I will be definitely be using this product from now on.</li>
    <li> I got to try this razor and cartriges as part of a Bzz campaign and its been love ever since! The cartridges last a long time and they stay makin me smooth time after time!</li>
    <li> Ohh I love these little cartridges.  They shave so close and smooth,  That i will not use anything else.  I am a bzz agent, and received the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razer and cartridges as part of my campaign. It was my favorite one by far. Sensitive skin? Sensitive Razer,  its that easy.  Thanks BZZ Agent and Schick Hydro.</li>
    <li> I received a sample from Bzzagent and switch from Venus and never looked back!!!&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and bump free shave!&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting too!</li>
    <li> One of the very best razors I&#x27;ve ever used!!! Did wonders for my skin and left them smooth. I just love it!!</li>
    <li> I received the Schick(R) Hydro Silk(R) Sensitive Razor from BzzAgent. First thing I noticed about the razor was the 5 blades and the moisture strips on either side. It looked like a beefy razor blades, less likely to miss those stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;The first shave I used the provided shave gel with the razor, I noticed results immediately. Nice close shave. Normally after a shave I need to apply lotion and even then my legs still itch. My legs were smooth, and no red bumps!&lt;br /&gt;Nice amount of refills in the pack for the money. They seem to keep the moisture strips for awhile and also stay sharp, so a person definitely gets a good deal of shaving out of one. I would highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> I switched from Venus because I received a free test trial with BzzAgent. At first, I didn&#x27;t think that I would continue to use the razor, but after using a Venus razor again, I had to switch back!! The Hydro Silk is an awesome razor and I highly recommend it to anyone, whether or not you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I received the razor with a refill cartridge as part of a BzzAgent campaign and was immediately hooked. The moisturizing beads on the cartridges help prevent irritation leaving me with no razor burn and a smooth shave - no bumps! I found my new razor!</li>
    <li> I first came across this razor as part of a BzzAgent campaign. I&#x27;ve used Venus razors for years so I was a bit skeptical about this one (plus I never really had a good feeling about the brand), but it really made a huge difference. During the coldest, driest months of the year it left my skin feeling extra moisturized right out of the shower. The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that the hair grows back feeling a bit different than with my usual Venus razor blades. I&#x27;m not really sure how to describe it, but I guess the best way to describe it is that it feels coarser/rougher a day or two earlier than with other razors. I would still highly recommend it, though.</li>
    <li> I got the razor and some cartridges to try as a part of a BzzCampaign. My skin is extremely sensitive and all products usually irritate it, so I didn&#x27;t have high hopes here. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the coated blades or the serum infused into the cartridge head, but this really does seem to glide over my skin and causes absolutely no irritation. I usually try to shave once a month or every other month because it dries my legs out and makes them itchy/bumpy, but I can use this every week if I wanted to. The shave is close, lasts at least 2 weeks before noticeable growth comes in, and smooth. I&#x27;ve switched over from my usual Venus. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I had a chance to try this product out for free and I&#x27;m so glad I did! Previously, I was always using mens razors in order to get a closer shave. I&#x27;ve officially stopped using mens razors and started using this! It moisturizes my sensitive skin while also giving a close shave. In my opinion a closer one then mens razors. This product is amazing!</li>
    <li> These cartridges are so easy to change when needed, and that isn&#x27;t an often occurrence. you literally just pop the old one off and snap the new one on. I was given the opportunity to try this product for free through BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> The razor shaves pretty close and I like that the moisturizing strip doesn&#x27;t clog up the blades or get goopy.</li>
    <li> These refills are worth the money! I received these as part of a Bzzagent campaign along with the razor and I love them.  There are 5 blades and a serum the hydrate and protect your skin.  The blades last a very long time!</li>
    <li> So easy to install in the razor! Love this razor no razor burn or bumps. Bzzagent sent to me to try and will continue to use for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The smoothness and close shave this blade gives is like nothing before. I typically have a five o clock leg shadow after shaving in the morning. As a female, this is very embarrassing and frustrating. I&#x27;ve typically resorted to using men&#x27;s shavers. For me, they seem to give the best shave. I received a BUZZAGENT free razor and though heck, Ill try and boy was I happy. This is the best shaving experience Ive ever encountered! A must try for those females who are looking for a better, closer and less abrasive shave.</li>
    <li> I have had to use men&#x27;s razors to get the close shave I want without razor burn. Now I don&#x27;t have to use the men&#x27;s razors anymore, because Schick Hydro Sensitive is exactly what I needed. I got my first Hydro as part of a Bzz Campaign. I will never go back to the ones I used before.</li>
    <li> Love this razor! I used to use another brand, but this one is by far the best for my sensitive skin. The individual cartridges also makes it easy to keep them from getting water damaged since I keep them in the shower.</li>
    <li> I got this as part of a bzz campaign. It left my legs feeling silky smooth and moisturized. Perfect for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. It is unlike any other razor I have tried. It glides over your skin and provides a close shave every time!</li>
    <li> I was able to try this free through bzzagent and I am glad I did. I shave my legs almost daily and they lasted about a week to a week and a half. I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor as part of bzzagent.com, and it is so much better than its non-sensitive counterpart for many reasons. I have sensitive skin, but I also have eczema. I was able to shave my legs without worrying about cuts or scrapes. It was an extraordinarily close shave, but one which didn&#x27;t leave my skin begging for moisture afterwards. I&#x27;m so buying this again!</li>
    <li> Got the Razor and Refills from BuzzAgent for free and love using them every time I need to shave! Recommend them to all the ladies out there!</li>
    <li> I tried the razor with bzzagent for free but in return I would spread my honest opinion about it. This razor was great. It&#x27;s such a great deal. I mean my Venus embraces run me a dollar something more and when you buy the kit to get the razor I think it&#x27;s almost a 6 dollar difference. The blades get pretty close I mean my legs felt super smooth plus it didn&#x27;t cut me like my previous razor. The only weird thing is the gooey thing on the head of the razor it didn&#x27;t really do anything to hurt me but it was jus weird it&#x27;s suppose to be a moisturizer but I use conditioner to shave anyway</li>
    <li> I received the razor and cartridges as part of a BzzCampaign and I&#x27;ve been more impressed the longer I&#x27;ve used it.  Recommend A++</li>
    <li> So smooth against my skin.  I love it.  I received this as part of a BzzCampaign for BzzAgent.  I can&#x27;t remember the last time I nicked myself and I don&#x27;t miss it!!</li>
    <li> I received this razor with 2 refill cartridges for free from BzzAgent as part of a campaign. I am in love with this razor! I absolutely have to have at least 3 blades to keep from having my legs shredded and razor burned, and this razor does the trick with 5 blades. I love the moisture strip; it keeps my legs so smooth, and it&#x27;s long lasting. I usually use each cartridge for about 10 days and then replace as it starts to get dull and the moisture strip wears out. So one pack of 4 cartridges lasts me a full month plus some. The only bad thing is the price, but most of the top quality razor refills are comparable, so that doesn&#x27;t deter me from buying. This will be my only brand of razor from now on!</li>
    <li> perfect for sensitive skin! love the lotion that is in it when it activates with water it is smooth shaving!!</li>
    <li> I got my razor and refills for free from Bzzagent and I love them. The refill blades last a really long time and leaves your legs feeling silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I received these blades free as a part of a BzzCampaign.  Not only do these blades work spectacularly to keep my red bumps to a minimum, but they also last a long time.  I used to exclusively use the Gillette Venus razor out of sheer convenience because shaving typically takes time and I&#x27;m lazy.  These cartridges last for a long time as opposed to the Venus blades that I feel like I really only get 3-4 shaves out of each cartridge.  I also found that I had minimal cuts after using this razor which is another reason I&#x27;ve used the Gillette Venus over other razors for the last few years.  It had super sharp blades that made my legs smooth but the contour of the razor made it easy on my legs in terms of both irritation bumps and actual cuts.  I&#x27;ll still use the Gillette Venus for those times when I&#x27;m really lazy but when I want my legs to be smooth and look good, this is the razor I&#x27;ll be using.</li>
    <li> These blades are amazing and leave my legs smooth and silky. I have never been cut using these razor blades and they don&#x27;t leave that unpleasant stubble like other blades. I had been using the hydro silk blades but when i discovered the sensitive care blades I knew I had to have them if I wanted to be beach ready. The sensitive blades worked better than the traditional ones and never left red bumps near my bikini area. They were also cheaper than the standard ones! The prices are amazing, I went to the store the other day and was shocked to see that my local grocery store was charging 25 dollars a box! You really can&#x27;t get any better when buying these blades.</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a trial through BzzAgent.  I usually have trouble with bumps and sensitive skin- I use this razor for my legs, underarms and bikini area and have had NO issues with sensitive skin, no cuts or nicks, and it leaves my skin so smooth.  I get a really close shave, so I don&#x27;t have to shave as often, and the blades seem to last longer, too.  I will never buy another brand of razor again.</li>
    <li> I first tried these out for free thanks to a BzzAgent campaign, and now I&#x27;m hooked! The replacement blades seem a little expensive, especially if you&#x27;re used to getting disposable razors. But they last much longer!! So in the end it&#x27;s all worth it. You can use them for such a long time, and the shave is so smooth and close with much better results than disposable ones, so in the end you&#x27;ll be very satisfied :)</li>
    <li> Best razor of my life. I got a free one somewhere, sometime. Only recently tried it and couldn&#x27;t believe how great it works!! And it rinses well, unlike many of the razors of years past.</li>
    <li> Love these razors, they keep my legs nice and moisturized. My legs are very sensitive, so these razors are just perfect for me. I love how hydrated my legs feel after each use. The price is great on these razors, it is worth every penny that I spent. They last quite a long time too, I only have to replace my blades about once a month. I would recommend these razors to any woman who has sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> These razors are wonderful. They give a great clean shave and last a very long time. The razor blade cuts nicely but doesnt leave bumps. I&#x27;ve even used the razor without shave cream and still works great.</li>
    <li> I received this courtesy of BzzAgent and I love it! It is perfect for sensitive skin and the refills are very, very easy to put on the hand and it actually stays on!!</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Skin Razor Refill Blades were given to me as a BzzAgent to review as part of a BzzCampaign. I loved this razor--the close clean shave paired with my ability to use a razor without purchasing expensive shaving cream was an easy sell. As someone with sensitive skin, I really appreciated my newfound ability to shave my legs and not find it necessary to apply lotion right after. My legs were left hydrated and clean shaven. I was even able to slide right into jeans without any burning sensation from the shave. These refills last a much longer time than any disposable or refillable razor I have tried. 5 stars in my book!!</li>
    <li> Seriously the best razor ever!!! I received this razor and the refill cartridge for free through Bzz Agent and I am so glad I did! I&#x27;m a super cheapskate when it comes to health and beauty products but this razor is one I will be splurging on from here on out!&lt;br /&gt;The moisture strip lasts forever! Well, not actually forever but at least 7-10 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only razor that I&#x27;ve ever been able to use for more than 2-3 shaves without it giving me major razor burn and nicks!&lt;br /&gt;It gives the smoothest shave! I love this razor!</li>
    <li> I received this razor from a bzz agent campaign. I love it. It shaves so close that I don&#x27;t have to shave as often and leaves my legs super smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I love this razer blade!  It&#x27;s is the closest shave I have ever gotten.  I love the shape of the razer itself too..the angle makes it easy to get around knees, ankles, and curves.</li>
    <li> I received my products as a member of the Bzz agent.. This is a product I would buy over an over and recommend to&lt;br /&gt;anyone with or without sensitive skin. So take my word and try it and you will love it.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because this razor blade is good for sensitive skin. It also has lotion or something on it to make the shaving smoother,and your skin.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I buy these every month. They last long and are so sleek and gentle to the skin. The extra moisture is a plus.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for awhile now and have purchase refills a few times. Overall great product and I will continue to use for the foreseeable future!</li>
    <li> I received this for free as part of a Bzz Campaign. The razor blades give an extremely close shave. MY FAVORITE!</li>
    <li> I was able to try this razor and cartridge thanks to Bzzagent! The cartridge is amazing, especially for sensitive skin. I never want to use another razor again!</li>
    <li> I had the chance to try this product through bzzAgent. For me every cartridge lasts can from 3 weeks to a month. I love this product. I think the price is also great and fair. My friends love it too...</li>
    <li> I received this shaver and blades to try and review for BzzAgent.  I was using a Schick Quattro Titanium and I thought I was happy with that shaver until I tried this one.  These blades shave closer than any other shaver I have ever tried, and I have not nicked myself one time.  I cannot say that about any other blade I have used.  The moisturizing strip is amazing.  It is not slimy like others I have used.  It moisturizes for a good 6-7 shaves and even after the moisturizing strip is worn down the blades are still very sharp.  These last me about a month each, making this the best deal for shaver replacement heads I have seen.</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro Silk Refill Blades is  a GREAT BUY..That Razor is top of the line.  I Recieved this as part of a Buzz Campaign and have used no other since!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the razor that I payed full price for the cartridge the other day at Walmart. I want to have &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34; cartridges.</li>
    <li> Received this as part of a bzz campaign, and will never ever use another razor cartridge. This gives me such a close shave, and my legs feel so smooth for over 24 hours. Love this razor cartridge.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving product I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t leave razor pumps like other products and my skin does not irritate after use.</li>
    <li> I received this for free along with the razor from BzzAgent and it gave me the best shave of my life. I typically get a lot of little red bumps on my legs after shaving and end up wearing jeans all summer. This year, I am going to rock some shorts with smooth, silky legs!</li>
    <li> These cartridges make my legs soo smooth and the blade lasts a good 20 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed at how long it lasts and how even till the end it makes my legs nice and silky smooth!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so these blades are my best friend when shaving. I first received these as apart of a &amp;#34;bzz campaign&amp;#34; to try them out, I am so hooked! I get a close, smooth shave with them and I love it!</li>
    <li> Pleased with my order.  Product was as described and delivered in timely manner -- packaged well.</li>
    <li> lasts long, and keeps me smooth</li>
    <li> I ran out of my other razor heads so i ordered these and this is a really good deal because these 4 razor heads will last me about a year. This particular razor doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin either I really love it its better than getting those disposable razors to me those are just a waste of money because they don&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Great razors for a great price. I like these as well or better than gillette razors and they are a much better price. The silk bars make such a difference on my legs, and I am VERY sensitive to razor burn. My one wish is they would last just a little longer (I get about a week out of a blade) but that is probably just asking too much from a razor.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend likes it (but it&#x27;s a little expensive)</li>
    <li> It does the work but it could be better. The moisture is gone after I rinse my skin, so I feel like the extra money I spent on this is worth nothing. The blades are sharp and does not hurt my skin, but somehow I wish I would chose the nonsensitive care one. This takes me few more times to get my skin nice and smooth. Overall it is a good product, but I will choose regular one next time.</li>
    <li> This razor has been the best I have ever used. When I tried it, it glided so smoothly that I thought it wasnt working, no pulling pain, no cuts, and it takes off all stubble and leaves your skin smooth! Try it! Id like to thank Schick for letting me test this product out for free!</li>
    <li> Nice product, smooth transaction</li>
    <li> My daughter likes these.</li>
    <li> Love it, very smooth shave. Only problem is the hydrating stuff in the top and bottom runs out pretty fast (after about 10 days) and the shave gets less smooth before it&#x27;s time for a monthly change. I will probably continue to use it since I already bought the wand.</li>
    <li> These refills are the best!  They are so easy to change out.  Some of the other brands of refills and razors are kind of a pain and don&#x27;t last long at all, but these last several times before you really need to change them!</li>
    <li> This product is great. I got it for free from BzzAgent. Never switching razor brands again! Two thumbs up from me!</li>
    <li> I like the refills for this razor. I like not having to buy a whole new razor and I like just buying refills.</li>
    <li> I received The Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Refill Razor Blades  to review for being part of the BzzAgent Campaign .&lt;br /&gt;These  razors  are great! It didn&#x27;t pull the hair on my legs nor clog up the  5 curve - sensing blades.  I loved the way my legs felt and looked. The razor didn&#x27;t irritate my legs .the Hypoallergenic Moisturizing Serum infused with Shea Butter next to the 5 Curve-Sensing  blades helps moisturize and rehydrate my legs. I noticed my legs felt very moisturized for a few days after I had shaved them. I recommend these razors if you love having a close shave and if you have sensitive skin. #bzzagent</li>
    <li> What more can I say than it doesn&#x27;t quit working. There is no worry of razor burn for months so it is worth every penny! I originally got it for free from Bzzagent and I&#x27;ll be using for life.</li>
    <li> I received these cartridges as part of my bzz campaign for free. They give such a great shave and my legs stay smooth for over 24 hours! My husband is a huge fan!</li>
    <li> To be honest I can be pretty picky when it comes to razors.. I have cut my legs shaving countless times and have scars to prove it! That being said, I must say I was intrigued when I was offered a free sample from BzzAgent. Wow. I love  how this razor handles. Glides smoothly around the curves and not a cut in sight. That is good enough for me!</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Refill razor blade as part of a Bzz campaign. The cartridge was easy to remove and attach a new one. They last a pretty long time, longer than most other razors I&#x27;ve tried. And they leave your legs feeling so soft and smooth, and not irritated as other razors can do to sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I agree that these refills last longer than some of the competitors. I really like that they do not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best razor and refills ever. I used to cut my self all the time especially whe I was on a hurry. Not with these refills they kept me soft and silky.I received this through BzzAgent and this is a product I would have never bought , so thank u. The best razor I ever used</li>
    <li> Love these Razors, they shave incredibly close without getting razor burn, even for the most sensitive skin!  Beach legs all year long...Yes please!</li>
    <li> Received as a sample and it has replaced the razor I was using previously.  Shave is closer and my legs are less irritated. I find myself not needing to replace the cartridges as much as well!</li>
    <li> I received the razor with extra cartridges from BzzAgent to test it out. These have five blades to get a really close shave, and also have a lubrication/lotion on the top and the bottom to help it glide easily over your skin and leave it feeling so soft and smooth. I have very sensitive skin, I usually always get razor burn when I shave. But I don&#x27;t with these. I will continue to use these and recommend them to everyone, especially those with really sensitive skin. This razor - these cartridges are a god send for people like us!</li>
    <li> I can not even begin to tell you how much the schick hydro sensitive razor/refills have changed my life!  My skin is smoother for longer and the dry skin is gone! I love it.</li>
    <li> I received this shaver through a Bzz Campaign and absolutely love it.  The shaver features a moisturizing strip that lasts about 2 shaves before it wears off.  Used in combination with Skintimate Moisturizing Shaving Lotion, I had an amazingly smooth shave and my legs had none of the usual razor burn that other razors have caused.  Hard to complain about a free razor, but I have already purchased replaceable cartridges for the razor!</li>
    <li> I got this to try for free as a BzzAgent and am happy to review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - Price is totally on point with other similar products&lt;br /&gt;SO smooth feeling afterwards&lt;br /&gt;my super dry skin did NOT need shave cream to go with it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Almost *too* slick (I actually cut myself more because I probably wasn&#x27;t as careful because it was so smooth!)&lt;br /&gt;I actually think that the hair grows back faster using this than the Schick Quattro I&#x27;ve used for years previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that this is GREAT for touchups, but I&#x27;ll still keep my Schick Quattro around for big jobs.</li>
    <li> I really liked the feel of these blades.  They were super moisturizing!  Would definitely buy again. Felt great on my legs.</li>
    <li> I received the razor and refill from my bzzcampaign. I love it, especially the moisturizing lotion that is released when shaving. I give this razor an +A.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a Bzzagent Campaign.  I have this using it ever since and bought several refills :-) I just love how soft my legs feels.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this razor through BzzAgent and am excited to say that I&#x27;ve been trying this razor for over a month and have switched from my usual razor. The moisturizing strip gets a little goopy at first but that lessens after the first few shaves. I don&#x27;t have razor burn like I did with other razors.</li>
    <li> I got this from BzzAgent, and I really liked it. The blades did a good job, didn&#x27;t rust easy, and I had no irritation while using them. I would definitely purchase this on my own.</li>
    <li> I liked it, but was not in love with it.  I found the first couple uses were awesome then it was  a wrap.  Had to replace it because I had some razor burn spots.  But for a short term use they are great.  The refills are at a great price!</li>
    <li> These cartridges are by far the best razor refills I have ever used. They are definately what they say they are. Your sensitive skin won&#x27;t have a probem with these. They also leave ylur skin silky smooth. I got the original from bzzagent.com to test out and love them.</li>
    <li> The razor are easy to apply. I mean its 5 blade razor that shave the thr hair right off my legs. It works good for armpits too.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love them!! They rock on super sensitive skin like mine. I am now able to shave every other day instead of once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> Loved the razor and the refills. It made for a smooth, soft and not over drying my skin. I was able to try this awesome item from Bzzagent couldn&#x27;t have had a better item to try.</li>
    <li> I was offered this razor to try for free through BzzAgent. I loved the razor so much that I have purchased the refill on two different occasions. The cartridges are sturdy and are easy to replace on the handle. The razor has five blades that give you a close shave and a moisturizing strip to prevent those pesky razor bumps and rash. I definitely recommend that you give this razor and the cartridges a try!</li>
    <li> When I first received the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor from BzzAgent, I was skeptical. I don&#x27;t necessarily have sensitive skin and the handle was hard to use. I didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting anything shaved. However, once I felt my legs after shaving I was AMAZED! My legs have never been so smooth and I was wrong- they are sensitive! Usually I have to wait a week between shaves or I get those irritating little red bumps. Not with the Hydro Silk! I can shave every day with this thing and have smooth legs all the time without the irritating red bumps. I don&#x27;t typically buy refills for razors and opt for the disposables instead but since I tried this razor, I won&#x27;t be going back to disposables! I definitely recommend these to anyone- sensitive skin or not!</li>
    <li> I received my first Schick Hydro Silk razor and cartriges for free from Bzzagent to try and share my opinion on, but I&#x27;m sill buying these because I loved them so much. Easy to use and easy on the skin.</li>
    <li> My skin is really dry and sensitive. Every razor I used was really tough on my skin until I found this baby. It came to me as a BzzCampaign and I fell for it I even repurchased it twice. It leaves my skin smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally Recommend It!</li>
    <li> I have used disposable razors for years and never thought the price was worth the results of a more expensive razor, until I tried Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor as a part of a bzzagent campaign where I got it for free.  I was instantly hooked and have continued to purchase the razor and refills for my shaving needs.  The serum and moisturizers help protect my skin during shaving and hydrates the skin at the same time - no more little red bumps for me!  The only downside to this razor is that the razor blade head is pretty big, but with 5 blades that&#x27;s expected and well worth it!  The blades last me about 2 weeks each and the price for them on Amazon is a great deal - especially if you have a Prime Membership and get free shipping! I definitely recommend this item to anyone with sensitive skin, or anyone just looking for a good razor in general!</li>
    <li> these blades are the perfect match for my sensitive skin. The kkin guards reduce redness and irritation and it has five ultra glide blades for smooth shaving</li>
    <li> Why wouldn&#x27;t you buy these for such a great razor. I was able to try this in a Bzzcampaign and I just now have to buy more refills. Out with the old and in with the new is all I have to say about this brand.</li>
    <li> Super Close shave! the stip os full of mosture, i recieved the razor free from buzzagent and im so glad they chose me, because i have very sensitive skin when it comes to shaving, i would suggest this razor to anyone who has sensitive skin</li>
    <li> A super close shave with no nicks or cuts.  Leaves your skin feeling smooth as if you used lotion already.</li>
    <li> This is such a great razor and being able to find the refills at any store is very helpful. They are  so easy to replace and I love that they are individually sealed separately is awesome. I am definitely using this razor again and again. I am a Schick Sensitive refill razor blades convert. Thank you Buzz Agent for letting me join the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor BzzCampaign.</li>
    <li> I received this as a part of the BzzAgent campaign and have really liked the razor ( I have a review on it over there). The cartridges are nice as is the razor, they don&#x27;t seem to last long and they dull after a few shaves, but I hear you&#x27;re supposed to replace them often anyway to prevent cuts and keep a close shave. This razor does what it says, it is great for sensitive skin, absolutely no redness or bumps. What I am not a fan of is the price, without a coupon or buying at Sam&#x27;s Club this is steep. I often just buy a new razor because it ends up being cheaper, at my Walmart a 4 count refill cartridge was $16 where it was $9 for 3 with a new razor. Of course this isn&#x27;t anything unique to the Hydro Silk, it&#x27;s with ALL women&#x27;s razors and of course the nicer they are the pricier they are.</li>
    <li> Yes, I am a Bzzagent and that is how I got this item for free.  However, some items that I have gotten from there I simply did not like.  This is NOT one of those items.  I have been using this razor ever since I got it.  At first I was afraid that I would get cut but that simply has not happened.  This is something that I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I received the razor and two cartridges as a member of Bzz Agent and have to say I was completely impressed by it. The ease of changing the cartridge is very nice.  For many years I have been using disposable razors and have tried some refillable ones from time to time, but none can compare to the close shave I received from this razor.  I highly recommend you try it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I received my Schick Hydro Silk sensitive razor as part of a Bzz Campaign and I love it.  The cartridges last a lot long then the others I&#x27;ve had.  My legs feel silky smooth as using this razor and I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I first tried the original razor as part of a BzzCampaign program. Before I ever participated in that campaign, I was using my boyfriend&#x27;s razors because my experiences with women razors were not very positive. They still gave me nicks, made my skin break out with bumps, and I would have to shave over the same area several times to get a close good shave. I was so surprised when I first started using the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor. Not only does it get the job done, but I don&#x27;t have to shave over the same area several times to get a close shave and it leaves my skin smooth and bump free. My skin is a little sensitive, so any razor that doesn&#x27;t mess up my skin and doesn&#x27;t take so long to shave. Great product.</li>
    <li> Received this cartridge and a razor free from a BzzCampaign.  This razor is amazing!  Loved the close shave, no nicks, no bumps and skin felt so smooth!  I have VERY course hair!  This is a perfect razor!  highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product and great price.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love these they have the moisturizing cream right on it No need for shaving cream I couldn&#x27;t dream of going back to my old razor &amp; Blades.. Thank you!! #FreeSample @BzzAgent @Schick</li>
    <li> I received these cartridges as part of a Bzz Campaign. I love these! They allow for a close shave and glide easily. They seem to last longer than other brands of cartridges I have used. The price is great too!</li>
    <li> I received an extra cartridge as part of BzzAgent and this razor does not dissapoint! It does a really good job !</li>
    <li> I received the razor for these blades as part of a bzzcampaign and I love how smooth my shave was and my legs were moisturized and I didn&#x27;t have any razor bumps. I do switch my blades in the summer about every 3 shaves.</li>
    <li> So easy to refill. Click and the cartridge comes off. Click and the new cartridge snaps on. Easy as pie!</li>
    <li> These razors are great. Pretty affordable as well. I would recommend this razor and refill pack. I received the original razor as a part of a BzzCampaign.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a campaign for bzzagent and it is amazing. This is my new razor of choice after using Venus for years. Not only do I not get razor burn,  these cartridges last for ever! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Although I have known about the Schick brand for years, I never personally used this product until I was introduced to it through a campaign on buzzagent. I&#x27;m in love with this product!! It left my legs feeling soft and smooth.  The cartilages does last longer than other razors.</li>
    <li> Cartridges are easily mounted on the razor. Just snap in and your done. The 4 count is enough to last you at least 4 - 6 months depending on how often you shave. I love how the blades glide on my skin and cover the curves of my knees. I&#x27;m sold on the razor and the refills. I don&#x27;t think I will be returning to disposable razors anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I am so hooked on these razors and not to mention the awesome price on the refills. wow! i will never buy another razor again.</li>
    <li> I tried this via buzz agent with the hydro silk razor. Certainly works well!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for sure.</li>
    <li> These razors are perfect, expect for the price. I&#x27;m not a complete cheapo but I don&#x27;t like having to spend so much to shave. I received these as part of a bzz agent campaign and immediately fell in love. This is the best close shave and the way it leaves my skin silky smooth for a lot longer then other razors I use. I will continue to use these as long as I can keep finding coupons.</li>
    <li> Love love the razor as well as the refills.  The blades last through several shaves.  Don&#x27;t like disposable razor.  I haven&#x27;t used one yet that I like.</li>
    <li> This razor is great and the fact that it has replaceable cartriges is even better.  I love having the convienence of switching the blade on my razor.  #BzzAgent</li>
    <li> I was able to try this razor and cartridge thanks to Bzzagent! The cartridge is amazing, especially for sensitive skin. I never want to use another razor again! And you don&#x27;t have to change the cartridge every time you shave Great close shave and saves money on cartridge to what more could you ask for</li>
    <li> I tried this product through BzzAgent, and I really liked it. The blades were long lasting and they didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. They were also easy to replace.</li>
    <li> I would always buy disposable razors because I felt that all razors were pretty much the same, so why pay the extra.  I am a part of BzzAgent and got to try out the Schick Hydro Silk Razor and I really changed my tune.  The blades do not dull as fast.  Also, I am prone to nicks.  The &amp;#34;hydro&amp;#34; element soothed my skin and made the shaving experience go smoothly. I did not need to use shaving cream when I used this razor. My skin was hydrated after shaving.  I am really impressed and recommend that you try this out as well.</li>
    <li> Great price, much cheaper than the local stores. I love these razors</li>
    <li> always love these, you dont even need shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I originally received the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor and Blades as part of a bzz agent campaign, in which I was asked to critically evaluate the products effects on sensitive skin. I was so impressed by this product that I made a permanent switch. I have always wondered at the women who have incredibly glossy smooth legs...because I always seemed to get razor burn! Using this razor, I have achieved those smooth legs, and underarms that aren&#x27;t irritated after a shave. On the first use of the razor the moisture pad can make the shave a little slippery, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the closeness of the shave. I am beyond pleased to have found this razor and continue to purchase the cartridges!</li>
    <li> I love how this razor cuts well and how it works well shaving. I also love how it can be gotten anywhere.</li>
    <li> I received a schick hydro silk sensitive refill razor blade as part of a BzzCampaign and I love it! I&#x27;ve been using it ever since to get perfect smooth, bump free legs.  The refills last a long time and are completely worth it!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of the Schick Hydro Silk® Sensitive Care® BzzCampaign. This was an awesome product to use in the middle of the horrible winter we had on the East Coast. My skin was dry, but when I shaved my legs with this razor they were silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that the weather is warmer, this razor is my best friend. I use it every day for a smooth shave on both my legs and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong...give it a try!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that these are the refills for a great razor!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a multi-blade razor that WOULDN&#x27;T leave my skin covered in red bumps and initially got the opportunity to try this through BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really ended up liking how well it treated my sensitive skin (read: no itchy red bumps) and the built-in serum does a pretty decent job of moisturizing your skin in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this razor. The only drawback is that the moisturizing serum becomes goopy and built-up after a few uses, meaning its possible that the razors won&#x27;t have great contact with your skin, leading to a not-so close shave after a few uses. This doesn&#x27;t happen every time though.</li>
    <li> After being a loyal user of the Gillette Fusion for years, I recently received the Schick Hydro Silk free as part of being a BzzAgent. I have tried all brands on the market and was never fully satisfied with a razor until now. The closest I ever came to perfection was the Gillette Fusion for men. I liked the 5 blades and felt the other options for women didn&#x27;t capture a close enough shave. I&#x27;m so thrilled I was able to try the new Schick product because not only does it capture a close shave like a men&#x27;s razor, it also has a built in moisture shield to preserve the softness of a women&#x27;s leg. I have noticed that I&#x27;m able to go longer without changing the cartridge than other razors I&#x27;ve used in the past as well. The product is highly recommended and worth the money- finally a razor that includes all of a woman&#x27;s needs in one!</li>
    <li> The lotion bars moisten my skin just right so I no longer need to put lotion on immediately when I get out of the shower after shaving if I do not want to.  With prior razors if I did not apply lotion my legs would turn red and burn for a couple hours after.  Not only does it moisten but these razor blades give a close shave, I am partial to 5 blades, that if I wanted to skip a day on shaving I could without getting stubs on my legs.  It is like shaving freedom.  The other aspect I love is the ease of putting on the blades.  There is no guess on what end is up as Schick&#x27;s name is printed on the cartridge and when placed on the razor is situated upright and readable.  Once it is on the cartridge stays in place well - it did not even pop off when I dropped my razor.&lt;br /&gt;I intend to keep using Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor Blades for years to come and am thankful for the opportunity I got from BzzAgent to try this razor for free because I do not know if I would have tried it on my own otherwise.</li>
    <li> i loved the one that came with my razor, but this pack of refills felt like it had particles in the blades that were almost painful. Worth trying another box since the shave is so good</li>
    <li> I ran out of the (regular) Schick Hydro Silk Razor blades, so I decided to try these. I have extremely sensitive skin and I am prone to allergic reactions in general, so I thought that these might be a better fit for me. Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t. The first time I used one, I noticed a small patch of skin had a little rash going on. I thought that maybe it was razor burn. The next time I used it the rash was bigger, but I had tried a new soap, so I thought that maybe it was something else. The third time I got a patch of hives on the side of my leg. It couldn&#x27;t be chalked up to coincidence. Something about this product was not hypoallergenic for me. It might work great for other people, but it&#x27;s really clear to me that this type of Hydro Silk blades is not for me.</li>
    <li> I have INCREDIBLY sensitive skin. I have tried SO MANY THINGS to help with razor burn and irritation. It was a dream come true when I finally found these! As long as the moisturizing strips at the top and bottom is still intact, these are the best razors available. But as soon as the strips are dry, the blades are done for me. Because of that, I tend to go through  a lot....BUT I don&#x27;t mind at all because of the way they calm my skin when I shave. A++</li>
