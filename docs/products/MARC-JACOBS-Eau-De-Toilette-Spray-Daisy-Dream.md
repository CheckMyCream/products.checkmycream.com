      <li>Love the perfume though.</li>
      <li>One of my newest favorite scents.  </li>
      <li>Got this as a sample to see if I would love it, I did, so</li>
      <li>I love this summery scent.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s a lovely perfume</li>
      <li>Nice light fragrance.</li>
      <li>I wish they would have put more in the bottle .</li>

      <li>Despite that, it is still wonderfully scented and convenient to carry in this small container.  </li>

      <li>I like it, but I actually was not trying to order this particular fragrance.  </li>

    <li> The shipping was double the amount of the Mini Spray Vials.  The Mini Spray Vials were actually the sample size sprays that upscale department stores give away.  Love the perfume though.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, delivered in time for Christmas!</li>
    <li> very disappointed at the size of this tube for 10.00 - it is a free sample size</li>
    <li> Nice light fragrance. Saving for a trip to Caribbean. I like to change my fragrances often so this small size is perfect for me to try a nice expensive perfume that I normally would not buy if high end expensive.</li>

    <li> It does come as described but please note that the size in comparison is not much larger than a sample.  However very quick shipping also.</li>
