      <li>and I love the taste of coffee and tea.</li>
      <li>The package is great, I always thought I was leaving too much in it at the bottom as it doesn&#x27;t all squeeze out.</li>

      <li>Good Product, Fast Delivery.</li>
      <li>SO MUCH, IT IS PURTTEY GOOD</li>
      <li>Very clean, smooth feeling after use.  </li>
      <li>The tube and cap should be made more user friendly.</li>

      <li>The taste is somewhat strong, but not off-putting.  </li>
      <li>My sister has beautiful, white teeth.  </li>

      <li>though didn&#x27;t notice any huge brightening affect.</li>
      <li>I enjoy it.</li>
      <li>Overall great tooth paste.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very fresh mint that leaves that</li>
      <li>Just love how clean, fresh and whiter it leaves our teeth.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the taste and the clean mouth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so totally in love and as long as the formula is this good</li>
      <li>This product really helped maintain my smile and keep my teeth white, it is a great product!</li>
      <li>It can&#x27;t possibly be good for your gums and general oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the results I&#x27;ve gotten thus far</li>
      <li>Wife - says it works well and rinses clean.</li>
      <li>My teeth have felt so clean.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not sure I would be able to if it were there, but the whitening ability alone of this is great.  </li>
      <li>Tastes good and keeps my teeth white.</li>
      <li>Teeth look whiter, feel good, definitely has a true cleansing feely taste after use.  </li>
      <li>I was thrilled with the quick results but my teeth became so sensitive that I had to discontinue using the toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I like this toothpaste, teeth feel fresh &amp; clean after using</li>
      <li>I began using this product when I became pregnant.</li>
      <li>a good option for those that want white teeth and fresh breath.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended :)</li>
      <li>Tube runs out quickly, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I guess some people have more sensitive teeth that others?</li>
      <li>I will probably need to use some kind of whitening treatment to completely restore to previous state, but very pleased with the results of this toothpaste, for &amp;#60; $5.</li>
      <li>I have always been an avid teeth bleacher, and it is not recommended to use bleach while pregnant for the risks of the chemicals transferring to baby.</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference right away</li>
      <li>Turns out that&#x27;s a design feature to get the right mix from beginning to end.</li>
      <li>but we&#x27;re willing to pay killer shipping costs to have it delivered.  </li>
      <li>Would most definitely buy this again!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even through my first tube</li>
      <li>Really works!</li>
      <li>My teeth do whiten fairly easily, and I used to get by with just Aqua Fresh extra whitening toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>It really works.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting to really see any whitening from this</li>
      <li>Received this in the mail today and I am amazed how much whiter my teeth are in just one brushing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do not see much difference in tooth whitening.</li>
      <li>but it really made my teeth</li>
      <li>Not so much.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m senstive to too much mint</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I bought this paste pretty much exclusively for the whitening ability that the package claims, but wasn&#x27;t really expecting much more than very slight difference.  </li>
      <li>Now I can feel confident to show my teeth without having to worry about those yellow stains, this toothpaste really does make your teeth cleaner and can go all day without those yellow stains no matter what you drink.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> use this product with a electric toothbrush i brushed my teeth 2 times with electric toothbrush and my teeth looks like i spent 200 on a whitening zoom at the dentist office and im a smoker great product !!!!</li>
    <li> Good purchase.  Arrived early.  Nice mint flavor.</li>
    <li> I began using this product when I became pregnant. I have always been an avid teeth bleacher, and it is not recommended to use bleach while pregnant for the risks of the chemicals transferring to baby. I was so worried that my teeth wouldn&#x27;t be their normal, pearly-white selves. This product really helped maintain my smile and keep my teeth white, it is a great product!</li>
    <li> My teeth used to get yellow stains on it easily after drinking something even though I might of just brushed my teeth shortly before that. Now I can feel confident to show my teeth without having to worry about those yellow stains, this toothpaste really does make your teeth cleaner and can go all day without those yellow stains no matter what you drink. Would most definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Seems to work well.  Noticeable difference but doesn&#x27;t seem to be a white white whitener.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this toothpaste. It has not left any sensitivity with my gums, and there is no bad after taste from the whitening. I have seen improvement in the whitening of my teeth, just do not expect overnight results. This is not meant to leave a wow factor after only a few uses.</li>
    <li> Good Product, Fast Delivery. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Wife - says it works well and rinses clean.</li>
    <li> Great product for price!</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase of this two-step Crest toothpaste so I definitely like it .The results are apparent .as my teeth seem to be getting whiter.and brighter.  The taste of the first tube, Step One, isn&#x27;t bad and is something similar to what a dental professional would use after a teeth cleaning The second tube, Step Two, which polishes, doesn&#x27;t have as clean and refreshing a taste as the many other Crest toothpastes I have used which was a disappointment.  However, since these tubes of toothpaste are doing what they are supposed to do, I&#x27;ll continue using them.</li>
    <li> Teeth look whiter, feel good, definitely has a true cleansing feely taste after use.  I enjoy it. Definitely a good product.</li>
    <li> Tastes good and keeps my teeth white. Tube runs out quickly, but it&#x27;s worth it. Just get two at a time. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works like any other whitening toothpaste only it cost more</li>
    <li> I recently started drinking coffee on a regular basis, and my bottom teeth were beginning to darken, even tho I actually drink it through a straw.  Within a week, using this twice a day, my teeth are almost back to normal.  My teeth do whiten fairly easily, and I used to get by with just Aqua Fresh extra whitening toothpaste.  I will probably need to use some kind of whitening treatment to completely restore to previous state, but very pleased with the results of this toothpaste, for &amp;#60; $5.</li>
    <li> This is decent toothpaste. It does whiten, although don&#x27;t expect miracle results! When the labels say &#x27;up to&#x27; that means best case possible scenario and is not the norm. That being said this particular paste does have he blue micro beads everyone has mentioned. I honestly didn&#x27;t think much of it until I noticed a small blue bead just under my gum after brushing! I was able to easily remove it but it was disconcerting for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again until they have discontinued the microbead use. They might be harmless, but they might also not be! I just don&#x27;t feel confident using a paste that leaves miniature blue debris behind. It can&#x27;t possibly be good for your gums and general oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without the beads this would have been a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
    <li> Goes through airport carry-on security check in. Only such fact deserve 5 stars</li>
    <li> Pretty good at removing surface stains. Not GREAT but better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried so far. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Little to no effect. did not remove 80 or 90% of stains in a week as advertised.</li>
    <li> I always been a fan of Crest 3D Toothpaste and been using them for years. I have tried various versions over time and this one lives up to their reputation like the others.  I am knocking one star because sometimes this version of toothpaste leaves your mouth sandy and dry, makes sure to properly rinse. Highly recommended :)</li>
    <li> Leaves a nice fresh feeling.  Whitening effect is noticeable but I think the whitestrips are better.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  It really works.  Go buy it now.  I noticed a difference right away and it gets me brushing because I know that it makes my teeth look whiter and shinier.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is the best!  After using it while on holiday in the USA my husband and I order our Crest toothpastes in from USA. We can&#x27;t get it here in New Zealand but we&#x27;re willing to pay killer shipping costs to have it delivered.  Just love how clean, fresh and whiter it leaves our teeth.</li>
    <li> This Crest 3D White Luxe Shine Whitening Brilliant toothpaste is fabulous!  I absolutely love the flavor as it is not too strong and is very fresh, but the best part is the overall outcome of your beautiful teeth after using it.  It gives your teeth great shine and feels nice and fresh.  I will continue to use this product daily.</li>
    <li> Thank you , its graet</li>
    <li> Has an awful after taste, but it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> After one week of using this toothpaste...I noticed a difference.  After one tube used a cashier at a store came up to me and asked me how I whiten my teeth.</li>
    <li> not for sensitive teeth</li>
    <li> Really works! But made my teeth sensitive after 4th or 5th use so I stopped it.The gel stays in place</li>
    <li> The package is great, I always thought I was leaving too much in it at the bottom as it doesn&#x27;t all squeeze out. Turns out that&#x27;s a design feature to get the right mix from beginning to end.</li>
    <li> The cap does not lock after one week of use. The cap needs to redesigned for easy use. The tube and cap should be made more user friendly.</li>
    <li> item arrived in a timely manner. I&#x27;m very pleased with the product. Would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE USED CREST ALL MY LIFE.  THIS CREST 3D WHITE REALLY MAKES YOUR TEETH WHITER, LEAVING YOUR TEETH FEELING SO CLEAN WITH A WONDERFUL SLICK-LIKE FEELING, TY!</li>
    <li> My dentist told me it&#x27;s just baking soda, and I&#x27;m not really whitening my teeth but the compliments keep coming in! I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste, teeth feel fresh &amp; clean after using</li>
    <li> My sister has beautiful, white teeth.  I drink ridiculous amounts of soda and am a former smoker, so me?  Not so much.  I bought this paste pretty much exclusively for the whitening ability that the package claims, but wasn&#x27;t really expecting much more than very slight difference.  I was wrong; this stuff is amazing!  I&#x27;m not even through my first tube and it already seems like my teeth are nearly as white as they were before I started smoking!  I don&#x27;t know about the enamel strengthening agents, as I&#x27;m not really sure how one would tell if their enamel has improved, but it does seem like my teeth are less temperature sensitive than before.  Every other whitening agent I&#x27;ve ever used either had an awful taste or made my mouth tingly.  This does neither!  The taste is somewhat strong, but not off-putting.  It&#x27;s a very fresh mint that leaves that &amp;#34;just brushed&amp;#34; feeling in your mouth for longer than the average paste.  I&#x27;m so totally in love and as long as the formula is this good I don&#x27;t see myself ever buying another toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. It took me years to find one that tasted okay. This one does. IT tastes &amp;#34;good for a toothpaste&amp;#34;. Best of all, after the first month of use, people were asking me if I had my teeth professionally whitened!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Very clean, smooth feeling after use.  A good buy</li>
    <li> Awesome toothpaste! I used this along with crest white strips and I&#x27;m amazed at how well they worked! I recently quit smoking after y years and never imagined my teeth could be this white again!!</li>
    <li> GOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODGOODLOVE IT SO MUCH, IT IS PURTTEY GOOD, I ean iit is very good so nice and good to eat!!!</li>
    <li> Received this in the mail today and I am amazed how much whiter my teeth are in just one brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Really surprised how well it worked, had low to no exceptions when I bought it but it really made my teeth white.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Will buy again. Effective and priced well.</li>
    <li> a good option for those that want white teeth and fresh breath. I enjoy the taste and the clean mouth.</li>
    <li> i just started using this about 2 weeks ago best price for the best toothpaste it works within 2 to 5 days love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I got this with the Crest Whitstrips, I guess it works well though didn&#x27;t notice any huge brightening affect. Plus I am wary of the chemicals on Crest which has a big bite out of the market. Nowadays I get healthier toothpaste from local organic stores.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all we use. It&#x27;s clean, tastes great and it does help fight the effects of my coffee habit.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste to use in conjunction with Crest Whitening strips. I haven&#x27;t even started using the crest white strips yet but can already see a difference! I am very pleased with my pearly whites.</li>
    <li> Wow. The other reviews were not kidding. I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth have gotten whiter over the past week. It&#x27;s very refreshing mint flavor too. I will definitely continue to use this toothpaste. Give it a shot!</li>
    <li> I got this after receiving a sample tube from my dentist a few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest 3D Luxe has a great minty taste (not overpowering) and leaves my mouth and teeth feeling clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be my go-to toothpaste for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> I do not see much difference in tooth whitening.</li>
    <li> Whiter teeth from just brushing, it&#x27;s a win-win!</li>
    <li> This is second time I buy it</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a week and I already notice a difference. My teeth are whiter and they also are less sensitive. The minty taste isn&#x27;t too strong but it is strong enough that I don&#x27;t have any bad breath like I noticed with other tooth pastes with less mint. Overall great tooth paste.</li>
    <li> Works great as intended</li>
    <li> Like it. Works pretty good.</li>
    <li> great toothpaste. works well tastes good.</li>
    <li> At first, I was skeptical of this product but I am very happy with it. I have purchased it many times &amp; will continue to do so. I have noticed extreme whitening since I&#x27;ve used it. I use it along with the whitening rinse &amp; have noticed amazing results!</li>
    <li> Taste great feel great. Definitely an incredible brand!</li>
    <li> Read the ingredients list, this contains Polyethylene which is tiny blue plastic particles used for the look of the toothpaste only. These can and do get lodged in between the gums and the teeth and also potentially into the body if swallowed. What was Crest thinking? Avoid!</li>
    <li> Best Toothpaste Hands Down...</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my son and he loves it</li>
    <li> after a short period of use I could tell a slight difference in color. I was thrilled with the quick results but my teeth became so sensitive that I had to discontinue using the toothpaste. I&#x27;ve never had sensitive teeth in the past. The price point of this tooth paste is great but my teeth became so sensitive that I had to stop using it. I read several other reviews with similar stories. I guess some people have more sensitive teeth that others?</li>
    <li> WOW!  My teeth have felt so clean.  Every time I brush it feels and looks like I just left the dentist after my 6 month cleaning.</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent value.</li>
    <li> After recently having retainers this has helped to lighten spots caused by the cement anchors used during treatment.</li>
    <li> After weeks of regular use, my teeth are slightly, but noticeably whiter (not just my opinion).&lt;br /&gt;Switched to this from colgate total whitening, and glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you  expect wonders, you&#x27;re unlikely to be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Keeps my pearly&#x27;s white.</li>
    <li> It does help whiten teeth, but don&#x27;t expect a big transformation.</li>
    <li> This is the best whitening toothpaste out there</li>
    <li> I love the taste, th e way it works and most of all its effectiveness.  I will never purchase a different toothpaste.. this is perfection</li>
    <li> I noticed that my teeth hasn&#x27;t been as clear and white as normal, as I am aging and I love the taste of coffee and tea. I decided to order this product off Amazon to give it a try. Within two weeks, I noticed that my teeth were noticeably more clearer and whiter than before. I brush twice a day, once in the morning, and once at night. With these results, I may even start brushing in the middle of the day as well to speed up the process. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the results I&#x27;ve gotten thus far and I will continue using this product in the hopes of achieving those shiny white teeth. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to really see any whitening from this and that&#x27;s not why I got it.  I got it because I was concerned that my tooth enamel was getting too thin.  I noticed immediately after the first day that my teeth were whiter, by at least two shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s been one month since I&#x27;ve been using it and there isn&#x27;t a hint of yellow at all to be seen in my teeth, in spite of drinking coffee and tea daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I see any difference in the enamel and I&#x27;m not sure I would be able to if it were there, but the whitening ability alone of this is great.  It also has a nice, not overly strong mint flavor that doesn&#x27;t sting my mouth like some strong mint flavors do.  I&#x27;m senstive to too much mint but this is a toned down version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super happy with this toothpaste and plan to keep using it.</li>
    <li> great taste and seems to have already started whitening my teeth so id say it works as advertised. glad I got it when they were at a crazy low price because normally this would be too expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste (or Crest&#x27;s toothpastes like it before this came out)for as the past 13 years.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> surprisingly effective</li>
