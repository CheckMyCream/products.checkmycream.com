<li> but I think you are using to much product or just flip your head down, maybe blow dry for 20 seconds, or just use your fingers to shake/blend it in.</li>

<li> This dry shampoo is a life saver for me since my hair tends to get limp and oily at the roots even 12 hours after washing it.&lt;br /&gt;Before a friend recommended Batiste, I tried Tresemme, but it didn&#x27;t help noticeably.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Bought this based on reviews and was disappointed. You might as well just sprinkle baby powder in your hair. It didn&#x27;t add any volume, made my dark hair look powdery and white and didn&#x27;t really seem to absorb grease that well. Will go back to buying the Big Sexy Hair brand.</li>
    <li> I use it at night so my hair isn&#x27;t white in the morning. Works great. Even gives my hair aittle body.</li>
    <li> It is ok. It is not the same thing as washing your hair, but it&#x27;s better than nothing (at least in the first couple of hours). Scent is a bit funny. No volume boost at all. Probably wont buy again.</li>
    <li> The cap was broken and the spray nozzle was missing. The product itself made my hair feel cleaner. but definitely dulled my hair.</li>
    <li> Maybe this would work as a mid-day root refresher if you are heading out after work, but this in no way replaces a daily shampoo. My goal was to be able to skip a day between shampoos or use it camping. No way....hair is now coated AND oily when using it after a night&#x27;s sleep. Definitely does not replace soap and water even for a day for me.</li>
    <li> Thought it was pricey for the size &amp; smell was just ok (I purchased a different dry shampoo locally that smelled better and was less expensive for larger container).  I wasn&#x27;t that impressed.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this dry shampoo for the fact that it has a nice smell and really seems to absorb excess oil.  My only drawback with this particular product is the white cast (like most any other dry shampoo).  Next time I will try it in the brown.  Still, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo is a life saver for me since my hair tends to get limp and oily at the roots even 12 hours after washing it.&lt;br /&gt;Before a friend recommended Batiste, I tried Tresemme, but it didn&#x27;t help noticeably. This stuff really works!</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo by far. More expense brands cannot touch this stuff. My brunette friends don&#x27;t like it as much because it comes out white and can look chalky if you have dark hair. Great for blondes though. Especially between highlights! Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Leaves white residue on hair.</li>
    <li> very good product.  works great..not sticky.</li>
    <li> I use this after I have a soccer game or practice if I have to go out and dont have time to go home and shower. It is awesome you wouldn&#x27;t even be able to tell that I was just running around and sweating.</li>
    <li> Most dry shampoos leave my hair heavy and kind of greasy. This one is perfect! I am a lifetime buyer!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft, free of grease and manageable. No other brand had done that (I have tried at least 3). I will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Not only does it make my hair look freshly washed but it gives it instant body. Warning I did use the batiste dry shampoo protect made for blonds. It did not work nearly as well.</li>
    <li> Works great! Really love the &#x27;Fresh&#x27; scent also!</li>
    <li> It works well, but I do not like the smell</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo there is out there.</li>
    <li> Cannot emphasize enough how awesome this product is. I am very prone to oily hair, so used to wash it every day. It was such a pain. Then a friend told me about this dry shampoo and I admit I was skeptical. So she bought me a bottle. And I was won over! This particular fragrance (Fresh scent) is so fresh and lovely, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair smelling like some perfume, far from it. It simply smells clean and the oil at my root line just disappears. It spray it on and then run a brush through the hairline and through the rest of my hair. It also gives my roots a little bit of lift. Magic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got quite long hair that is very fine/thin so when I DO wash &amp; style it I usually use steam rollers or the twisty ones. Both take more than enough time to do &amp; we do it because it makes our hair look allot nicer right? Can you imagine doing this EVERY day? Not me..better things to do as you all do to. Was a bit skeptical mostly because allot of reviews said it smelled quite bad/over powering &amp; I HATE that (nose of a Blood Hound so my husband says). Can&#x27;t review the med./brunette or dark/deep brown one&#x27;s. I just bought \\&quot;fresh\\&quot;. NOT nasty/smelly @ all &amp; this product does work 4 me. It&#x27;s a matter of just finding out the correct amount to use etc. I don&#x27;t use much (the lesser the better for me). It will/can leave that \\&quot;powdery\\&quot; residue on your hair but I think you are using to much product or just flip your head down, maybe blow dry for 20 seconds, or just use your fingers to shake/blend it in. I recommend it. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Just bought this in town. It&#x27;s the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair looks like I just washed it even though it&#x27;s second day hair.  I can put it in the night before so it feels clean as I sleep too.</li>
    <li> Smell is really good. It can make my oily hair looks dry. But it will leave some white granule on your hair looks like dandruff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s making me very lazy @ hair wash ! &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an awesome dry shampoo, this brand is the best. I only use Batiste. As for the smell, if you&#x27;re looking for a fresh &amp; clean scent, THIS IS THE ONE! I tried the original one and it DOES NOT smell fresh or clean. It smells like clothes detergent! Gross, i&#x27;m not trying to smell like i just came out from the washing machine.</li>
