      <li>It has a sweet floral scent but not TOO sweet and not TOO floral.</li>
      <li>It smells sexy and soft and not musky and strong, and defiantly not like your grandma.</li>
      <li>The sweetness and floral scents of blue lilies, elegant white rose petals and gardenia make &#x27;Goddess&#x27; a perfect everyday perfume that is lightly spritzed on the body.  </li>
      <li>She tells me it has a beautiful scent not too heavy</li>
      <li>So clean and pretty, people comment often..</li>

      <li>the diamond part comes off like a ring so that was fun.</li>

      <li>A few more generous sprays of &#x27;Goddess&#x27; completes a cocktail dress or a night of kinky clubbing!!  </li>
      <li>It wasnt the right baby phat ..</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I first purchased this product in college about 8 years ago.  </li>
      <li>First of all it came unboxed (ordered from Tuccini).</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and love the smell , it last all day....</li>
      <li>The first time I tested &#x27;Goddess by Baby Phat&#x27; was at a mall kiosk, I choose it because I fell in love with the diva-ish, pink diamond packaging and bottle  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to get you noticed</li>
      <li>A little spray of &#x27;Goddess&#x27; is a must for me, it makes me feel incredibly SEXY, and makes doing the naughty very satisfying.  </li>
      <li>AND SHIPPED FAST</li>
      <li>Ladies you can&#x27;t used too much.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I believe this to be the real stuff.</li>
      <li>Love the pink bottle with the ring bling.  </li>
      <li>SHE&#x27;S VERY HAPPY&lt;</li>
      <li>The heavier underlying scents of black pepper and exotic woods make &#x27;Goddess&#x27; wearable through the night.  </li>
      <li>This smells like it&#x27;s real old.</li>
      <li>I WAS SURPRISED THANKS AMAZON...</li>
      <li>but not so much that you could be &#x27;tracked by your scent&#x27; or give those with sensitive noses</li>
      <li>I found myself having to spray more on after a few hours.</li>
      <li>it seems that i use more, because the product doesnt LAST LONG as it normally does.</li>
      <li>I love this scent &amp; it last a very long time.</li>
      <li>This is a great perfume for those that want to smell nice but don&#x27;t want be drown the people around them in a horrible perfumey death.  </li>
      <li>It was not the same Goddess that first came out.</li>
      <li>After first application I was still strongly smelling baby powder for hours, and I only did two small spritzes.</li>
      <li>There are reviews that comment that it smells like baby powder, which for my nose was completely underplaying the potency.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s flowery and mature.</li>
      <li>Having a baby around the house currently I personally get enough baby powder from her and was looking for something more fashionably-woman and less frazzled-mom.</li>
      <li>This bottle is pretty big and will last me</li>
      <li>I mean it not TOO strong to wear it</li>
      <li>at last the entire day I would highly recommend the perfume and the seller.</li>
      <li>Its gentle but lasts present long.</li>
      <li>This is slightly flowery, but very light and not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the few cheaper perfumes I buy at their full size (the other being Victoria Beckham&#x27;s perfume).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I believe this to be the real stuff. Got it at a great price and love it,</li>
    <li> No idea.  I never purchased this .</li>
    <li> She loves the smell of it although I&#x27;m not the one who wears it all the time. She said she likes it a lot and it&#x27;s very difficult for her to find. Amazon was the only place I could find it.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite and they don&#x27;t sell in stores. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great price for a fragrance I love if I can only keep it from my daughter.</li>
    <li> I planned it to be a Xmas gift, but I had to throw it away. First of all it came unboxed (ordered from Tuccini). The box was damaged, so there was no way it could qualify as a gift. The smell was so cheap, it literally stunk!     I really have no idea why people give this product good reviews. Could it be that I have received the fake one???</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite</li>
    <li> An excellent product for anyone who enjoys the smell of something that is not too overboard in wearing fragrances. I mean it not TOO strong to wear it will give others a headache. Its gentle but lasts present long. Definitely became a regular on my collection.</li>
    <li> This is about the third time i&#x27;ve purchased Baby Phat Goddess.I was excited and surprised to find it for such a great price,and in a large sized bottle.When it arrived, i sprayed some on...it smelled the same as my previous one(i had run out-the bottle leaked)BUT it seems that i use more, because the product doesnt LAST LONG as it normally does. I spray it on and it wears off shortly.It makes me wonder if it is a knockoff of the original&gt;?</li>
    <li> I love this scent &amp; it last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this based on some of the reviews that I read. I took a chance because of the price and as crazy as this may sound I LOVE a beautiful bottle. I&#x27;m glad I took a chance. It smells good. It has a sweet floral scent but not TOO sweet and not TOO floral. It really is a great combo. I don&#x27;t like to smell like a teenager and I don&#x27;t want to smell like my grandmother. The only problem I had with this is the fact that it didn&#x27;t last a long time. I found myself having to spray more on after a few hours.</li>
    <li> I know this is a cheaper perfume, but I just love it. I like clean smelling perfumes. This is slightly flowery, but very light and not overwhelming. It&#x27;s one of the few cheaper perfumes I buy at their full size (the other being Victoria Beckham&#x27;s perfume). You can&#x27;t really buy it in stores anymore, so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still available online. This bottle is pretty big and will last me forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is pretty cute, too.</li>
    <li> Scrumptious smell....It makes you want to inhale all day.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  I don&#x27;t smell like all the females at work and it&#x27;s a plesant smell that you can wear at work or out on the town.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and love the smell , it last all day....I recommend ....☺very happy😊</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely lovely smelling perfume, have been wearing it for approx 4 Years now. Love it! So clean and pretty, people comment often..</li>
    <li> It wasnt the right baby phat ..I didnt like the smell so I gave it away</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my daughter. She tells me it has a beautiful scent not too heavy it&#x27;s light and at last the entire day I would highly recommend the perfume and the seller.</li>
    <li> Very sensual and sexy scent. I love and use it often for speci all occasions. Baby Phat Goddess is just like its inventor Ms. Kimora Lee Simons and I often but her products because the are fabulous.Thanks.</li>
    <li> Love this!!! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for teen girls but maybe for like their moms it&#x27;s flowery and mature. It smells sexy and soft and not musky and strong, and defiantly not like your grandma. I&#x27;m 17 and I might wear this when I go out with the boyfriend! Very beautiful bottle tho and the diamond part comes off like a ring so that was fun.</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume on a whim, having some years ago found a Kimora product that I liked but unsure as to which fragrance it actually was. There are reviews that comment that it smells like baby powder, which for my nose was completely underplaying the potency. After first application I was still strongly smelling baby powder for hours, and I only did two small spritzes. So I can say it&#x27;s long lasting, and if you like baby powder this is the scent for you. Having a baby around the house currently I personally get enough baby powder from her and was looking for something more fashionably-woman and less frazzled-mom.</li>
    <li> This arrived on time, it was well wrapped.  I was very pleased with this item.  I plan to buy additiional items.</li>
    <li> Best day perfume for cheapest price.</li>
    <li> Its a ok scent. Not too over powering. I really love the bottle that it comes in. Over all a nice buy</li>
    <li> A very good price for a great smelling fragrance and the bottle comes full and the bottle and box are very pretty</li>
    <li> Was disappointed with the size....should have read more closely the description. Otherwise it is still one of my all time favorite scents.</li>
    <li> i owned this perfume years ago and now bought it again recently. smells so good. love it! like the bottle and ring too</li>
    <li> Am a Baby Phat fan for years. This fragrance is lasting, after washing my garments &amp; ironing them. Its still smell fresh. My hubby is excited &amp; hug me more. Ladies you can&#x27;t used too much.</li>
    <li> Hmmm what can i say. This smells real good.</li>
    <li> The first time I tested &#x27;Goddess by Baby Phat&#x27; was at a mall kiosk, I choose it because I fell in love with the diva-ish, pink diamond packaging and bottle  I ended up buying &#x27;Goddess&#x27;, before I knew it I was addicted.  I proceeded to purchase a new bottle of &#x27;Goddess&#x27; every few months, or when I needed a refill.  The smell is erotic but still so girlie, the perfume is wore wit attitude.  &#x27;Goddess&#x27; will make any lady a Goddess.  The sweetness and floral scents of blue lilies, elegant white rose petals and gardenia make &#x27;Goddess&#x27; a perfect everyday perfume that is lightly spritzed on the body.  The heavier underlying scents of black pepper and exotic woods make &#x27;Goddess&#x27; wearable through the night.  A few more generous sprays of &#x27;Goddess&#x27; completes a cocktail dress or a night of kinky clubbing!!  I have always received great comments about my perfume, &#x27;Goddess&#x27;, and people always want to know the name.  Plus, my boyfriend loves it.  A little spray of &#x27;Goddess&#x27; is a must for me, it makes me feel incredibly SEXY, and makes doing the naughty very satisfying.  ;)</li>
    <li> Smells nice and will never go out of style...truly fabulous.  Love the pink bottle with the ring bling.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume because it has a light sweet scent and is not too over powering.  Slightly floral but not overbearingly so.  This is a great perfume for those that want to smell nice but don&#x27;t want be drown the people around them in a horrible perfumey death.  It&#x27;s strong enough to get you noticed but not so much that you could be &#x27;tracked by your scent&#x27; or give those with sensitive noses a headache.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good to smell nice but if you can be tracked like an animal because of the perfume you are wearing then you are doing something horribly wrong.</li>
    <li> THIS BABY PHAT GODDESS PERFUME WAS A GIFT 4 MY MOM SHE LOVES THE SMELL ...SHE&#x27;S VERY HAPPY&lt;br /&gt;WITH THIS PRODUCT IT&#x27;S HER FAVOREAT ....THE PRICE IS GOOD ...AND SHIPPED FAST THEN I THOUGHT IT&lt;br /&gt;WOULD I WAS SURPRISED THANKS AMAZON...I WILL BE BUY N MORE ...</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product in college about 8 years ago.  Once it was all gone, I moved on to the next perfume...  I came across this one again and ordered it, AMAZING! I sprayed it on myself a couple times, walked into the living room; to say the least, my fiancé couldn&#x27;t get enough of me! A must try and buy!</li>
    <li> Smells great and is the original, its no a knock and and the price is great couldnt be more happier.</li>
    <li> This smells like it&#x27;s real old. Had to give it away. Yuck. It was not the same Goddess that first came out. Won&#x27;t buy ever again. Wish I could give it ZERO stars.</li>
</ol>
