      <li>Best hair color to achieve vibrant hair color!</li>
      <li>Brilliant color that lasts a long time compared to Manic Panic and, with it being a vegan formula, is very good for your hair.</li>
      <li>Best bright red hair dye out there.  </li>
      <li>Better to bleach your own hair and then use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When it comes to bright colors I&#x27;ve noticed that the Special Effects brand stays the longest.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather retouch my dye more often than do</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that I have come out of the shower before with quite a bit of dye still in my hair -</li>

      <li>and I absolutely love the quality of the product.</li>
      <li>I have the red over a lightened brown and its looks awesome.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather retouch my dye more often than do</li>
      <li>I love this brand.</li>
      <li>Nonetheless, it is still a fantastic product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that I have come out of the shower before with quite a bit of dye still in my hair -</li>
      <li>Overall great dye!</li>
      <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
      <li>It works a million times better than those cheap bleach kits you can find out there...    </li>
      <li>pricier but holds the best in unbleached hair compared to other products on market</li>
      <li>application was extremely easy.</li>
      <li>While bleaching does, in fact, damage the hair, vegetable based dyes (Manic Panic, Special Effects, many others)</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for bright, extremely vibrant red hair, this is a great dye to use.  </li>
      <li>it made my girlfriend&#x27;s hair look pretty awesome for like 4 weeks before it now is starting to fade.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for bright, extremely vibrant red hair, this is a great dye to use.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve bleached the heck out of your hair (like I have), it will probably rinse out more quickly, as your hair is TOO porous and allows the dye to seep out when you wash.  </li>
      <li>This makes a huge difference when trying to keep it from getting on your counters, shoulders, clothing, skin...  </li>
      <li>If you want colorful hair, you&#x27;ll love this hair dye.  </li>
      <li>but I leave it on anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour to make sure the color is absorbed.</li>
      <li>so the dye can be absorbed more thoroughly.  </li>
      <li>It looks fabulous, and doesn&#x27;t have pink-ish tones to it like Manic Panic/Punky Color.</li>
      <li>It shows up over light brown hair too.</li>
      <li>I will definately be ordering more in the future when the bottle runs out and the red has faded! :D</li>
      <li>Okay, this is my first review on here so bear with me.  </li>
      <li>My hair has been a lot of shades of red, but this is by far the best!</li>
      <li>I have been using Special Effects for about 10 years now</li>
      <li>Still looks bright one month later.  </li>
      <li>You will not achieve the bright red you want, and you&#x27;ll damage your hair trying to get there.  </li>
      <li>If your looking for bright red (but not blinding) hair--this product is for you.</li>
      <li>When you shampoo your hair, your suds will be bright red.  </li>
      <li>The seller isn&#x27;t doing it any justice with the tiny dot image, but it is of good size and gets the job done.</li>
      <li>Even if you were in a room full of people with dyed hair, you would still stand out with this color.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super excited to use it tomorrow, thank you so much and also for the super fast service! :)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend to people who love to stand out.</li>
      <li>color was extremely VIBRANT!!!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t wash your hair with VERY hot water.  </li>
      <li>was very pleased with this product &amp; am actually ordering another bottle of it when i finish this review.</li>
      <li>The color is super bright with pre-lightening of course, &amp; is also lasts very long.</li>
      <li>best part about SFX nuclear red is that it glows under black light.</li>
      <li>Used this on freshly bleached hair.</li>
      <li>By far my favorite color I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Special Effects is a wonderful brand and is getting harder and harder to find.</li>
      <li>Everyone asks what hair dye I use, and this is it right here.  </li>
      <li>Although I liked the bright color it faded extreamly fast alot faster then the other red hair dyes</li>
      <li>As soon as I put some more of this dye on my hair and let it sit for a few hours, my hair is silky, smooth and fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Nuclear Red is my favorite shade, people have told me the color is so bright that they have a hard time looking at it in the right light.  </li>
      <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this brand of dye and especially this color.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a more blood red color this is not the one for you!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re considering trying a \\&quot;safer\\&quot; boxed dye to get a stunning red, you should avoid that at all costs.  </li>
      <li>girlfriend is stoked, thanks!</li>
      <li>This is my first time using this brand, but I&#x27;ll use it again.</li>
      <li>shipped hella fast!</li>
      <li>Try to rinse it until the color in the tub water is very light, but not clear.  </li>
      <li>Try to rinse it until the color in the tub water is very light, but not clear.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Special Effects for 10 years and this is hands down my favorite color.</li>
      <li>Nuclear Red is a great color, stays vibrant for a long time.  </li>
      <li>The color is very vibrant and has a lot of shine.  </li>
      <li>I got lots of compliments on it but a certain friend of mine called it \\&quot;clown hair.\\</li>
      <li>Most reds on the market (in the semi-perm category) are pink based - this includes pretty much every Manic Panic shade.  </li>
      <li>It was a very good color, which even covered my pretty dark hair, but it washed out in less than a week, even with shampoo for colored hair.</li>
      <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to fade as fast as others do (like Cherry Bomb).</li>
      <li>I recommend this brand, and hair color, to anyone that wants intense color that sticks for weeks.  </li>
      <li>This absolutely will not happen.  </li>
      <li>You only need to bleach to a light orange, if bleaching freaks</li>
      <li>That really gets it in there.</li>
      <li>This absolutely will not happen.  </li>
      <li>It is insanely intense, no color comes close.  </li>
      <li>I still have a whole bottle...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you&#x27;re unsure what this is going to look like in your hair I&#x27;d suggest doing a google/bing search and pulling up a website that has pics of other people w/it in their hair. It is VERY red if you do it right. (Think Raggedy Ann &amp; Andy) It looks fabulous, and doesn&#x27;t have pink-ish tones to it like Manic Panic/Punky Color. This is my first time using this brand, but I&#x27;ll use it again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to dye my nieces hair.  She has very dark brown hair.  I bleached it with a 40 volume developer and then dyed with the Special Effects Nuclear Red.  The color is very vibrant and has a lot of shine.  The color grabbed quickly and is not washing out as bad as Manic Panic or Color Jams.</li>
    <li> Okay, this is my first review on here so bear with me.  I have been dying my hair and shaving my head for the better part of the past eight years.  Mohawks, chelseas, and other random hair experiments; I have tried Manic Panic, and countless others that sucked so much I cannot even remember their names.  However, Special Effects is my go to hair dye when I want some intense long lasting hair color.  Nuclear Red is my favorite shade, people have told me the color is so bright that they have a hard time looking at it in the right light.  It is insanely intense, no color comes close.  It is not a deep red, it is more of a bright red like fire engine red, not orange if applied properly.      I recommend this brand, and hair color, to anyone that wants intense color that sticks for weeks.  I have two daughters and I dyed their hair with Atomic Pink Special Effects in October and it is still pink!!  Very pink... it&#x27;s faded slightly, but everyone still comments on their pink hair, even though their roots are showing lol.  Everyone asks what hair dye I use, and this is it right here.  So if you&#x27;re thinking about trying it, go ahead!  If you want colorful hair, you&#x27;ll love this hair dye.  Salon quality hair bleach works best; from Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply you can get powder bleach and developer.  It works a million times better than those cheap bleach kits you can find out there...    If you&#x27;re wondering what this hair dye will look like after applied to bleached hair, I uploaded a picture of my experience with the hair dye to the product images.</li>
    <li> I have been using Special Effects for about 10 years now and I absolutely love the quality of the product. My only negative comment is that sometimes the bottles are not completely full due to the way it is processed. Nonetheless, it is still a fantastic product! I always recommend SE over any other brand. My next choice is Manic Panic Amplified. This is the first time I&#x27;ve colored my whole head with Nuclear Red and I freakin love it! A tip to help the color last longer....I wash my hair with Baby Shampoo and I only do it every other day or every two days. Also I know a lot of people who pour the rest of the color they don&#x27;t use when dying their hair into their conditioner and they only use conditioner on their hair...especially if you just bleach it. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> it made my girlfriend&#x27;s hair look pretty awesome for like 4 weeks before it now is starting to fade.  word</li>
    <li> Best bright red hair dye out there.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and it has the longest lasting effect.</li>
    <li> 1.  It is an orange based color, not pink.  Most reds on the market (in the semi-perm category) are pink based - this includes pretty much every Manic Panic shade.  If you want it to fade into a more pink color, stay away from this, as it&#x27;s going to fade orange (unless you had pink on beneath it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  If you don&#x27;t bleach your hair before using this, you&#x27;re probably going to be disappointed.  If you&#x27;re looking for a deep red to add a shimmer of red in the sunlight, you&#x27;re probably better off with Manic Panic&#x27;s Vampire Red.  If you DO bleach your hair before using this, this is one of the most forgiving dyes out there.  You only need to bleach to a light orange, if bleaching freaks you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. While bleaching does, in fact, damage the hair, vegetable based dyes (Manic Panic, Special Effects, many others) actually help the hair.  You can leave it on for hours and hours and it will not harm your hair.  The dye contains no harmful chemicals, and when used on hair that has been bleached or is dry, can be very beneficial.  I find that as it fades, a month or so after dyeing, my hair starts to feel dry and brittle.  As soon as I put some more of this dye on my hair and let it sit for a few hours, my hair is silky, smooth and fantastic.  Some people put the dye on and keep it on overnight.  Some people apply heat while it&#x27;s on, to open the hair shaft so the dye can be absorbed more thoroughly.  However you decide to do it, just know that these dyes are NOT damaging, and you can leave them on as long as you want.  Also, make sure you do NOT condition your hair before using this, as the conditioner will make the application uneven.  Wash your hair with a PH balanced shampoo (a lot of people use dandruff shampoo) and then let it dry.  No conditioner.  Some dyes have instructions telling you that you can go ahead and apply the dye after your hair is towel dried.  Don&#x27;t do this.  Your hair should be bone dry, otherwise application can be uneven.  After you rinse it out, only use conditioner on your hair.  Your hair should already be clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  This is a BRIGHT color.  Expect that :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  I find Special Effects dye to be a lot less runny than others, say Manic Panic.  This makes a huge difference when trying to keep it from getting on your counters, shoulders, clothing, skin...  I definitely recommend keeping a towel just for dyeing your hair - drape that over whatever counter space you&#x27;re using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  If you&#x27;re considering trying a \\&quot;safer\\&quot; boxed dye to get a stunning red, you should avoid that at all costs.  You will not achieve the bright red you want, and you&#x27;ll damage your hair trying to get there.  Better to bleach your own hair and then use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.  This bleeds a lot when you take a shower.  Don&#x27;t be alarmed.  When you shampoo your hair, your suds will be bright red.  This will fade a little every time you take a shower - and can fade even more if your hair is hardly damaged or is very damaged.  When you bleach your hair, it makes the hair porous - or, it puts holes in your hair shaft.  When you dye with a vegetable dye, like this one, the dye soaks into those holes.  So, if you put this on virgin hair, this dye has little to no holes to soak into, and will probably rinse out pretty quickly.  If you&#x27;ve bleached the heck out of your hair (like I have), it will probably rinse out more quickly, as your hair is TOO porous and allows the dye to seep out when you wash.  A lot of people who keep their hair colored with dyes like this wash their hair only a few times a week.  Some of them once a week.  I feel that life is too short to have dirty hair.  Some people also use cold water to wash and rinse their hair, as cold water closes the hair shaft (heat opens it) and keeps the dye from leaking out as much.  Again, I feel that life is too short to take cold showers.  Ways to combat this:  Don&#x27;t wash your hair with VERY hot water.  Make it as cool as you can without being uncomfortable.  Also, you can mix the hair dye with your conditioner, which will deposit color in your hair after you wash.  Some people only mix a few tablespoons of their dye into their conditioner - I mix almost a half bottle in.  My hair stays vibrant for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.  You&#x27;ll read that you should rinse the dye out until the water runs clear.  This absolutely will not happen.  Ever.  You could rinse it for 45 minutes, and there would still be dye running out of it.  That&#x27;s how it works.  It&#x27;s not like a boxed dye.  Try to rinse it until the color in the tub water is very light, but not clear.  I&#x27;m sure that I have come out of the shower before with quite a bit of dye still in my hair - but, don&#x27;t worry about that.  Some people rinse their hair with vinegar after they rinse out the dye, to seal the color in.  I don&#x27;t do this...well, I go back to life being too short.  Life is too short to pour vinegar on my head.  I&#x27;d rather retouch my dye more often than do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9.  That leads me to talking about how the dye WILL run if it gets wet.  This includes rain, pools, anything involving water.  The running will be worse just after you dye.  If you jump into a pool, not only will your hair leak out all over the place, but the chemicals in the pool will probably strip it further.  Overall, not a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been dyeing my hair in crazy colors for well over a decade.  I&#x27;ve been every shade of every color on the market.  If you&#x27;re looking for bright, extremely vibrant red hair, this is a great dye to use.  Probably the best on the market.able.  Also, you can mix the hair dye with your conditioner, which will deposit color in your hair after you wash.  Some people only mix a few tablespoons of their dye into their conditioner - I mix almost a half bottle in.  My hair stays vibrant for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.  You&#x27;ll read that you should rinse the dye out until the water runs clear.  This absolutely will not happen.  Ever.

I&#x27;m sure that I have come out of the shower before with quite a bit of dye still in my hair - but, don&#x27;t worry about that.  Some people rinse their hair with vinegar after they rinse out the dye, to seal the color in.  I don&#x27;t do this...well, I go back to life being too short.  Life is too short to pour vinegar on my head.  I&#x27;d rather retouch my dye more often than do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9.  That leads me to talking about how the dye WILL run if it gets wet.  This includes rain, pools, anything involving water.  The running will be worse just after you dye.  If you jump into a pool, not only will your hair leak out all over the place, but the chemicals in the pool will probably strip it further.  Overall, not a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been dyeing my hair in crazy colors for well over a decade.  I&#x27;ve been every shade of every color on the market.  If you&#x27;re looking for bright, extremely vibrant red hair, this is a great dye to use.  Probably the best on the market.</li>
    <li> I freaking LOVED this color. I had hair to about my collar bone that I bleached then dyed this color. I got lots of compliments on it but a certain friend of mine called it \\&quot;clown hair.\\&quot; It does wash out rather quickly but not near as fast as manic panic does. WHen it did fade, it went to an orange, but I had some orange spots with some still red spots, this is possibly from a home bleach job not being really even. When it comes to bright colors I&#x27;ve noticed that the Special Effects brand stays the longest.</li>
    <li> I love this hair color, vivid even on dark hair, negative: it BLEEDS EVERYWHERE and it only lasts a couple weeks. BUT it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair so you can touch it up as often as you need and you can leave it on longer than the time it says. 15 minutes is how long it says on the bottle but I leave it on anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour to make sure the color is absorbed. There is no rinse until water runs clear it&#x27;s more like rinse until you don&#x27;t have the actual dye in your hair anymore, Buy red towels. Blow dry your hair as soon as you get out of the shower. Even when your hair is dry it will transfer color onto surfaces. You will most likely have a red ring around your shower wherever the rinse off touched. Use Vaseline around your face, ears, neck, and arms when dying your hair &amp; keep a wet rag near by to quickly wipe up and splattered dye. Use gloves. Other than that the color is completely worth it to me.</li>
    <li> shipped hella fast! girlfriend is stoked, thanks!</li>
    <li> I was expecting this color to be a tad more red than it actually came out. I have naturally blonde hair, but it still looked too orange for my taste. If you are looking for a more blood red color this is not the one for you! It&#x27;s a good dye don&#x27;t get me wrong. Just wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair dye! I&#x27;ve used it for years and I always have great results. Brilliant color that lasts a long time compared to Manic Panic and, with it being a vegan formula, is very good for your hair. Always leaves my hair silky soft after I use it. Overall great dye!</li>
    <li> Used this on freshly bleached hair. Mixed in a little napalm orange for extra base and I got to say the color came out wonderful. Very bright and now 3 weeks in and still not faded.</li>
    <li> Nuclear Red is a great color, stays vibrant for a long time.  Still looks bright one month later.  It works best on light colored hair, but makes a nice addition to darker hair as well.</li>
    <li> Love the color!  Very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Best hair color to achieve vibrant hair color! I highly recommend to people who love to stand out. The color is super bright with pre-lightening of course, &amp; is also lasts very long. Best hair color ever.</li>
    <li> This product is usually a lot cheaper, but it looks like all sellers are raising the prices. I have been using this dye for years and always get the same amazing results, but with this particular bottle I&#x27;ve been getting color that isn&#x27;t as vibrant and the dye job lasts half as long! I got three dyes out of this bottle and it has been consistently poor quality. So disappointed. Gonna go back to ebay! Way cheaper.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything but.</li>
    <li> product was as specified. application was extremely easy. i colored only my bangs &amp; was able to get 4 applications out of the bottle (bangs hung down below my armpit). color was extremely VIBRANT!!! was very pleased with this product &amp; am actually ordering another bottle of it when i finish this review.</li>
    <li> I love this brand. I only have to reapply once a month and even then its only to make it pop. I have the red over a lightened brown and its looks awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Special Effects for 10 years and this is hands down my favorite color. It&#x27;s SO frigging vibrant, it&#x27;s like having one of those neon highlighters on my head - I love it! Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to fade as fast as others do (like Cherry Bomb). Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This was amazingly bright!  I used it for the 4th of july after bleaching - it was like a fireball of hair!</li>
    <li> My hair has been a lot of shades of red, but this is by far the best! I&#x27;ll never use anything else.  Most red dyes fade out pinkish, but this ones stays true forever, and eventually turns slightly orange.  It shows up over light brown hair too.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite color I&#x27;ve used. I tried several other bright red temporary colors such as keune, pravana&#x27;s brights and rusk. This red color has ORANGE undertones, which I was looking for. So, when the color fades ( which it really doesn&#x27;t, it gets brighter) it fades to orange, not pink like the other brands I mentioned. The color is thick, but leaves your hair very silky and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;The best part about SFX nuclear red is that it glows under black light. When I go dancing, you can&#x27;t miss me on the dancefloor!! I&#x27;m adding a few pics in this review. One is freshly dyed, one under black light and the other after 3 weeks and 6 shampoos.</li>
    <li> Got this ridiculous stuff for my wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I keep buying two at a time. Great product for coloring daughters hair</li>
    <li> pricier but holds the best in unbleached hair compared to other products on market</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brand of dye and especially this color.  It stays in your hair for a really long time and comes out really vibrant, without staining your skin or shower much.    Of all the colors I&#x27;ve tried (10+), this one is my favorite!  It&#x27;s so ridiculous!  It&#x27;s not so much red as neon red/orange/pink, and it really stands out.  Even if you were in a room full of people with dyed hair, you would still stand out with this color.  It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> This red lasts longer than most of the other semi permanents such as color zone, pravana, beyond, and manic panic.</li>
    <li> Special Effects is a wonderful brand and is getting harder and harder to find. The seller isn&#x27;t doing it any justice with the tiny dot image, but it is of good size and gets the job done. I just dye a section of my bangs and sleep in the dye. That really gets it in there. If your looking for bright red (but not blinding) hair--this product is for you.</li>
    <li> It was a very good color, which even covered my pretty dark hair, but it washed out in less than a week, even with shampoo for colored hair. Really disappointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m dying it tomorrow but I&#x27;ve heard many great things about this product. It got here super fast too which really blew my mind because I wasn&#x27;t expecting it until around the 17th of this month and its only the 12th. I was a bit confused as to why it was wrapped in news paper and had blue electrical tape around the cap which made it seem a bit sketchy but someone I know comfirmed that it was just to keep it from somehow spilling during shipping so I felt a bit silly. I wanted to add that in just in case anyone had a situation like I did. I&#x27;m super excited to use it tomorrow, thank you so much and also for the super fast service! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright so I dyed it the next day and omg I absolutely love it! Everytime I sweat or got wet it did bleed... I even showered but the color is still bright as ever. I still have a whole bottle... I only needed a little bit which is also very amazing. I will definately be ordering more in the future when the bottle runs out and the red has faded! :D</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments, I&#x27;ve been told my hair is fiery lol and almost florescent. If you are looking for Arial red hair look no father</li>
    <li> Although I liked the bright color it faded extreamly fast alot faster then the other red hair dyes I use I do like it but this is the first time I used one from special effect tht has faded as fast as it did all the other colors you have last alot longer</li>
