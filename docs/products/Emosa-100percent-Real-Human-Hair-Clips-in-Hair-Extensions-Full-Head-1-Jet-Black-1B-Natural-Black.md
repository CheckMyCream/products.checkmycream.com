      <li>I love love LOVE these extensions.</li>
      <li>I love the variety of sizes I got for the tracks.</li>

      <li>It still looked ok in my hair</li>
      <li>I was about to spend 100 on extensions but am pleased that I wont have too(: I recommend these</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t run into a problem when I used heat, I did make sure to use a lower setting just in case.</li>
      <li>I love these extensions.</li>
      <li>If there was more hair in the pack</li>
      <li>will def buy again :)</li>
      <li>I Just Received Mine &amp;&amp; I Love Them..</li>
      <li>That saying &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34; couldn&#x27;t be more true here!</li>
      <li>You are probably thinking these extensions aren&#x27;t very good because of the price but the truth is that they come in the same packaging as the 40 dollar one I bought these</li>
      <li>I recommend buying more than 2 or more packs to use this hair as full head.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the overnight shipping and the quality of the hair is fantastic ..</li>
      <li>sounds too good to be true right?</li>
      <li>so when it said FULL HEAD, i thought it would be a lot more.</li>
      <li>These are nice if you want to wear board straight!</li>
      <li>As for that one girl who said that it melts when you straighten them, I don&#x27;t know what kind of hair straightener she is using, but mine (molten hot) does fine on the hair.</li>
      <li>But That&#x27;s Fine</li>
      <li>I straightend them just fine.</li>
      <li>very soft and good for normal/fine hair.</li>
      <li>I looove how smooth the strands of hair are.</li>
      <li>and I wanted to take the cheap way out....</li>
      <li>You really are not going to find these kind of quality for this price anywhere else.</li>
      <li>i have black &amp;#34;scene/emo&amp;#34; hair and its straight and teased on top and its perfect for that.</li>
      <li>When I received the extensions I was so excited.</li>
      <li>It was ok when first purchased.</li>
      <li>I like this hair being that its very soft, no split ends and pretty good quality for it to being as cheap as it is.</li>
      <li>My hair will not blend right if I can&#x27;t curl my hair with the extensions!</li>
      <li>I love it because it&#x27;s help really helpful</li>
      <li>Not As Full</li>
      <li>so if that&#x27;s good enough for your hair then go for it.</li>
      <li>You DEF need to purchase 2 or 3 sets of these to achieve a full head cover up.</li>
      <li>Like if all you can get is one set go with it because you really wont be let down these curl good too with the right kind of curling iron (mines a curling wand) .</li>
      <li>I love my new hair once I put this on</li>
      <li>:) Very soft also.</li>
      <li>All in all they are exactly what I asked for!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth buying, you really get what you pay for!!</li>
      <li>Completely worth the money.</li>
      <li>Other than that they looked really good</li>
      <li>I tried many different ways to make the \\&quot;full head\\&quot; extensions look fuller.</li>
      <li>You will most likely need packs which does suck but worth it.</li>
      <li>They are very shiny and I have used them without any issues for a few months and they still look great.</li>
      <li>exactly what you see in the picture is exactly what you get.</li>
      <li>These extensions have held up very well!</li>
      <li>I love the hair feels really soft and looks natural!</li>
      <li>cuz they pretty much are.</li>
      <li>I am asian with fine hair and it works really well.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>treat these extensions like your real hair</li>
      <li>so much i looked like Elvira and it took lots of hair spray and the clips</li>
      <li>The picture really doesn&#x27;t do the extensions themselves</li>
      <li>The Shipping Was Fast.</li>
      <li>Thanks amazon.</li>
      <li>The package came really fast</li>
      <li>Works very well when curling it.</li>
      <li>They dont really blend in the well with my hair.</li>
      <li>I expected more hair, since I did buy two packets.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I liked the length on them but when i got them i noticed that hair was cut off of the extension. They are really thin and they get tangled alot. They dont really blend in the well with my hair. I think that if they weren&#x27;t cut how they were, then they would be okay.</li>
    <li> People spend hundreds of dollars on hair extensions and i wanted to find some that were in my budget. sounds too good to be true right? I received this product a day early and let me tell you what, these are so soft and look just like my hair. I was very skeptical because they were so cheap and i saw mixed reviews and saw someone say they melted when they straightened them (which is a big deal to me because i have straight hair) first of all, if your straighter is on a high enough heat and you hold it there long enough, your actual hair will melt. I straightend them just fine. i set the heat lower just in case and it diddnt melt at all. treat these extensions like your real hair cuz they pretty much are. That being said, idk how good they will be if you want to curl it or do crazy stuff with it. i have black &amp;#34;scene/emo&amp;#34; hair and its straight and teased on top and its perfect for that. very soft and good for normal/fine hair. Definitely a great buy if you dont want to spend a lot of money</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because I honestly found nothing wrong with the product. One package for my hair wouldn&#x27;t have been enough, because of my thickness ( So glad I decided to buy two sets). It shed a little, but After a couple times of brushing them, they still kept intact. I used to wear hair extensions all the time, but I made them myself. Minezzzz are the best. lol Anyways, no complaints. If you have thin hair, then just buy one set, for thick hair, I suggest two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am asian and I was a little worried that the texture would not match mine, but luckily it did. :) Very soft also. I actually had a few pieces left. I see nothing wrong with these. I literally went to the store to buy extensions and they suggested I buy a set for $100. I am on a budget so I went online. These came within two days. I am so happy with them :DDDDDDDDDD &lt;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and I am buying another set just because I love the price. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and you have to remember, you are paying a lot cheaper for these extensions, so you can&#x27;t expect to have the silicone clips. But here is what you can do, buy these extensions and sew the silicone clips to the actual hair weft. It will be a lot cheaper either way. As for that one girl who said that it melts when you straighten them, I don&#x27;t know what kind of hair straightener she is using, but mine (molten hot) does fine on the hair. I&#x27;ve curled it so many times.</li>
    <li> It was ok when first purchased. Definitely VERY thin. I used it once with a flat iron and all the shine was removed. No burning so it is definitely HUMAN hair.</li>
    <li> My niece loved it, she told me she was very happy with the product and the price was good too!</li>
    <li> Looks kind of greasy but did look nice in my hair BUT this product burns when you try to curl it. Not real hair. But okay for the price you pay.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I Just Received Mine &amp;&amp; I Love Them..They&#x27;re Not As Full But That&#x27;s Fine Im Ordering Another Set. N The Shipping Was Fast. Highly Recommended</li>
    <li> This hair shed a lot. I used then over the Christmas holiday. sheds , leaves your bathroom messy.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 sets and sewed them together and we&#x27;re still to thin for my hair and I don&#x27;t have thick hair</li>
    <li> Absolutely a good value. I use this along with some extensions from hair extensions sale. These extensions have held up very well! I&#x27;ve bleached th and dyed them already! All in all they are exactly what I asked for! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love it because it&#x27;s help really helpful and I use them a lot for when I go parting cam tell I habe them on</li>
    <li> I like this hair being that its very soft, no split ends and pretty good quality for it to being as cheap as it is. They do come thin so if you want to use this throughout your head get 2-3. I however don&#x27;t mind that because I&#x27;m only using these extensions because although the rest on my hair is 16 inches I&#x27;m in the process of growing out my nape shave so I&#x27;m using this as a transition. If you don&#x27;t wear extensions like that I recommend these for starters like myself.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re great for my hair because i have very thing hair and they&#x27;re perfect since i purchased two but i could tell that if I had just purchased one it wouldn&#x27;t have been enough. These do not dye either so I am purchasing blonde one so i dont have to bleach(kill) them!</li>
    <li> Its great hair but after a week it starts to mat together even after you wash it but its great hair I got the 20 inches and got 3 packs made it kinda thick but I would say get about maybe 4 or 5 so I will buy this again soon 😊😊😊</li>
    <li> These are horrible. They shipped in two days, which is good. But they felt so bad and were not soft at all,even after I only conditioned them. And the ends were frizzy and gross, and the rest of the hair was just dry and ugly. They weren&#x27;t even black, it was like a faded black kind of silver. Don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, because the picture definitely doesn&#x27;t do these extensions justice. I was sooo happy when I opened them. The hair was sooo soft, and silky. And unlike previous extensions I bought off here the clips were not already falling out lol. You will most likely need packs which does suck but worth it. The hair is thin but isn&#x27;t scary thin at the bottom like most are. I was about to spend 100 on extensions but am pleased that I wont have too(: I recommend these</li>
    <li> The picture really doesn&#x27;t do the extensions themselves justice i will say the quality it just wonderful for the price they are soft and usable easy to curl and don&#x27;t shed but the quantity is lacking they hair itself is thin and wouldn&#x27;t even sustain my thin hair and it such a shame for how nice they are i would say one thing for this seller is to at least make them triple wefted because 2 is not enough for most otherwise keep doing what your doing they are absolutely worth it if it weren&#x27;t for that one short coming.</li>
    <li> I recommend buying more than 2 or more packs to use this hair as full head. The tracks are thin, hair is good quality, at least the one that I got, also the color is a little darker than I expected. Fast shipping. Thanks amazon.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and I wanted to take the cheap way out.... That saying &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34; couldn&#x27;t be more true here! I bought 2 packages figuring 140 grams would be enough and I may say it might had been, had the hair had the same fullness from the root to the end. exactly what you see in the picture is exactly what you get. You can see right through the wefts and wearing 14 pieces in my hair is very uncomfortable. The hair quality by the second day deteriorates so much. I didn&#x27;t sleep with the and only wore them for about 3 hours the first day. I would highly recommend you get your hair from either Luxyhair.com, bellamihair.com or myfantasyhair.com. Me, once I have saved the money after extensive research I will be getting BellamiHair Bellissima 22&amp;#34; 220g. These reviews that are on here didn&#x27;t save me from making the worst purchase ever. Hopefully mine helps you guys!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to say. . I have thinner hair then a baby and these extensions are WAY too thin. The weight of all 7 pieces combined is what the weight of one track alone should feel like. You DEF need to purchase 2 or 3 sets of these to achieve a full head cover up. Overall ..I was pleased with the overnight shipping and the quality of the hair is fantastic ..other then them being way too thin I&#x27;m satisfied and plan to order another set</li>
    <li> Definitely fake hair! Do not waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> Wayyyyyy toooooooo thinnnnnnnnn</li>
    <li> Well I didn&#x27;t get the extensions the day I was supposed to they came the day after I needed them. And then I opened them and the one of the 3 clip pieces was broken so I don&#x27;t and cannot even wear them. I will not be purchasing anything through amazon again.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! Such great quality and speedy delivery!! LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I love my new hair once I put this on I feel so beautiful I can&#x27;t hardly feel there on. I recommend this 120% . You won&#x27;t regret buying them and for the price is awesome.</li>
    <li> I looove how smooth the strands of hair are. I am asian with fine hair and it works really well. People can&#x27;t even tell I have them on!</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE these extensions. My only problem is that thy&#x27;re too thin! Id have to buy 2 packs for my hair. I cant afford that. If there was more hair in the pack id 5 star them. Besides that, they are perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought two packets of extensions &amp; they are still much too thin for my hair. I am kind of disappointed. I expected more hair, since I did buy two packets. Probably will not order again because they were WAY to thin.</li>
    <li> the hair breaks im not going to worrie about sending it back because and only because i do not have a printer to print the lable very disipointed</li>
    <li> When I received the package, I was suprised at how little hair was on each clip.  I have never bought hair before so when it said FULL HEAD, i thought it would be a lot more. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> When I received the extensions I was so excited. I go then two days after ordering. They were so soft and long and the color matched my hair perfectly, however I have thick hair. I tried many different ways to make the \\&quot;full head\\&quot; extensions look fuller. It got to the point wherein just ordered another pack to make it look thicker. Other than that they looked really good and I was impressed!</li>
    <li> These are nice if you want to wear board straight! I purchased these due to it saying you can curl them! They will not curl! Not with a regular curling iron or curling rod! My hair will not blend right if I can&#x27;t curl my hair with the extensions! Will never buy from this company again. Had problems with shipping as well!</li>
    <li> I had no problem with washing or straightening them, they are very nice! But they are very very thin. If you want to add thickness to your hair these are not for you, but other then that I had no problem at all.</li>
    <li> Not enough Hair! It was thin as heck! You&#x27;d need 10 of these just fon it to blend, who it doesn&#x27;t look fake!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!</li>
    <li> these are super soft, they cut really well (most extensions seem to cut weird) and they arrived in TWO DAYS! the only thing that upset me was that I&#x27;ve been paying 100+ dollars for the same quality hair from a professional shop. you won&#x27;t regret getting these, 3 months later and I still wear them almost daily. will def buy again :)</li>
    <li> You are probably thinking these extensions aren&#x27;t very good because of the price but the truth is that they come in the same packaging as the 40 dollar one I bought these and I was not let down although I will tell you if you want your hair to be super full purchase two sets. All and All I have thick long hair and these make it look AHHH MAZING Like if all you can get is one set go with it because you really wont be let down these curl good too with the right kind of curling iron (mines a curling wand) . I just seriously think for the price this product does not disappoint</li>
    <li> the hair is very thin and impossible to hide your own hair even though it says its for a full head its really only about 1/4 of how much you would need for good coverage on your hair, and the wefts are sown on with only a few strands of thread, and the clips do not have any silicone on them to prevent slippage, so i had to tease my hair so much i looked like Elvira and it took lots of hair spray and the clips keep popping open....its really a hassle and they tangle alot, so im just gonna do glue in extension</li>
    <li> Its awesome but if you have a lot of hair you need 2 pairs,looks great, but you need to know how to blend the hair in....</li>
    <li> It falls of quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s to thin most especially in the bottom part.&lt;br /&gt;I guess you must buy 2 sets for better results</li>
    <li> The extension is really smooth and perfectly blends into my hair. Works very well when curling it. I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s the same product as the $33 one listed by other sellers. The product is thin and you may need 2 sets for a volume look. The package came really fast and I ordered it twice. I love the hair feels really soft and looks natural! Remember do NOT to comb it too hard because the hair may fall, and be careful when washing it for avoiding too much color fading, anyway I think the shortcomings don&#x27;t really bother, just treat it like your own hair and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.It&#x27;s worth buying, you really get what you pay for!!</li>
    <li> I read a number of reviews before I purchased and went ahead and placed my order. I love the variety of sizes I got for the tracks. The hair feels like the real deal. I didn&#x27;t run into a problem when I used heat, I did make sure to use a lower setting just in case. There was no smell to them (I saw others say there was a smell?) The ends are a bit thin which was a downer but I can&#x27;t complain for the price. I have only worn them twice but no one could even tell they were extensions because they are true to the color and matched perfectly! I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love these extensions. Came 5 days after ordering. However the seller put my name, address, and phone number on the package. I don&#x27;t like the idea knowing who got my phone number when it was shipped. My hair blended well with the extensions and curled amazingly. Completely worth the money.</li>
    <li> These extensions are amazing quality. They are very shiny and I have used them without any issues for a few months and they still look great. A few cons though, my clips are coming loose but nothing a few stitches can&#x27;t fix. Also, they are really really thin. I had an extra pair that I had to use in addition to these because these are just way too thin and look really unnatural. Please please don&#x27;t assume they will be ok because your hair is already very thin, because that&#x27;s what mistake I made. You really are not going to find these kind of quality for this price anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I love this hair! The length was perfect and the quality is amazing. It&#x27;s really thin so if you have thick hair like me then you will need to buy two sets OR by another pack of remy hair and double strand the clips. It&#x27;s only 70grams so if that&#x27;s good enough for your hair then go for it. They should update their photo because they make the ends of the extensions look terrible but in actuality, the ends were beautiful. Well done!</li>
    <li> It is very thin. I have a small head but I need at least three packets. i won&#x27;t be buying anymore. It takes me 10 mins to clip in. It sheds a lot. I put flex rods in them over night and sprayed it with a spray to make the curls stay. It didn&#x27;t work. I then took a flat iron in the morning and tried to flat iron it. It didn&#x27;t work. If you want to wear it straight and flat and do not want to style it then this is for you. If not, buy good weave and sew the clip-ons your self. It still looked ok in my hair but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone spending their money on it because of the shedding, non curling, and thinness. I don&#x27;t believe its Remy or Human hair but if you wear it as a quick fix.</li>
