    <li> Very happy with the product! The price was great and so was the quality!</li>
    <li> Tattoo kit was great but the ink did not agree with my arm so im not sure if the ink is old or if maybe im just allergic to that type of ink.</li>
    <li> Some needles are fine and others are not.</li>
    <li> I was completely happy with this product. Everything was there and it arrived on time and i couldn&#x27;t be happier with my choice. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who is a tattoo artist or anyone thats aspiring to be one as well.</li>
    <li> Great value, good quality</li>
    <li> I had no idea so many would come inside. All these needles and no gun to get a tattoo!! :( 5 *&#x27;s for variety! :)</li>

    <li> Exactly what I ordered. Good needles. Quick delivery and no problems. I will definitely order again</li>
    <li> Love it, exactly what you&#x27;d hope</li>
    <li> Power cord was broken when I recieved the tattoo machine so I&#x27;ve never been able to use it</li>
    <li> Lots and lots of needles only thing is they seem to favor some needles sizes then others</li>
    <li> Good quality.. I&#x27;m a satisfied customer</li>
    <li> It came pretty fast but I only got 50 needles and not 100 like promised. Bummer</li>
    <li> Some of these needles came damaged/ unsterile due to the package being punctured, but I was still pretty pleased with the overall quality.</li>
    <li> They seem to like it.  Said it is great.  Use it a lot</li>
    <li> some look dirty, some were bent but other then that it was ok .</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the price. The needles work well. I only use disposable needles so the quantity works out well in comparison to the costs.  I will buy my needles exclusively from One Tattoo world as long as the price stays reasonable.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered very quickly and 99% of the needles were usable. Other than a few bent needles everything was great but the package it came in looked like it had been through a boxing match lol</li>
    <li> Great needles! I only found like....2-4 bent, or unusable needles out of the 100 that I bought. Otherwise the assortment of 3,5, to 9 round liners work great. The 9 liner gives a thick bold finish, probably my favorite needle to use.</li>
    <li> They were very good and came in good time but I have received my paper that was with that order  and it has been a month ago now</li>
    <li> Pretty decent needles but a few had some badly soldered groupings or groupings that were messy with bent needles. I might look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Late every time. Figured the first was just a mistake and this time it&#x27;s even later.</li>
    <li> It came fast all there and i was very happy with them!!</li>
    <li> Received today, great buy. Only 1 needle bent out of the hundo.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a lot of different brands of needles out there, I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds, and so far, these are my favorite. They don&#x27;t pull skin (Unless of course you hook the tip by accident) and they&#x27;re pretty durable. I will keep ordering these for as long as they make them. I&#x27;m still learning so don&#x27;t mind the mistakes in my tribal skull I did on my arm haha. Thanks One Tattoo World.</li>
    <li> when i got the needles the packaging for about half of them were already open and useless. not to happy about this purchase and wouuld like them to be resent.</li>
    <li> great quality needles. i&#x27;ve checked every needle with a magnifying glass before using them and they&#x27;ve all been straight as can be and no burrs.</li>
    <li> They got the job  done, still are.</li>
    <li> I was and am completely satisfied with these needles. there was one box that was a little smashed on the corner i was worried that it was going to hurt the needles but they were all good. Thanks again for the great product look forward to ordering more</li>
    <li> Very nice set to use!</li>

    <li> These needles are not worth your money unless you are using them on a practice skin. If you were to use these on a person you would mess them up. Tips of needles over half had burrs and could not be used.</li>
    <li> Great product, as expected no bend needles so far so no waste. Have ordered over and over and till no problems. Great Company</li>
    <li> Ordered these and when I got them 4 were dull. The previous reviews were great but I&#x27;ll definitely think twice before ordering this brand again. After using looking at the rest only 10 were sharp enough to use.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, even earlier than expected and product was exactly as described. Great purchase!</li>
