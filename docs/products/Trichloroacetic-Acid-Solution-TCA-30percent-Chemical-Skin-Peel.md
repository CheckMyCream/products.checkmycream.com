      <li>The most remarkable were the lines across my neck.</li>
      <li>amazing for stretch marks</li>
      <li>Amazing stuff</li>
      <li>I did more harm than good to my skin......</li>
      <li>I did a peel so effective</li>
      <li>As of now, they kind of look like pimples that I couldn&#x27;t resist popping, so it&#x27;s not too embarrassing to go out with them.</li>
      <li>Nicely packaged with formula to decreased/increase</li>
      <li>So I followed the directions and had my baking soda paste handy to neutralize the acid.</li>
      <li>sure to have a paste of baking soda+water handy and have it made up before you start.</li>
      <li>Be sure to have a clock handy</li>
      <li>It came off on its own in one week, and I used Eucerin Healing Cream every day to keep my skin moist and healthy.</li>
      <li>Strong stuff!</li>
      <li>You can dilute this with filter water for your first time as well but with great accuracy.</li>
      <li>Sun damage gone from my cheeks where i wanted it to work most.</li>
      <li>I wish I had better luck here, and I sure did try to get them.   </li>
      <li>This stuff was better than the $150 peel I got at the doctors office.</li>
      <li>I will look more into this product if I consider using it again.</li>
      <li>It caused more hyperpigmentation in my skin.  </li>
      <li>It hurt more on my nose and it caused my eyes to water quite a bit.</li>
      <li>good product it really work but must be carefull very strong.</li>
      <li>the 30% is too strong, dilute it with a bit of water to make it slightly more</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s &amp;#34;one of those funny kind &amp;#34; :)</li>
      <li>Also, I recommend you use a Q-TIP with the cotton swap part removed from the end to make it more precise.  </li>
      <li>More rinsing with cool water after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The fine lines under my eyes, lets say 8 out of 10 faded away.</li>
      <li>Thank youping it smooth.</li>
      <li>I think there is something to be said about wrapping the face to aid in keeping it smooth.</li>
      <li>Great deep peel.</li>
      <li>I would never use this on my face or anything, unless you want to look like a leper, and fortunately I have no moles on my face.  </li>
      <li>But so far so good.</li>
      <li>it is very effective may take several peels to acheive desired look but it will work!</li>
      <li>Super strong.</li>
      <li>It took 5 days to peel but it was worth it!</li>
      <li>Original review</li>
      <li>Because it was so soon after my first TCH pee (1 month) and did not leave the chemical on for more than 7 minutes.</li>
      <li>the first peel i seen minimum changes but still better than what my skin use to look.</li>
      <li>Most of what I learned after my first peel were things I read, not what I did.</li>
      <li>ive done a second peel and the results are amazing but be sure to follow instructions on how to use products on YouTube.</li>
      <li>My face is VERY swollen where I was more precise.</li>
      <li>I have fair and sensitive skin, I also used a numbing cream before use, which proved useful.</li>
      <li>A big, acid drenched cotton tip isn&#x27;t probably a great idea unless you&#x27;re trying to get a very large area for some reason.  </li>
      <li>The one was more of a discolored sunken in spot on my face and this didn&#x27;t really work for that.</li>
      <li>You SHOULD ABSOLUTELY get all moles looked at by a dermatologist before attempting to burn them off, so you can be sure they aren&#x27;t cancerous.  </li>
      <li>so use with caution and apply with the tip of a toothpick, keep baking soda handy in case your skin is overly sensitive.</li>
      <li>Still never frosted at 15% and full strength.  </li>
      <li>so I had to use it according to what I knew and experienced about chemical peels and from other people&#x27;s word.  </li>
      <li>I saw a change in my skin and follow instruction and you will succeed with the treatments the minute I put a layer it quickly frosted</li>
      <li>the product is awesome works almost instantly, it took only two  applications  </li>
      <li>Overall, I was very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>WOrked great on a few moles</li>
      <li>I smoothed one side against the bowl and used the full side to go over, first, my forehead.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty cool.</li>
      <li>Last most important DO NOT PICK OR PEEL THE SKIN</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not clumsy, but this bottle will tip over easily.  </li>
      <li>I used the 50% on two scars on the side of my nose, right where the cushion on eyeglasses would sit.</li>
      <li>and I started noticing results, was a slight burn for a moment after second application, but nothing unbearable.. great product guys!</li>
      <li>And kept my face full of the ointment, and am still&lt;br /&gt;doing so.&lt;br /&gt;The reaction to peeling was much quicker this time.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get something that would be strong enough to kill the warts.</li>
      <li>Right now, I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the tiny peeling spots on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I did my first peel 2 months ago.</li>
      <li>luck to anyone about to use this product and get as much info as you can before use!</li>
      <li>but I was able to cover it up when I needed to go out in public.</li>
      <li>Sometimes layering the product a few times for good penetration.</li>
      <li>It pretty much halved the size of the mole.</li>
      <li>If your product is 30% and is to strong by trying out your test spot than add equal amout of your purified filtered water</li>
      <li>The first day I had to use to baking soda, water paste to neutralize it right away, but the second day I pushed through that brief pain and found that after a minute I couldn&#x27;t even feel it any more.</li>
      <li>All it really did was take the color out of the mole.</li>
      <li>They were removed and made my neck much righter.</li>
      <li>They have risen up quite a bit and are MUCH smoother.</li>
      <li>Wont use it to much but its the real thing baking soda as neautralizer is a must</li>
      <li>during this time my face and neck get VERY swollen.</li>
      <li>Maybe 30% is diluted so much that it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
      <li>But this one really shrank a lot.</li>
      <li>I will tell you this much.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t know how it would work when I bought it</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s an absolute NO for me and a NO CONFIDENCE in this product.</li>
      <li>Not recommended for use around eyes - better left to a professional.</li>
      <li>Other than it worked just as expected and, I&#x27;m happy with the results it has given me.</li>
      <li>And they are still peeling a little, so I&#x27;m confident that with a little more time I will be able to finally get rid of them.</li>
      <li>Less is more when applying.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>and I wish they went into detail a little bit more on how to use this.</li>
      <li>But, know that&#x27;s normal.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve has laser surgery for tattoo removal an some areas of were the tattoo use to be its be came darker but there isn&#x27;t any ink there. So I was wonders will this work to get my actuall color back!</li>
    <li> Bought it but kinda concerned, didn&#x27;t want to apply juts yet, I have done some research and read labels, this chemical says that it might cause cancer.. Don&#x27;t know if I want to risk it :/ help!! I need feedback</li>
    <li> All strengths are awesome! Especially  for the price.</li>
    <li> I am mixed race  so I&#x27;m dark toned. I used this product because a year before I received horrible Hyperpigmentation in strange up and down line pattern all over my stomach due to a laser treatment. I used fade cream for a year ...no effect.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to used tca&lt;br /&gt; I diluted the acid to a lower strength I want to say 20-15% and once a month about I would put it on for as long as I could stand it.. Sometimes layering the product a few times for good penetration. And I used a neutralizer then Neosporin for aftercare keep it out of the sun small dab of Ambys  fade cream and then eventually all the marks away. Took 4 applications</li>
    <li> Bought to help my daughter remove some questionable tatoo&#x27;s. It&#x27;s a LOT less expensive than laser removal!!!</li>
    <li> It had very little instruction to it so I had to use it according to what I knew and experienced about chemical peels and from other people&#x27;s word.  It caused more hyperpigmentation in my skin.  That&#x27;s an absolute NO for me and a NO CONFIDENCE in this product.</li>
    <li> My bottle had a leak so it spilled all over me and burned my hands</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work has expected</li>
    <li> Be careful, you should observed the how is risky using this powerful Acid. It works</li>
    <li> Came on time. Great deep peel. Sun damage gone from my cheeks where i wanted it to work most.</li>
    <li> Did not remove hyperpigmentation</li>
    <li> the first peel i seen minimum changes but still better than what my skin use to look. ive done a second peel and the results are amazing but be sure to follow instructions on how to use products on YouTube.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Would not be ordering again.</li>
    <li> amazing for stretch marks</li>
    <li> Updated review: It is now a long time after I had used this. All moles returned. Some are lighter than before, but others more or less are the same as before. I really think having them burned off or cut out by a dermatologist is about the only way to get rid of them now. Lowered by one star. I wish I had better luck here, and I sure did try to get them.   Original review: This is a great product for trying to get rid of moles.  I was unfortunately blessed with a good number of moles on my body and I was just kind of sick of them.  You SHOULD ABSOLUTELY get all moles looked at by a dermatologist before attempting to burn them off, so you can be sure they aren&#x27;t cancerous.  I would never use this on my face or anything, unless you want to look like a leper, and fortunately I have no moles on my face.  Also, I recommend you use a Q-TIP with the cotton swap part removed from the end to make it more precise.  A big, acid drenched cotton tip isn&#x27;t probably a great idea unless you&#x27;re trying to get a very large area for some reason.  My gripes are the following. 1) Especially if you need to burn the mole tissue deeply, it will take a while to heal and the redness may take a very long time to go away.  Months.  Maybe a year.  Who knows.  But you&#x27;ll be without the mole.  Moles can be very deep. 2) Bottle is thin and tall.  I am on my second bottle, because I spilled my first bottle on the sink by accidentally knocking it over while I was setting it down.  Then I did that with the second bottle.  I&#x27;m not clumsy, but this bottle will tip over easily.  Fortunately I saved 1/3 of the second bottle which may be enough to finish getting rid of the rest of the moles I want to get rid of.  They really should make this a short, wide bottle with the same size top.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for my boyfriend wort but I yet to try it in my underarm tag moles I&#x27;m kinda scared.</li>
    <li> This stuff was better than the $150 peel I got at the doctors office. I can&#x27;t wait to do my next feel in a few months. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff I did a peel so effective I saw a change in my skin and follow instruction and you will succeed with the treatments the minute I put a layer it quickly frosted I would recommend this peel to everyone who is looking to peel</li>
    <li> Really awesome one ...</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try acid peels at home for a while so I decided to give it a go. This product works extremely well and I shall pass on what I learned from using this product-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to lie or sugar coat anything- This will make it feel as if the winds of Hades are blowing on your face. It does hurt!&lt;br /&gt;If the 30% is too strong, dilute it with a bit of water to make it slightly more tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to have a paste of baking soda+water handy and have it made up before you start. This will neutralize the acid immediately. You don&#x27;t want to be in a panic with your skin feeling like it is on fire while looking for the box of baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a very, very long way so do not dump out half the bottle on to a cotton ball. I used the end of a Q-tip and that worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to test a small area of skin before applying to your entire face! I did a small test patch on my cheek and found the burning sensation to be tolerable. It was a different story for my nose! It hurt more on my nose and it caused my eyes to water quite a bit. This is where the baking soda/water paste came in handy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions said to leave it on 5-10 minutes but for me that was way too long. 3 minutes was enough for me to get the results I wanted. Be sure to have a clock handy to time yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will be red and raw afterwards. I used lotion to soothe my skin and it helped quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not pick at any peeling skin or scabs, this can cause scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use caution and do not get this into your eyes/inside your nose/on your mouth. I couldn&#x27;t imagine how badly those areas would hurt if acid got on to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would defiantly recommend this product for people who are do-it-yourselfers.  This will save you so much money in the long run!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this within a week of ordering and it came packaged in a small baggie that was packed in bubble wrap. Both bottles I ordered were intact and a plastic seal was around the black screw-on cap. It did come with instructions on how to use this product and I wish they went into detail a little bit more on how to use this. Overall, I was very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I used the 50% on two scars on the side of my nose, right where the cushion on eyeglasses would sit. These two scars were depressed and were moderately/severely deep. I dipped a q-tip into the solution and dotted the scars. They frosted, and I put some lotion on them. Now, 10 days later, I am amazed at the improvement I have gotten! I&#x27;d say the scars are at least 50% improved, and probably closer to 75%!!! They have risen up quite a bit and are MUCH smoother. I&#x27;ve not had any color changes to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, these two scars were the result of an Isolaz IPL treatment. I thought I&#x27;d be stuck with these forever but not now!</li>
    <li> I loved it. It got rid of my moles within two days. Just be very careful applying it. It does burn the skin and while the healing process has begun it does leave the spots you burned with a little Burt skin scab ( this usually goes away within three days)</li>
    <li> Works wonders. I bought this for tattoo removal and it has actually worked for me. I&#x27;m not sure why it didn&#x27;t work for everyone else. Mine was very small however and was monotone.</li>
    <li> At the end of the summer, if my several moles are completely gone - then I will come back a change my rating to 5 stars. Right now, I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the tiny peeling spots on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have several moles that have popped up in recent years that really annoy me. So I thought I&#x27;d try this out. I applied it the way I&#x27;ve seen reviewers recommend (the instructions are terrible), using a q-tip and just touching a tiny bit to the mole. It  doesn&#x27;t feel like anything for a second and then it burns like you just stuck a match on your face. The first day I had to use to baking soda, water paste to neutralize it right away, but the second day I pushed through that brief pain and found that after a minute I couldn&#x27;t even feel it any more. Maybe just because it&#x27;s the 30% I guess.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I only put it on two days in a row and then I haven&#x27;t done it for almost a week. My sister in law is visiting from Turkey, arriving today, and I didn&#x27;t want to have raw patches all over my face. So I will wait to do the next batch till after she leaves in a month. That&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t update till the end of summer.&lt;br /&gt;The last few days the little red spots have been slowly peeling, as soon as I think it&#x27;s done, it will peel again. It&#x27;s pretty cool. As of now, they kind of look like pimples that I couldn&#x27;t resist popping, so it&#x27;s not too embarrassing to go out with them. Since they don&#x27;t hurt and have thin scabs on them, I cover with a little face powder and it seems to work fine to cover them. Though not completely, I&#x27;m not a big fan of foundation.&lt;br /&gt;To finish this longer than expected review, the moles are not completely gone yet, but I can tell they are smaller and flatter than they were, which is nice. And they are still peeling a little, so I&#x27;m confident that with a little more time I will be able to finally get rid of them.</li>
    <li> Stings a little when first applied, but that goes away fairly quickly. May have to make several applications to achieve desired results. Not recommended for use around eyes - better left to a professional.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I have gosh awful rosacea, indentations from acne, and acne scars that are colored.&lt;br /&gt;I used this on one spot on my face about 6 months ago. It scarred and it is still scarred. It might have been my fault. Maybe I let it sit too long, maybe I put it on wrong, maybe something in the numbing cream that I used mixed incorrectly with this acid. I have fair and sensitive skin, I also used a numbing cream before use, which proved useful. I will look more into this product if I consider using it again. The scar has lasted 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to anyone about to use this product and get as much info as you can before use!</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t work at all. left big red burn mark that hurt and was very uncomfortable, now I have a big red scar.</li>
    <li> WOrked great on a few moles I had that irritated my bra line and necklace area. It leaked in the bag so I had to use gloves.</li>
    <li> Not strong enough to kill my skin tag. Skip this, numb the tag with ice then cut off with surgical shears, it&#x27;s hurts for just a second and you will move on with life.</li>
    <li> Treated a raised blackhead that other peels I bought would not touch. Turned it brown and ugly, but it shriveled up and fell off in about a week. Strong stuff! It is now gone permanently. There is a little pink spot left, which is fading away. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Pros: delivery was on time. Nicely packaged with formula to decreased/increase strength.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: no frosting at all. In an effort to achieve frosting i must have left it on too long because now I have burns. Took about 3 wks for burnt skin to be exfoliated. Still never frosted at 15% and full strength.  I did more harm than good to my skin......researching how I can remove a burn scar.... . Not happy!</li>
    <li> smaller than I expected, but got what I ordered</li>
    <li> As it states , this does not work for tattoo removal but it does work!!</li>
    <li> After 2 to 3 applications was all my skin tags needed. 2 wks after they were gone, just the healing process of the skin looks like a burn. But eventually back to normal. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on some warts on my foot. I was so excited to get something that would be strong enough to kill the warts. So I followed the directions and had my baking soda paste handy to neutralize the acid. I dipped a cotton swab in the solution and carefully placed it on one of the warts, expecting it to start burning. Nothing. Tried again. Nothing. No reaction; skin didn&#x27;t turn white or even tingle. Maybe 30% is diluted so much that it doesn&#x27;t do anything. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for what I wanted it for!</li>
    <li> I will be doing a thorough follow up shortly. In the meantime. Please respect what you are using. Read EVERY review and google it. I will tell you this much. I am very pleased. Just don&#x27;t have the time for a thorough review and you and this product deserves that. I am by far no expert. This is my second peel. I did my first peel 2 months ago. The results were not as thorough as I hoped. The fine lines under my eyes, lets say 8 out of 10 faded away. and the dark semi-circle is half as dark. The most remarkable were the lines across my neck. They were removed and made my neck much righter. Most of what I learned after my first peel were things I read, not what I did. Yesterday I did my second peel. My face is VERY swollen where I was more precise. For instance, around my eyes and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Make NO mistake. What you are doing is serious. So, turn off your phones and put a \\&quot;do not disturb\\&quot; on your door. I use 3 separate procedures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STEP 1. PRE-PODUCT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your work table and lighting. A small bowl of premixed water and baking soda. 2 dry small hand towels. Q-tips. Cotton balls. Kleenex. Alcohol. Vaseline. Lge Tube of Neosporin, Rubber gloves. My TCH bottle and a small glass bowl to pour it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I proceed to pull my hair back (TCH does not harm the hair) and thoroughly wash my face. At this point everything I do is \\&quot;thorough\\&quot;. I sit down and make sure there are no loose strands of hair that may get acid on them and breeze into my eyeball (be careful). Using several cotton balls soaked in alcohol I go over my face and neck (front and back) at least 4 times. I then poured my solution of 30% TCH into a very small ceramic bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STEP 2. APPLYING 30% TCH SOLUTION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dipped and swirled my q-tips in the vaseline and, swabbed it onto my lips and a small portion of my upper and lower eyelids. As if I were using vaseline as an eyeliner to make \\&quot;owl eyes\\&quot;. I then dipped the fan brush into the TCH. I smoothed one side against the bowl and used the full side to go over, first, my forehead. This dipping and applying went on from my forehead, down the sides of my face and to my cheeks. I then focused on my neck to my decollete. Then I went around my entire necks. After finishing that. I took my small rounded brush, wet in and went around my lips, nose and very thoroughly around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My clock was set for 5 minutes. Because it was so soon after my first TCH pee (1 month) and did not leave the chemical on for more than 7 minutes. This is a good time to take that prescription strength Ibuprofen that you never finished. Or, the Vicadin prescription you still had some of. Please, only if they were prescribed to you for pain! And just try to keep in mind, \\&quot;If if doesn&#x27;t kill you, it will make your stronger.\\&quot; Or, more attractive. What I mean to say is, YES, it is very uncomfortable. However, I think the glycohlic peel was far more painful. Be prepared- IT HURTS AND BURNS! So, you gotta have a little moxie. Otherwise, see a doctor to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STEP 3.  ACID REMOVAL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the clothe that had been in the baking soda solution to the bathroom with me as I rinsed my face and neck for at least 3 minutes. I then applied the neutralizing solution on the facecloth all around my face and neck. More rinsing with cool water after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t prepare you for what happens next. Everyones different. But, I can give your an idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTERCARE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited about an hour before I slathered my face with Neorporin. And kept my face full of the ointment, and am still&lt;br /&gt;doing so.&lt;br /&gt;The reaction to peeling was much quicker this time. I started to peel around my hairline and neck on the 2nd day. Note to you.. during this time my face and neck get VERY swollen. My eyes were close to being shut. But, know that&#x27;s normal. Whatever you do DON&#x27;T PEEL IT! YOU WILL SCAR. Use some medical scissors with round tips to cut the hanging pieces off. Also, make a point to sleep on your back. I think there is something to be said about wrapping the face to aid in keeping it smooth. I am going to do this on my next peel. The new lines that appeared by sleeping on my face were different because my skin when from swollen, scabby, firm, etc. Yes, I&#x27;m going to wrap my face with gauze next time I do my peel. However, next time I&#x27;m doing a spot peel. Forehead-under and around eyes-completely around neck-upper and lower lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to focus on elliminating the deeper wrinkles stemming from sun damage and smoking. Next time I promise you pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way I have a 5 to 6 inch scar in the crook of my left arm. I am going to video monitor using TCA on one half and glycohlic on the other side. It is an obvious bad scar and will be easy to follow the depth of any recovery. Thank youping it smooth.

    <li> I bought this to deal with a couple of moles. The one was more of a discolored sunken in spot on my face and this didn&#x27;t really work for that. The other was a fairly large mole, or maybe a lipoma, hard to tell, anyway this worked really well. It pretty much halved the size of the mole. It&#x27;s uncomfortable. I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say painful but it is a little gory. I am just working up the courage to use it again to completely get rid of the mole. I really didn&#x27;t know how it would work when I bought it but I figured heck, worst case scenario I can spend hundreds of dollars for a dermatologist. But so far so good. Moles are stubborn. They  But this one really shrank a lot. Excellent investment.</li>
    <li> Just made mole turn white and red around it. Never got rid of it</li>
    <li> This works but definitely needs to be diluted. Don&#x27;t even dare buy the 100%.</li>
    <li> Wont use it to much but its the real thing baking soda as neautralizer is a must</li>
    <li> This stuff works! It truly does u wont regret purchasing this it is very effective may take several peels to acheive desired look but it will work!</li>
    <li> Had previously ordered 12.5% but needed stronger. This one did the job!</li>
    <li> Very important to do a test spot folks! You can dilute this with filter water for your first time as well but with great accuracy. If your product is 30% and is to strong by trying out your test spot than add equal amout of your purified filtered water (1/2 teaspoon of tca to 1/2 water) use a glassmeasure never use metal anything acid will corrode the metal and ruin your peel. This product is a God send when tested and used correctly. Be patient and results will come. I lube generously aloe gel from a health food store after and have used fugera brand ointment for the healing of difficult spots.  I have been using for 10 years sparingly as not to over due ad I am 45 yrs old. Last most important DO NOT PICK OR PEEL THE SKIN YOU WILL SCAR! Use cuticle scissors and cut off any long NATURALLY peeling skin.</li>
    <li> It does seem to work, although it&#x27;s kinda slow. Just have a little patience.  It&#x27;s cheaper than lazer, so it&#x27;s worth it to me to have a little patience.  I&#x27;d recommend this for smaller tattoo removals. I think it&#x27;d take too long on large tattoos.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Super strong. Be careful!</li>
    <li> good product it really work but must be carefull very strong. i will buy again good price and good results</li>
    <li> As described. It is acid so use with caution and apply with the tip of a toothpick, keep baking soda handy in case your skin is overly sensitive.</li>
    <li> BE CAREFUL!  Precision is key it using this product safely, if you miss your target area by even a little bit, the skin will blemish. Less is more when applying.</li>
    <li> This works great I used this to spot treat some dark pigmentation and my darks spots are gone so happy. It does turn your skin brown before you peel but I was able to cover it up when I needed to go out in public. It took 5 days to peel but it was worth it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It got rid of whatever holes I had left from picking. I&#x27;m so happy to have used it. It came off on its own in one week, and I used Eucerin Healing Cream every day to keep my skin moist and healthy. It lightened the hyperpigmentation and freckles immensely.</li>
    <li> Seems to work. Use carefully and have patience.  Edit of review. All it really did was take the color out of the mole.</li>
    <li> Yes, ind1eed! the product is awesome works almost instantly, it took only two  applications  and I started noticing results, was a slight burn for a moment after second application, but nothing unbearable.. great product guys!</li>
    <li> The burning  is just what other people comments were,but have not notice a change yet, but will give it another try.</li>
    <li> Must use with cation I have permeant scaring....of burn marks and don&#x27;t use band aids because it makes the burns spread...</li>
    <li> This item worked great! I had to do a few experiments to figure out that one side of my face can tolerate 30% and the other side cannot. Other than it worked just as expected and, I&#x27;m happy with the results it has given me.</li>
    <li> for tattoos I applied a wet base of tca 30% (any strong will scar) encircled by petroleum jelly to keep it from running in unwanted spots. kept the area continuously wet with the tca  for about four minutes still it started to frost the tattoo( this looks similar to the way hydrogen peroxide frost your skin when applied for long periods of time). then i applied a paste of baking soda for one minutes(owww) as a base for the acid. washed off with cold water and kept a band-aid with a+d ointment applied to the tattoo. after a week it became hard and started peeling i stopped applying the a+d ointment. after another week it was healed up and once the skin returned to an almost normal color, I reapplied starting from the beginning. it will be a long process but after three applications my stick and poke tattoos are defiantly much lighter and I&#x27;m not getting any chemical burns or scarring.</li>
    <li> it was an acid.it worked,hard to become rhapsodic over a chemical(unless it&#x27;s &amp;#34;one of those funny kind &amp;#34; :)</li>
    <li> I am using this for tattoo removal and I have to say that it has faded my tattoo a lot. It does burn quite a bit but a baking soda and water paste soothes it and stops the burning immediately!</li>
    <li> when i opened the package the label on the outside had turned black and peeled off along with a puddle of acid on the bottom.</li>
    <li> This product works as discribed.  Low to moderate stinging as to be expected.  100% recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Caution- not for children.</li>
