      <li>Great price, too.</li>

      <li>This product smells great and seems to do the job.</li>
      <li>Product was great.</li>
      <li>Works great to protect my hair.</li>
      <li>This is GREAT stuff</li>
      <li>I tried to convince myself that it was great</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy but does a good job.</li>
      <li>The product is good but the bottle was leaking when it arrived.</li>
      <li>so I thought it will be exceptionally good.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>When I first bought this I told myself this was the best because it was pricier and it will protect my hair from drying out from the hair dryer or the straightening iron.</li>
      <li>I use it with hot rollers and/or curling irons, and it does the best job of encouraging my stubborn hair to curl -- and HOLD that curl -- every day, without damage.</li>
      <li>This is really great for fine hair that tends to frizz when blow-dried.</li>
      <li>Not a deal breaker, but kind of annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very strong chemical smell.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>The one thing I know for certain is that the smell is great.  </li>
      <li>I wish the spray was a bit more defused.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, and it works well in keeping a nice smooth finish.</li>
      <li>I stopped using Nexxus Heat Promend because it did not have anything more that it did to my hair than another brand.</li>
      <li>This brand seems just okay to me.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better products out there.</li>
      <li>The bottle with the trigger drips a bit, but my last order was a pump bottle and works great!</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about 3 years now and love it.  </li>
      <li>A product I could use with the serums and texturizing spray I already use without it becoming the spray that broke</li>
      <li>I know that when I use this it will make my hair so easy to manage .  </li>
      <li>(I have baby fine hair.)  </li>
      <li>The spray smells nice and makes my hair very soft.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything special.</li>
      <li>This is light, smells nice and fresh, and makes my hair silky soft.</li>
      <li>Nice product hair is soft</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve found that to be true.</li>
      <li>Then I tried a much cheaper brand that I got from walmart and believe me it worked much better than this.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a heat-protectant that didn&#x27;t smell too powerful and didn&#x27;t give my hair a waxy look, thus making it darker in appearance.</li>
      <li>It gives a nice extra layer of protection and shine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s in pretty good shape, but is colored, on the dry side, and a bit heat-damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have very fine fragile hair that breaks when you look at it</li>
      <li>funny</li>
      <li>It smells funny and that smell rolls with you all day.</li>
      <li>Hope it holds up better next time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used several heat protection sprays and this one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>It protects my hair when I use my hot iron.</li>
      <li>It seems to make drying time much shorter.</li>
      <li>It takes only a light spritz and does not cause any build up.  </li>
      <li>Just know that it is very &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, so I let it absorb for a minute after spraying before I pick up my curling</li>
      <li>I bought this hoping it would protect my hair from split ends, which would help it get longer faster as I wouldn&#x27;t have to cut it as much.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>If i am going to flat iron or curl i apply another light spritz before using them.  </li>
      <li>The main reason is because it is alcohol-free.</li>
      <li>I bought a second bottle just to make sure but saw no obvious effect.</li>
      <li>The trigger broke off of the last bottle i purchased the very first time I used it.</li>
      <li>This product helps keep my real hair and my Remy (real) hair smooth without the harsh use of alcohol.</li>
      <li>I spritz a few sprays all over, mostly on the ends</li>
      <li>Protects your hair much more than comparable products and does not make stiff with continued use.</li>
      <li>My friends and stylists say my hair does look very healthy, even though I&#x27;ve dyed it and used a flat iron everyday, so</li>
      <li>To get it to curl nearly takes an act of God -- with assistance from Nexxus Heat Promend!</li>
      <li>suggest following it up with Redken Smooth Down Heat Glide before using the heat tools.</li>
      <li>I have very thick, fine and straight hair.</li>
      <li>forgot to come to work that day apparently.</li>
      <li>I tried new styling tools, multiple &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; products, and was even concerned I had a medical issue and then decided to give this a shot.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but in reality by the time I was done with the first bottle I saw less of an effect.</li>
      <li>I use this with the Nexxus Promend and Emergencee line and my hair always looks much healthier than when using other product.</li>
      <li>I like it so much that I plan to purchase the rest of the product line once my other shampoo/conditioners run out.</li>
      <li>year and a half later, my hair is healthy and thick and is no longer breaking off constantly.</li>

<li> Hard to say whether it&#x27;s really protecting my hair from damage, but I like the conditioning and detangling aspects.  </li>
<li> Long term</li>
<li> Received this item with the bottle completely empty of any actual contents.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll keep using this product, probably because it lasts so long</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a heat shield that would simply protect my hair WITHOUT doing anything else, especially weighing it down or making it greasy.</li>

<li> It makes my hair shiny and soft instead of dull and frizzy.</li>

<li> have thick, coarse, wavy, white girl hair.</li>
<li> It does the job as well as all the other brands I have tried.</li>

<li> only complaint:</li>
<li> Love the spray, hate the bottle.  </li>
<li> /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.</li>
<li> I was concerned that using both would weigh my hair down.  </li>
<li> I blow dry my hair and usually use a straightening iron as well</li>
<li> My pony tail had litterally gone to about half the thickness because my hair was so damaged and was breaking.</li>
<li> I gave this a 4 because the trigger has broken off of the last 2 bottles of product that i have purchased.</li>
<li> There&#x27;s no strong odor either.</li>
<li> If I am spending hundreds of dollars coloring my hair, it is pointless to have a knockoff product for heat protection.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately I am unable to comment on the actual effectiveness of this product as a heat protectant because whomever&#x27;s job</li>
<li> /&gt;Very subtle smell.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s subtle and pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Confused.  </li>
<li> I just put it in a small spray bottle now, but it is annoying.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s not greasy but does a good job.</li>
    <li> Works great to protect my hair.</li>
    <li> Very strong chemical smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with the straightening iron. This is more expensive than other brands so I thought it will be exceptionally good. But it&#x27;s not. It does the job as well as all the other brands I have tried. When I first bought this I told myself this was the best because it was pricier and it will protect my hair from drying out from the hair dryer or the straightening iron. I tried to convince myself that it was great but in reality by the time I was done with the first bottle I saw less of an effect. I bought a second bottle just to make sure but saw no obvious effect. Then I tried a much cheaper brand that I got from walmart and believe me it worked much better than this. I stopped using Nexxus Heat Promend because it did not have anything more that it did to my hair than another brand.</li>
    <li> This brand seems just okay to me. I&#x27;m sure there are better products out there. Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything special.</li>
    <li> Love the spray, hate the bottle.  The trigger broke immediately and I had to put the contents in another spray bottle.  The spray smells nice and makes my hair very soft.  Hard to say whether it&#x27;s really protecting my hair from damage, but I like the conditioning and detangling aspects.  Hopefully it&#x27;s also extending the life of my color.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years now and love it.  Smells great and leaves hair shiny.  I have very fine hair, i blow dry part way then apply spray and finish drying.  It seems to make drying time much shorter. If i am going to flat iron or curl i apply another light spritz before using them.  Just dont drench your hair with it or it gets sticky.  The bottle with the trigger drips a bit, but my last order was a pump bottle and works great!</li>
    <li> This product took about two weeks to arrive. Product was great. It comes actually the way it is displayed on the site. I was very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. The main reason is because it is alcohol-free. I have Cold Keratin Infusion Extensions. I also flat-iron my hair almost every day. This product helps keep my real hair and my Remy (real) hair smooth without the harsh use of alcohol. I seriously don&#x27;t want to ever live without it on my shelf!!</li>
    <li> Protects your hair much more than comparable products and does not make stiff with continued use. Nothing can permanently refuse split ends, but this can hold them together so they don&#x27;t continue to split.</li>
    <li> I do like this spray, if only for the peace of mind.  The one thing I know for certain is that the smell is great.  It&#x27;s subtle and pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a pixie about 18 months ago and decided to return to a longer style.  I bought this hoping it would protect my hair from split ends, which would help it get longer faster as I wouldn&#x27;t have to cut it as much. But I always wonder how I can prove it actually works. My friends and stylists say my hair does look very healthy, even though I&#x27;ve dyed it and used a flat iron everyday, so maybe that&#x27;s proof enough (?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t trimmed my hair in over a year and have only found a few split ends recently.  I&#x27;ll keep using this product, probably because it lasts so long and it makes me feel like I&#x27;m making an effort to protect my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a heat shield that would simply protect my hair WITHOUT doing anything else, especially weighing it down or making it greasy. A product I could use with the serums and texturizing spray I already use without it becoming the spray that broke my straw-like-hair&#x27;s back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, coarse, wavy, white girl hair. It&#x27;s in pretty good shape, but is colored, on the dry side, and a bit heat-damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all. In fact, I don&#x27;t feel like I added another product to the mix at all, which is just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very subtle smell. The directions say you can use on wet or dry hair and I&#x27;ve found that to be true. Just know that it is very &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, so I let it absorb for a minute after spraying before I pick up my curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short term: Seems to be keeping my hair from frying. Long term: I&#x27;ll update if I see any evidence to the contrary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint: I wish the spray was a bit more defused. It&#x27;s sort of condensed and streamlike, meaning it concentrates on one area and kinda drenches it. Not a deal breaker, but kind of annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest following it up with Redken Smooth Down Heat Glide before using the heat tools. Just on the ends. It gives a nice extra layer of protection and shine.</li>
    <li> Very good, does the job well.</li>
    <li> Does not protect hair like leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> Confused.  I had a bottle I bought from Ulta, with a manfacturing location of Santa Barbara, CA.  Bought this new one on Amazon a few weeks ago, with a manufacturing location of Trumbull, CT.  The spray smells differently too.  I am not convinced this is a legitimate Nexxus product.  If I am spending hundreds of dollars coloring my hair, it is pointless to have a knockoff product for heat protection.  Not convinced it is even helping my hair at this point.</li>
    <li> I know that when I use this it will make my hair so easy to manage .  It  will also work with the other products to help its manageability .</li>
    <li> This is really great for fine hair that tends to frizz when blow-dried. It makes my hair shiny and soft instead of dull and frizzy.There&#x27;s no strong odor either.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with the Promend Bodify Mousse. I was concerned that using both would weigh my hair down.  (I have baby fine hair.)  It takes only a light spritz and does not cause any build up.  I like it so much that I plan to purchase the rest of the product line once my other shampoo/conditioners run out.</li>
    <li> I like the product itself. It protects my hair when I use my hot iron. My only complaint is that the sprayer broke the first time I used the product. Just transferred the contents to another spray bottle. Am reordering, though, since I like the product. Hope it holds up better next time.</li>
    <li> This definitely does what it needs to. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it is something big. It smells funny and that smell rolls with you all day. Something Nexxus definitely needs to look at.</li>
    <li> Nice product hair is soft</li>
    <li> I was looking for a heat-protectant that didn&#x27;t smell too powerful and didn&#x27;t give my hair a waxy look, thus making it darker in appearance. This is light, smells nice and fresh, and makes my hair silky soft. Great price, too.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, fine and straight hair. To get it to curl nearly takes an act of God -- with assistance from Nexxus Heat Promend! I use it with hot rollers and/or curling irons, and it does the best job of encouraging my stubborn hair to curl -- and HOLD that curl -- every day, without damage. This is GREAT stuff and I hope Nexxus never stops making it!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd bottle of this product in about a year and a half and it has completely saved my hair. I cannot recommend it enough! I blow dry my hair and usually use a straightening iron as well and my hair was brittle and breaking off before this product. My pony tail had litterally gone to about half the thickness because my hair was so damaged and was breaking. I tried new styling tools, multiple &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; products, and was even concerned I had a medical issue and then decided to give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year and a half later, my hair is healthy and thick and is no longer breaking off constantly. I spritz a few sprays all over, mostly on the ends and there is absolutely no noticeable weight or product fee when dry.</li>
    <li> The product is good but the bottle was leaking when it arrived.</li>
    <li> This smells horrible.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and seems to do the job. I have very fine fragile hair that breaks when you look at it funny so no matter how often I trim I still have split ends and frizzy looking hair. I use this with the Nexxus Promend and Emergencee line and my hair always looks much healthier than when using other product. I gave this a 4 because the trigger has broken off of the last 2 bottles of product that i have purchased. I just put it in a small spray bottle now, but it is annoying. The trigger broke off of the last bottle i purchased the very first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Received this item with the bottle completely empty of any actual contents. Paid for heat protection spray and received an empty plastic bottle. Unfortunately I am unable to comment on the actual effectiveness of this product as a heat protectant because whomever&#x27;s job it was to put the product in the product container forgot to come to work that day apparently.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several heat protection sprays and this one is my favorite. I love the smell, and it works well in keeping a nice smooth finish.</li>
