      <li>, it&#x27;s like there is more hair.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff</li>
      <li>I can tell you it does thicken because when I put her hair up in a ponytail I can&#x27;t wrap it around as many times</li>
      <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, this really does leave hair with some impressive volume.</li>
      <li>So glad you did.  </li>

      <li>I have very fine hair that gets oily easily.</li>
      <li>It smells great, is easy to use and very effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>When I first spray it in, it kind of smells like grape Bubble Yum chewing gum, which I would be ok with, but after it dries, it starts smelling like burnt and moldy grape Bubble Yum.</li>
      <li>It also has a yummy sweet smell!</li>
      <li>I went from using two products down to just this product and it works great!</li>
      <li>Hands down the best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I have tried a lot.  </li>

      <li>I have super fine hair that breaks easily.  </li>
      <li>The smell is a bit strong, but smelling like strawberries all day is worth it for the results.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m curious if any others have experienced it.</li>
      <li>This product has a sweet smell of strawberries that lasts through out the day.  </li>
      <li>Not a bad product, not a home run product either.</li>
      <li>The smell is great, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>spray it in even on dry hair and lightly tease my hair to create a lot of volume.&lt;br /&gt;The best way to see its effects is to spray it at the roots on damp hair and then blow dry with a large barrel brush.</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t leave my hair flat and has a nice strawberry scent.</li>
      <li>and you can comb right through and style.  </li>
      <li>Right.  </li>
      <li>and when I spray this in, the comb literally goes right through it.  </li>
      <li>My hair is soft, but easy to style.  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
      <li>the effects of conditioning but volumizing is definitely evident.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as effective of a product as other Tigi brand products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Makes it very soft and super shiny.</li>
      <li>I did not feel that this made any positive impact on my hair at all.</li>
      <li>While it smelled nice, I did not feel a difference in volume and if anything it just weighed my hair down.</li>
      <li>If you spray too much into your hair, it will get crunchy.. like hairspray.    </li>
      <li>Really does what it claims.  </li>
      <li>do not spray in too much</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t plan to repurchase, but did use the whole bottle of this stuff.</li>
      <li>Not sure it is the greatest for detangling little heads, but my daughter still loves it because of the sent.</li>
      <li>Most leave in conditioners weigh down my hair</li>
      <li>This really does work to give you a little bit more volume</li>
      <li>The smell is kind of subtle, so I&#x27;d just catch whiffs of stinky hair off and on all day.  </li>
      <li>Pretty gross.</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference in conditioning my hair or making it softer/stronger.</li>
      <li>As far as the smell....</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>- I can&#x27;t use a lot of eye make-up and what I do use has to be \\&quot;for sensitive</li>
      <li>I too have thin hair, and it leaves my hair nice and soft without flattening it.</li>
      <li>All the other reviews talk about a strawbery smell, but I think it only smells sweet out of the bottle.</li>
      <li>However, there are some major flaws that will stop me from buying it again:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t use this like a detangler - it smells too strong and if you put too much on it never dries and the hair is sticky, it actually makes the tangles worse by the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>, it made my hair feel tacky the first few times I used it.  </li>

<li> , it made my hair feel tacky the first few times I used it.  </li>
<li> Does not leave my thick but very fine hair limp like other conditioners.  </li>
<li> It does work well as a detangler, but it comes at the price of your hair feeling flat and greasy the rest of the day.    </li>
<li> However, the smell seems to change when I dry my hair, and I swear it smells skunkish or something, similar to the smell of marijuana.  </li>
<li> It definitely adds volume and does not make my hair greasy by the end of the day, like other leave in conditioners.  </li>
<li> I spray it in my shoulder length hair, comb it through, and then blow dry it.</li>
<li> and I need to blow dry it.</li>
<li> Once my hair is dry it smells like illicit drugs.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not thick and heavy, so your hair can have a little volume.</li>
<li> I have long, thick, naturally curly hair</li>
<li> I use it on my wet wavy hair and let it air dry</li>
<li> I was getting from living in a very dry climate.</li>
<li> While the increase in volume was VERY noticeable, it didn&#x27;t really help with dry flyaways, and the smell is really bad.  </li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way, so it lasts a long time.  </li>
<li> I really do not feel or see</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell of this product when you are spraying it and while my hair is wet.  </li>
<li> Fluffs and conditions long hair without weighing it down</li>
<li> Sounds weird, but the first couple of days I used this</li>
<li> , however, you will smell like a PrettyPretty Princess, or possibly a pink My Little Pony.  </li>
<li> This product does smell a little like strawberries but be careful</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it all of three times, and I&#x27;ll be pouring the rest of it down the sink.</li>
<li> It provides little if any volume and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel conditioned, but just greasy.  </li>
<li> I used this and it didn&#x27;t add volume to my hair, not even a little bit.</li>
<li> Use sparingly, as even a few sprays made my hair look a little greasy.</li>
<li> It tries really hard to be fruity but to me, it makes my hair smell</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> doesnt feel or smell like the ones i usually buy in the salon. i think its fake or watered down. didnt come sealed.</li>
    <li> I have now used almost an entire bottle.  This product does smell a little like strawberries but be careful do not spray in too much, it made my hair feel tacky the first few times I used it.  You need to lightly mist your hair.  It definitely adds volume and does not make my hair greasy by the end of the day, like other leave in conditioners.  I really do not feel or see the effects of conditioning but volumizing is definitely evident.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing. No blow dryer required for added volume (horray). The smell is a bit strong, but smelling like strawberries all day is worth it for the results. I have very fine hair that gets oily easily. This conditioner does not turn my head into a slick mess, nor is my hair sticky or tacky. Not sure it is the greatest for detangling little heads, but my daughter still loves it because of the sent. Will definitely keep this product stocked from now on.</li>
    <li> This is the only leave in conditioner I will use. It&#x27;s not thick and heavy, so your hair can have a little volume. It smells great. I use it on my wet wavy hair and let it air dry, I have no frizz that way.</li>
    <li> This Bed Head Volumizing Conditioner is all my daughter will use!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I have super fine hair that breaks easily.  This product gives great impressive volume, while protecting and conditioning hair.  It helps with tangles as well.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, and have never used a leave-in conditioner before.  I was afraid it would weigh down my hair.  This product protects my hair, makes it shiny, and adds volume!  The strawberry smell is wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> This product left my hair looking and feeling great, but I can not stand the smell. All the other reviews talk about a strawbery smell, but I think it only smells sweet out of the bottle. Once my hair is dry it smells like illicit drugs. I can&#x27;t go to work smelling like a hippie all day!</li>
    <li> This is one TIGI product that failed me. I did not feel that this made any positive impact on my hair at all. While it smelled nice, I did not feel a difference in volume and if anything it just weighed my hair down. It&#x27;s a 10! is my leave in conditioner of choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every day for years. Great detangler and conditioner, but keeps my hair full. It also has a yummy sweet smell!</li>
    <li> I tried this leave-in conditioner as part of my hunt for something to help tame the frizz I was getting from living in a very dry climate. While the increase in volume was VERY noticeable, it didn&#x27;t really help with dry flyaways, and the smell is really bad.  When I first spray it in, it kind of smells like grape Bubble Yum chewing gum, which I would be ok with, but after it dries, it starts smelling like burnt and moldy grape Bubble Yum. The smell is kind of subtle, so I&#x27;d just catch whiffs of stinky hair off and on all day.  Pretty gross. I&#x27;ve used it all of three times, and I&#x27;ll be pouring the rest of it down the sink. Too bad.</li>
    <li> I used this and it didn&#x27;t add volume to my hair, not even a little bit. It did, however, add a cherry cough drop smell to it which I found disgusting. It does leave in conditioner to protect your hair. I use to have bleach blond hair and this protected it from horrible damage from the sun at the beach. But the smell, just didn&#x27;t cut it for me. I ended up switching back to the Pravana Keratin infusion spray.</li>
    <li> Got this on clearance at Target to avoid paying $27 for Bumble &amp; Bumble Styling Cream on a whim.    DOES seem to make my hair smooth, however, you will smell like a PrettyPretty Princess, or possibly a pink My Little Pony.  It seriously evokes the memories of my childhood, all I smell like is plastic girl toy.  Returning the product tomorrow and washing out hair.  Right.  Now.</li>
    <li> Works great.  A few pumps and you can comb right through and style.  Just difficult to find in local stores. Adds volume and smells yummy!</li>
    <li> This product has a sweet smell of strawberries that lasts through out the day.  I used to get compliments that I smelled nice because of it.  I too have thin hair, and it leaves my hair nice and soft without flattening it. I love this stuff</li>
    <li> I have medium length, chemically-treated, fine hair.  I was hoping this product would do what it is advertised to do...condition while creating volume.  It does neither of these things well.  It provides little if any volume and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel conditioned, but just greasy.  It does work well as a detangler, but it comes at the price of your hair feeling flat and greasy the rest of the day.    As far as the smell....I don&#x27;t mind the smell of this product when you are spraying it and while my hair is wet.  However, the smell seems to change when I dry my hair, and I swear it smells skunkish or something, similar to the smell of marijuana.  Sounds weird, but the first couple of days I used this, I thought people next to me at work and in stores must have been smoking weed.  Finally, I realized it was just my hair.  Not something I want to smell like.</li>
    <li> If you spray too much into your hair, it will get crunchy.. like hairspray.    I noticed maybe a small hint of volumizing, if that.. but no effects of conditioning.     It&#x27;s not as effective of a product as other Tigi brand products that I&#x27;ve used. Not a bad product, not a home run product either. I don&#x27;t plan to repurchase, but did use the whole bottle of this stuff.</li>
    <li> I use this product on days when I need to wash my hair but I don&#x27;t want to use a conditioner in the shower and I need to blow dry it. I spray it in my shoulder length hair, comb it through, and then blow dry it. By the time I&#x27;m done, my hair looks great and has tons of volume.</li>
    <li> This really does work to give you a little bit more volume but I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference in conditioning my hair or making it softer/stronger. Use sparingly, as even a few sprays made my hair look a little greasy.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I have tried a lot.  I have long, thick, naturally curly hair and when I spray this in, the comb literally goes right through it.  If I could give this 100 stars I would.  The smell is great, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Thank you Bed Head!</li>
    <li> I gave it away, I usually like Bed Head products but this stuff made my hair like glue. HATE IT!</li>
    <li> It smells great and worked good as a volumizing product in my hair, but as far as conditioning I will stick with Alterna leave in conditioner spray when I can afford that additional product now and then.</li>
    <li> This product is great for volume and conditioning. I went from using two products down to just this product and it works great!</li>
    <li> Really does what it claims.  Does not leave my thick but very fine hair limp like other conditioners.  My hair is soft, but easy to style.  A little bit goes a long way, so it lasts a long time.  Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s probably my fault I don&#x27;t like this - I needed a detangler for my daughter.  You can&#x27;t use this like a detangler - it smells too strong and if you put too much on it never dries and the hair is sticky, it actually makes the tangles worse by the end of the day.  I can tell you it does thicken because when I put her hair up in a ponytail I can&#x27;t wrap it around as many times, it&#x27;s like there is more hair.</li>
    <li> I just sprayed this stuff through my hair and blow dried it. My hair is wavy and thick I used this just to make my hair even more voluminous, and it does a job well done.</li>
    <li> Always leaves my hair feeling perfect! Makes it very soft and super shiny. Never is it too much and it smells great too!</li>
    <li> This is one of the few products that conditions my hair and also adds volume.  The fragrance is strawberry, but after I started using it, I started smelling pot everywhere I went. It was driving me crazy!!  I finally realized that it was this product.  I had all my friends smell it to confirm too!!  I haven&#x27;t seen any reviews that mention this so I&#x27;m curious if any others have experienced it.</li>
    <li> Fluffs and conditions long hair without weighing it down</li>
    <li> This smells bad! I love the Superstar shampoo but this smells nothing like it. Unfortunately it is just sitting in the cupboard, I could not use it.</li>
    <li> Love it Love it Love it!!!  Smells awesome, works even better!!  I&#x27;ve been using it for years, can&#x27;t go a day without it!!.</li>
    <li> Usually I love the Brand, but I did&#x27;nt like this at all. First of all it smelled really bad, but I tried to give it a chance anyway.I used the product, but the smell made me sick. I actually had to wash it out and start all over. I was really disappointed with this product.  I don&#x27;t know why they could&#x27;nt make it smell nice.</li>
    <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, this really does leave hair with some impressive volume. However, there are some major flaws that will stop me from buying it again:&lt;br /&gt;1) The smell. It seems a lot of people here like it, but personally I have never smelled a hair product so offensive. It tries really hard to be fruity but to me, it makes my hair smell dirty.&lt;br /&gt;2) I have really sensitive eyes - I can&#x27;t use a lot of eye make-up and what I do use has to be \\&quot;for sensitive eyes\\&quot;, but never has a hair product irritated my eyes before. I literally can&#x27;t wear this stuff on the body of my hair unless I&#x27;m planning on pulling it back, otherwise my eyes are red and burning all day!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find so bed head products.  So glad you did.  This is the only leave-in conditioner I can use that doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores so I ordered on-line.  This is an excellent product for baby fine hair like mine.</li>
    <li> THis product works. !! It smells great, is easy to use and very effective.&lt;br /&gt;I spray it in even on dry hair and lightly tease my hair to create a lot of volume.&lt;br /&gt;The best way to see its effects is to spray it at the roots on damp hair and then blow dry with a large barrel brush.</li>
    <li> I tried to refund this product to Amazon...because I am sure something is wrong with it. It smells like burnt electrical wiring. I couldn&#x27;t even get the smell of my hands w/out taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;I would be happy to exchange and give the company the benefit of doubt that this product was tampered with, but had no choice since I was not offered FREE return shipping. I don&#x27;t pay to send back a defective product.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist convinced me to try this product. Most leave in conditioners weigh down my hair so I stay away from them. This product doesn&#x27;t leave my hair flat and has a nice strawberry scent.</li>
