      <li>I love the scent of this product, too.</li>
      <li>love the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It has a lovely, moisturizing lather.</li>
      <li>was actually the best thing I&#x27;ve ever done to it.  </li>
      <li>The Tropical smells ok.  </li>
      <li>Will buy more when I run out.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Pros: natural, no bad ingrediants; smells great; works fairly well</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not quite as nice as the Baby shampoo, but it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightly scented, which is one thing I enjoy when I use it, pleasant but not overpowering; it has a nice lather; it keeps my scalp and my hair feeling fresh and clean without over drying my skin and my hair.  </li>
      <li>my hair had shine, body,was smooth looked and felt healthy.</li>
      <li>It looks fine.</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic -</li>
      <li>Paradise Island Organics seemed to fit the bill.</li>
      <li>started using it because I was running out of my go-to Trade Joe sulfate free shampoo that I stocked up before moving, so I was looking on Amazon for an alternative.  </li>
      <li>, I know), followed by using a rich conditioner for the ends to keep it tangle-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wash it every two to three days as instructed, and my scalp and hair get as clean as I have come to expect from any shampoo.  </li>
      <li>and I was surprised that I was able to comb my hair afterwards!</li>
      <li>Not needing conditioner is true.</li>
      <li>...it makes my scalp SUPER itchy.  </li>
      <li>When I tried this shampoo for the very first time I noticed that my hair got so moisturized.</li>
      <li>But the fact that this shampoo keeps my hair in its natural, healthy shine is plenty good enough for me!!  </li>
      <li>That was a first!</li>
      <li>Thrilling!</li>
      <li>I love that there are no harsh chemicals in this product.</li>
      <li>Granted, PI shampoo costs a lot more than the TJ brand (still the best value IMHO), but I do like it enough to pay the extra for it and obviously to continue using it.  </li>
      <li>: my hair seems to &#x27;catch&#x27; dirt a lot faster; it also gets oily easily (which isn&#x27;t normal for me).</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s worth getting, particularly for someone who has sensitive skin or is looking to use a good quality, natural product.  </li>
      <li>It did make my hair shiny and it feels nice and wonderfully soft like no other shampoo</li>
      <li>Two stars only because the scent was quite lovely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo regularly since May 2014, and I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>I noticed it after the first use.  </li>
      <li>The very first time I ordered from this company and Amazon sent me an old baby shampoo which smelled rancid</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no way around it, my hair needs that extra moisture to smooth it out.  </li>
      <li>I use the baby shampoo on my kids for about a year now and really like it.</li>
      <li>I just need to get the conditioner now although I really don&#x27;t need it....</li>
      <li>I skipped on purpose to see for myself that the claim was for real.</li>
      <li>Absolutely could not believe the difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to use slightly more of this shampoo than I do with other high-end shampoos (Aveda, etc).  </li>
      <li>Camile contacted me and sent me fresh sample from the same shampoo which smelled nothing like the one I first got.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now, and so far my wife, myself, and our two year old have loved it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had my years of coloring my hair regularly, and then tried numerous products to make it &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; healthy.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It feels different than more commercial shampoo.  </li>
      <li>You definitely don&#x27;t have to use a heavy conditioner which is nice.  </li>
      <li>While it does suds up, I need to use quite a bit to get it to the high lathering point while my hair is completely soaked.</li>
      <li>and I am getting old hair now with menopause upon me!  </li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much as far as cleaning my scalp.  </li>
      <li>I found Paradise Island, which appealed to me by its claims for using natural ingredients, and that it is sulfate/paraben/SLS-free, so</li>
      <li>Was pleasantly surprised to have it delivered to my door one day after ordering.</li>
      <li>The price is more than I was used to paying for shampoo, however, it&#x27;s difficult to justify using more toxic substances to wash my family in order to save a few dollars.</li>
      <li>It has safety ingredients and it really moisturizes my extremely dry hair.</li>
      <li>I do not notice any significant change in my hair, so I am not sure I would get it again for the price.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking at all natural hair care, look no further.</li>
      <li>and I barely have to use any.  </li>
      <li>When I look for hair care products, I generally try to pick items that won&#x27;t kill me either immediately or through a delayed reaction some years later.</li>

    <li> Left a film on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  My hair looks and feels great and I feel good knowing it causes no harm to me or to the environment</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle of Paradise Island Shampoo (Tropical scent, if that matters)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it because I was running out of my go-to Trade Joe sulfate free shampoo that I stocked up before moving, so I was looking on Amazon for an alternative.  I found Paradise Island, which appealed to me by its claims for using natural ingredients, and that it is sulfate/paraben/SLS-free, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.

I&#x27;ve had my years of coloring my hair regularly, and then tried numerous products to make it &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; healthy.  Stop coloring/hot styling/putting a bunch of chemicals on my hair was actually the best thing I&#x27;ve ever done to it.  But the fact that this shampoo keeps my hair in its natural, healthy shine is plenty good enough for me!!  :)</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo!  My hair feels softer and fuller than it has in a long time and I am getting old hair now with menopause upon me!  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> need to substitute with another shampoo  hair needs some sulfate</li>
    <li> Smells good, but not at all overpowering. I love that there are no harsh chemicals in this product. It has a lovely, moisturizing lather.</li>

    <li> Absolutely could not believe the difference in my hair. I did not have to use conditioner! What!? Unheard of! Smells so good also. Paradise scent. This is my 3rd order. Gret buy!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I have used so far. My hair looks and feels great.Will buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this shampoo.  I have long thick hair with some natural curl.  I wash it every two to three days as instructed, and my scalp and hair get as clean as I have come to expect from any shampoo.  The Tropical smells ok.

I definitely need a conditioner.  There&#x27;s no way around it, my hair needs that extra moisture to smooth it out.  And since I have to use one from a different line, then it cancels out the scent from this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s worth getting, particularly for someone who has sensitive skin or is looking to use a good quality, natural product.  I will probably hold off on buying this one again until Camille puts out a conditioner or at least a detangler.</li>
    <li> I had a feeling this would be good. Was pleasantly surprised to have it delivered to my door one day after ordering. Thrilling! The result after using this just once gave me the chills... my hair had shine, body,was smooth looked and felt healthy. Not needing conditioner is true. I skipped on purpose to see for myself that the claim was for real. I am impressed and satisfied with this purchase. Wen doesn&#x27;t have anything on these guys. If your hair is having more bad days than ever, this just my do the trick.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this shampoo. I use the baby shampoo on my kids for about a year now and really like it. Got one of this for a gift and finally decided to get one for myself. It smells fantastic - I got the tropical scent and can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents too. It has safety ingredients and it really moisturizes my extremely dry hair. I use a conditioner after shampooing since I can remember... When I tried this shampoo for the very first time I noticed that my hair got so moisturized. I decided to skip on the conditioner and I was surprised that I was able to comb my hair afterwards! That was a first! Since I still like to use a conditioner after shampooing I wished that this company also makes conditioners. I don&#x27;t like putting harmful chemicals on my hair after using this safety shampoo. So glad for companies like this one to keep trying for the better products!&lt;br /&gt;And also... Camile is super nice! The very first time I ordered from this company and Amazon sent me an old baby shampoo which smelled rancid and I&#x27;ve returned it. Camile contacted me and sent me fresh sample from the same shampoo which smelled nothing like the one I first got. And since then I became a Paradise Island customer.... it was about a year ago...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit undecided about this shampoo. It did make my hair shiny and it feels nice and wonderfully soft like no other shampoo but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much as far as cleaning my scalp.  While it does suds up, I need to use quite a bit to get it to the high lathering point while my hair is completely soaked. You definitely don&#x27;t have to use a heavy conditioner which is nice.  I have to use it every other day not the every three days they recommend.  (The company also sent me a small sample of a new formula which cleaned my scalp but dried my hair).</li>
    <li> The shampoo is wonderful!  It smells great, cleans my hair well and I barely have to use any.  I do not notice any significant change in my hair, so I am not sure I would get it again for the price.  I am very happy to have tried it though.  I will probably treat myself to this and eventually try there conditioner every now and then.  I also have the baby shampoo and it also smells wonderful!  It is nice to have products out there that are healthy for you and your baby.</li>
    <li> ...it makes my scalp SUPER itchy.  I noticed it after the first use.  Wanting to make sure it was the shampoo and not something else, I stopped using it for a week and noticed the itching stopped.  I then used it again after that one-week break and...the itching came back in full force  :(  I know finding the perfect shampoo for your hair is all about trial and error, but I&#x27;m still very bummed I wasted $20+.  Two stars only because the scent was quite lovely.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was looking for a shampoo without all the bad ingredients in it.&lt;br /&gt;It feels different than more commercial shampoo.  A small amount soaps up well after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fragrance.  And my hair looks good until I wash it again; it never looks limp like it always did by the second day with the bad- ingredients shampoo.  It looks fine.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used. And it smells like paradise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo regularly since May 2014, and I LOVE IT. My hair -- sometimes flyaway and on the thin side -- feels thicker. Also, this shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip away the color I have done at the salon. I love the scent of this product, too. (I&#x27;ve been using the Tropical Paradise formula.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other sulfate-free shampoos, but this was the only one that didn&#x27;t make my hair feel limp, clumpy and greasy. I&#x27;m not saying this shampoo will perform miracles -- I wish! -- but I can say that Paradise Island Shampoo has helped my hair look and feel better than it has in years.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo in the Tropical Paradise scent and I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase.  My hair is the softest and shiniest it has ever been. I found that I can cut back on the amount of conditioner I was using and now only use a dime-sized amount. I will definitely purchase this shampoo again and am looking forward to trying the other scents also.</li>
