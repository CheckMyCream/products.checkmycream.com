      <li>Like, really easy.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t harden in your hair and easily restyles with a comb.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a water based pomade that works and feels like oil based that washes out easy</li>

      <li>Love this pomade, replaced a drawer full of others.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and wear and executive contour.</li>
      <li>and I could easily see this clashing with my daily scent, but the stuff smells great.</li>
      <li>Got a great pomp and didn&#x27;t use any extra.</li>
      <li>Great medium hold mid shine</li>
      <li>This is a great pomade pain and simple.  </li>
      <li>Tommy boy original works perfectly for styling my executive contour styled hair and has a good enough hold to keep my cow lick under control.</li>
      <li>It washes out super easy.  </li>
      <li>(I&#x27;d guess I used half the jar in about two months with mid-length hair), and does it&#x27;s job as good, and better than most anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
      <li>The thing is, in order for me to get the most out of this pomade, I first need to blowdry my hair (I don&#x27;t like to &amp;#34;have&amp;#34; to blowdry my hair when styling) in order to create volume and then apply this generously and evenly all throughout my hair.</li>
      <li>I love the way the product feels when you first put it in your hair, the way it tingles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping, and great overall product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not flashy, or bright, but it&#x27;s classy</li>
      <li>Everyone tells me how much they love my hair, but they&#x27;re not stuck with it on their head.</li>
      <li>The product lives up to the expectation and the hype I can put this product in my hair and go weld or work in the shop for a full day</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m paying for it because I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to my hair looking a certain way everyday and holding all day and the competition is lack luster at best.</li>
      <li>Teddy Boy Original really has it all; scent, easy application, hold, and washes out.</li>
      <li>Teddy Boy Original really has it all; scent, easy application, hold, and washes out.</li>
      <li>I do like the new updated look, it improves the aesthetics a lot more.</li>
      <li>Overall, this is a pretty good product.  </li>
      <li>But if you have medium length to long hair and want a good slick that you can recomb or finger comb throughout the day this will make you happy.</li>
      <li>This applies smooth and has a decent hold, i&#x27;m not looking for anything with a super hold, but, more of a natural look.  </li>
      <li>The smell is sort of minty fresh ... but</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of pomade for my wavy and very unruly hair but this Original has made me a dedicated customer.</li>
      <li>Boy Original then really blew me away.</li>
      <li>I washed the excess of my hands and it came right off in water being a water</li>
      <li>I washed the excess of my hands and it came right off in water being a water</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s application is good but the results for hold and style ability are second to no other product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>At first, this made me concerned for how well it would hold despite the glowing reviews of it</li>
      <li>Most days it&#x27;s simply unmanagable.</li>
      <li>I actually don&#x27;t even wear cologne on the days I wear this product because of the really refreshing smell.</li>
      <li>First off, the scent is not Bay Rum.</li>
      <li>first opening the tub, I immediately noticed that the pomade itself smells divine.</li>
      <li>Even the instructions say that you should first blowdry your hair.</li>
      <li>Awesome stuff go back and forth with this and the slick.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, has a very good light hold for the style of hair duo I have, has a great smell as well, fixing to buy more</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible, no hold, no shine, just a heavy greasy mess. The reviews &amp; spendy price fooled me, shame on me. It has a tea tree oil mixed with patchouli smell that&#x27;s not very appealing. I&#x27;ll stick with Blvd.nights, lay rite &amp; such. I hope this trash washes out</li>
    <li> Love this pomade, replaced a drawer full of others. My only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; is the smell. Reminds me of some cherry liquid I stole from my parents basement back in high school. I&#x27;ll get over it</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Smells great, feels great! Not too heavy and I can run my fingers through my hair with it still holding its form!</li>
    <li> Best pomade I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few water based, but this one is outstanding. It literally does not harden like a normal water based pomade. I had this product in my hair for an 8 hour work day slicked back, came home and wanted to restyle my hair to go out. It was like I had just put it in my hair, I didn&#x27;t even need water to restyle it. Got a great pomp and didn&#x27;t use any extra. Insane! The smell wasn&#x27;t what I had thought it was going to be though, but that&#x27;s merely a minor setback compared to the product as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> First off, the scent is not Bay Rum. It smells like icy-hot/tooth paste/old school glue. But if your wondering about the hold, it works well. Seems like it wouldnt when you put it in but as the day progresses it settles nicely in your hair for a descent medium light hold depending on your hair type. If you have shorter hair and your looking for that tight pressed side part you might not like this product. But if you have medium length to long hair and want a good slick that you can recomb or finger comb throughout the day this will make you happy. Only downside is the scent.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff go back and forth with this and the slick. smells nice with good hold. Texture is like creamy butter</li>
    <li> Great product! Suggest to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is it! Best thing on the market by far</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of pomade for my wavy and very unruly hair but this Original has made me a dedicated customer.</li>
    <li> Great medium hold mid shine pomade.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on a daily basis and it holds well but also allows for corrections when needed.</li>
    <li> Fabulous WB pomade! It won&#x27;t harden in your hair and easily restyles with a comb. Washes out easily. Awesome hold and scent. This is a game changer in WB pomades. It&#x27;s not a ringing gel. It&#x27;s a cream. You WILL NOT go wrong with this product. Get it!</li>
    <li> This pomade has very little hold in your hair and you smell like an old man all day.</li>
    <li> My hair looks nice for about three hours, then I needto restyle...and restyle again and again throughout the day. The smell is also a bit overpowering (and offputting). I also noticed that my forehead breaks out whenever I style my hair with it. Can&#x27;t really find any good things to say.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this stuff. The smell is great too.</li>
    <li> Kickass pomade, great herbally scent, like a light peppermint, but not like the candy, more like organic-y herbal peppermint you&#x27;d find at a whole-foods or an Adas. Lighter hold and moderate shine but VERY pliable all day long.</li>
    <li> This is a really great hair product. My wife is a hair stylist and has brought me many products to try. I don&#x27;t have the time to list them all, but they are from the typical salon brands not the grocery store type. Prior to finding this product my favorite of the ones recommended online was the suavecito firme which holds really well for a water based product, but also weighed down my fine hair. This product on the other hand has just about the perfect balance for my hair and has a pleasant scent as well. Tommy boy original works perfectly for styling my executive contour styled hair and has a good enough hold to keep my cow lick under control. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering a lot of hair products lately. I&#x27;ve tried waxes, clays, fibers, pomades and just about any other type of product under the sun. In that time, I&#x27;ve used enough shampoo to sink an aircraft carrier trying to remove some of the more stubborn pomades that are seemingly manufactured with superglue, or been able to use my head as a battering ram because my hair would get hard as a rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the other reviewer here, James &amp;#34;The Pomp&amp;#34; brought me to this product as I had been simply violating my debit card trying to find the right hair product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teddy Boy Original is nothing short of 4.5 ounces of pure, unadulterated sorcery. The pomade comes in a nice, but small plastic tub with a twist off lid. It has a very vintage look about it which personally I find really cool. It&#x27;s not flashy, or bright, but it&#x27;s classy and I always had a soft spot for that type of packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first opening the tub, I immediately noticed that the pomade itself smells divine. I won&#x27;t lie I wish it was a little weaker actually since I&#x27;m a cologne wearer and I could easily see this clashing with my daily scent, but the stuff smells great. It&#x27;s a minty, spicy scent and it&#x27;s awesomesauce. So next was to try it out. I scooped out a small dime sized blob of the tub and was surprised how easy it was to scoop out. At first, this made me concerned for how well it would hold despite the glowing reviews of it&#x27;s holding power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teddy Boy Original then really blew me away. Spreading this stuff through my hair was easy. Like, really easy. Sameer is right in that the workability of the product is akin to American Crew Fiber but personally I find it easier to work with. Oh and smells way better. I would vouch that slightly damp hair and/or a wet comb for troublesome areas will help out a bit. I don&#x27;t have a classic pomp, but more of a short pomp where just the front of my hair is slicked back with the rest parted and combed to the side. Teddy Boy was a bit tough to work the front with at first, but a wet comb completely smoothed it out with no troubles. I washed the excess of my hands and it came right off in water being a water soluble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that&#x27;s been in my hair for a while, this stuff holds like a champ. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Teddy Boy Original really has it all; scent, easy application, hold, and washes out. It does all of this with a natural, clean list of ingredients. I really hope Anchors Hair Company stays around and takes off as a company because this product is nothing shy of incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this stuff. Don&#x27;t even think about it just do it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.rted and combed to the side.

    <li> I love this pomade. It&#x27;s very versatile. It does not fight you back when you style with it. Comfort and ease. Even when it washes out. One of my favorite scents as well.</li>
    <li> Definitely a game changer in the water based pomades. I&#x27;ve gotten the best hair days with this baby right here. The container (I bought the 2.5 oz jar) is well made: all plastic except the aluminum lid. I do like the new updated look, it improves the aesthetics a lot more. It&#x27;s a creamy substance that&#x27;s very easy to scoop out and apply on your hair. It gives great shine and fantastic hold that lasts the whole (and very hot) day - it never dries. I can definitely restyle if I so desire, and it leaves your hair feeling soft enough and great; not sticky or hard at all. I must say I love the smell - its a very nice peppermint fragrance that&#x27;s not overpowering.The thing is, in order for me to get the most out of this pomade, I first need to blowdry my hair (I don&#x27;t like to &amp;#34;have&amp;#34; to blowdry my hair when styling) in order to create volume and then apply this generously and evenly all throughout my hair. Even the instructions say that you should first blowdry your hair. I didn&#x27;t give it the 5 stars because I believe there is room for improvement: maybe improving the hold a small bit in order to create more volume and height on your hairstyle. Besides that, I fully recommend this pomade; its the best WB pomade I&#x27;ve currently tried. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this pomade, go right ahead and get the 4 oz jar and as long as you&#x27;re using it for what its meant, you&#x27;re gonna love it.</li>
    <li> I found this product through James (The Pomp on Youtube) After giving it a try, I have to say that I loveeeee this product!! Great hold, just the right amount of shine, and awesome awesome scent. I actually don&#x27;t even wear cologne on the days I wear this product because of the really refreshing smell. I love the way the product feels when you first put it in your hair, the way it tingles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grew tired of drug store products and them not lasting all day, and having a long list of ingredients that just sounded unhealthy. That&#x27;s why I like this product and what this company stands for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Really good hold, similar to American Crew Fiber, and reworkable with water if you want to change in the day.&lt;br /&gt;Really great shine, just the right amount to look healthy and great. Your significant other will want to run their hands through your hair with this one in it ;)&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, awesome scent, and lasts a while too. It just feels so fresh!!&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good price point, considering handmade and the natal ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Washes out easily&lt;br /&gt;Comes with two product stickers and a comb; so you too can be a little hipster and advertise this very unknown product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;May not last THE WHOLE day, depending on how much you have in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also what I love, is the person that shipped it wrote a little handwritten note on the back. That to me, just speaks to the customer service and the care they give to orders! Very fast shipping, and great overall product!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I have been trying out as many pomades and creams as I can until I find the one that works best for me. So far this is the one. I have wavy/curly hair and I was looking for a product that I can run through my hair with my fingers and be on my way. This applies smooth and has a decent hold, i&#x27;m not looking for anything with a super hold, but, more of a natural look.  The small jar I bought first had a strong minty smell that was a little too much at first, the larger jar however, was not as strong for whatever reason, maybe it was less concentrated.</li>
    <li> The hold lasts all day while still keeping your hair malleable. Gives a sweet texture to your hair to give it more dimension, more lines and detail while still looking smooth. Gives your hair a very slight shine.Smells good: like pine; the smell will diminish after your hair dries.&lt;br /&gt;This is not for people that want max hold. That being said, best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used. I buy a jar every other month. It&#x27;s also hand made in Tennessee.</li>
    <li> easy to wash out, easy to style with.  Has a classic spicy / manly smell to it.  One of the major selling points to the water based teddy boy pomades is how easily they wash out, and how soft they make your hair feel.  Im done using hair products that leave my hair feeling burnt out, coarse, sticky, gross, hard to wash out.  Ill be using this for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has held up in rain and humid summer weather.  Easy to restyle with or without water, and style lasts all day.  Can even restyle in the morning if your showering later on your day off.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. would recommend this to anyone. It has all day hold while still being able to comb it with out messing it up. Acts like oil based but washes out like water based.</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a pretty good product.  Hold is medium....I&#x27;ve got finer, straight hair, for comparison purposes.  It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair slicked back all day, not even always half the day.  But for me, I don&#x27;t mind having it hang a little.  Some great aspects of this product- the jar goes a long way, so price is actually pretty reasonable.  It washes out super easy.  I sometimes go a few days without using any shampoo or conditioner, just water, and my hair feels clean still.  Even with the product in, you can definitely tell it&#x27;s there, but it doesn&#x27;t have any dirty feel to it (it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands slimey if you touch it).  If you put it in your hair when it&#x27;s pretty much dry, your hair stays malleable all day.  The only time this stuff really gives me any hassle is in real humid heat, or just overly hot days in general.....but good luck finding any pomade that holds up in heat.  Any other water based pomade I&#x27;ve tried has not worked as well as this stuff.  I&#x27;ve tried Suavecito, Imperial, American Crew (think that&#x27;s water based, if not, it&#x27;s not excessively oily).  I tried oil based ones like Murray&#x27;s and Murray&#x27;s Superlight as well and was left with a head full of grease that looked like I hadn&#x27;t bathed in a week.  Not to mention the excessive hassle of getting the crap off your hands after application, and getting it out of your hair.  Not worth it to me.  In a nutshell, this is a decently priced pomade that lasts quite a while (I&#x27;d guess I used half the jar in about two months with mid-length hair), and does it&#x27;s job as good, and better than most anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Best bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> Great pomade, currently my favorite.</li>
    <li> Maybe for others it might work but for my type of hair i have to keep looking for something else</li>
    <li> I have thin straight hair at medium length and it held my style for about an entire day.  Mind you, I do have to spend some time training the hair into the style that I want and carry a comb with me in case I need to rework it.  Since it is water-based, it washes out easily at the end of the day. This is unlike other wax-based products which tend to leave a thick residue in your hair after a day.  I switched from Gatsby products to this to try it out and I really do like its hold and sheen.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair and I love this product. It has a nice hold and smells great. Works into hair easily. My only complaint is that they need a bigger size!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair product I have ever used. I currently ran out and grabbed something at the store in a pinch and I&#x27;m paying for it because I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to my hair looking a certain way everyday and holding all day and the competition is lack luster at best. I love the fact that this is handmade in America by a small business I encourage everyone to keep supporting small businesses. The product lives up to the expectation and the hype I can put this product in my hair and go weld or work in the shop for a full day and I can run a comb back through it and I&#x27;m back to looking proper in no time.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after several claims that it was the &amp;#34;pomade of pomades&amp;#34; from habitual users. Apart from the hipster name, I&#x27;m honestly not blown away by this product. Yes, it gives a certain degree of hold (light-to-moderate, in my opinion) and can be restyled through the day (a nifty plus), but it doesn&#x27;t give my hair enough hold to keep unwanted waves from appearing and it leaves it looking a little greasy ... and my hair is not greasy! The smell is sort of minty fresh ... but arguably borderline medicinal (the jar it comes in is sort of classic Vicks shape and size, come to think of it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed trying it and I&#x27;ll use it while I have it (in combo with other product to be able to achieve desired volume and hold for my short wavy hair), but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Especially not at that price tag.</li>
    <li> No real hold capabilities. It&#x27;s fine if you have bags of barnet and you literally want to slick your hair back - plus, it does wash out easily enough (unlike Black and White and Dax, etc) but it&#x27;s no where near as good as other products I&#x27;ve tried which offer shine AND hold.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair.  It&#x27;s a blessing and a curse. Everyone tells me how much they love my hair, but they&#x27;re not stuck with it on their head. Most days it&#x27;s simply unmanagable. Anything that will hold it down feels like Rubber Cement, and anything i can run my fingers through either leaves my hands sticky or doesn&#x27;t hold my hair in place. This product is simply great. The smell is very manly, a mix of mint and bay rum.  The hold/shine are respectable, it won&#x27;t give you that Mad Men look but it&#x27;s enough to prevent my afro from creeping back before noon.  You can run your hands through it without them feeling gross. Washes out easily. And best of all it&#x27;s a great value! Only downside is I personally have you use a relative large amount to acheive the same effect as some other products, but again, i have really unruly, voluminous hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great pomade pain and simple.  It&#x27;s application is good but the results for hold and style ability are second to no other product I&#x27;ve used.  It holds throughout the day and is easily restorable with just a little water if you need a touch up.  At the end of the day a simple rib of your fingers through your hair will release the styling easily but won&#x27;t make your hair go wild.  A dedicated staple of my hair arsenal from here on out.</li>
    <li> The scent is like tea tree oil which I&#x27;m not a fan of.  The hold is very weak.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and wear and executive contour. I love this product, it&#x27;s pefrect for my hair and style. It doesn&#x27;t dry out, is easy to comb through and smells great.mwashes right out.</li>
    <li> Works great and it shipped on time!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a water based pomade that works and feels like oil based that washes out easy</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very smooth and easy to apply. Definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> Best Pomade on the market......LOVE IT</li>
