<li> this hair is worth every penny i spent</li>
<li> The hair was good but very thin at the ends</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m a little upset, the hair is full at the top but very thin at the bottom, not good.</li>
<li> and it didn&#x27;t shed a lot, just a little and get at least 3 bundles for a full head.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this hair to anyone, don&#x27;t even waste your time, go to your near by hair store or something.</li>
<li> The long of the courtain is like like 62inch .</li>
<li> The length dwindles with only a few straggling long pieces.  </li>
<li> The hair is very thick and it does not shed much.</li>
<li> really is unprocessed hair that u can dye curl etc</li>
<li> After this hair gets wet</li>
<li> its so soft and thick..</li>
<li> I bought the 18 inch which was really a 14 inch with very thin ends.</li>
<li> i got it in black and the moment i washed them, the water turned purple....</li>
<li> I ordered 3 18in bundles in 1B black.</li>
<li> I decided to give these hair extensions a try after purchasing some for my little sister to make clip-ons.</li>
<li> Half of these negative reviews almost had me not purchase this hair</li>
<li> the curl is NO MORE.</li>
<li> I must say I was a little skeptical when I purchased this product..</li>
<li> At the beauty stores just one bundle of hair this length would be minimum 70$ each and worse quality of hair too.</li>
<li> I was disappointed by how small the bundle was.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s very thin at the ends.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very thin.</li>
<li> Because I cut the wefts I had a bad shedding problem</li>
<li> but it doesn&#x27;t look bad.</li>
<li> BUT, this hair sheds REALLY REALLY bad!</li>
<li> I am very disappointed.  </li>
<li> it was awful.</li>
<li> Worst hair ever an never going to buy anything ever again from this site</li>
<li> I just had a horrible experience with Janet bundle Brazilian hair extensions..</li>
<li> the hair matted and tangled horrible after two weeks of my install..</li>
<li> Three words: Worst.</li>

    <li> Worst hair ever an never going to buy anything ever again from this site</li>
    <li> Half of these negative reviews almost had me not purchase this hair but after I did and went ahead and tested out the hair by coloring it and etc I realized that ppl have no idea wth they&#x27;re talkin about this really is unprocessed hair that u can dye curl etc call me if u dont believe me  I have pictures to back it up 347 470 4115 this hair is worth every penny i spent</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by how small the bundle was. It literally wasn&#x27;t a full bundle by a long shot.  The hair does feel fairly well but for the amount of hair given its worth way less</li>
    <li> This hair was really pretty when installed. BUT, this hair sheds REALLY REALLY bad! After this hair gets wet the curl is NO MORE. Its straight and very unmanageable.</li>
    <li> I order 5 bundles and I only got 2 i would like to no where is the rest of my hair</li>
    <li> Hair was very full, bundles were long and NOT THIN at the ends. Had a smell to it and when I washed it lost some curl but it doesn&#x27;t look bad. Can&#x27;t wait to install. (if you buy,  you&#x27;re not wasting any money)</li>
    <li> Excellent hair! This is my firt time buying hair extensions and they are perfect! The long of the courtain is like like 62inch . Obviously, they are thinner at the ends but it&#x27;s ok. They are just 18inch</li>
    <li> Arrived on time here is ok does frizz alot and I ordered 14,16,18 inches and received 14 inches for all in which I payed additional for more length. However only recieved 14 inches</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very thin. The length dwindles with only a few straggling long pieces.  I am very disappointed.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> the hair is amazing but it wasnt enough and it seem short but ill order more hair from the owner</li>
    <li> The hair was good but very thin at the ends</li>
    <li> Seems like good hair so far</li>
    <li> Love this hair died it and it was perfect and it didn&#x27;t shed a lot, just a little and get at least 3 bundles for a full head.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 18in bundles in 1B black. I haven&#x27;t installed them yet but the hair is very soft and not tangled at all ! Ran my fingers through it and no shedding or tangling. I don&#x27;t plan on dyeing these but the hair is great for the price. At the beauty stores just one bundle of hair this length would be minimum 70$ each and worse quality of hair too. This hair has no weird scent and is great. So far I&#x27;m loving the price for the quality of hair. It&#x27;s better than the overly expensive beauty store hair. The hair is very thick and it does not shed much. With proper care these could probably last a while . Will definately buy again soon !! This is my honest opinion on these! Also these were supposed to be shipped between 9/10/15 -9/25/15 but they were actually shipped today August 25. Very fast shipping</li>
    <li> it was awful. i got it in black and the moment i washed them, the water turned purple....it was crappy the hair and matted a lot</li>
    <li> I must say I was a little skeptical when I purchased this product.. I just had a horrible experience with Janet bundle Brazilian hair extensions.. the hair matted and tangled horrible after two weeks of my install.. and I paid double the price for that hair. I decided to give these hair extensions a try after purchasing some for my little sister to make clip-ons. We absolutely love this hair!!!! I dyed this hair a honey blonde and have not had any issues. its so soft and thick.. I also loved the fact that I got the hair a day before I expected and the distributor left his contact information just in case I had any issues. I give this company and this hair 5 stars !!</li>
    <li> I bought the 18 inch which was really a 14 inch with very thin ends.</li>
    <li> Good texture hair but it looks nothing like the hair on the internet. Just got mines and I&#x27;m a little upset, the hair is full at the top but very thin at the bottom, not good. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this hair to anyone, don&#x27;t even waste your time, go to your near by hair store or something.</li>
    <li> Three words: Worst. Hair. Ever.</li>
