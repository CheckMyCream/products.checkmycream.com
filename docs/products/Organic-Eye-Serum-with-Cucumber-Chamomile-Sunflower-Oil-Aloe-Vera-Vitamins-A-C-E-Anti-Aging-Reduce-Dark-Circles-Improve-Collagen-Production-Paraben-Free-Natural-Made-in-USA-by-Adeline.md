<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for about this product was its consistency.  One full pump provided a bit too much watery serum to be applied.  Eventually I learned to control the amount I wanted for use.  It went on very wet but it did seep in rather quickly leaving a slightly shiny look underneath the eye.  If you apply makeup or concealer on top of the product it may cause a reaction that will flake off the makeup, as I noticed this with a few liquid concealers I use, but not all.  I applied it both morning an night and within a few uses I noticed how soft the skin around my eyes were and it definitely helped reduce puffiness.  Within a few weeks a few of my more noticeable wrinkles around my eyes had been diminished but not completely wiped away and it slightly (emphasis on slightly) reduced my dark circles.  I really enjoyed this product but would probably prefer it in a less watery form, maybe like a cream. I would buy it.  I received this product for free via Adeline and Tomoson to try, review, and supply my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Delivery:&lt;br /&gt;Since this product was bought through Amazon the delivery was quick and easy. I got the product in two days as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;Adeline has put a lot of thought into their packaging design and it shows. The bottle is wonderful and sleek and anyone who is into packaging design will be impressed with this display.&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;Such a powerhouse of a product that I can use just a tiny amount (like half a pump or so) for both eyes and still have results Two weeks into using this product I noticed how my eyes have improved. No more puffiness for me! The eye cream has a wonderful texture and is a wonderful quality for an organic product.&lt;br /&gt;The best part I think is that the cream is not too watery like a lot of other organic creams and it does not irritate my very sensitive skin! If you have sensitive skin and are looking for an organic product you can stop searching and buy now!&lt;br /&gt;Other:&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product for free as a sample and my review/opinion is my own.</li>
    <li> The product is OK.  I just don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> I do see some results around my eyes, it brighten the under eye. I been using it for a month now.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid twenties, and I recently started noticing that I have dark circles. I never used to have any, so I really wasn&#x27;t sure how to go about dealing with it. I have been using this serum for about a month now, and I have some pretty nice results so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mild darkening of the skin under my eyes, not enough where I need to use concealer, but enough to make me notice them. I use this in the morning during my skincare routine. A little goes a long way for me. The serum has a nice light cucumber scent which I really enjoy. Its very soothing and calming. As I said I have been using this for about a month. I have noticed that the darker areas are becoming less visible and my eye area just looks much more awake and bright. I cannot comment about how this works with wrinkles since I don&#x27;t have any thankfully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently still using this, and look forward to seeing what results I reach after using a whole bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> Works well on eye wrinkles</li>
    <li> I had a chance to review the Organic eye serum by Adelne. All that it takes is 1 push of the bottle and that is enough for the eyes, so the bottle will last you for sometime. It kept my eyes looking like I had slept for 8 hrs straight, and they looked soft without having to add makeup to my face. I love the bottle that it came in, it would work perfect for giving as a gift to someone, I know that I will be buying a bottle for my mom to go in her beauty basket that I&#x27;m making her for Christmas. I would recommend it to those that get puffy eyes or have fine lines etc.</li>
    <li> Adeline Organic Eye Serum is awesome! I have suffered with dark circles and bags under my eyes all of my life, at last to me it seems that way. The eye serum is very soothing under my eyes, it did not irritate my eye area and I love the feel of it on my delicate eye area. My dark circles are fading and the puffiness is not as pronounced as it used to be. I like the fact that the product is naturally paraben and alcohol free and a plus is that it is made in the USA. I feel like my eyes look brighter and more alert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received product free for my unbiased opinion*</li>
    <li> Great eye serum!  I noticed a difference in just a few uses.  It feels so good to my skin and my bags under my eyes disappear.</li>
    <li> Adeline offers an organic eye serum that comes in at #20 on Amazon&#x27;s best selling list for eye serums. Not half bad!&lt;br /&gt;The brand promises:&lt;br /&gt;  the reduction of crow&#x27;s feet and fine lines&lt;br /&gt;  the reduction of dark circles under the eyes&lt;br /&gt;  a healthier and youthful glow (no makeup necessary!)&lt;br /&gt;  protection of your skin thanks to antioxidant vitamins&lt;br /&gt;  eliminate brown spots and discoloration&lt;br /&gt;  reduce inflammation&lt;br /&gt;  improve clarity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND THE BEST PART:&lt;br /&gt;a RISK FREE guarantee so that even if you use the entire bottle and are still not satisfied, they will issue a full refund! So what do you really have to lose except time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ---&lt;br /&gt;So, what did I think?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I definitely saw a reduction of dark circles (a result of poor sleep) under my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;  The serum is clear, goes on smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t have any noticeable smell (all good things).&lt;br /&gt;  I have sensitive skin and eyes and did experience some MINOR irritation at first but it is not something that interferes with my day-to-day life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4-1-1:&lt;br /&gt;Price: $35.25 (money back guarantee)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Deionized Water, Glycerin, Glycerin*, Cucumber Extract, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Chamomile Extract, Eyebright Extract*, Potassium Sorbate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice*, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil*, Arctostaphylos Uva Ursi Leaf Extract*. *Organic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To buy or not: I have previously reviewed other Azure Cucumber Eye Brightening Gel that comes in as #1 in eye treatment serums at $19.95. So if you are looking for a new product to test and money is an issue, I would suggest giving Azure a try first. But again, I did see improvements using Adeline&#x27;s eye serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was gifted the Adeline organic eye serum for review purposes however all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This is a small family run business with great products. I love this product and the way it makes my face feel. I use the eye serum, the hyaluronic acid and the moisturizer. It makes my skin look great. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION.</li>
    <li> I saw a 5 star rating for this product which is really hard to find on skin care products so was anxious to read reviews.  I cannot buy this product because every review seems contrived and written by someone paid by the manufacturer.  Dying to find an effective eye cream to prevent early signs of  aging. Want this to be it but looking for honest info.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I love the way my skin feels firm around my eyes along with how even without makeup my under eye skin looks so much healthier while the puffiness is gone.  Love the chemical free and organic elements.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this eye serum. Just like the Adeline Hyaluronic Acid Serum this is a gel based product. I am used to eye products being in the form of a cream so I was pleased to find an eye gel. It has no smell what so ever and best of all, it does NOT burn my eyes. Unfortunately most eye products burn my eyes and the skin around it, that I have to be extremely careful. I will be honest.... I was scared to try this just for that fact but I am so happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can literally feel the skin tightening and I think that over time this stuff could really smooth out all the fine lines I have around my eyes. I have not been using it that long, but in the short amount of time I have had this product I can already feel a slight difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed more and more lines appearing around my eyes and on my forehead lately. I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s either laugh lines or squint lines, both of which I don&#x27;t want more of! I received Adeline&#x27;s Organic Eye Serum, and I have to say so far I&#x27;ve been impressed. The product is made from organic materials, it is a clear gel with no fragrance that leaves no residue behind. It&#x27;s also made in the US, which is a plus (supporting &#x27;local&#x27; products). There is a caution that it may &#x27;tingle&#x27; for some people, but I had no issue with it. It also states that along with renewing your skin, it helps minimize dark spots. I&#x27;ve not tried this product for that yet, but do have a spot on my face that I will be testing it on.</li>
    <li> Loved it. Will buy again</li>
    <li> MOISTURIZE skin around your eyes&lt;br /&gt;REDUCE dark circles under your eyes&lt;br /&gt;ELIMINATE brown spots and discoloration, reduce inflammation, improve clarity and tone&lt;br /&gt;PROTECT the skin around your eyes from dangerous and unsightly damage with antioxidant vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Adeline Organic Eye Serum in exchange to my opines review. I apply for this product for my mom because she alway try to look more younger. The Serum comes in a beautiful package, the  bottle containing 15ml of the gel. It is very simple to apply before you go to bed wash your face and apply the serum in the morning you will felt like new. My mom love this product she has use two time so far .If you want to eliminate dark cirle under your eyes this is a good product.</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used an eye cream, but I have used the healing properties of aloe and cucumber separately, which is what intrigued me about this product. One great thing about the product is it&#x27;s very mild. Absolutely no burning or uncomfortable tightening. This product gives you more bang for your buck as a little goes a long way. For both eyes you only need a pump on your index finger, about the size of a pea, maybe less!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this serum, I have found my face looks so much better when I use this serum before a moisturizer.  My skin looks smooth and healthy, moisturized and the fine lines around my eyes are more &amp;#34;puffed up&amp;#34; and so less visible.  It is not sticky and has no scent, I am in love with this serum.</li>
    <li> This to is very good wrinkles are gone and puffiness is gone to even the little red vines around the eye lids are almost gone as well ladies this is a good eye serum and does not mess with your eyes also eye lids are little firmer also with continued use I know that I will see great results no need for eye lid lift surgery and by the way I am 58 yr. old lady and I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> After sacrificing some sleep for study time last week I was glad that I had this product to perk up those under eyes. The eye serum smells very fresh and is almost not even scented at all. You only need a small amount of this product to cover underneath both of your eyes because it spreads like crazy. It has a nice gel-like consistency and is cool and refreshing on the skin. I did notice within a minute the disappearance of my under-eye bags after using this product. I have used the under-eye roller sticks before and I have had mixed results with these. Sometimes the sticks work like magic and other times I still look zombie-like after application. Luckily, this product worked nicely for me each time and dried within a minute after application. So if you suffer from those baggy eyes in the morning or are trying to reduce aging in this area, I highly recommend this product. Disclaimer: I was asked to review this product for free.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to review 3 Adeline skin care products, including: Hyaluronic Acid Serum, Anti-Aging Moisturizer with Matrixyl and the Organic Eye Serum, with the sole purpose of sharing my unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Purchasing Experience: A+&lt;br /&gt;I always love when I can find a product on Amazon because I think that it just immediately makes the purchase experience better than other retailers right from the start. The same applies here. I ordered all three Adeline products and received the product super quickly through Prime shipping, in just 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Packaging and First Impression: A+&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was good, with each bottle arriving in a smaller box. The bottles are nice – good quality material with the pumps on each functioning as expected. The labeling and overall appearance gives the product a classy look, and I enjoyed using them daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Review: A&lt;br /&gt;I am very blessed to come from a long line of women in my family who are all quite youthful in their appearance. Much to my children’s chagrin, most people are shocked to know that I have a 19, 16 and 14 year old – or that I am bordering 38 years old. I love the fact that my skin is still fairly youthful – and that I am not knee deep in researching or trying everything under the sun to battle wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that – I was eager to try a new skin care line as the years are passing quickly and it never hurts to be prepared or to be proactive. I was truly impressed by all 3 of these products, and would highly recommend that they be used in unison. The Hyaluronic Acid Serum goes on smoothly and leaves your skin feeling tighter, clearer and refreshed. There were times before I added the Anti-Aging Moisturizer with Matrixyl into the mix that my skin felt a touch dry, but that would be expected with this type of treatment. Once I added in the moisturizer – it was the perfect balance that my skin was craving. I also want to share that,even at 37 – I still fall victim to acne breakouts. My skin has never been clearer since using all 3 of these products! Even if I never produce a wrinkle, I would still use Adeline because my skin is super clear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite product of the 3 is the Organic Eye Serum. I am so not a morning person and often wake up groggy with bags under my eyes and my hair standing on end. No – this doesn’t fix bed head, but it does fix bags…and awesome-ly at that. You can feel a slight tingle as soon as you apply the Organic Eye Serum and immediately you are assured that it is indeed working. But besides the tingle you can feel a tightness and see the bags begin to disappear. Like magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service: B-&lt;br /&gt;When I first ordered the products, I had done a quick google search on the ingredients. I felt comfortable that there were no animal products used in the making of the Adeline skin care, but I wanted to be certain. I sent a quick email to the company and they replied back stating that their products are never tested on animals (great!) and that they were pretty certain that the ingredients were not animal based. I would have appreciated a firm yes/no or let me find out – versus a “pretty certain”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend? Yes&lt;br /&gt;I had a great experience with the 3 products being used together and would recommend doing the same.</li>
    <li> In my quest to have more natural, organic products in my beauty routine- I am definitely pleased with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients include cucumber, chamomile, aloe, sunflower seed oil, and uva ursi leaf extracts. Awesome! The smell is very light and organic smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, the greatest thing about this eye serum is the fact that you literally need the tiniest amount around your eyes for results. This 15 ml bottle is going to last me quite a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately upon application, you get a little bit of tingling and actually a firming feeling. That was incredibly surprising and awesome- I&#x27;ve never had such immediate, strong results from an eye gel before. I&#x27;m kind of tempted to start using this on my whole face.</li>
    <li> Serums for the eye are pretty new to me. I&#x27;ve tried several - gels, semi-gels, and now the Adeline Organic Eye Serum which is a somewhat liquid product. It is a \\&quot;slick\\&quot; liquid that goes on pretty easily. You certainly doesn&#x27;t need to use much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found, in comparison, that the serum works better than creams when used at bedtime. I simply like the way my eyes feel and look in the morning after using a serum than after using a cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Adeline Organic Eye Serum is very pleasant to use. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of weeks and found it beneficial. It is nice to know that the ingredients are organic and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review. No compensation was received. Opinions expressed are solely my own.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes around my eyes. I can&#x27;t say I like it that much.</li>
    <li> the product is good so far...leave the skin around my eyes refresh at night. Still have those annoying deep wrinkles (crow lines) around my eyes that only goes away with Botox. As a prevention product to avoid future wrinkles would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Organic Eye Serum for about 3 weeks, and although that hasn&#x27;t been enough time to verify the full benefits claimed by the manufacture, I can say it goes on very smooth, and my skin under my eyes looks very refreshed after I apply the serum.  I especially like that the Organic Eye Serum is alcohol-free and paraben-free! The item claims to be organic, but I couldn&#x27;t actually verify this other than the ingredient list states *organic.  But the fact it&#x27;s not full of un-needed chemicals makes me happy.  The shipping from Amazon was very fast, and the bottle and box presentation are nice.  DISCLAIMER:  I received the product mentioned above complimentary for review and testing purposes.

    <li> Nothing special.  Feels like I am rubbing water on my eyes which are dry.  Do not buy.  Just put tap water on your eyes and you will have the same product.</li>
    <li> This eye serum is very nice. It is clear has little to no smell. You get the cooling sensation around your eyes. You can feel it working. There is a slick non greasy feel to the serum. It&#x27;s also not watery, but thick. When it absorbs quickly into your eye area it feels super soft. The ingredients are natural from what I can read and organic. The packaging is nice also.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product to review. I wasn&#x27;t paid to review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I would like to start by saying that I got this product to review but everything I tell you is my option. This product works well with the other products in the line not alone. The packaging is amazing and I like to look at it. I got this product for my aunt and she’s 63 years old and needs something to stop or slow down the aging. She told me that the product is easy to use and that it smells clean to her.Fine lines and wrinkles faded a little over a week.The product leaves skin nourished, soft &amp; smooth which is something she looks for in a skin care product.There are additional Serum with Aloe, Cucumber Extract, Chamomile Extract, Antioxidant Vitamins A, C, E. We have the following products Adeline Organic Eye Serum, Hyaluronic Acid Serum and Anti-Aging Moisturizer. She didn&#x27;t think that the product would work the way it has and the products to together are amazing.This product is lines around your eyes and we can both say that it works and couldn&#x27;t be happier. My aunt feels so much better about her eyes and the wrinkles are not hardly there anymore after a week. You don’t need much of the product to apply to your eye area and make sure the product doesn&#x27;t get into your eyes. My aunt’s eyes pop now and everyone is looking at her eyes not the big wrinkles. This product helped me Sunday apply her makeup and it stayed all day which never has happened to her. I would tell someone thinking about ordering this product used to reduce wrinkles, and fine duct to order it but the order the other items to get the best results. This product is in a smaller bottle which is the other down side. The fact that it’s made in the USA is a plus as well. This product did make her feel oily for a while.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an eye serum that actually delivers Adeline Organic Eye Serum is just what you need. I&#x27;ve been using this little miracle worker for about 2 weeks &amp; absolutely LOVE it. I am currently in my 3rd trimester into my pregnancy &amp; sleep has become very scarce which resulted in dark circles &amp; puffiness, after just two days of using this organic eye serum I noticed a drastic change in the circles &amp; a complete reduction in the puffy eyes. Within 3 days of use my dark circles were completely gone. Recently my husband found this in our cabinet &amp; was complaining about his puffy eyes &amp; I told him this would work, sure enough he was very pleased even after just his first use. My husband as asked me multiple times if I will please order more when we run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Adeline Organic Eye Serum Free of charge in exchange for an unbiased review</li>
    <li> I love the all-natural ingredient list of Adeline’s Organic Eye Serum. It contains Cucumber Extract for moisture and treating lines and wrinkles, Chamomile Extract to soothe the skin around your eyes and reduce puffiness, Aloe Barbadensis leaf juice to improve collagen production and reduce the appearance of wrinkles and crow’s feet, Sunflower Seed Oil which contains Antioxidant Vitamins A, C, and E and Fatty Acids to prevent premature aging and promote new cell growth, and Usa Urvi leaf extract to reduce inflammation and the appearance of brown spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After showering (in the evening), I apply Adeline Organic Eye Serum under and around my eyes and I can immediately feel the skin around my eyes tighten. After the eye serum, I apply Adeline Hyaluronic Acid Serum to my entire face. I love the way my skin feels after using both serums, and I would recommend you purchase these two serums as a pair and use them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
    <li> This eye serum is viscous, with a milky translucence.  It absorbs into the skin quickly, leaving it feeling silky. It has a pleasant fragrance of fresh cucumbers with a hint of aloe vera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does an excellent job soothing and moisturizing the sensitive skin around the eyes and protecting it from loss of moisture.  Regular use will reduce the appearance of fine wrinkles and improve the texture of the skin.  I am also using it on some other areas with irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump cap is easy to use and dispenses a large drop, which is just the right amount to apply.  The glass container holds 15 ml (0.5 oz.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adeline Beauty provided eye serum for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks and so far I enjoy it , however I do see a few drawbacks. I think this should be encouraged for those who want to prevent the signs of aging, not those who expect to reverse it. No product is going to completely reverse the aging process unless it contains very harsh ingredients that are similar to those used in the acidic masks/peels used by dermatologists. Having said that, I really enjoy the fact that this product is organic although I do think it is overpriced. When it&#x27;s on sale at $35 I feel this is reasonable. If you go to your local supermarket or Walmart orTarget , they have anti aging products around $20. At $35 , I would personally rather spend the extra $15 and have my product organic then purchase the cheap Walmart one with added junk and chemicals. I enjoy the consistency, I have oily skin and when I read the word serum on the bottle, I was very hesitant to put it on my skin. Usually the word serum indicates an oily substance. This was not the case at all, it feels great on my skin and gives it a nice and refreshing feel. I also like the fact that I can look on the ingredient list and pronounce every single item. I would purchase this product.I would like to say though that before you trust a review that is four stars and above, click on that person&#x27;s profile and read the other reviews. It sounds like a lot of these people are trying to over sell this product.</li>
    <li> How many times have we all ended up frustrated with the prospect of spending bundles of cash looking for that perfect eye serum? Adeline’s Organic Eye Serum is the product we all need; it’s light on the wallet and packs a heavy punch against those wrinkles, fine lines, puffiness, and dullness. It comes out clear and has no distinct smell. I only need less than a single pump to cover my entire eye region, so I think this product is going to last me a while. It doesn’t overwhelm me with fragrances, as it only has a light and fresh scent of cucumber. I’m a student, so I am often unable to get my full 8 hours of sleep. When I started using this, my eyes were illuminated. People told me how awake and happy I looked! My dark circles were greatly diminished. The serum itself is silky and easy to spread across my eye region. It’s very lightweight and feels incredibly cool and refreshing. It’s perfect for hydration against the harsh winter winds. In my honest opinion, this serum is better than most creams. There’s something about the thickness and texture of creams that sets me off, but this serum has none of those issues. I liked all of the ingredients, especially the cucumber extract and chamomile. I’m so glad I found this product, and I will look forward to adding this serum to my daily beauty regime!</li>
    <li> I am very skeptical of serums and usually believe that the best way to have good skin is to avoid the sun, eat well, and drink lots of water. I still believe that these are minimum daily requirements. However, I am now 50 and, despite having good skin for my age, I do have a fair number of small wrinkles, especially around my eyes. Since I&#x27;m taking care of whatever I can internally, I can only turn to external applications for further improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this to the skin around my eyes after a shower each evening. I would recommend using a tiny amount since it glides on easily and a little goes a very long way, especially over such a limited area. My best guess at this point is that one small bottle will last three months, possibly longer, with daily application as long as you use only what is needed. This is clear, so you can apply it in the morning or evening. I just find it most convenient after a nightly shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for a week and was stunned that it actually does reduce wrinkles and other signs of aging under the eyes. I was surprised because I really have my doubts. It is not a miracle. I don&#x27;t suddenly look 25 again, but it definitely improves the look and quality of your skin around your eyes. If you have some topical damage or dryness, this seems to visibly improve things. I&#x27;d put this on par with much more expensive eye treatments (like L&#x27;occitane, which is amazing, but twice the price of this for a smaller amount).</li>
    <li> I loved this eye serum, it works great, I can feel it really feel it work. It also works great with Adeline&#x27;s Acid Serum. One bottle last a long time when you use it daily.</li>
    <li> No problems with this vendor. Everything came fast and as described.</li>
    <li> This product feels so good on my skin. No burning, no tingling. Instantly reduced puffiness and black circles. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this company!  Adeline has great products that are chemical and additive free!  This is an extremely important thing for me especially when it is for my face!  This company is great to work with and very interested in making sure their customers are happy with their products.  I have tested out other products from them in the past and always had a pleasant experience with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I tested out the Adeline Organic Eye Serum.  This stuff is great for that sensitive skin under the eyes.  It helps reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles as well as reducing the dark circles under the eyes.  Dark circles have always been an issue for me.  After using this product just a few times, I see the skin under my eyes lightening and looking brighter!  I have three young, active children so sleep is not something I get a lot of!  This product helps with puffiness under the eyes and just helps me look more awake then I really am!  Wonderful product, wonderful company.  I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
    <li> I just started using this serum because I heard rave reviews about it. All the celebrities are talking about serum this and serum that so I figured I may as well give in. My face isn&#x27;t in terrible condition. As I am getting older I am seeing the dark circles and fine lines. I love that it is all natural with no parabens or terrible chemicals. I apply a little in the morning and find myself having a nice glow already just after a couple of days. It&#x27;s chalked full of vitamins and minerals so your skin heals nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky with residue. Overall, I am very pleased with this product and will be keeping it around for years to come! I am seeing a decrease in the dark circles and my skin never looked better!!</li>
    <li> This eye Serum works great, just need a tad bit, and smooths well on your eyes underneath. Doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor which is nice. You can apply once or twice a day. I do it in the morning and before bed. The container isn&#x27;t very big, but luckily it covers a small area it will last you three months like it did me.</li>
    <li> I have been very diligently using this serum day and night for two weeks and I&#x27;m pleased with the results so far.  My skin is very sensitive and this serum didn&#x27;t cause any reaction.  It does have a good deal of glycerin which makes the skin feels nice and smooth but takes time for the other ingredients to be absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks, my eyes are a little more supple and not so puffy after a &amp;#34;not so good&amp;#34; night of sleep.  I like that the ingredients are organic and it has uva ursi which is a good anti-inflammatory supplement - I have taken this supplement in capsule from as well.  I have been looking for a little more aid in brightening the skin but have found better (and faster) results with Vit C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long ways.  After two weeks I can hardly tell that I&#x27;ve made a dent in the bottle.  This is going to last me a while.  I am now adding Vit C serum to increase the benefits of brightening the skin around the eyes.  It&#x27;s a good serum to try. I think you will see nice smoothing results fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
    <li> Like many of you, I&#x27;ve spent a bundle looking for that perfect eye cream. I just found mine! You only have to use a 1/2 pump it is so powerful. Has a nice slight smell of cucumber. Not offensive at all. I had a small light brown spot, hardly noticeable cuz it was half in my eyebrow. This took it away. Not any other eye cream did! I now have NO wrinkles, fine lines, puffiness, my eyes look bright, it&#x27;s really amazing! I gave Dave the other eye cream I was trying when I started using this one. Lol. I just can&#x27;t say enough how great this eye cream works! Try it. See for yourself. They stand by their products with a money back guarantee. Oh, and the cust service dept is the greatest! They make sure you are happy and make it right if your not. Impressive. Good luck to all of you! This is what I use with the eye gel. It is my total regime.

    <li> I love it...I want to use it longer to give my opinion.  But so far my skin in eye area improve.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference and its been almost 5 weeks now. Honestly, I m feeling that reviews are not even real.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Fast results!  I will be a returning customer for a very long time.  It really does reduce puffiness under the eyes and also makes skin feel great and supple again.  I really like this product and I have recommended it to my friends.  Thanks so much for a great product!!</li>
    <li> Wow! This is some serious eye cream!! If your looking for something that actually works and within 1 week of using twice a day, morning and evening and I could see a difference and here 3 weeks after usage and there is a definite noticeable difference! Even my husband noticed and never notices anything! You should definitely give this a try! Adenine sent me this for testing purposes and a review on my blog and I think my favorite part is the smell! I am weird with smells and this has a very nice smell, so that was bonus cause most stuff like this has a weird smell! I recommend at least giving this a try, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> i was very disappointed that the item arrived without its own box as on the picture. and smells like some rotten...... yuk.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. So far I have used this product for some days and I have noticed a change under my eyes. I have like this glow affect going and I&#x27;m loving it. Also its easy to use, the pump is very durable. I also like the fact that the serum isn&#x27;t greasy and easy to lather onto skin. I will definitely recommend this product to friends and family...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION AS WELL!</li>
    <li> My wife tried this, and here is her report: She found it soothing. The serum felt very gentle on her skin. She noted it had a smooth texture, neither too thin nor too heavy. She also found it non-irritating. Finally, she liked the sensible packaging.</li>
    <li> I only have to use a small amount to deliver firmness around my eyes!!:-)</li>
    <li> After couple of weeks using, did not see change at all and on top of that i had developed an allargy to this product around my eyes its red.</li>
    <li> To be honest I&#x27;ve never used an eye serum before so I can&#x27;t really compare it, but I like this one a lot. It&#x27;s totally odor free which I think is great for something that goes near your eyes. It soaks into my skin quickly and leaves a subtle light feeling around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this product was cautious because of beauty products I have tried in the past but it really came through. I tried it for a while before leaving a review . I love that product does what it should do. I had dark circles under my eyes and also added on my upper lip and as few days went by, I saw a huge difference. Results wow.&amp;#34;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY UNBIAS REVIEW</li>
    <li> Why are all these reviews packed withing about a week of each other?  Hmmmmm.....</li>
    <li> I loved the scent of this eye serum.  However, for eye serum, it was too thin.........almost watery.  The company saw my review and reimbursed me with no questions asked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week. I notice that the sensitive skin of my eyelids and under-eyes feel much smoother and moisturized. Application is easy and doesn&#x27;t irritate the eye (which is so easy to do).  My &amp;#34;smile&amp;#34; lines are diminishing and the bags under my eyes are lightening and diminishing as well.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that the serum is quickly absorbed by the skin.  I also love the fact that this serum has no scent, it&#x27;s fragrance-free. That&#x27;s a plus for me. I have rather sensitive skin and serum with scents are a problem.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product to facilitate this review. All opinions are my own and are based on my own use of and experience with the item.</li>
    <li> I like this product alot but I wonder if I would get more from a lotion seeing as this is a serum. The other products in the Adeline skincare line are FABULOUS!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome eye serum! Best I&#x27;ve used so far! It feels great when applied and even though I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple weeks, I see improvements. Great product.</li>
    <li> This product does indeed seem awesome and a little goes a long way.  With the pump it&#x27;s hard to control the amount that comes out and perhaps I press too hard leaving me with way too much product on my fingers - going to pump a little softer next time :)</li>
    <li> Up until I received and tried this product {and I did receive this complimentary from Adeline}, I thought I was an eye cream only kind of girl.  This serum has changed my mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a clear liquid serum, much like the same consistency of other serums for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is going to last me forever, as well, because I literally need less than half a pump for each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I will know exactly when I will need more as you can see how much of the product you have used since the middle of the bottle is clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And speaking of the packaging, it is so slick.  The middle of the bottle is clear, but the rest is done is this silver, stainless-steel-like look.  It feels so fancy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, of course, I love that it has a pump!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was dealing with my typical winter dry eyes when I received this serum {you know, right at the corners of your eyes where it gets dry if you tear up from the cold weather and then those tears essentially freeze on your face}.  The instant I put this on, that cleared right up!  But, I am really looking forward to using this as my eye \\&quot;cream\\&quot; come summer as it is going to be the perfect cooling, soothing thing to put around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 5 days now and I love it. The serum helped reduce the puffiness around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It has a light smell of cucumbers so if you enjoy that smell you will love this eye Serum. Very easy to use, put on before you go to bed and after removing your make up on a nice clean face &amp; it works the magic while you sleep. It was very gentle on my skin, most eye serums i find are greasy and to heavy on my skin around my eyes and causes a break out. This didn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION</li>
    <li> I used as instructed but did not notice any improvement or results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a bit leery of eye serums, having used a few in the past that actually made my eyes look puffier and even darker.  This one however was a pleasant surprise.  It took a week or so of use for it to kick in, but once it did the results were awesome!  The darkness of my circles started to lighten and the wrinkles started to smooth out.  If it wasn&#x27;t for my thinning hair (that&#x27;s a whole other issue) I&#x27;d feel like I was 20 again!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I just started using this serum because I heard rave reviews about it. All the celebrities are talking about serum this and serum that so I figured I may as well give in. My face isn&#x27;t in terrible condition. I&#x27;m only 25 and don&#x27;t actually need a serum but I do want to take care of my skin before it does start aging. The scent is very nice with a hint of cucumber. Not overly powerful but not too dull. I love that it is all natural with no parabens or terrible chemicals. I apply a little in the morning and find myself having a nice glow already just after a couple of days. It&#x27;s chalked full of vitamins and minerals so your skin heals nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky with residue. Overall, I am very pleased with this product and will be keeping it around for years to come!</li>
    <li> This differs from other eye creams I&#x27;ve used lately in a couple of important respects. First, it&#x27;s clear. Second, it absorbs easily into the skin. A lot of the eye creams I&#x27;ve used lately have been white and some of them have been hard to get to absorb. This often results in white/lighter areas around the eyes. Not so with this product. Once you put it on and rub just a little, you can&#x27;t see it. So even if you use this during the day instead of (or in addition to) at night, it won&#x27;t show up. This is especially nice if you have darker or tanned skin, where the extra white from other products can be really noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I know the instructions say to use this once a day, but I typically use eye products twice a day. I wanted this to be the only one I was using, so I applied it morning and evening. It was completely non-irritating, even after twice-daily use for over a week. And, as long as I let it dry for about five minutes, it didn&#x27;t interfere with eye makeup application (I used it on the browbone and also underneath my eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been sleeping well at all lately, but I think this has helped control the puffiness that results from poor sleep (and also from seasonal allergies!). I&#x27;m 37 and spend most of my time out of the sun, so I don&#x27;t have many fine lines yet, although I think this is fairly moisturizing and helping keep those in check, as well. I don&#x27;t have much of a problem with dark circles, but I&#x27;d been getting them a little bit (I&#x27;ve been stressed lately) and I think I&#x27;m seeing maybe a slight improvement there, as well, although that might be wishful thinking. I can&#x27;t say how well it would work if you have a more significant problem, but I&#x27;m excited about the potential preventive aspects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agree with some of the other reviewers that this is not going to be as dramatic as Botox, despite the claims made on the product page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump is nice because the product is never exposed to air (should prolong the lifetime of the product and prevent bacterial contamination). Don&#x27;t depress the pump all the way and you&#x27;ll get a smaller amount out (you don&#x27;t need the amount from a full pump even to do both eyes). The texture is a little viscous, like a gel (probably from the aloe). One thing I&#x27;m not sure about is that the container isn&#x27;t opaque -- not sure how well the vitamins in this hold up when exposed to light. It&#x27;s probably best to keep this in a dark area like a linen closet or medicine cabinet or drawer to prolong the lifetime of the product, because you use very little at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice a scent (but to be fair, my allergies have been acting up lately and my sense of smell is maybe a little compromised). A lot of the ingredients should be soothing and/or reduce inflammation -- the vitamins, the aloe, chamomile, cucumber extract, etc. You can see a full list of ingredients (provided by the manufacturer, so presumably accurate) in the customer question and answer section on the product page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, do a patch test somewhere out of the way to make sure this won&#x27;t cause a reaction. Also, try not to get it *in* your eyes as that will sting (I know from experience...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with it. I like that it absorbs without leaving residue, and I especially like the anti-puffiness effects. I think for a product in this price range, with a fairly short ingredients list, this is pretty good. I&#x27;m not seeing the most dramatic or instant results ever, but with time, I am definitely maintaining the appearance I&#x27;d like to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.time of the product and prevent bacterial contamination).

    <li> Finally!  An organic eye serum that works!!! Plus it doesn&#x27;t have a horrid smell as most all the others I&#x27;ve tried! I recommend this for all ages.  I&#x27;ve over 60 and I&#x27;ve noticed a definite improvement in the fine lines and puffiness.</li>
    <li> Who wants to get rid of those bags under your eyes and crows feet?  *Waves hand wildly in air*.  Yeah I think we all want that!  This cream will help you accomplish that goal and it is pretty cheap and easy to use.  The packaging is very pretty and it is not a huge bottle and you only need a little bit each time.  With all the vitamins and minerals in this, there is no downside to using it.  Refresh, renew and fortify your eye area by using this just once per day.  The bottle has a top just like soap, you just squeeze the top and squirt a little bit on your finger and apply to the areas around your eyes :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is all natural and organic, no fillers or chemicals that could burn or harm your eyes/skin.  The ingredient list includes Aloe, Cucumber Extract, Chamomile Extract, Antioxidant Vitamins A, C, E plus it is paraben and alcohol free so no drying out.  I used this for a few days before noticing a difference - I have horrible skin on my face - acne, bags, you name it I have it and I am only 38.  It really lightened the bags under my eyes and that is exactly what I wanted.  I would definitely purchase this product again and recommend it to all my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I received a complimentary product in exchange for an open and honest review***</li>
    <li> I bought this for hydration as my eyelids are very dry.  I used it once and it made my eyes swell alarmingly and turned the whites of my eyes bright red.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of facial products in my life and never had a reaction like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed this company is Malaysian and wonder if it is manufactured there.  If so, I wonder if the list of ingredients is accurate.  Anyway, I think these sorts of products should be independently tested by a U.S. laboratory.  In the meantime, buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I received a free bottle of this from the merchant and had my mother test it out for me so I could review it for my blog. My 57-year old mother always used eye creams but I don&#x27;t think she was using the right kind to handle her big issues, puffiness and dark circles. She doesn&#x27;t have wrinkles yet so those creams she always used did nothing in my opinion. So I felt she was the best one to use this eye serum since another eye product I was testing handled the concerns I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She liked that this was not sticky and absorbed fast. What amazed her (and me for that matter) was that after the first application it already decreased some of the puffiness under her eyes. It is working on her dark under eye circles but it might take a few more weeks for those to completely diminish. Of course, she is keeping the serum, which is fine by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do know that this works well for puffiness and dark circles. For lines and wrinkles I can&#x27;t tell you about that, though.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it (no pun intended!): No cream or gel can stop skin from aging.  What a serum like this can do, however, is protect and enhance what you have by moisturizing, soothing, tightening, and nourishing.  Tired skin can definitely look better, but nothing short of plastic surgery will permanently tighten it.  This Adeline organic serum works almost as well as the more expensive serums I&#x27;ve tried -- and some are easily three times the cost.  I especially love that my sensitve skin does not react adversely to it -- right there, that&#x27;s a triumph for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is dispensed through a pump, and the right amount comes out every time.  Just pat under and around your eyes.  I even do my lids.  The cucumber extract acts as an astingent to tighten the skin and reduce the appearance of fine lines (they don&#x27;t go away, obviously), and the aloe soothes.  Most of the ingredients are recognizable extracts/plants, while a few other ingredients are more chemical sounding (glycerin, phenoxyethanol, and potassium sorbate).  The only thing I&#x27;m not wild about is that I can feel the serum under my eyes even hours after I&#x27;ve applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the Adeline organic eye serum is the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; at its price point, but it certainly a nice product.  The serum is labeled as &amp;#34;Made in the USA,&amp;#34; with a company headquarters in Iowa.  Note:  I received a sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the eye serum.  It&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin and eyes.  I like that it&#x27;s organic and am looking&lt;br /&gt;forward to it&#x27;s long term effects.  Thanks for your personal contact with me.</li>
    <li> Like the texture. Haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference. Maybe more preventative than repairing.</li>
    <li> The Serum is easy to use. It absorbs quickly and completely. I suffer from dark circles and puffiness around my eyes. This combination of vitamins A, C &amp; E aids collagen synthesis and makes my eyes feel hydrated and more supple. You have got to love the fact that this product is organic. Received This Product For Free In Exchange For My Honest And Unbiased Opinion</li>
    <li> so i am not sure if this is the same product i recieved.I did order the organic eye serum. The bottle and everything looks completely different unless they have changed it. i bought it quite a bit ago. i been using the bottle i have and it&#x27;s helped a tad but not what i was hoping for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and works great!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no stranger to eye products. I naturally have large fat pads under my eyes - just genetics, no fighting that! However, this means that if my eyes are puffy then my eyes look 100x worse and even more tired. This product helps to instantly relieve that puffiness. It&#x27;s like a night of sleep in a bottle for my eyes. It really does moisturizer and smooth while helping me to look more alt and awake. I simply pump out half a pump on the back of my hand, dab my ring finger in the serum, and then dab gently around my entire occipital area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that it&#x27;s a serum and not an eye gel nor cream, allowing for me to easily layer this under my other eye products without too much buildup. Another reason why I love this product is that it&#x27;s organic and free of harsh chemicals. My eyes are very sensitive and if there were any harsh chemicals or unnatural fragrance in this, my eyes would run nonstop. Overall, I will keep using this product, day and night!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now and I love it! It really moisturizes and reduces find lines without feeling heavy. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I enjoy the texture and results of this product.  The serum is cool and viscous, and I notice a difference when I use it.</li>
    <li> This affordable product works wonders. I saw a noticeable difference right away. I will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Love this serum!! I opened the package and started using this right away. The serum is gel-like in consistency and clear. I need one small pump to cover both eyes and based on the size of this bottle I know this will last a long time. The product feels cool and gives me a tightening sensation right away. It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.   Made in the USA!! Ingredients include: Deionized Water, Glycerin, Glycerin*, Cucumber Extract, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Chamomile Extract, Eyebright Extract*, Potassium Sorbate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Helianthus Annus (Sunflower) Seed Oil*, Arctostaphylos Uva Ursi Leaf Extract*. (Ingredients with the * are Organic).   The company says that the Uva Ursi Leaf reduces inflammation and I look for ward to that benefit and the others. The product doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance or dye, so it&#x27;s totally clear and great for sensitive skin around the eyes. I look forward to a long relationship together!   Disclosure: I received a free product to facilitate my review, however the opinions are my own and honest.</li>
    <li> I definitely feel this product firming the skin around my eyes.  It is also very gentle!</li>
    <li> For reviewing purposes, I had a chance to try out Adeline&#x27;s organic eye serum which I still enjoy using. It contains key ingredients like aloe, cucumber extract, chamomile extract and vitamin e that help with the appearance of dark circles. Immediate use of this serum helped soothe my tired, dull eyes. With a week&#x27;s use, my dark circles looked better and less severe.  I also like the easy airless pump bottle which is great for those who have longer nails. Overall, Adeline&#x27;s organic eye serum has been an effective eye serum for me and continues to work.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, just what I was looking for! One drop truly goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I received my Adeline Organic Eye Serum free and for review.  Just as other Adeline Products, the eye serum came in very exquisite packaging.  It is in an airless pump with silver accents.  It would definitely catch my eye and stand out among other products.  The eye serum is easily distributed from the pump and comes in a cool clear serum form.  It is easy to apply and does not burn around the eyes.  It is very gentle which is so important around sensitive eye tissue.  I am a contact lens wearer and with all the tugging and pulling of the skin around my eyes, I have developed some fine wrinkles.  I also have the standard baggy, dark circles.  I applied the eye serum twice daily and noticed a remarkable difference.  It smoothed out my skin and left it less dark.  I especially like he fact that the serum has natural, organic materials, one being cucumber extract. I definitely benefitted from using the product.  I also am impressed that the company uses some of its profits to help dig wells in a community with limited water resources.  It is a win-win for all.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with how well this eye serum has worked for me. I am using it as an eye gel and on the fine lines on the sides of my nose and I must say that it has met all my expectations - and then some. It has worked well and got rid of the dry patches on the corners of my eyes. It has also gotten rid of the dark circles and under my eyes as well as the puffiness. My eyes have been moisturized since I started using this product religiously and I must say that it has made a significant difference even with the way I apply my eye makeup. I don&#x27;t have to worry about dry patches and eye makeup products caking up on various parts of my eyes. Two thumbs up for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying my Adeline Organic Eye Serum. I&#x27;ve began using a couple days ago,  and I already notice the puffing around my eyes has gone down.&lt;br /&gt;I cant wait to see what a month of use does.</li>
    <li> I Love this product! I have very sensitive eyes and have a hard time finding products that don&#x27;t run into my eyes or irritate them. After the 1st use my eyes felt less puffy and tired looking. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week but I&#x27;m already noticing the fine lines and crows feet around my eyes are less noticable. I recieved this product for free in exchage for my unbiased opinion.</li>
