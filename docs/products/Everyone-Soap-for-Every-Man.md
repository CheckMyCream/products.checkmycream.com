      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>They put out a safe product and do not charge you an arm and a leg!</li>
      <li>The soap itself rinses off nicely.</li>

      <li>This is one of the best soaps on the market and it is all natural.</li>
      <li>Excellent, all natural product.  </li>
      <li>I like the coconut flavored one better, but this is a nice change.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I don&#x27;t seem to smell the scent once I&#x27;m out of the shower, but it doesn&#x27;t make showering pleasant.</li>
      <li>Not crazy about the lemon smell, but the product is advertised as lemon so more my fault, but does a great for shaving as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a good size and the pump is super convenient.</li>
      <li>The product is good but the leak wasn&#x27;t fun.</li>
      <li>I love e&amp;o/everyone products.</li>
      <li>Seems to offer a better shave than what I get from shaving get, plus it allows for a better cleaning between multi blade heads.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Love all their soaps.  </li>

      <li>I love this company.</li>
      <li>Love this soap from EO.  </li>
      <li>I love this soap and this brand</li>
      <li>The pump makes it even better for that</li>
      <li>This is not my favorite scent but amazon didn&#x27;t have any others.</li>
      <li>The cucumber gives it a distinctive earthy smell which I guess is supposed to be more manly.  </li>
      <li>Crew hair conditioner (better than most shaving creams, foams or gels).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but the smell wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>I like this soap better than Lab Series shaving cream.</li>
      <li>I like lavender more than this scent.</li>
      <li>the &amp;#34;Cedar and Citrus&amp;#34; scent offered by Everyone Soap is much better.</li>
      <li>I love this soap.</li>
      <li>But maybe sandalwood and patchouli would be more appealing than the herbs or blends they used.</li>
      <li>Pretty good price for a better alternative than SLS.  </li>
      <li>I am super excited!!</li>
      <li>It smells great too in the shower, but the scent doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin, which I like because I just like smelling natural.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see it as a men&#x27;s soap, but good for the whole family.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This does not foam up as much as higher-sulfate, more drying body washes, but does seem to clean well and leave the skin feeling good.  </li>
      <li>Good overall product, nice smell, love that it is free of phthalates and that sort of thing.</li>
      <li>They were all very gentle, cleansing and had a nice smell.</li>
      <li>Smells fine, not too strong.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These EO body washes work fine for washing and body shaving; have not tried them as shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It huge, you get a lot of soap, and it cleans stuff.</li>
      <li>They are fantastic products and the value for the money is also fantastic.</li>
      <li>I feel this is important to point out, given the name of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fortunately, it came in a sealed plastic &amp;#34;envelope&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Great inexpensive soap, I ordered it as a present, but decided to keep it.</li>
      <li>love EO products, and the prices are well worth the product.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe that it was being offered so cheaply.</li>
      <li>cruelty free, paraben free, polysorbate free, disodium EDTA free, gluten free, non-GMO verified, sodium laureth/lauryl sulfate</li>
      <li>It is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Even though it says &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34;, it is really just still great for the whole family.</li>
      <li>Very nice, mild clean scent, natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>clean your body.</li>
      <li>clean your face.</li>
      <li>it smells nothing like cucumber, but it does leave me feeling clean.</li>
      <li>clean your hair.</li>
      <li>I feel fresh, light and clean after my showers.</li>
      <li>TBS full.</li>
      <li>My entire family comments on how good I smell.</li>
      <li>did not work for me as most EO products did really did not like this one</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin like so many soaps do and it leaves my hair super clean with no residue!</li>
      <li>Otherwise the soap is great and 25% less in cost than the stores.</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s for men, but I couldn&#x27;t really smell the cucumber extract and the blend of herbs and spices is not quiet pleasant.</li>
      <li>Luckily the other products were sealed and they smelled good.  </li>
      <li>We batted 3/3 on the scents, this one, the coconut/lemon, and citrus/mint are all very pleasant smelling, unisex, not overwhelming but scented enough to be refreshing in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However it feels wonderful and left are skin soft and not dried out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, but he didn;t like the scent. It doesn;t smell too much like cucumber like I was hoping, but still great for the proce for me!</li>
    <li> Great price on an all purpose product.  I small issue with leakage during delivery</li>
    <li> Like a lot. It&#x27;s taking some time for me to get used to the little foam it creates but I goes along with not using phosphates.</li>
    <li> I love e&amp;o/everyone products. Love them! I was happy to see this listed as an add-on item. I couldn&#x27;t believe that it was being offered so cheaply. Well, it&#x27;s because the scent is horrible. It smells neither like cucumbers nor like lemon. It smells like a hippie-dippie household cleaner. Luckily, I don&#x27;t seem to smell the scent once I&#x27;m out of the shower, but it doesn&#x27;t make showering pleasant.</li>
    <li> Love my Lavender and coconut versions of this product but my whole family thinks this scent is not good.</li>
    <li> Does not smell spectacular, but for $10, and for use as a hand soap, my expectations have been met. Smelled the coconut lemon in a store a few days ago, and will certianly get that next time.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my shampoo. It&#x27;s a good size but you do have to use a bit more to get the same amount of lather as, say your typical shampoo. Smells fine, not too strong.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell of this at all!</li>
    <li> I have used the other well known brands that they sell in local health food stores.  This Everyone company&#x27;s products are SUPERB. Hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever used - - less drying - and can be used on hair and skin. They are fantastic products and the value for the money is also fantastic. You get a quart for about $10. I seriously pray that this company stays in business and keeps making product. I don&#x27;t usually write product reviews on Amazon, but in this case I am doing it because the competition in this niche must be tough and I want this company to survive. The &#x27;scent&#x27; descriptions might sound a bit odd and may be off-putting (maybe the marketing dept. could work on that) - but in reality both bottles I&#x27;ve used (different scents) have been wonderful. My entire family comments on how good I smell. I&#x27;m not a &#x27;cucumber&#x27; fan per se... but I knew that I should probably ignore that and trust that it would be great and it is. Keep up the great work!</li>
    <li> I bought this one for my husband. We use &amp;#34;everybody soap&amp;#34; since a year. We use it for hand soap, shampoo and body wash. I&#x27;ve had citrus and mint, coconut and lemon, and the fruity one for kids. They were all very gentle, cleansing and had a nice smell. This one, however, they need to work on the scent. I know it&#x27;s for men, but I couldn&#x27;t really smell the cucumber extract and the blend of herbs and spices is not quiet pleasant. There is so many natural blends that works, this one doesn&#x27;t for us, We&#x27;ll use it for shampoo and hands not on the whole body...my husband is not going to go for it. The quality of soap is excellent, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But maybe sandalwood and patchouli would be more appealing than the herbs or blends they used. Funny smell...Up to you, if you want to buy.</li>
    <li> Shipping by Anazon LLC. Not too happy.  Package arrived with the soap dispenser unlocked and pushing on the outside of the box. What idiot would pack soap like this.  4 of the 32 oz. was sispensed throughout the box.  Luckily the other products were sealed and they smelled good.  If it doesn&#x27;t fit use a bogger box Amazon!  Otherwise the soap is great and 25% less in cost than the stores.</li>
    <li> Bought this to share with my fiance, so I picked a manly scent to avoid any complaints from him. It does smell manly, but the scent doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin so don&#x27;t worry ladies :) I&#x27;ve used it to shave, as body wash, and as shampoo and it works awesomely for all three purposes. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin like so many soaps do and it leaves my hair super clean with no residue! I would recommend it for anyone, especially those with fine hair like me who don&#x27;t need heavy shampoos.</li>
    <li> I use this for shaving now and will never go back to foams, gels, or -- as I was using the previous year prior to this soap -- Crew hair conditioner (better than most shaving creams, foams or gels). I like this soap better than Lab Series shaving cream. This size is perfect for months worth of hand, face, washing and shaving.</li>
    <li> My son says it smells like he is washing his hair with a salad.  But he doesn&#x27;t mind.  Seems to work well.  Pretty good price for a better alternative than SLS.  Arrived with pump damaged, so we had to put the soap into another container, but no big deal.  I like the coconut flavored one better, but this is a nice change.</li>
    <li> I use as shampoo, body wash AND to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the lather as a wash and shaving soap.  wife loves the scent.  highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My whole family loves and uses this line of all-in-one soap. We decided to try out this one because of the price. Even though it says &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34;, it is really just still great for the whole family. The scent is just not as fruity or floral as the others.</li>
    <li> I use the EveryOne Coconut Lemon Lotion and Everyone 3-in-1 Soap, Lavender plus Aloe they both smell great! This Cucumber and Lemon smells disgusting! I was so disappointed and will never order again. It reminds me of old man cologne Aramis. It&#x27;s really horrible.</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive soap, I ordered it as a present, but decided to keep it. I use it as hand soap.</li>
    <li> never have smelled any thing like.</li>
    <li> Soap smells really nice and isn&#x27;t overpowering. It cleans well but not the best. I use it for almost everything in the bathroom. Shower, shampoo, face and shave. It just does everything.</li>
    <li> The cedar smell did not smell awful but it wasn&#x27;t my family&#x27;s favorite. However it feels wonderful and left are skin soft and not dried out. I have very sensitive skin and I was surprised about not getting a reaction. Deciding to reorder, but the lavender smell instead.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but the smell wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. Too me it smells nothing like cucumber, but it does leave me feeling clean. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this specific product again, but rather try another scent they offer.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells TERRIBLE. I&#x27;ve used some of the other EO everyone soaps in different scents and they were all nice essential oil based scents. This stuff reeks like some terrible mens cologne. It supposedly has no artificial fragrance and is just scented with lemon essential oil and cucumber extract according to the label, but it smells like some sort of cheap men&#x27;s body wash you would get at the drugstore. I&#x27;m having a really hard time believing this is the correct product and hasn&#x27;t been replaced with something else by the seller. Yuck. In the trash it goes!</li>
    <li> This is soap. It works great, gets you clean, doesn&#x27;t smell too fruity and doesn&#x27;t irritate anything. This is not my favorite scent but amazon didn&#x27;t have any others. I prefer the ceder one. This one, indeed, smells like lemons and cucumbers. pretend you are at the spa. Like I said, not offensive by any means. The soap itself is great. It huge, you get a lot of soap, and it cleans stuff. clean your hair. clean your face. clean your body. none of this three different product nonsense. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t just an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I am taking the time to post the ingredients to this soap for your reading pleasure. This is one of the best soaps on the market and it is all natural. There are no garbage ingredients or poisons that the big manufacturers put in their products. Remember, your skin is a sponge and anything that you put on it is absorbed into your blood stream. It IS time to stop using poison products and start supporting companies that put together healthful products for us to use. The price is fantastic due to the amount that you get in the bottle and how long it lasts. I have calculated it to be about $ 3.00 dollars per month. you can&#x27;t buy two bars of disgusting Irish Spring or Dove  or any of the garbage soaps full of poison for that price. Here are a list of ingredients. I have used most scents of this product and my current infatuation is the Coconut and Lemon. The scent just makes you smile because it is so clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  3 in 1: shampoo, body wash, bath - perfect for a cleansing shampoo, invigorating shower and a fragrant, luxurious, bath&lt;br /&gt;  pure and natural - gentle enough for the whole family&lt;br /&gt;  for the informed, practical, value-conscious consumer&lt;br /&gt;  pure essential oils nurture and soothe the skin&lt;br /&gt;  gentle and fragrant with ingredients and essential oils that are pure, natural and organic&lt;br /&gt;  cruelty free, paraben free, polysorbate free, disodium EDTA free, gluten free, non-GMO verified, sodium laureth/lauryl sulfate free.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients found in this product:&lt;br /&gt;Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Coco-Sulfate, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sodium Chloride, Coco-Glucoside, Panthenol, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Oil, Organic Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Extract, EO Organic Herbal Blend [Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf, Organic Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Organic Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, and Organic Camelia Sinensis Leaf Extract], Citric Acid, Sodium Phytate, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, Tocopherolassium Sorbate, Tocopherol</li>
    <li> This soap smells excellent and isn&#x27;t an overpowering smell. The added aloe helped restore my skin from blisters that occurred from weeding. I intend to buy again once I run out. Leaves a lasting scent in my beard as well which has gotten complements.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It&#x27;s not filled with the EWG worst ever chemicals and it suits both me and my male shower partner. The smell is neutral and appealing enough that I would use it even if I didn&#x27;t have a male shower partner. Be aware it will froth a little less than your average drugstore soap (the stuff that makes shower gels froth is not really what you want to be rubbing all over your body) and it also is a very sizable bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this company. They put out a safe product and do not charge you an arm and a leg! I recently purchased this product in the lavender scent. WOW it is my new go-to product. I like lavender more than this scent. (only because it is more feminine.) Great soap and I use it on the whole family. Your skin is your biggest organ! Protect it by using organic and natural skin products!</li>
    <li> Bought mine at Whole Foods. It is fantastic.I will NEVER switch back to chemical shampoo or soap. I have always been looking for something like this and now I have found it.</li>
    <li> The cucumber scent DOES smell a little like a salad :) But I like the soap and it&#x27;s a nice neutral scent that men and women can both use. It doesn&#x27;t really linger on the skin anyway - it rinses clean. I have medium length hair and I also use it as a shampoo from time to time - it works as a nice clarifying wash, leave hair shiny, and lets me save my expensive salon shampoo on occasion.</li>
    <li> Ignore the &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; part, this soap is a good family soap, perfect for the whole family! And as a guy who is happy with a bar of soap washing my hair this works much better :D</li>
    <li> Smells fresh and not overly masculine. I don&#x27;t see it as a men&#x27;s soap, but good for the whole family. Good soap to use in a shared bathroom so that products don&#x27;t clutter the shower.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m officially a fan. I can use it on my hair, on my face, for shaving, and for body wash. I literally just have this, conditioner, and some scrubbing face wash.  Love it! It smells great too in the shower, but the scent doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin, which I like because I just like smelling natural.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, hence why I use it on my face, and it suds really well. It&#x27;s also a good size and the pump is super convenient. I literally couldn&#x27;t think of anything that could improve on this product. IT&#x27;S PERFECT!  Update: I bought a few different bottles and the cucumber lemon is definitely my favorite. I stopped using any soaps or shampoos or products on my body, so this became my new doggy wash. The pump makes it even better for that and it&#x27;s a great value as a little bit goes further than the watered down dog shampoo.  Update 2: So I noticed they increased the price, but it&#x27;s still $9 at Whole Foods, so if that&#x27;s an option for you, I&#x27;d check that out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever buy my husband the store brands again!</li>
    <li> This is a good body wash.  The scent isn&#x27;t particularly &#x27;manly&#x27; to my nose, and seems to be the same formula as the other Everyone &amp;#34;soaps&amp;#34;.  I was afraid these might actually be *soap*, but they are a detergent based formula, safe for hard water, do not leave rings in the tub or soap scum everywhere, do not make your skin feel tight or coated.  I feel this is important to point out, given the name of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not foam up as much as higher-sulfate, more drying body washes, but does seem to clean well and leave the skin feeling good.  We batted 3/3 on the scents, this one, the coconut/lemon, and citrus/mint are all very pleasant smelling, unisex, not overwhelming but scented enough to be refreshing in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These EO body washes work fine for washing and body shaving; have not tried them as shampoo.  The male of the family has used it for shaving his face with no issues.</li>
    <li> did not work for me as most EO products did really did not like this one but how ever I really like lavender and aloe for men soap and lotion use as an body wash to</li>
    <li> the soap is great but to me personally i think that the lemon scent is a little over powering vs the cucumber. i think that it smells a little like dish soap honestly.</li>
    <li> Good overall product, nice smell, love that it is free of phthalates and that sort of thing. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap. The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming. The soap itself rinses off nicely. I feel fresh, light and clean after my showers. If there was any slight drawback, I guess it would be that when using it as shampoo, it doesn&#x27;t lather as thickly as regular shampoos. This doesn&#x27;t bother me though, but was just something I noticed.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and this brand but it smells nothing like what I thought a cucumber and lemon soap would smell like - very masculine smell, not bad but very masculine.</li>
    <li> The soap itself is good. I like this brand and will continue to buy it in the future. But this scent leaves something to be desired.</li>
    <li> This soap is very gentle and has pleasant subtle scent. It lathers reasonably and I genuinely feel the lack of industrial-style fragrances makes this soap NEARLY edible. I will DEFINITELY purchase this again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s heavier on the lemon oils but the smell mellows out after a few minutes, good for a guy</li>
    <li> OK cleaner, a good value for its size (32 oz), although you can find better at the store. The lather is not the best either...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont like the scent (too lemony and not masculine at all), but the &amp;#34;Cedar and Citrus&amp;#34; scent offered by Everyone Soap is much better.</li>
    <li> Smells like Meyers floor soap</li>
    <li> Excellent, all natural product.  It really lasts a long time too.  The pump is great along with the price.  BUY!</li>
    <li> I got this for my lazy husband to use.  He doesn&#x27;t like conditioner and will only use Head &amp; Shoulders (which tests products on animals), so I thought I could entice him to try a product that would clean his hair AND body.  He likes the smell, and a house guest even complimented it!  It&#x27;s a great &amp;#34;man scent,&amp;#34; but I use it too as a woman.  (I ordered another girlier fragrance to try!)</li>
    <li> Very nice, mild clean scent, natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Incredible as a shampoo, body wash, and even as a shaving cream. This is my new go-to soap for home and traveling!</li>
    <li> My teenage son uses this everyday and loves it.</li>
    <li> Some of the product leaked out prior to use</li>
    <li> Limited lather, the smell combo not for me</li>
    <li> I have found that most soaps and shampoos tend to dry my hair out. Generally after a shower my hair would be extremely dry then by the end of the day it would be super oily. I picked this up and I love it. Smells decent and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like most shampoos do and allows my hair to remain balanced all day. I am super excited!!</li>
    <li> love EO products, and the prices are well worth the product. also works well on my natural BLACK HAIR</li>
    <li> Works great as a body soap, shampoo and shaving soap.  I keep a bottle in the shower and another on the vanity for shaving.  Seems to offer a better shave than what I get from shaving get, plus it allows for a better cleaning between multi blade heads.  Blades also last longer.  Great value, and no it does not smell Foo-Foo</li>
    <li> Love this soap from EO.  Love all their soaps.  No weird chemicals and the price is right.  I use this monster one for our sink.  Excellent products from Everyone Soap</li>
    <li> Not crazy about the lemon smell, but the product is advertised as lemon so more my fault, but does a great for shaving as well.</li>
    <li> Fortunately, it came in a sealed plastic &amp;#34;envelope&amp;#34;. It leaked quite a bit during transit -several TBS full. I don&#x27;t know why - likely a defective pump. I bought it to give as a gift. The product is good but the leak wasn&#x27;t fun.</li>
    <li> I like this soap because it&#x27;s a no-nonsense all over body (and hair) soap.  Keeps your products to a minimum.  And it&#x27;s biodegradable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say the Cucumber Lemon is not as nice as some of the scents offered for women.  The cucumber gives it a distinctive earthy smell which I guess is supposed to be more manly.  Next time I&#x27;m buying the women&#x27;s version that smells like grapefruit.</li>
