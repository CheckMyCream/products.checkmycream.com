      <li>AMAZON customer service is truly amazing...</li>

      <li>This is the perfect shape and size for my hairstyle and grip.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be working as good as expected</li>
      <li>okay but very cheaply made.</li>
      <li>I had this product and used it every day, liked it just fine, until one day it didn&#x27;t heat up, and that was that.  </li>
      <li>What more can I say?</li>

      <li>Once again extremely happy with both the fast delivery and product.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>So it tends to roll on top of the counter.</li>
      <li>Now I am wondering if it was more of a product issue.  </li>
      <li>I choose it for the option to be able to use it in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I guess you just can&#x27;t go by the name of the product any more.</li>
      <li>So glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I love this curling iron.</li>
      <li>Also, the built in stand keeps it from touching the surface it&#x27;s resting on, but it gets in the way when I&#x27;m trying to use it on my hair...</li>
      <li>I am well satisfied.</li>
      <li>The teeth should also be of a better quality</li>
      <li>product is all that is advertised, I love the auto shut off since I always seem to forget to turn it off</li>

      <li>It is much better</li>
      <li>I love that it was dual voltage.  </li>
      <li>This time I ordered  four of the Revlon 3/4 inch curling brushes and won&#x27;t have to shop for this item for many years to come.  </li>
      <li>It smooths out the frizzies and can give you just waves or more curl  depending on how you use it.  </li>
      <li>This replacement is Much much better.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for a long time and have found it to be excellent in curling my hair.  </li>
      <li>I have hair that is about 5\\&quot; long and this curling brush works perfect for me.  </li>
      <li>Not well balanced, so it easily falls off the counter top.  </li>
      <li>Have not tried it yet, but I am sure it will be fine.</li>
      <li>I like this fast and does a good job</li>
      <li>I have a really full head of very fine hair.  </li>

      <li>It has an on off switch and heats up very quickly.</li>
      <li>Easy to handle.  </li>
      <li>The swivel cord does not swivel easily.  </li>
      <li>so they don&#x27;t break off so easily.</li>
      <li>This curling brush works great and it is of better quailty than I could find anywhere in my local area.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, does the job and doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>

      <li>I had an old one that I&#x27;d used many many years and liked.  </li>
      <li>Makes doing my hair quick and easy and satisfying.</li>
      <li>It is just ok-doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would like,and it is kind of cheaply made.</li>
      <li>Works just fine.</li>
      <li>Just what I needed for my fine</li>
      <li>It provides the body needed for fine hair.  </li>
      <li>However, I was able to find this online, and it is exactly like the other ones I&#x27;ve had, so I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great and price was great</li>
    <li> This iron heats quickly and has adjustable heat settings. I like it.</li>
    <li> After pondering several different ceramic brushes, I opted for this one and could not be happier.  I have an older one which has only two setting...high/low and it does not come close to the great performance of this one.  I saw something similar on QVC and actually ordered it but it was back ordered.  During that time, I searched Amazon and found this.....I have extremely thick AM hair and it works wonders....is get to the roots without tearing my hair.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> I bought this about 2.5 mo ago. Almost from the very beginning the &amp;#34;strips&amp;#34; of plastic comb/brush-type things would slide off all in one piece. I slid them back on with a little glue to help them stay. Then last week I started seeing little brown specs on my vanity. It took awhile to figure out that the little brown plastic spikes were actually breaking off one at a time.&lt;br /&gt;The last one of these I had--a different brand--the strips NEVER slid off. And the little spikes started breaking off after prob. 5-6 yrs of not just sitting on my vanity, but being thrown in flexible travel bags and thrown in over head compartments over and over. I had no idea they were so fragile/cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It damaged my hair and makes it brittle because of too much heat. It&#x27;s so frustrating.</li>
    <li> It is next to impossible to find these curling irons in a store.  This iron is ideal for shorter hair.  It provides the body needed for fine hair.  This curling iron is well made.  It is sturdy, easily handled, and gets hot enough to style my hair.  I would recommend this product over the more expensive irons.  And from past experience, it will last several years.  This is my third Revlon iron in 15 years.  And the price is great!</li>
    <li> It fit all of my needs and does a good job.  Easy to handle.  I have medium short hair.  What&#x27;s not to like about it.  And the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied customer BW</li>
    <li> not really what I wanted.  can&#x27;t seem to find a good brush curling iron like I had</li>
    <li> I had an electric brush-type curler in the 80s and they stopped making them. This appliance gives your hair body and volume without too much curl. My hair is short and I love this ceramic brush as much as I remembered.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the worst curling brush made.  I&#x27;ve had it for two months and today the end fell right off.  First off all, the design is terrible...no matter how carefully I place my hand when using it, I inevitably end up hitting the off button or turn down the temperature by mistake.  It does not get hot enough even at the highest setting so you never get a good curl.  The barrel and it&#x27;s case are so cheap and flimsy that it creaks like it&#x27;s going to crack in half when you use it.  When it heats, the whole barrel wiggles as if it&#x27;s going to fall off.  Please save yourself the money and avoid this product at all costs!  It&#x27;s horrible/</li>
    <li> JUST PERFECT IN ALL ASPECTS. The temperature settings, instant heat ( only 30 sec.) and perfect design, plus the low cost for such an outstanding product make it a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price</li>
    <li> For Revlon to put its name on a product, it should deliver. This is a piece of junk and after about 3 months I am tossing it.  Doesn&#x27;t heat up enough, which I can handle, but what really frosted me is the fact that  half (yes, HALF) the rows of plastic teeth fell out, with no discernible way to put them back in.  I paid for a brush, not a curling iron. This thing turned into a curling iron and not a very good one at that.</li>
    <li> I had this curling brush for about 1 month and it overheated and burned up completely - the black knob at the end of the item melted and fell off and smoke came out of the opening that was left.</li>
    <li> This is my second iron. Just the right size for my short hair.</li>
    <li> I had used this item before when my daughter bought it for this is the second one and I would not be without it. I travel with it also and it does not take up to much room.&lt;br /&gt;  Mildred Boyd</li>
    <li> I had a similar one before that is why I bought and this new one, and it is doing the same great job.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, the Revlon name appealed to me.  I was so disappointed with this curling brush.  It is so light weight that it feels like the manufacturer forgot to put the parts in it.  It does not have perfect heat like the description states. The quality is poor and it is not a well made product.  I stopped using the Revlon and I am going back to my tried and true Conair curling brush.  The only good thing about this purchase is the excellent return policy Amazon has, and yes the product was returned.  I guess you just can&#x27;t go by the name of the product any more.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is awful.  As other reviewers said, I had to turn it all the way up and it barely gets hot.  The design is horrible.  As I roll it, my fingers hit the on and off buttons all the time.  The tip has a groove so that you can slide the bristles out and remove them but there is no way to lock the tip in place so as you rotate the thing, it turns and the groove in the tip lines up with the channels on the barrel and the bristles fall out onto the floor.  I was ready  to throw it in the trash on my last trip but it was better than nothing.  Save your money.  Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> Great price for this curling brush. I have always used a brush and love them. Please continue to make this size. Hoping the reviews are correct because I went by them to purchase this.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my curling iron  I use it everyday  It does  A great job on my hair</li>
    <li> If you have fine, thin hair, don&#x27;t bother with this. I feels like it&#x27;s going to fall apart and does not work at all on thin hair. I&#x27;m going back to my curling iron.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice curling iron.  I used it when traveling to Europe and liked it so much I decided to use it at home as well.  Heats better than my other curling iron.</li>
    <li> This item is just what I was looking for.  Had a similar item for years but could not find in stores.  So glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works great.  This is the only style that works for me.  Thank goodness somebody still makes curling irons with teeth on them.  And it heats up fast.</li>
    <li> Like that the directions in the enclosed instructions recommend the heat range for different types of hair.  Found that the curls lasted all day, which was a plus.  Good design, easy to handle and store.</li>
    <li> bristles don&#x27;t fall off like  on some so I am very pleased with this products and you will be too.</li>
    <li> Very good curling brush.  Simple yet durable. Looked all over for this model and found it only on Amazon.  Replaces older model that broke after many years.</li>
    <li> Works great!  I love that it was dual voltage.  I could use it in Italy with just a plug adapter.</li>
    <li> Awful! It is quick to heat up however I have had this product for two months and almost all the bristles have broken off with gentle use. I&#x27;ve been able to get years of use out of my other curling brushes and I&#x27;m back on amazon today to but another one after just a few months and an arm burn :/</li>
    <li> the teeth in this curling iron came out and I only purchased  this item 1 month ago. I think I should get a refund.</li>
    <li> I had an old one that I&#x27;d used many many years and liked.  I dropped it an broke it.  This replacement is Much much better. It has a swivel so cord does not get tangled and twisted.  It also has a button switch which my old one did not.  It is much better and I&#x27;d highly recommend.  (this one is for pretty large curls).</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered and it is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a similar curling iron brush for years.  When trying to find a replacement, every one that I&#x27;ve tried had brush &amp;#34;tines&amp;#34; so long that it held the iron too far away from my scalp and made my hair too puffy.  This one has tines short enough to place the curl in the right place, but they still grab the hair and don&#x27;t tangle.  It has a range of heat settings, so you can get it as hot or cool as you need.  It is also duel voltage, so that I can take it on my trips over-seas.  I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Works just as good as the expensive stuff they try and sell you on infomercials for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Heats well, shuts off automatically, perfect length of bristles.  Had been looking for a curling brush for 2 years and finally found this on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I really like this. It heats up quickly, stays hot, and that is all I need! It is easy to handle, also. What more can I say?</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find one in stores, even bought one or two different ones to try them--didn&#x27;t work.  However, I was able to find this online, and it is exactly like the other ones I&#x27;ve had, so I&#x27;m very happy with it.  The shipping was fast, also.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s near to impossible to find a curling iron with bristles nowadays. After searching in stores in my town, I finally caved and ordered this one. It left me disappointed. It barely gets hot. I&#x27;ve been turning up the heat dial but for someone with short, fine hair, cranking it up to over ten shouldn&#x27;t be necessary. Frankly, ten still isn&#x27;t high enough. I wonder if the one I received is actually defective.</li>
    <li> Once again extremely happy with both the fast delivery and product. I also recommended the curling iron brush to a friend and she is also delighted.</li>
    <li> Awful...had a hot air brush for years and no problem. This thing is dangerous! The number of times I&#x27;ve burnt my hands whilst trying to wrap my hair round it is awful. Bristles should be longer so your hand doesn&#x27;t go so near the hot plate at the base of them. I&#x27;m going to send mine back!!</li>
    <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough to curl my hair as well as others I&#x27;ve had - just OK. Also, the built in stand keeps it from touching the surface it&#x27;s resting on, but it gets in the way when I&#x27;m trying to use it on my hair...</li>
    <li> Would have given it a 5 but it doesn&#x27;t have have instant heat and the automatic turn-off [a very nice feature] sometimes turns off before I&#x27;m finished. I&#x27;ve had it 2 months and find it to be a nice size for my semi-short hair. It is easy to use, does the job and doesn&#x27;t tangle. I recommend it -- but buy it on sale.</li>
    <li> I looked for a long time in local stores and couldn&#x27;t find what I wanted.  This time I ordered  four of the Revlon 3/4 inch curling brushes and won&#x27;t have to shop for this item for many years to come.  I am well satisfied.</li>
    <li> My wife is very pleased with this curling iron. She especially likes the auto shut off feature. It is a great value.</li>
    <li> The brush does not heat up enough even when on the highest setting. Rather disappointed in the quality of the brush.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is poorly constructed from cheap plastic.  It was inexpensive and now I see why.  Not a good buy.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet because I bought it for a trip we plan on taking. The packaging was not damaged.</li>
    <li> Fast heating and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Product as described and works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and wear it messy &amp; spiky.  I need this to get some height to the top of my head, otherwise it just goes flat.  I really like the 3/4&amp;#34; brush to achieve the look I want.  I use it @ 15.  It&#x27;s a very good price and seems to do the job.  AMAZON customer service is truly amazing...as I had purchased another brush from a different company that was a complete joke.  Didn&#x27;t even turn on!&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to purchase items sold/shipped by AMAZON.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t order...this item fell apart in one month...cheaply made and I had to replace it a month later</li>
    <li> it looks very nice and the way it&#x27;s advertised. I ordered this for my wife and the only complaint i heard from her is about the heat....it doesn&#x27;t produce enough heat. beside that very perfect and very nice too.</li>
    <li> I have very short hair.  On day 2 I prefer not to wash.  If I awake with a little bed head...a little spray (even h20 and this will make it a good hair style again.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this curling iron brush as these are difficult to find especially in certain sizes.  It came promptly and nicely packaged.  The brush style was what I was looking for, it was light and comfortable to hold.  Unfortunately, it would barely heat up.  Turned to the highest setting it was only vaguely warm, and definitely didn&#x27;t curl my hair.  So I sent it back, and in two days I had a replacement from Amazon.  So sad, this one wouldn&#x27;t heat up either.  Sent it back and am now looking for a similar product that will heat to the necessary temperature.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> The first one was delivered in a timely manner but was missing 3 teeth on one comb. and did not heat up.The second ( replacement) one was sent in timely manner nut It worked for 3 days and quit. I would not recommend this product to any one.  Finally bought one at discount store.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Heats up in less than a minute, muliple heat settings from 1 - 30, and the cord swivels around where it attaches to the handle so it never tangles.  The barrel is only 3/4&amp;#34;, but that is perfect for the (very) short hair style I have right now.  The prongs are just the right length for this size barrel too, unlike others I&#x27;ve tried with a small barrel but prongs so long that you can&#x27;t easily curl short hair around the barrel.  As soon as I&#x27;m ready to go longer, I&#x27;ll be looking for another one of these with a bigger barrel.</li>
    <li> Would have liked a more ergonomic handle.  Not well balanced, so it easily falls off the counter top.  A stand would help with this problem.&lt;br /&gt;It does heat up very quickly and is very hot, so you need to be very careful with your fingertips.</li>
    <li> This is a great curling brush; the only thing that I&#x27;d change is move the on/off button to a location that would be less likely to accidentally turn the styling tool off. Otherwise great hot styling brush!</li>
    <li> Great product, but did not flow through my hair like the Conair products.</li>
    <li> Bought it from Amazon....don&#x27;t remember when (less than 7 months ago) but it has fallen apart! Don&#x27;t buy!!</li>
    <li> The On/Off switches fell inside the barrel after a few uses. Took it apart &amp; was able to reconnect, but the same thing happened &amp; I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Curling iron heats up fast, and does the job. Would not buy again, as the teeth slip out if the top black knob twists and it is very light weight...feels cheeply made.</li>
    <li> I had ordered one of these because I had a similar one that had seemed to quit working.  Now I am wondering if it was more of a product issue.  The problem I am having is that I cannot get it to consistently heat up.  You have to plug it in and then turn it on by pressing a button on the rod.  I have to push the button  a number of times and kind of wiggle it around to eventually sometimes get it to turn on, on some days I just give up.</li>
    <li> This curling wand is lightweight and easy to use.  It smooths out the frizzies and can give you just waves or more curl  depending on how you use it.  I would reccomend it to anyone with short or long hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had more expensive heat styling brushes that were worse quality.  I&#x27;ve also had some less expensive ones that work just as well as the Revlon.  This is the perfect shape and size for my hairstyle and grip.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be working as good as expected but, I will have to see how long it lasts before committing to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> In spite of having &amp;#34;world wide dual voltage for use anywhere&amp;#34; it went dead after the first time using in the UK.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> It heats up real fast, which is what I need,and I need the bigger size for when my hair gets longer.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. I bought a Conair to replace it when it finally broke, it was horrible, I had to use the highest setting 10, and it still wasn&#x27;t hot enough. So I bought another Revlon. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> waste product, so painful and time consuming</li>
    <li> exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> It does not work. It has no heat.</li>
    <li> I used this brush daily and after the first month the brush tines started falling off. After 2 months the iron is unusable.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 3 years.  Now I want a new one just in case this one does stop working.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.  I have hair that is about 5\\&quot; long and this curling brush works perfect for me.  When I let my hair grow out longer, it did get tangled and I had to stop using it.  But for short hair it is simply the best.  I found a heat setting that works for my hair and I never change it.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone with short hair.  Great for just touching up flat spots too. I wash and dry my hair every other day and always use this curling brush because it is so easy to use.  I&#x27;m not good with a curling iron.  I have burned myself too many times.  With this, never. Mrs. A.</li>
    <li> Even on high heat it doesn&#x27;t do a great job even on short hair. I choose it for the option to be able to use it in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;I will get a chance to try that next week.</li>
    <li> Great iron. Started using it. Works just fine.</li>
    <li> Made a mistake did not want a curling iron</li>
    <li> I have a really full head of very fine hair.  Works well.  Like the heat temperature control.  Many tools do not have temp. settings.</li>
    <li> why did i buy this? idk cause it doesnt work at all and i dont even have thick hair...wouldnt reccomend</li>
    <li> It worked fine as long as it worked......but the on-off switch quit working after a couple weeks.  I did not try returning it.....too much trouble through the mail.</li>
    <li> Just right for short hair</li>
    <li> I have used a curling brush for years.  There were some negative comments about this one, but I took a chance because I needed one that would get hot enough to make the curls or take out frizz.  I have been very happy with this curling brush.  It heats up quickly and gets plenty hot.  I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> It was a cheap curling iron.  You get what you pay for.  The swivel cord does not swivel easily.  You have to stop and straighten the cord often.  My hand slides up the handle and either changes the temp setting or hits the off button.  As soon as I get another one, this one goes in the trash..</li>
    <li> It was no good for me..</li>
    <li> It is just ok-doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would like,and it is kind of cheaply made.</li>
    <li> If you have long hair be careful this can get tangled in hair and is hard to get out and you may burn your hair</li>
    <li> takes a long time to heat up, and no extra gard to set it down and not burn your counter or table.</li>
    <li> Very inferior.  The off switch collapsed into the handle the first time I used it.  Returned it for a refund.      A far better product of this type is the Conair BC84JCS Instant Heat 3/4 Inch Hot Brush for $12.99, also available from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time and have found it to be excellent in curling my hair.  It heats up quickly, is very sturdy, and easy to hold. I was quite shocked by your only, very negative review that I read on this product.  I needed a second curling brush, so decided to follow the advise of the first review, and buy the Conair Instant Heat Styling Brush BC84SCS 3/4\\&quot;. I have now used it, and, while I have found it to be satisfactory, in no way could I say that it is superior to the Revlon styling brush.  It is sad to say that the Revlon stying brush has been given such a bad reputation on Amazon&#x27;s website.</li>
    <li> product is all that is advertised, I love the auto shut off since I always seem to forget to turn it off</li>
    <li> If the return period has not expired, I will return this.  I have had hot air curling brushes with plastic &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; in the past.  They tangled my hair so much that I couldn&#x27;t get the brush loose without help.  A couple of times this type of bristle just ripped out a bunch of hair.  Never again.</li>
    <li> One of the rows of teeth keeps slipping out.. Otherwise I like the curling iron</li>
    <li> Not using it as the plastic piece to set brush down on counter hits my scalp as I turn it and  is very uncomfortable!!</li>
    <li> I had this product and used it every day, liked it just fine, until one day it didn&#x27;t heat up, and that was that.  I&#x27;d had it less than a year.</li>
    <li> Looked for this product for several years now and here it was - all I would find would be the flat irons or curling irons and these seemed to disappear in the last few years but now it is found.  Tks.</li>
    <li> I had an older version of this model and it finally went out.  When I saw it available online at a reasonable price I ordered 3.</li>
    <li> I used it twice before the prongs broke. It also didn&#x27;t heat up enough to curl my hair</li>
    <li> This styling brush is definitely a professional product. It has a very long, heavy-duty cord and heats up very quickly. My hair is very curly and requires more heat than regular styling brushes provide to control the curls. Very good product.</li>
    <li> My wife needed a new curling iron.  I searched and found this one.  She loves it.  It get the job done and as she says \\&quot;It does not take long to do my hair\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> It good, but doesn&#x27;t heat up fast as it states and doesn&#x27;t stay hot as long as I would like</li>
    <li> It came quickly, no complaint there. I have only had it a short time...use it daily and the plastic brissels are already breaking. Previous other brands I have bought...the plastic brissels didn&#x27;t break or start breaking for more than six months, my last brush I had for a year before replacing with this.  I had this one maybe less than 2 weeks and the plastic brissels started breaking. I am going to have to replace it very soon. Would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on line for convenience but I have had one in the past so I knew what to expect.</li>
    <li> Like the quick heat up on this curling brush.  For short, straight hair, this curling brush adds good curl and height.  Very happy with this curling brush.</li>
    <li> This curling iron brush is very easy to use.  It heats up fast.  You can use it for curls or for giving your hair fullness.  Impossible to burn your scalp because of the brushes.  Wonder-&lt;br /&gt;ful and you are able to change your hairdo whenever you want to.</li>
    <li> Versatile item with several heat settings which help achieve the exact hairstyle required, a decent sized cool tip to help prevent fingers getting scorched during use, which with the added advantage of the extra safety measure of an on/off switch on the handle as well as being able to switch off at the wall socket, all add up, in my view, to a really good purchase.</li>
    <li> Makes doing my hair quick and easy and satisfying.</li>
    <li> Not a good product!!  Within a few weeks, several teeth had broken off (my 10-year-old curling iron had NO teeth missing) and after 2 months it quit working.  Bad choice</li>
    <li> I had one simular to this one, same make and everything, but it isn&#x27;t do the job that the other one did.  Maybe I needed a 1/2 inch one, but couldn&#x27;t find it by this manufacturer.  It also doesn&#x27;t have a built in stand like my previous one.  So it tends to roll on top of the counter.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done, kind-of. Doesn&#x27;t seem to curl my hair like my very old curling brush does. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this if I had to do it over again.</li>
    <li> Excellent to use in Argentina  (220V) and USA / Canada (110V)</li>
    <li> Good curling iron for the price, buy it does not last more than a year. Gone through 8 I would say. The teeth should also be of a better quality so they don&#x27;t break off so easily.</li>
    <li> This is my second one. The previous one lost most of its teeth. The price is good even if you have to buy one a year.</li>
    <li> The Revlon curling iron brush was perfect while traveling Italy! I highly recommend it for international travel.  I also use it at home.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use, sturdy, heats up quickly and cools down after turning it off.  Glad to be able to order it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a backup to the Conair Brush.  Have not tried it yet, but I am sure it will be fine.</li>
    <li> I like this fast and does a good job</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find curling iron brush appliances in the stores, they are either clamp or combo Blow-curl.  Have ordered a 2nd one to keep in my travel bag.  It heats up very fast, with a range of settings from low to hi.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt; Works great, and also like the dual voltage</li>
    <li> Big improvement from other brands, in which the brushes slide out of barrel and get lost.  This brush is very good for long thin hair, it heats quickly and easy to handle with cool tip on end.  Your hair will be smooth and have body with this brush.</li>
    <li> I like this curling iron, but the holding tip swivels so you can&#x27;t rotate it unless you move one of the strips of &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; out a bit, but that slips too.</li>
    <li> Did the job okay but very cheaply made. I&#x27;ve had it for less than a year and it stopped working. My previous curling brush lasted at least 10 years.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, well made, does the job!</li>
    <li> This curling brush works great and it is of better quailty than I could find anywhere in my local area.  It has an on off switch and heats up very quickly.</li>
    <li> This iron does not heat up enough to curl fine hair.</li>
