    <li> This is the best hair gel on the market.  It does not leave your hair sticky yet still holds it in place perfectly.  Easy to wash out as well.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> This product is Great!!</li>
    <li> The hubby loves Sexy Hair Hard up Gel. It holds but yet doesn&#x27;t make hair stiff. It&#x27;s humidity resistant and doesn&#x27;t make flakes. ALOT cheaper on Amazon than in the salons.</li>
    <li> Originally purchased this product in salon and loved it.  The bulk price is perfect.</li>
    <li> Item as described.  Would recommend seller.</li>
    <li> Great value. Receive real quick</li>
    <li> My son loves this gel and this was a great price for it!</li>
    <li> Picture shows 9 shine 10 hold and I was delivered 9 shine 9 hold. Not really a big deal, it&#x27;ll do the job just fine but just not 100% what I ordered. More like 90.5% of what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for years. Nothing else even comes close.</li>
    <li> Love this hair gel. When it dries it doesn&#x27;t flake like a lot of the other hair gels I&#x27;ve used before. Great product.</li>
    <li> It does not work . It leaves your hair sticky and hard.</li>
    <li> I use this because it last all day.  Its a hard hold so it will take some work to wash it out but that is a good thing for me.  If your hair is really short it doesn&#x27;t take much product to get the effect you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> never a hair out of place with Hard up Gel - Shine 9 / Hold 10</li>
    <li> Great item at great price.  Holds all day without flaking.  The tubes are so much easier than the bulk bottle with the pump.  Last time I bought that I had to cut the top off in order to get the last bit of gel out.  I was happy to see this two pack come in at a better price per ounce than that lousy pump.</li>
    <li> My wavy hair gets straighter as it gets dryer. This gel has great hold, and trapped moisture in my hair to keep it curly. Without it I have a white guy fro, with it I have tight dark glossy curls. Great effect.</li>
