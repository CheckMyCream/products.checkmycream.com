      <li>LOL</li>
      <li>They probably aren&#x27;t great for a large-busted woman since they don&#x27;t provide the lifting type of support.</li>
      <li>Great for times when you are wearing backless tops or dresses but just keep in mind it doesn&#x27;t lift as a bra would.</li>
      <li>I am really happy I bought this.</li>
      <li>Also had shoulder surgery so these are a great alternative to a bra that won&#x27;t irritate my incisions.</li>
      <li>Takes a while to get here but the price is great.</li>
      <li>The self adhesive Nu Color Bra does a great job in support and uplift in my swimsuit.  </li>

      <li>Works great for days</li>
      <li>Love these!!</li>
      <li>This thing is amazing!</li>
      <li>Good.</li>
      <li>The tape or gel is a good idea if you feel like it&#x27;s losing some adhesiveness.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;Honey, you looked good in that suit before</li>
      <li>The adhesive seems good, but I don&#x27;t think it works well for a size D cup.  </li>
      <li>Was good when I tried on my wedding dress.</li>
      <li>lol, its was nice</li>
      <li>I ordered a size D and the cups fit perfectly.</li>
      <li>Sticky and gave me good cleavage.</li>
      <li>Great price, fast shipping, excellent product.</li>
      <li>GREAT PRICE, even BETTER product.</li>

      <li>Ok!</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>and it felt great, stayed in place all day and yet came off easily.</li>
      <li>Real cheap in price</li>
      <li>they kind of feel like they are going to come off, but they don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>It sticks well to skin and helps prove nice support.</li>
      <li>Price is nice</li>
      <li>So happy I ordered them and plan to buy more.  :)</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t expect them to have any kind of padding.</li>
      <li>This kind of bra is not made for a &amp;#34;D&amp;#34; cup.</li>
      <li>Nice product for the price.</li>
      <li>these are great and really stick to the skin good.  </li>
      <li>maybe I just need to clean it better, but either way, the price is great</li>
      <li>Held all night through drinks and dancing and for the amazing price I&#x27;ll be ordering more for when this one stops working.</li>
      <li>Most of the time I swim in chlorine water and loved the fact there was no deterioration from the strong chlorine.  </li>
      <li>They stick great here in the east where the weather is quite hot and humid these days.</li>
      <li>but when i putted on it was like wearing nothing, so very comfortable</li>
      <li>Very comfortable and warm to skin very quickly.</li>
      <li>The good thing about this product though is that it is super sticky and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it will fall off.  </li>
      <li>On the upside, it arrived quickly and in good shape; that&#x27;s why I gave it one star.</li>
      <li>Great bra for those certain dresses</li>
      <li>I wore them two days in a row for special functions and am very pleased to say they stayed put.</li>
      <li>Better for tigher dresses</li>
      <li>Anyway, these are so cute.</li>
      <li>You can do better</li>
      <li>Make sure you keep the plastic covers</li>
      <li>I like to wear them under sweaters mostly.</li>
      <li>Not to mention this is literally the most comfortable bra I&#x27;ve enter owned!</li>
      <li>Enjoyed my night because I knew i was covered and didn&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
      <li>fuss with straps or fitting.</li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>I think it work better as a gag in someone&#x27;s fridge than as a bra.</li>
      <li>I love that.</li>
      <li>you have boob sweat all on your totally cute tanks.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad Amazon offered these in a size D cup.  </li>
      <li>You would be better off with some type of strap bra that might work for your attire.</li>
      <li>I love backless tops and cutout tops.</li>
      <li>(just touching them)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been tempted to look into one, but thought they&#x27;d cost way more.</li>
      <li>I don&#x60;t know if I&#x60;ll get to use it or give it to a friend better</li>
      <li>Better than others I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
      <li>With More chesty girls</li>
      <li>This product does much more than it is designed for...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s best to order 1 cup size larger than the one you wear.</li>
      <li>You get the stickiness you need and more.</li>
      <li>Overall, great great product and well worth the $5 price!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think what they sent was a D cup, but they are made very nice and they do stick very well.</li>
      <li>It sticks pretty good.</li>
      <li>Ok I really wasen&#x27;t sure about this item, but I love it!</li>
      <li>I could go without a bra, but your always more comfortable covered.  </li>
      <li>I was able to get it on comfortably</li>
      <li>Once I saw how secure they were, I ended up peeling them off and reapplying them to create more cleavage.  </li>
      <li>They are as good as new!</li>
      <li>Easy to put on.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>The adhesive is very good also, washing it super simple too.</li>
      <li>i would recommend them to any girl who wears strapless or wants to get that sexy dress for prom!</li>
      <li>I am a 34C and I ordered a D cup thinking it would fit fine.  </li>
      <li>This being said, there&#x27;s 2 important details that you need to know:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Seems pretty cool for the price, and yes you better take a bigger size</li>
    <li> I tried it only because I was curious and it was cheap. I do not like the shape of it, there is no support. This kind of bra is not made for a &amp;#34;D&amp;#34; cup.</li>
    <li> Ok I really wasen&#x27;t sure about this item, but I love it! I got the D size and am a large (saggy *blush*) C cup. I didn&#x27;t think this would really do anything except maybe control the nips. Well I am pleassed to say I was wrong. This works great if you put it on correctly, even if you get it wrong it still controls the nips. Here is the way I do it: (right or wrong this is what works for me) lift the breast, apply the bra an inch or so below the nip and an inch or so from the nip to the center of your breasts and then lift your breast and complete by sticking the rest of the way on as high as you wish to be. Do the other side the same and be sure to pull that one up to the same level as the first. It takes a some practice. I have worn them for a week now daily and finally figured it out LOL They stick great here in the east where the weather is quite hot and humid these days. They are easy to wash (takes maybe a minute) and they dry over night, probably much faster I just wash them at night and use them again in the morning. They are as good as new! I am going to get another pair in &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; but I think these will last quite a while.</li>
    <li> Great bra for those certain dresses that you can&#x27;t wear a regular bra.  Extremely herd to find in local stores.  So this was agood find. fast delivery.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick and stay well enough.</li>
    <li> I purchased these knowing they ran on the smaller side. My daughter is a small C and the D size fits. She likes them well enough, waiting to see what happens after she wears them out a few times and I will update.</li>
    <li> It work good very happy was it.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for support - this is not what they advertise.  These are made to wear with backless or strapless tops, they also pull the chest together for cleavage.  They do not last forever that is why they are cheap.  I live in Florida I wear a ton of items that have no back or no straps, or look like a halter and most bras hurt and tend to show or stick out in places -looking untidy, these fit the bill for that outfit and I have bought about 5 so far.  Sometimes you have to be careful if you pull them to tight they will break (I have even fixed them myself with a little glue at the clasp) They are just a silicone patch for your chest, they stick but after repeated wear you will get oils from your body, lotions, perfume etc. on them and the stickiness will fade.  So you will have to break the bank and spend another $5.00 for another pair. I personally love them and I am back to get some more.  I am a Size D and they could be a little bigger but work fine. I have only had one top where they could be seen under the outfit and it was a white halter - other than that they are pretty invisible.</li>
    <li> this product is a lot thinner than I have bought in the past. but what can I expect for the price</li>
    <li> Way too small; I didn&#x27;t use them because they didn&#x27;t do what they said they were going to do!</li>
    <li> It still didn&#x27;t fit... which means : D I&#x27;m probably a little bigger than i thought i was. Woot! Anyway, these are so cute. i would recommend them to any girl who wears strapless or wants to get that sexy dress for prom!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m normally a C-D cup to begin with, and I wanted to give this a shot for a dress that cuts deep under the arms. Ladies, if you&#x27;re busty, this is not your answer. I think this actually pulled the girls down more than it held them up, and that&#x27;s only the part that actually fit in the cups. It may work better for the smaller, perkier crowd, but even ordering up a size, this didn&#x27;t fit and didn&#x27;t work. I ended up going with a regular strapless pushed way down, and while it wasn&#x27;t ideal, it was a far better option than this was. On the upside, it arrived quickly and in good shape; that&#x27;s why I gave it one star.</li>
    <li> Great for those backless and strapless dresses and shirts! After they dry out from too many washes you&#x27;ll need a new one. But I love the natural look it gives me. And no nip-slip. I love that.</li>
    <li> Quality is below my expectations and not worth to spend that amount what I paid, really upset about the product I received.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to say.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin very well. It has a tendency to fall off, which limits its usefulness</li>
    <li> I wanted a strapless bra that provided some support and nipple coverage so that I could wear wear backless tops and dresses and other strappy items that would show a bra strap (I&#x27;m a \\&quot;C\\&quot; cup).  Traditional strapless bras did not work for me.  They gave my breasts an odd shape and tended to slip down my body over time.  Also, the cups tended to stick out due to not having straps to keep them in place, leaving a gape between them and my body, a #1 no-no in fashion, especially with lower cut fashions. I saw this item in a clothing shop and gave it a try.  I was a number ONE fan immediately!!! The adhesive stayed in place all day/night, and I loved how the silicone warmed to my body and added a little additonal size to my bust.  Also, the natural bounce made it seem like it was all me! The absolute best feature of this product is the ability to gain MASSIVE cleavage by placing the cups farther apart and clipping them together in the middle! My regular push-up bras could NEVER give me this type of cleaveage! Also, there is no bra bulge on my back, because there is no bra there!  Better cleavage and a sleek back.  I love it!  The only down-side is that if you sweat, the adhesive can disengage and the cups can fall off (!!)  But you will feel if this is about to happen. They probably aren&#x27;t great for a large-busted woman since they don&#x27;t provide the lifting type of support. Also, the bra doesn&#x27;t last forever, so you need to replace it eventually. Totally worth it.  I recommend it whole-heartedly!</li>
    <li> Okay, so I breast fed my little for 14 months. Needless to say, my boobs shrank from a 34DDD to a 34C, and they cannot hold themselves up any more. I love backless tops and cutout tops. So I needed a backless bra. These bras, however, are not for women with sagging breasts or large breasts that need support. To top it off, they loose their &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and slide right off your chest!! Even one of my friends with size 32A boobs can only wear these if she knows for sure she won&#x27;t be sweating because they will slide ride down the front of her dress. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this type of bra for anyone really.</li>
    <li> Worked for me, however I&#x27;m a C cup and went one size bigger as suggested from reviews (and also from the cashier at the store) and found it was slightly too big.... but its sticky, so it wasn&#x27;t a big issue.</li>
    <li> The adhesive seems good, but I don&#x27;t think it works well for a size D cup.  There is not enough coverage.  It is pretty sticky and takes some working with.</li>
    <li> Product is what it is. Doesn&#x27;t provide support for D cups, but didn&#x27;t expect it too. Hope this helps. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Works great for days I don&#x27;t like to wear a bra.  Forget I have them on!!</li>
    <li> When I saw the box I was thrilled as it is the same as the ones I used to buy at the swap meet for a lot more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they came I saw why they were less money - these are VERY thin.  And I ordered 3 from one company and 2 from another hoping that I might test one against the other.  They all looked like exactly the same company sent them and all from China.  They came crushed from sticking 3 packes of them together and so the bottom one is permanently crushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doubt if I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> It stopped working at the end of the night, but it was expected. My boobs are large and they aren&#x27;t fake so they hang naturally a little bit. A bra that has no support is going to have trouble holding these puppies up.</li>
    <li> Great quality.  Anyone that wears a bra should&lt;br /&gt;try this strapless bra.  Easy to put on.  No need&lt;br /&gt;to fuss with straps or fitting.</li>
    <li> I wish I could&#x27;ve given this seller no stars, This bra is the absolute worst... Not what the image shows... They literally came In a zip lock bag and not anything like the image shown...This is false advertising, I always buy these backless sticky bras and have never seen a cheaper on... It is super thin and flimsy... Do not buy from this seller... There are plenty better bras out there for pretty much the same price</li>
    <li> These are comparable to a much more expensive product. Takes a while to get here but the price is great.</li>
    <li> lol, its was nice but i didn&#x27;t really know how to wear it :3 sooo, lol it felt weird (just touching them) but when i putted on it was like wearing nothing, so very comfortable</li>
    <li> Total waste of money. I usually wear a C cup, so I decided to buy a D cup to be on the safe side. Still too small. I&#x27;m not going to wear it.</li>
    <li> It sticks pretty good. I originally bought it to wear with my strapless wedding dress. I have worn it several times after that and it hasn&#x27;t lost it&#x27;s stickiness. Doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue either. Only down side is I am a DD, but this is the biggest size I could find.</li>
    <li> This product does much more than it is designed for...it gives someone with less than stellar confidence a boost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!</li>
    <li> With More chesty girls these do not do much, as I ordered these for prom I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with what they did for me! :/</li>
    <li> This bra is great I wear a DD and bought the D size since its not avalible in DD and it still worked wonderfully! Held all night through drinks and dancing and for the amazing price I&#x27;ll be ordering more for when this one stops working. Not to mention this is literally the most comfortable bra I&#x27;ve enter owned! Only 1 reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it took forever to get here so order about a month ahead of time if u have an event.</li>
    <li> You pay for what you get. You can do better but you can do worse. Not bad coverage.</li>
    <li> Perfect !  Stays put entire day , d size was much larger than the c .Holds me up and in place .Great Price !!</li>
    <li> This is a great price for these, but they are a little small for me. I don&#x27;t think what they sent was a D cup, but they are made very nice and they do stick very well.</li>
    <li> But it doesn&#x27;t offer any support. Great for times when you are wearing backless tops or dresses but just keep in mind it doesn&#x27;t lift as a bra would.</li>
    <li> I was nervous because a cup size without a band size is completely useless, but they fit me pretty well. I am a DD, but have a band width of 28, so the &amp;#34;runs small&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t harm me. Stays on as long as you&#x27;re not doing a lot of sweating, and peels off painlessly. The only problem is having basically no support to where it feels like I could just do the bandaid trick instead of using these. All in all, I guess it&#x27;s useful...just not fantastic. But for the price offered, definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> The very first day I wore this bra, about 5 hours later I was walking around braless. It was a hot day and I was sweating a bit, but I assumed the bra would still hold up. I was in the mall and before you knew it, one of the cups was literally hanging out of my shirt. It was beyond embarrassing but as I was trying to re-stick the bra to my chest, the other cup fell off. I couldn&#x27;t get the bra to stick and I was in public so it was even worse.</li>
    <li> I wear a C or D cup normally so I bought a D and I think the bra does a great job! I wear it more often than my regular bras because it&#x27;s so comfy. I&#x27;ve had it since July, and I think it just now might be starting to lose some adhesive... maybe I just need to clean it better, but either way, the price is great so it&#x27;s fine. I wore it first during a wedding with a very particular strappy dress and it covered up everything that needed to be covered and didn&#x27;t randomly show through in spots.</li>
    <li> Good. Sticks better than expected. It doesn&#x27;t provide any lift but works well for backless dresses. Happy with the bra.</li>
    <li> fell off in middle of the night.. not great adhesive</li>
    <li> they stick on really well!</li>
    <li> I love these. They aren&#x27;t too sticky, leave no residue, and are extremely comfortable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear regular bras anymore. These are fantastic. Great price, fast shipping, excellent product. Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> At first I just felt naked.  Then after awhile I felt like I had support and comfortable around others. You need to keep your skin and the bra clean. The tape or gel is a good idea if you feel like it&#x27;s losing some adhesiveness.  I wouldn&#x27;t want them for every day. But there are times they are the best!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and for the best price!!!! So happy I ordered them and plan to buy more.  :)</li>
    <li> A Lil smaller than I&#x27;d like. And for some reason they do not have as much sticky stuff on them as the C cups do. The C cups will stick forever these you have to get just right or there falling off. Don&#x27;t hold me up as much as I&#x27;d like either.</li>
    <li> Was good when I tried on my wedding dress. Sticky and gave me good cleavage. When I went to use them on my wedding day they slid right off and wouldn&#x27;t stick. Caused a lot of wedding day issues</li>
    <li> These work pretty well so far but I didn&#x27;t expect them to have any kind of padding. They have a small amount of padding to the side of the nipple which is kind of weird but for the price I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;bra\\&quot; only covers about half of my (25 year old, perky) breasts, and does nothing to lift or support them such that I would actually wear it in public.  It&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
    <li> I bought a backless dress for my birthday and took it as an excuse to finally make an investment and get an adhesive bra. I&#x27;ve always been tempted to look into one, but thought they&#x27;d cost way more. This bra is seriously the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time. I can get all kinds of cleavage with it and don&#x27;t have any awkward bulges or lines under my clothes. It adheres well and I&#x27;ve stopped using my regular strapless bra just for this. I use it often and with all kinds of clothes and it looks great with everything! I&#x27;m a 34C and this size was perfect so I hate to say it but you&#x27;re probably out of luck if you&#x27;re really busty but it works very well for me. I feel a lot less limited now with the clothing I can buy and I will definitely buy another once this bra wears out.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical.  I am a 36D (full D) and I doubted these things could possibly be of any help.  First of all, they are STICKY...I wore them to a black tie event that was held outside in JULY...they did not move all night.  Second, while the size of each part of the &amp;#34;bra&amp;#34; was not large enough to provide substantial coverage of any sort, they were still strong enough to pull together my breasts and create some reasonable cleavage.  One tip -- at first, I was afraid to place them too far apart before pulling them together and hooking them closed for fear I would create too much tension and they would pull away from my skin.  Once I saw how secure they were, I ended up peeling them off and reapplying them to create more cleavage.  If I were wearing them again, I would not be so nervous.  Also, check out YouTube for videos with some tips for how to apply.  I watched a couple of videos that helped me a lot before I wore them on the night of the event.  Great product, I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> If you are a woman with larger breasts, don&#x27;t buy this. It effectively covers the nipple but is way too small to do much else.  You would be better off with some type of strap bra that might work for your attire.</li>
    <li> So first of all.....this bra come straight form China. This being said, there&#x27;s 2 important details that you need to know:&lt;br /&gt;1) Their sizing system is different than the American one: so if for example you are a size B, get a C, if you&#x27;re a C- get a D and so on.&lt;br /&gt;2) The product being shipped straight from China, would obviously take more time to be delivered (even if sometimes it doesn&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now my experience:&lt;br /&gt; I bough it in a size bigger than usual (I&#x27;m a C, I got a D), and surprisinglyyyyyy.....I got it within 7 days!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it looks, and even if sometimes I feel that it&#x27;s gonna fall, it doesn&#x27;t; the glue actually sticks to your skin without suffocating it.&lt;br /&gt; Now just re- reading my review...it sounds like they paid me to give such good feed-back. I guess I&#x27;m just veryy happy with it and with the service.&lt;br /&gt; Bottom line....Just get it!</li>
    <li> Have used this a few times. It sticks well to skin and helps prove nice support. I highly recommend keeping the box it comes in to allow bra to last longer. Although it fits alright I think a size bigger than a regular bra would fit better.</li>
    <li> This product likely works great for women that are not as well endowed. If you sweat at all it wont stick and my chest is just way to large to hope that anything other then a real bra would hold them up and make them look good. After having a baby and nursing this bra did little to fight the effects of gravity.</li>
    <li> It feels weird and was a pain to figure out exactly where/how to put it on(angle wise) since it didn&#x27;t come with any directions or anything.  There&#x27;s no info for care or anything either, just the sticky cutlets is all.</li>
    <li> It sticks pretty well to the skin, it&#x60;s just that the size is not right for me. I don&#x60;t know if I&#x60;ll get to use it or give it to a friend better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I listened to other reviews and bought a size bigger - it fits perfectly so I can&#x27;t stress this enough. I bought this to wear under a bridesmaid dress but tried it out with a t-shirt and it felt great, stayed in place all day and yet came off easily. Be aware that this is a less than $5 product so don&#x27;t expect the package to be fancy - it basically includes a clear plastic tray (mine got here all bent out of shape) and the plastic protectors covering the sticky part of the silicone.</li>
    <li> Love these for the days I do not want to wear a real bra. Also had shoulder surgery so these are a great alternative to a bra that won&#x27;t irritate my incisions.</li>
    <li> IT didn&#x27;t come with a box or anything to put it back into.....</li>
    <li> I am a 34C and I ordered a D cup thinking it would fit fine.  It was so small!  it looked like a B cup bra.  I was able to get it on comfortably but it left indentations in my breasts--not flattering.  I then tried it on a bit higher and it looked smoother but provided no support (it actually made my boobs look saggy; and I do not ave saggy boobs!).  It might work for a small C cup and under but it is not for shapely breasts.  The good thing about this product though is that it is super sticky and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it will fall off.  It is also thick and the cups were the same thickness and same size-just small.  I may hang on to it for when I wear baggy lace back shirts but it is not to be worn with tight clothing when it is too small.</li>
    <li> This thing sucked! It was too small, I would have returned it, but decided not to go through all that fuss. The adhesive comes off,so much came off it was the size of 3 peas! It makes your chest look saggy, no support at all</li>
    <li> After having some less than professional conversations with the seller, I finally received my package. I purchased the bra having high hopes to wear it with some key holiday pieces, but that was not the case. The quality is definitely mirrored by the price, make sure to remember that. The piece doesn&#x27;t have enough padding to give any actual lift/support, and the adhesive doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours. If you have breasts I would simply call these glorified silicon nipple covers.</li>
    <li> I wear 34C, the bra provides some lift, but not enough. Do not bother with this product if you wear a C or larger, it&#x27;s just not going to work well enough to be worth it, save your money for a different style backless bra. For anyone small enough, I read that with this type of bra it&#x27;s best to order 1 cup size larger than the one you wear. I ordered a size D and the cups fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is a great idea, but if you have D or bigger its not gonna work. It give ZERO support!</li>
    <li> Its UN bra not NU bra. Fake</li>
    <li> I needed to get this for a bridesmaid dress that was showing too much on the side. It pushed my breasts together and away from the side, which is what I needed. Other than for this dress, I wouldn&#x27;t really wear this - it&#x27;s not ideal for large breasts. If you&#x27;re not the size of the chick in the picture, you&#x27;re going to be annoyed with the results. That being said, I DO like this bra for what I needed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this bra because I needed it for a backless dress.  I recommend to order a cup size larger to get full coverage and more support.  Try to get it positioned correctly the first time because once you pull it off, the adhesive doesn&#x27;t stick as well.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay up, doesn&#x27;t seem the right size, too small. I had bought one on another site that I like so thought I&#x27;d try a larger one, but this one isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
    <li> 2 days late on arrival , didn&#x27;t adhere for more then 20 minutes, did not for my breast , DEFINITELY would NOT recommend!! It provided absolutely NO SUPPORT ! Might work well for women with small bust , but if your large breasted , like myself (38C,or sister size 36DDD) I feel you will not be satisfied !  However if you are going to purchase , do your research before hand and spend the a little extra to get a good quality self adhering bra, even of its only for special occasions !</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! It&#x27;s great for when you need a little support but don&#x27;t want bra straps to show. I&#x27;m a size D and this strapless bra surprisingly does the job! I was a little disappointing that there are no cleaning instructions (or instructions of any kind) included in the package but it doesn&#x27;t take a genius to figure out how to put it on. I did not have any issue with the bra staying put... even in 100 degree Texas heat &amp; humidity. Overall, great great product and well worth the $5 price!</li>
    <li> Ok! The packaging was horrible.. No 5 star for that! sorry guys!! but of course NU BRA are the Best ever! and the old ones I have I just add a little body adhesive and voila Stays on!! So This Bras are always a must in any ladies closet.</li>
    <li> My daughter used the bra for her ballet performance. She needed a strapless bra and it worked perfectly. This product was everything the seller said it was</li>
    <li> The people who are saying that this doesn&#x27;t work for D cups are wrong because I am a 38 D and wow does this work! It took about ten minutes to figure out how to wear it but when I was finished I put on a shirt and tried to see how my boobs looked, they were perky and looked even bigger than usual! The adhesive is very good also, washing it super simple too. I am really happy I bought this. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This might work, if they have your regular bra size... two sizes up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 38D would fit the boobs of a 36B person, maybe... unless you think demi-size versions will hold your boobs up in a backless halter.</li>
    <li> Love these!! I wore them two days in a row for special functions and am very pleased to say they stayed put. I&#x27;m a 32D and these were perfectly sized. Rinse off with water and let it dry after wearing and amazingly they are just as sticky as before being used once dry again. Very natural feel, no pinching or buckling of the material or my skin when wearing.</li>
    <li> These are too thin, unlike the ones I purchase at the Closet.</li>
    <li> The $20 one at target is a much better deal because it actually works. This one peels off at the edges. It is super thin and shows nipple right through it which is disconcerting when you want to wear a white top. It was a waste of money and I never use it.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stick for long and there is no support.</li>
    <li> I bought the &amp;#34;D&amp;#34; size and it does its job; there are other brands that I&#x27;ve used that are a better fit, but they are more expensive.</li>
    <li> Definitely NOT true to size and they look ridiculous. Threw it out right after I attempted to apply them. Shipping took forever and I thought for the price why not? Not worth the gamble...sorry. Never again! Good idea but not a good buy! Save your couple bucks :(</li>
    <li> How gross but that&#x27;s exactly what they feel like. The size is very small so I&#x27;d say go up two sizes rather than one as others have suggested. The transition from edge to skin is not smooth so they&#x27;re not as &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; as you&#x27;d want when wearing nylon or silk, for example. Real cheap in price so it&#x27;s worth a shot -- some reviews are very positive. For myself, they&#x27;re useless.  (I expected to wait on the shipping and got it within three weeks.)</li>
    <li> I did not even end up using this for my wedding in which I just wanted to have a little lift and padding under my lace up corset dress. I followed the directions specifically and even tried to use tips that were given by others who bought this product... I couldn&#x27;t get them to make my bust look anything but weird, It looked better with nothing.</li>
    <li> Priced according to quality. They fit good, but poorly assembled.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know how long they will last.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably loose them dancing at a concert.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these for her prom and formal dresses.  Arrived in a VERY REASONABLE amount of time and in time for Prom.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> I purposely bought these to wear with some backless tank tops I had purchased.  I could go without a bra, but your always more comfortable covered.  these are great and really stick to the skin good.  only problem, in the dead of summer, while outside and sweating, the sweat pools inside the cups and then down your shirt, then viola! you have boob sweat all on your totally cute tanks.  I guess I will just be going braless from now on.</li>
    <li> Not good at picking breasts up, but it does adhere nicely to skin and come off smooth. Better for tigher dresses</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about this product, but I have some shirts and dresses that a bra won&#x27;t work. So when I saw this, I thought what the heck, they weren&#x27;t expensive, so I got a pair to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my amazement they really work...they kind of feel like they are going to come off, but they don&#x27;t. They stay put until you take them off. And they really hold you in place.&lt;br /&gt;After awhile, I&#x27;ve heard, you have to buy some liquid adhesive to help them stay in place, but I haven&#x27;t run into that problem yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One big issue, they come from like Hong Kong, so it took like 7 weeks to get here, but I would absoulutly buy them again. And probably will.</li>
    <li> Price is nice but I don&#x27;t know about the quality cause I still yet to receive my purchase</li>
    <li> They are probably fine if you wear a C cup or smaller and will be in a supportive dress... These did nothing for me. The adhesive power is intense though! You get the stickiness you need and more.</li>
    <li> Wish it was bigger. Better than others I&#x27;ve bought.  If you&#x27;re bigger than a 34 C wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I&#x27;m a 34DD</li>
    <li> Returning for refund.  Absolutely NO SUPPORT and sized way smaller.  I am a C/D cup size so ordered the D cup and it was way too small.  Not only is it not recommended for large breast, it is not ideal for normal/average breast size unless you have silcone where your boobs are perky.  If your a normal woman with natural breasts that have not been cosmetically altered, these will do nothing for you accept hang along with your boobs!</li>
    <li> Do not purchase if you are larger than a B cup, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> When looking for any type of bra for a larger cup size one needs support.  This product does not offer it.  All it does is pull one&#x27;s assets together.</li>
    <li> The self adhesive Nu Color Bra does a great job in support and uplift in my swimsuit.  The adhesive held up for two years in the others I bought so I have no reason to doubt these will do the same.  Most of the time I swim in chlorine water and loved the fact there was no deterioration from the strong chlorine.  I&#x27;m so glad Amazon offered these in a size D cup.  I was unable to find the larger cup size anywhere else.  For those of you who are looking to add some extra curve to your suit (or your clothes) I quote my hubby....\\&quot;Honey, you looked good in that suit before but now you look like the 3-D version of yourself.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my daughter to wear with her strapless prom dress.  She stated it was easy enough to put on, but has concerns over how stick it will be for another use (she&#x27;s only worn once).  My biggest complaint is that it was not supportive enough.  Also, the product did take a while to arrive, so plan ahead.</li>
    <li> Absolutely worthless, a complete waste of money. Weighed my boobs down instead of lifting them up, and wouldn&#x27;t stick on. I was unable to use them for my event.</li>
    <li> Size not accurate. Too small</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product.  It is not the correct size and will not stay on.  It is not at all what I expected.</li>
    <li> Would not purchase again.  Does not fit anywhere near my regular size.&lt;br /&gt;Soft natural feeling material.</li>
    <li> Nice product for the price. Always wear them under all garments. I like to wear them under sweaters mostly. Very comfortable and warm to skin very quickly.</li>
    <li> It was great! I used if for  one night so far. The dress i wore was a chiffon dress that was backless. I took the bra out of the packaging and put it on and it stuck and stayed there the whole night!!! Enjoyed my night because I knew i was covered and didn&#x27;t have any problems. I put the plastic back on the adhesive side of the bra and folded it up to wear it next time. GREAT PRICE, even BETTER product. I also didn&#x27;t utilize the push up option because my dress wasn&#x27;t low cut at all, but i look forward to trying it with a low cut dress. Take it from me me guys, it STICKS, STAYS, and DOES THE JOB!!</li>
    <li> This bra looks EXACTLY like a piece of raw chicken. I think it work better as a gag in someone&#x27;s fridge than as a bra. It&#x27;s super sticky and it got immediately covered with lint. Make sure you keep the plastic covers it comes with. I only got to wear it once, because my cat also thought it looked like chicken and ripped it apart. It did do a pretty good job lifting my breasts and adding a bit of volume, but the outside is slicker than a fabric bra so it made my strapless dress impossible to keep up.</li>
    <li> I ordered a D because all of the reviews said to order a size or two up because they ran small. Either they did not send me a D or their idea of a D is WAAAAAY off. Even my friend who is a B could not wear this thing. It&#x27;s SUPER SMALL. Waste of money, I had to throw it away.</li>
