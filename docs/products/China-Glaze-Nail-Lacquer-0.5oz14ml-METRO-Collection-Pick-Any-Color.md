<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The color is very similar to China Glaze &amp;#34;Recycle&amp;#34; only darker. I love both colors!</li>
    <li> Formula is a little sticky and doesn&#x27;t do an awesome job a leveling. I used both CND Sticky basecoat and Seche Vite&#x27;s topcoat but the polish chipped pretty quickly. The color matches the photo but I&#x27;m a little disappointed but that may be because it&#x27;s closer to black than I would have liked (I should have looked carefully at the color swatch).</li>
    <li> Well this is my first China Glaze polish and I&#x27;m not a fan of the brush, I prefer wider brushes.</li>
    <li> I love the color gray. This is a very dark color gray and it has long lasting staying NO CHIP power. I have lots of China Glaze polishes. In fact, they are starting to beat out my favorite O.P.I polishes.</li>
    <li> China Glaze is the best!  If you put a top coat over it, it&#x27;s good for at least a week!  Concrete Catwalk is a beautiful color that goes with everything!</li>
    <li> This is a great Fall/Winter color you can even wear it early Spring, it wears great. I receive many compliments every time I wear this polish.</li>
    <li> The nail polish color is exactly as I expected and matches the outfit that I bought it for perfectly. But the finish isn&#x27;t very glossy, so I have to use a top coat with it, and the color doesn&#x27;t last that long; it started to chip after a few days of wear (even with top and bottom coat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it three stars because it&#x27;s a great color for those looking for a slate-grey color and it has really great coverage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge OPI gal, and I&#x27;ve never tried China Glaze. I&#x27;m very happy with the results, great color, dries in a fair amount of time. It&#x27;s interesting that you may not get a tracking # but i placed the order on the 17th--and it&#x27;s here today! It came before the stuff I do have a tracking # on. It&#x27;s packaged properly too! I recommend this seller &amp; an amazing product to everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a charcoal and this is pretty close.  It matches the pic shown and is very pretty, especially paired w/yellow....I&#x27;m satisfied!!!</li>
    <li> Great Product and Fast Shipping!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this color, especially for winter. 2 coats gives it the perfect shade of dark gray.</li>
    <li> China Glaze&#x27;s CONCRETE CATWALK is a gorgeous neutral gray color that is perfect for everyday use and can be easily dressed up for a special occasion.  It is a dark color you can feel comfortable wearing.  The polish goes on smoothly and is quick drying.  All together it is a wonderful, quality product that I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Chips easily and takes several coats.  Like the color, but not impressed with the product.</li>
    <li> the color shows nice on any complexion (im a medium brown) i would recommend this color to anyone who would  like to try a dark/ not exactly black color. 2 coats of this nail polish is sufficient and this nail polish lasts a reasonable amount of days (it doesnt chip right away). Overall nice brand, nice color, buy it, you will not be disappointed :)</li>
    <li> I like China Glaze polis as it goes on so nice and smooth and last a long time without chipping.  Every color I&#x27;ve ordered has been great and vibrant, will be ordering even more colors.</li>
    <li> I have a very similar color in OPI that chips the minute I paint my nails...so I figured I&#x27;d give this one a try. This color is amazing but within a day, I have chips all over... even worse after taking a shower :(   What I have been doing is painting my nails with Gellish in clear and then painting over it with this. It&#x27;s a bit chippy even on top of the gellish but I love the color so much!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this brand. It goes on so smoothly and you don&#x27;t even need to aplly a second coat. It even looks just like a gel manacure. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> i dont like the color in real life on my nails it looks weird cant describe, maybe i will give to someone else</li>
    <li> The color is fantastic - a dark glossy charcoal with no shimmer. My favorite part is that it only takes one coat to achieve the saturation you want but if you want another coat for that ultra lacquered look, it can easily be done in one sweep. What a great product, and SO affordable!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a dark metal grey that because of the shine kinda pops. I like to take my polish when I get a manicure for in-between touch-ups....so I have a lot of polish. Never bought China Glaze. The glossy shine is very good.</li>
    <li> I received this so fast! And I was amazed that I did one coat right on top of the other and it dried within minutes, and it covered so well(I almost didn&#x27;t need a second coat but I wanted to make sure it was all even!) I added China Glaze&#x27;s \\&quot;Doll house glitter\\&quot; on my tips for some added sparkle! Soo cute &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> Amazon always delivers-&lt;br /&gt;Love China glaze ( great shine ) unique colors.&lt;br /&gt;NO STREAKING :-)&lt;br /&gt;Last without a chip for up to 5 days..&lt;br /&gt;No exaggeration.</li>
    <li> its a unique color and love it for the fall time. Its not black so i don&#x27;t feel  goth when wearing it. but its cute</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this! when i got it in the mail, it was pretty quick!!! i love the color and im just overjoyed by it!!!</li>
    <li> It was a beautiful color, however, before a week was even up, the nail polish already had started peelingand chipping off. Not the best quality.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this dark grey shade it applies super smooth. If I was to use the whole bottle I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Color is exactly as shown.  What a great shade!  China Glaze covers really well and gives off a nice finish.</li>
    <li> The color is exactly what i wanted. the quality is ok, but the color is what you see so yeap, works for me!</li>
    <li> exact color i wanted. it drys fast. its good to mix and to do designs on. last more than three days on nails</li>
    <li> I love this color and have received a ton of compliments on it. I had my nails painted when I went to a salon to get a pedicure. The technician complimented me on my nails and asked if it was Shellac. I had that same question from another person as well. I got this product within a few days. Very Happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect gray that I&#x27;ve been looking for!! Great price too. Also doesn&#x27;t chip very easily!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This polish is nice and thick, and in certain light has an almost blue sheen. I strongly recommend the use of a top coat, on it&#x27;s own it does not stand up to the rigours of child care.</li>
    <li> Cant always find nail color without sparkles! This great!!! Dark and it is definitely a great buy! Highly recommend this color!</li>
    <li> I love the color, but I think I&#x27;m going to have to try thinner coats. I put on two heavier coats of polish, and it started flaking and chipping after only a few days. Jury&#x27;s still out on this....</li>
    <li> It is a nice polish but I thought it would be a little but lighter. It&#x27;s hard to tell that it&#x27;s even grey it looks almost black when you put it on.</li>
    <li> I havent used it yet but looks to be great gray. I dmt usually wear cremes i like sparkle but i will take a shot with this because of past reviews. Very happy and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The color goes on smooth without lines. Only 2 coats are needed to get that professional look!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a color just like this and finally got it yesterday. I love it. I was afraid that it would be too dark, but its perfect. The seller was amazing too.. expected delivery was Wednesday and I received it Monday. Perfect!</li>
    <li> This is the color it shows and I love it so much this is my second buy of the product. I am not very happy with the other colors that I got but this one is great if you like dark greys, and I do because I add other colors of sprinkles etc to them to make them different, its fun</li>
    <li> the color is so ugly, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going to use it. It looks different in the picture shown. I wish I can return it. I don&#x27;t recommend this color to anyone.</li>
    <li> Color is very true and beautiful, love grey and if you do you will, love this color on nails and your toes!!!</li>
    <li> This was a Birthday gift for my Daughter-in-Law and she loves it!  She loved how smoothly it went on and the shine!</li>
    <li> I ordered first time and I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase. The color is perfect, has a good quality and last long time</li>
    <li> This is definitely my fall color. It is dark and rich, and I love it. The picture is slightly misleading, as it has a sort of brown hint to it, but the real polish comes out a nice dark grey. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great color!  Great nail polish!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different shades of gray &amp; this is the perfect shade!  It is very long lasting color.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I love the color, that&#x27;s why I gave it a 5 star rating.  I am a bit suspicious that the polish has been &amp;#34;watered&amp;#34; down some.  It takes about 3 coats to get the right color.</li>
    <li> Color looks amazing on nails for any occasion. You can actually get away with one coat. I layer it up with glitter polish.</li>
    <li> Fantastic wear, long lasting.</li>
    <li> I love this grey color. It paints on smoothly and dries well. Would also look amazing with a matte finish.</li>
    <li> Everything about this polish is to die for... Color, consistency, ease of application.  I can&#x27;t stop looking at my nails!  I think it looks great especially on fair skin.</li>
    <li> China glaze is the best nail polish hands down. It&#x27;s not as thick as I&#x27;d like, so you have to layer up. But it does dry quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to wait long.</li>
    <li> Love this polish, its the same polish that the nail shop use. the polish goes on smooth apply 2 coats and your good to go. the price is great and the shipping experience was good 2 because nothing came in broke thank goodness.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this color for a pink-toned, fair-skinned person.  I&#x27;ve tried this numerous times since purchasing and can&#x27;t get over how GREEN it looks. It really doesn&#x27;t come off as being gray at all.</li>
    <li> The color of this polish is true to picture and goes on easily and lasts! I&#x27;m really happy with this product and am actually wearing it now. :-)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love China Glaze and this color is amazing. It&#x27;s a creme polish witch I love, goes on smooth ans dries fairly quick.</li>
    <li> Never disappointed with China Glaze Products</li>
    <li> This color is BEAUTIFUL! A wonderful dark gray, that looks good alone or with a little sparkle polish over the top. Lasts a long time also.</li>
    <li> I love China Glaze polish, and this color is GORGEOUS. It is just as displayed and the color is very saturated, not thin at all. One coat is all you need with this polish! Took awhile to ship, 7 days. But it was worth the wait!</li>
    <li> This is a very unique color, grey/green/purple, reminds me almost of a mood ring as it changes colors depending on what type of lighting your in.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I was super excited when I got this nail polish. It is a beautiful shade of gray that goes well with almost anything. The nail polish goes on smooth and looks really nice.</li>
    <li> ITS THE BEST THANKS A LOT DEAR  I WILL DEAL WITH U GUYS LATER&lt;br /&gt;REGARDS THANKS A LOT AGAIN  .</li>
    <li> I love the color it goes on smooth and dries fast. It last a couple days without chipping I really like China products they last a long time and I&#x27;ve had some bottles for a few months/years and they’re still going</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very much a bright color person, but this looks incredibly sophisticated.  Also works well with sparkles to give nails a celebratory look.</li>
    <li> Love this color and this brand makes really long lasting nail polish</li>
    <li> Thank you this nail polish is pretty and it shipped fast. This brand of nail polish stays on for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love China Glaze in the first place, but I loved this color!! I got lots of compliments when I used it!</li>
    <li> Nice deep ash color. A bit darker than I expected- It looks black in dimly lit environments. Dries quickly, needed a second coat and didn&#x27;t have to wait 3 hours for the first coat to cure.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color gray, not too dark and not too silvery.  I&#x27;m very hard on my hands but it stays on well with a top coat.</li>
    <li> I was most concerned with how a color like this would coat my nail-it only takes 1-2 coats for a solid, even finish.:) I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I do wish it was a little faster drying, but overall worth it.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> Stayed on well. Like the color. Always happy with china glaze</li>
    <li> Daughter wanted this so I had to get another one</li>
    <li> Nice color, thick&amp; glides on smooth ..it doesnt chip..fast delivery</li>
    <li> Great price...great co.or. As I have said in other reviews...this co,or is. Ot for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;It works on toes or fingers.&lt;br /&gt;I just lo e it...mostly in winter and fall seasons.</li>
    <li> i choose this color to go with a matte top coat, wanted it to match my husband&#x27;s denim color harley he has, and it matched perfectly. the color itself is a very nice color. it is a black/charcoal color</li>
    <li> I really like the color it is not like other nail polishes that show one color and when u aply it it ends up lighter or darker</li>
    <li> The color was just what I wanted and this is really good quality nail polish! Comparable to OPI, but half the price :) I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I really love the way this  color looks...its rich and only took one coat! It will last so much longer than your normal polishes. It does chip fairly quickly if you dont use a good top coat.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this color! It&#x27;s a very deep, sexy color (I would call it dark grey) and it looks SO great with my skin tone (I&#x27;m mixed with black and white). A must have for any collection!</li>
    <li> I got this about a week or go in the mail and used it for the first time last night. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this color it gives you that grown sexy woman feel without giving to much and not enough at the same time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on this nail polish from friends and strangers. It was reasonably priced and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> great color . one of my favorite . dries well and i would buy it again and again . love it .</li>
    <li> Concrete Catwalk is a good alternative to black polish.  Application was good, two coats is perfect. I used Seche Vite topcoat to make it extra glossy but it&#x27;s shiny without it.  Wear is good also.</li>
    <li> It looks gray or green depending on the light.  Very nice with olive skin but may be a bit harsh is you have fair skin,</li>
    <li> 100% satisfied with the product, is a very good nail polish, very good quality, the color is great and protects nails. I love it</li>
    <li> Very nice dark coverage and provides lots of shine. I use a under and top coat to even it out. You can&#x27;t beat the price and it arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Although there was a mix-up, they promptly sent me the right product! And they threw in a free gift for the trouble. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> Poor quality nail polish. Very sticky and applies streaky. Does not dry in a reasonable amount of time and chips in less than a day. Will never purchase again or recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This CONCRETE CATWALK color by China Glaze looks smashing on toe nails! It does have a tinge of dark green on the first coat, but gradually darkens to a beautiful dark gray hue on the second coat. 2 coats and you&#x27;re a walking diva. It doesn&#x27;t have shimmer or glitter on it, but a glorious glossy shine, and twice as glossy with the top coat on! It is mysterious and overall sexy if you&#x27;re into dark colors. The consistency is perfect--that means no bubbles and never runny.</li>
    <li> More than one layer makes this appear black, and only one layer is not enough to have a smooth, nice look. Thumbs down. (No pun intended.)</li>
    <li> love this winter colour</li>
    <li> Ordered this on a Monday, received it Saturday. Very happy with my purchase and the quickness of shipping. I love the color and China Glaze polish is always great. Thanks for making this a great shipping opportunity!!</li>
    <li> This color is soooo cute. It is definitely one of my new favorites. I have to put on 2 coats for it to completely cover my nail because it leaves a few light spots, but its okay. I really lovee it.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish, it just take two coats...n it so shiny u don&#x27;t even have to put on top coat for shine, no bubbles n clumping..</li>
    <li> I love this color. It&#x27;s not a cool grey. It&#x27;s a warm, stormy gray. Just short or a charcoal, and it looks great with almost any look.</li>
    <li> My husband got me this for christmas. Beautiful color! And it dries fast! I am so in love with this nail polish (and the brand!)</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish! This color is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With one coat, it&#x27;s a little too light and clear, but two coats is perfect; it&#x27;s very solid and pretty much exactly the color in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s a little sticky. I just opened it yesterday, and when I applied it today, it kind of had the texture of about a month old nail polish.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite polishes!!</li>
    <li> I love it. It looks great if u put some glitter on top. Im been getting  a lot of compliments</li>
    <li> China Glaze is the best brand of nail polish on the market. It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t need a top coat. The only downside with this color is that it is a little darker than it looks in the picture.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the rich grey color and the glaze that you get with using China Glaze Concrete Catwalk. Also, the color stays on very well (I didn&#x27;t have to retouch very often.).</li>
    <li> This is a cute color, I mostly use it as a base under glitter toppers or in some nail art, but it looks great on its own as well.</li>
    <li> have this on my nails right now, and I am so happy with how the color came out! super shiny and it&#x27;s not streaky at all!!! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be wearing it for the spring season, but this is definitely such a lovely color and the way you apply it on your nails is so smooooth! :)</li>
    <li> This was a really good buy and the color is so pretty and it blends perfect with just about everything. I  knew I would like when I could find it at any of the stores in my home town. Very popular color...a must have!!!</li>
    <li> Any China Glaze is amazing, but I especially love this color. It stays on for days and this is my new fav.</li>
    <li> i returned it n dont like it at all its not good n even dont has any style .....i dont like it</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic dark grey. I am in love with it!!! It goes on perfectly in one coat (super bonus--less dry time!!!) and really reacts with different types of light really nicely. I truly recommend this!! I am loving China Glaze! (Shipping time was great too!)</li>
    <li> this nail polish is so GREAT ! i can do the dishes , take a shower , even wash my car , and it don&#x27;t chip ! its amazing ! it costs more than walmart nail polish BUT WELL worth it !</li>
    <li> The color was nice. Very good price for China Glaze nail polish. I&#x27;ll be buying some for myself soon as well.</li>
    <li> I adore the color onscreen, but even with several coats (that were unnecessary) I couldn&#x27;t get rid of the green undertone the other reviewers noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would liken the green undertone to British racing green, which is pretty specific and to each their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first China Glaze product and I did however, fall in love with the polish. One or two coats, the fastest drying time I&#x27;ve ever experienced and a highly glossy finish made me go back and try other colors instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame about this one...might have been the lighting but it just didn&#x27;t win me over.</li>
    <li> I wear this color with black tip (french manicure style), and it is different, yet elegant. On my toes nails, I used to coats of this color and it looks very nice.</li>
    <li> received this polish with another polish by the same maker - China Glaze. LOVED both of the color choices, polish remains shiny for quite a while, and color lasts a long time as well. Pleased with the vendor and their packing methods, would buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> its a beautiful dark greyish-navy-black. Sophisticated, elegant alternative to my usual black nail polish, which now seems juvenile in comparison. Wears well.</li>
    <li> only needed a few coats and the color comes out very glossy!. Very nice dark color and stands out, got a few compliments!</li>
    <li> I ordered this polish and was really excited to have received it in like 3 days. When i opened the package however, they sent me a freaking gray crackle polish. If I wanted a crackle polish I would have ordered one. waste of money.</li>
    <li> My daughter says she likes the color but it tends to chip off easily.  But all in all it&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
    <li> Great color. Great polish. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this color.. Can&#x27;t wait to try a french with the blackish and a clear, I just know it will be awesome</li>
    <li> I received soooo many compliments on this polish color.  It really looks great, even on someone my age!  I&#x27;d buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> Very awesome color, and very awesome brand. If your not looking for a black color, but something still dark then this is the color for you. A little thicker than I expected. Only one coat needed; which is great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly the color I expected it to be! I get a lot of compliments and I absolutely love it.  If you&#x27;re going for a dark color, but don&#x27;t want black it&#x27;s definitely the color to try.</li>
    <li> I had bought this dark gray color for my daughter away to college but when I saw it on her manicure I fell in love with it. I normally buy pinks and corals but this gray is unique and provides great coverage. I can use either for water marble or for accents in decorating. You must get it if you like to have unique colors and receive many compliments.</li>
    <li> Mighty mighty beautiful iam in love with the texture, color, and love that I don&#x27;t have to over coat.the amazing things and styles that I&#x27;ve done you would love this polish too.this polish goes on very smooth it dried perfect and quickly and it lasts for over three weeks without chipping or needing touch ups..Thank you</li>
    <li> Nice color. Although it chipped easily. I applied 3 coats to get the same color as the picture. I will still recommend it. China glaze is a great brand.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible Grey color.  I love it and have gotten many compliments on it.  It also lasts a long time too...with the right base and after coat I easily went 1 full week with no chips.</li>
    <li> love the color and the polish.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish. I have not had for even a month and I already ordered a second one. I love the color and how beautiful it looks on my nails! It arrived earlier than I expected. It was packaged nicely and it had no dents. The second one that I ordered in this color was delivered really quickly! I ordered it on a Friday and it was delivered on the following Monday. I will definitely order again.[[ASIN:B005EHHWPA China Glaze Concrete Catwalk 81074 Nail Polish]]</li>
    <li> I love this color. Its nice with a glitter coat on it also. It may be a tad bit darker than the picture but I love it.</li>
    <li> I really like this color. Its not as grey as I thought, its darker and I liked that. Doesn&#x27;t chip easily either. Good fall/ winter color.</li>
    <li> The nail polish color is exactly as shown, came right on time, loved it! I did not have any problems with this, did not come broken, absolutely a bargain!</li>
    <li> Thank you! This is the best color I ever bought I just love it and I have bought a lot of colors.</li>
    <li> Title said it all. Two coats of this stuff and I don&#x27;t have to touch my nails all week. The color is awesome too.</li>
    <li> Even though it was darker, almost black looking, it went on very smooth, one coat did cover, but I always put on 2. It&#x27;s very smooth and shiny, I just ordered a lighter gray, but still will be wearing this color too!! I&#x27;ve just started making designs on my nails, and almost all my polishes are china glaze!!! Love, love!!! China glaze! Used to be an OPI girl, but now I&#x27;m changed!!! Sorry OPI :( . So this color is darker then it shows in the picture, if I&#x27;m inside it looks black or a dark dark blue. So if your looking for a gray, there is a gray by CG can&#x27;t think of the name cause I just bought it.. I will put up a picture of this dark gray, it has pink dots, but you can see the color and see how dark it is.</li>
    <li> love it. exactly as pictured.  great product. great color. what else can you say about nailpolish? Dark gray. Perfect color.</li>
    <li> My wife LOVES the color and really enjoys this brand. She says it last a long time and looks great.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this color. Color is true to picture! Goes on well and the coverage is good. Don&#x27;t really need 2 coats!</li>
    <li> This polish is nice! It&#x27;s a beautiful color and dries very well. I didn&#x27;t know it would be like very see through and u have to paint thin layers to get the full affect but it&#x27;s easy.</li>
    <li> It goes on SO easy, you can do with one coat, although I preferred two. It gives a flawless finish and I love it because it is not as drastic as black. Looks beautiful with a shimmery coat on it. I am extremely pleased with this!</li>
    <li> Love love love this color.  Believe it or not it does go with everything.</li>
    <li> Great price, great arrival time, &amp; great product! I would highly recommend this product &amp; the company that sells it!</li>
    <li> This was just the color i was looking for it is a dark charcoal grey and a nice solid color with out all the glitter to it</li>
    <li> I brought this since it was said to be a dupe of http://www.amazon.com/OPI-Nein-Ok-Fine/dp/B008VFXYLI . I loved the color as soon as I saw someone in my office wearing it and I ordered it right away. I only have a few, but I love the China Glaze polishes I have so far. It goes on smoothly and you only two coats. You can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
    <li> I love this color! I&#x27;m very fair skinned and I love this grey color, it&#x27;s a great option for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to go as dark as wearing a black polish and the wear time on this is super long and is pretty resistant to chips!</li>
    <li> Love the nail polish.</li>
    <li> I love this color. It&#x27;s not quite grey, and not quite black. Perfect medium for any outfit! I use it for both my toes and fingernails.</li>
    <li> I love the color! Only s***ty part is that when I got it in the mail, the Polish was open!!  What a big aghh!</li>
    <li> Product was shipped quickly and I really love the color. Does chip pretty easy but really like the polish overall.</li>
    <li> I love this shade of Gray and it works great with the silver glitter I purchased as well. China Glaze is a great brand and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> This seems to be thin at first but a good shake and two coats later its very strong. Compared to opi scraping this off is much much harder.</li>
    <li> Great color and it goes great with Ahoy!! I have used them together as water marble and the design I get are beautiful!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product and the quality is really bad, bad, bad and bad. The same day I got my nails painted the same day the enamel was cracked, I have to paint my nails again and even if you apply 3 coats it still do not last more than a day. Bad quality.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try these out as an alternative to OPI. I also wanted this color to see how many coats I would need even though it is dark. I need two coats to get the nice rich dark color as portrayed in the photo. This is about the same with OPI. I actually like the quality of this nail polish and I am going to start buying this brand over OPI as it is very similar but cheaper.</li>
    <li> It IS a dark color but it seems like it changes color almost.. It&#x27;s kinda weird and not very pretty. I was a little upset because I wear a lot of grey and I was really excited to find such a great color (pictured) but its ugly. Not very flattering, it&#x27;s too bad...</li>
    <li> Probably the best polish I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> This polish is beautiful ... it&#x27;s different ... not soo girly but still girly.  It applies very nicely to the nail as well with only 2 coats needed.</li>
    <li> This color is such a lovely gray. I usually prefer lighter colors but this gray has such a flow to it that I have a tendency to use it a lot, it goes with a lot of outfits and designs since its a medium for a black or white.</li>
    <li> Same as pictured used on pedicure and put white daisy with it on top so cute and looks good and dark but not black or dark purple which I don&#x27;t like. Recommend it for winter for sure and rainy spring weather!</li>
    <li> I love love love the color of this nail polish. It arrived quickly and looks great. It lasted longer without chipping than any of my OPI nail polish.</li>
    <li> I love how this color looks on my nails. It&#x27;s like a dark charcoal gray, but from a distance it looks black!!</li>
    <li> Love this color!!!! I am a neutral and earthtone- kind of girl, so this color was right up my alley. It&#x27;s China Glaze, so, of course, it has awesome color and shine ....plus the color name made me think of Catwoman ....Raaaawwwrrrrrr!!!! Had to have it! You will too!</li>
    <li> I like the color but it was kind of thick and clumpy. It dried well and looked good after and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail polish i&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few. I put it on 4 days ago and it still hasn&#x27;t chipped or split.  The color is pretty and it shines so nicely. It looks like its wet kind of like when you first apply it. I&#x27;ve paid a ridiculous amount for Nars and that polish can&#x27;t hold a candle to china glaze. Wil def buy more</li>
    <li> Really great charcoal color.</li>
    <li> Great shade of grey! glides on smoothly and is opaque with just one coat. Finishes to a nice subtle gloss. Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> True to picture. I like it more with a matte top coat, but it&#x27;s beautiful on it&#x27;s own. I hope it lasts long!</li>
    <li> This is one of the few trend colors that doesn&#x27;t look ridiculous on adult nails! And the color goes with everything, too.</li>
    <li> I love China Glaze product they are so great they look so beautiful on my nails they&#x27;re super shiny and go on with one coat</li>
    <li> Nice color... not much of a sheen to it though.  Even after a base coat and two clear top coats its started peeling/chipping the next day.</li>
    <li> lovely color, use it all the time, pretty good staying power, love this shade of grey, goes w everything</li>
    <li> Great color and lasted a good while</li>
    <li> This is a very dark gray color that looks almost black sometimes, but reveals the dark charcoal color when the light hits it. Very nice color. I love China Glaze nail polishes because they dry pretty fast and have great colors.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s close to black but just not quite.  It is nicer way to look chic without being to severe. It can be worn with any color.  More of a spring or fall basic versus summer or winter.</li>
    <li> Love this color &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;Goes on the nail softly&lt;br /&gt;No clumps&lt;br /&gt;Great color&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly !&lt;br /&gt;Will be purchasing again*</li>
    <li> This polish literally chipped instantly and I even had it done by a professional. I rather spend a little more money on better quality polish. I&#x27;ll stick with Essie brand polish from now on.</li>
    <li> I just love this color so much. I&#x27;m almost out and I will need to buy another bottle. Only complaint I have is it needs 3 coats so you use it up very quickly.</li>
    <li> This color is so beautiful; It matches with everything. I ran out of black nail polish, so I figured I would try a lighter color instead. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product. Not only did it arrive in the mail in just five days, but it also was a great price. This color is unique, and I never saw nail polish this color before.</li>
    <li> The person who I bought this for off of their &amp;#34;wishlist&amp;#34; was very appreciative of the gift and very happy to receive it. It was for their birthday.</li>
