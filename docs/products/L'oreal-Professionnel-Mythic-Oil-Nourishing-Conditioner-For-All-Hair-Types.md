    <li> It&#x27;s a great product!! My grandkids and I love how it softens all hair types young or old. Try it</li>
    <li> Makes my hair INCREDIBLY soft. I don&#x27;t know if this is a shower conditioner or a leave in one... it doesn&#x27;t specify but I use it as a leave in and it makes my hair feel wonderful. Smells really clean and fresh, too.</li>
    <li> Very nourishing, 2 pumps of oil is sufficient for my hair which is ear length, makes it shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> Mythic oil is amazing.... love...love...love...love... this stuff... it restores your hair and provides an unbelievable shine and brilliance.... the conditioner is superb</li>
    <li> I am choosing this rating in order to get it in the books that I cannot rate a product I have yet to receive!!!! the order has supposedly been shipped on Dec 3, 2013, charged to my account and delivery set for time frame up to Jan 13, 2014 so I am not able to complain about it to Amazon and tell them how miserably unhappy I am about this issue so decided to go at it this way! Do not know where it is coming from as they have not said but cannot believe a product ordered over a month ago is still not delivered with no explanation and a charge to one&#x27;s account!! NOT acceptable. Do not order this product !!!Find somewhere else to buy it I would advise you if you really want it. I personally no longer care what it is like as I would never order it again unless it can perform incredible miracles on my hair which I DOUBT AS THE SHAMPOO WAS NOT ANYTHING INCREDIBLE! The oil however is a great product and it arrived in a short time after I ordered it--go figure!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Not only does it make you hair so shiny it is feels great all over your entire body.  It smell so clean and does not leave an oil residue.  Your skin is so smooth..........Try it I know you will love it like I do.</li>
    <li> this product isn&#x27;t worth the money but it works well enough. I will use it after swimming to keep my hair in good condition during the summer months.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love this product.  Great for any kind of hair.  Will reorder.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see benefit</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I was skeptical at first but really started using it after I ombre&#x27;d my hair to make sure my hair didn&#x27;t get too dry.  This stuff is amazing! Seriously!!</li>
    <li> The first time I used this I was blown away. I put it in my hair and let it settle in while I finished other shower duties, by the time I went back to wash it out it had sunk into my hair and made it super silky. Not to mention it smells great also. This product came in the mail on time and in good condition. I plan to buy this again for sure!</li>
    <li> So great for color-treated hair.  Makes drying and styling a breeze.  Hair looks soft and smooth!  Would recommend highly, even for the price.</li>
    <li> Great smelling and really makes my hair shiny. I originally wanted another Loreal product that was 4x the cost of this product...but this was a good bargain and works well.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft and clean with no residue</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t make my hair flat,since I have straight hair,condioners make my hair just go flat!! I will buy again!! love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s long, wavy hair that she likes to keep tame.  I noticed how shiny her hair was looking and decided to try it on my fine, flat, short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my hair very shiny, soft and I can go two days without washing instead of having to wash every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely stocking up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum:  Had to quit using because it caused my scalp to itch (I had the same problem with Moroccan Oil conditioner).</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. been using it for some time now.</li>
    <li> Is helping my previously envied curls become defined and beautiful again. I suffered from over-processed hair as a result of using box dyes consistently for years. My gorgeous hair became frizzy, much more prone to breakage points and split ends and it was difficult to grow out as I had to have the damaged ends trimmed regularly. I recently began taking prenatal vitamins to help with the growth, doing moisture treatments and using leave-in protein spray treatments with decent results. However, once I started using this conditioner along with the shampoo a few days ago, I noticed my curls looks much more defined, the frizz had subsided considerably, and my hair had regained a noticeable sheen. Plus it&#x27;s terribly terribly soft now. I&#x27;m feeling like I can go natural again instead of needing a blowout every week - although I will never give up a good blow-out. i also purchased the unisex leave in oil and wait to see the results of that.</li>
    <li> Over priced for the benefits received.</li>
    <li> It was without box but looks new !</li>
    <li> I got this I&#x27;m tandem with the matching shampoo. I love these together. This conditioner it&#x27;s super light, yet I can feel the gentry oils left over to hydrate my fine hair naturally.</li>
    <li> This is my first review on Amazon... First off I originally found this product at my salon. I paid $90 for the shampoo, conditioner, and oil... I will never pay that much again thanks to Amazon. I have baby fine hair plus after all the color and bleach in my hair completed destroyed it.. the first time I used this product I was in awe..  my hair is shiny, soft, healthy, and smells great. When I ran out I tried others again that had good ratings..  I have decided I wont be using anything else again.</li>
    <li> Love the Mythic products!</li>
    <li> A L&#x27;Oreal hairdresser used this product on my hair at his shop, and I really liked it.  I was please to learn that I could order it on Amazon.  I have just loved the way it makes my hair look and feel.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> probably, my hair doesn&#x27;t need any extra effort, so, i didn&#x27;t feel big difference using this product. I love loreal shampoos proffesional series, so, decided to get loreal conditioner as well. Overall very good product.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel soft</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this product. She can be picky, so when she says something is a must have for her hair, then it has obviously left a VERY good impression. Since I keep a shaved head, I could not tell you anything more than the fact that my wife LOVES this stuff and says that it works wonders.</li>
