<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Purchased for my preteen, its build and quality rivals the $340.00 version she has from Sefora, may be even better.  Gets hot very very quickly and is very sturdy.  Never has a problem, she&#x27;s been using it for about 4 months, would buy it again if needed...hopefully it lasts.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the great reviews and deciding to take a chance and see for myself. I can say that I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality of this product so far. I haven&#x27;t had it long, so I can&#x27;t speak about if the product holds up in the long run though. It feels solid, not flimsy when you hold it, so it&#x27;s a little heavier than my last flat iron. I love the titanium plates, they never snag my hair, and they glide smoothly over my hair, but hold it firmly at the same time. And I like the chime that alerts you when the temp is correct. I love the range of heat settings and the fact that it holds the heat well so I can use a lower heat setting with less damage to my hair. I would definitely recommend this flat iron and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very relieved to say I am ESTATIC about this purchase!! I used to swear by CHI and GHD ceramic straighteners until it they started losing their affect. So I research titanium straighteners and came across this brand and model, and took the leap of faith! It&#x27;s been amazing on my 3c/4a curly hair and can straighten most of it on a one-pass through. I&#x27;m very satisfied!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. I think the titanium iron is better than the ceramic. My hair looks like I had my stylist straighten it. I am black with natural medium textured hair. Using this iron, my hair doesn&#x27;t revert as easily when its straighten. This Izunami iron is a much better iron than the Chi and Babyliss. The only downfall is that the manufacture may not honor the warranty because the purchase was not made with an authorized dealer.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is one of the best one&#x27;s I have ever owned.  I almost purchased a Chi flat iron, but I am really happy with the Izunami Flat Iron because of how well it straightens my hair, especially in the summer when it is very humid where I live.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This does a great job making my hair straight and shiny.  The plates are a little bit so I find it difficult to do my bangs very well - I end up with a dent.</li>
    <li> Love this iron!  I have natual curly hair and this by far is the best flat iron I have used.  I don&#x27;t even have the use the highest heat setting to get my hair straight.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine, and I love it at a lower temp, but a friend who has thick, coarse hair absolutely loved it!</li>
    <li> it is amazing product . it make my hair looking good , soft , shiny and I give it 5 star</li>
    <li> Great straightener!  I love how quickly it warms up and how it beeps when it&#x27;s at the right temperature just like an oven.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great at straightening you hair. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t as expensive! When I flatiron my hair, I look as if I just came from the salon. It doesn&#x27;t take a long take to do your hair if you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
    <li> Flat iron works great. Keeps hair straight between washing . Had Chi in past. This works better than that one and was cheaper .</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted a new flat iron for Christmas. I told her to pick one out and I would get it for her. She had heard really good things about Izunami and this is the one she wanted. The first few days it worked great. It went through her hair like butter. About a week after getting it, it melted while she was doing her hair. She had to get about 4 inches of her hair cut off. I think that this company (Not Amazon) has decided to profit from these defective flat irons! IF you get one that doesn&#x27;t give you problems then consider yourself lucky! If you decide to buy this product you will be playing Russian roulette on your hair and skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****On a good note when I contacted Amazon they went above and beyond to rectify this issue.*****</li>
    <li> I have medium curly hair of the non-pretty, non-ringlet variety. Basically, my hair just kind of frizzes. And now that I&#x27;m 64 and my hair is mostly white, individual hairs get really frizzy and stand straight up or out to the side. Ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing cuts through the wayward curls and frizzies like a hot knife through butter. Heats up fast, too, and audibly lets you know when it&#x27;s ready for use. It&#x27;s an attractive piece of equipment as well and is very light. Doesn&#x27;t snag, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited a couple of months after I bought and used it to write a review because I wanted to see how it held up. It&#x27;s been functioning at 100% ever since I bought it. I am glad I did, because it&#x27;s reasonably priced. This isn&#x27;t my first flatiron, so I have a basis for comparison. This thing stacks up well against my now-dead Sedu ceramic. When this one dies - eventually all equipment dies - I will replace it with another Izunami, Good bang for my buck, good functionality, easy maintenance, and looks nice on my bathroom vanity.</li>
    <li> Just received my Izunami Ktx450 - LOVE IT!  Had to replace my Croc which I had for 7 years when it was damaged while I was traveling.  This flat iron was the third I had tried in my quest to replace.  The first was a Rowenta (a mere $150.00) and did little for my hair - returned that within days.  Next was a Jose Ebert (also about $160), beter but not good enough for the price.  Found the reviews on this one and I also found that for my hair - I need the shiny titanium plates - the coated ones do not help with my frizz.&lt;br /&gt;This one was less money (at least on Amazon) but performed WAY better!!!  Thank goodness, I live in central Florida and I was afraid I would be a frizzy mess forever!  Thank you Izunami!!!  (PS - I think I might try the hair dryer next)</li>
    <li> Awesome on long and curly hair!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She loves it and she said it works great. Her hair straightening time has been reduced to 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews where this stops working. I don&#x27;t use it every day, maybe 3-4 times a week and so far it is great. Love it and it really is hotter and more effective then a chi for sure.</li>
    <li> I have used this flat iron a couple of times, I bought it recently after my \\&quot;Sedu\\&quot; stopped working. I was debating wether to get another \\&quot;Sedu\\&quot; or try something new. My very closed friend said I should try \\&quot;Izunami.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this fat iron does miracles to my 10\\&quot; long and freezy hair, can you imagine what it can do to your hair?!?!?! IT IS A MUST HAVE, TRUST ME!!! &lt;3</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of flat irons over the years. My best, up until now, was an Izunami I purchased in early 2011, to replace a Chi I burned out.  That izunami lasted me two good years until it was sadly stolen from a hotel room. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since that fateful day in February, I have been hunting a new flat iron. I did not order a replacement Izunami because of too many reports of fakes, defectives, etc. I tried a T3 (which arrived in two pieces with wires exposed), a Chi (which barely got hot enough to straighten) and a Babyliss (which got hotter than the Chi but constantly pulled my hair and left me with a million broken ends.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Randomly, I happen upon the KTX450.  It has great reviews, and I give it a whirl based on my prior amazing Izunami experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A-MAZ-ING.  One pass to totally straight hair. Even on thick, curly hair like mine.  It did not lose heat while I was straightening, at least not to any noticeable degree, nor did I have to stop straightening to let it heat back up, like I did with the Babyliss.  I have hair to my mid-back and I was done in 5 minutes flat.  Possibly less. My hair is smooth, shiny, and perfection. No hair pulls, snags, or breaks -- I was so excited, I went online and immediately ordered a second one to keep at my boyfriends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I ordered from Beauty Fulfillment, which is fulfilled by Amazon - and I received what I believe to be an authentic product. That being said, my warranty will not be upheld as I purchased through Amazon(it is expressly written in the warranty that you cannot purchased through amazon) , but my prior experience with the brand makes me feel ok about that.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works so much better than the others I&#x27;ve owned.  U get what u pay for.  Still using it more than 3 years later, as good as the day I got it.</li>
    <li> My very seasoned hairdresser said this is the best bang for your buck and I agree!  I live in Florida &amp; have a lot of fine,curly &amp; often frizzy hair thanks to the humidity.  I love wearing my hair curly AND straight.  I bought a CHI a long time ago and gave up forever on having straight hair in the summertime here in FL.  This Izunami however REALLY straightens my hair quickly &amp; easily.  It also slides through my hair w/minimal pulling.  Also, my hair stays straight w/minimal touch ups for 3 days!</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;price tag&lt;br /&gt;FAST heating&lt;br /&gt;works great with little effort&lt;br /&gt;does the job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;haven&#x27;t found any so far. It&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I have slightly longer than shoulder length hair and my hair is thick. I use it every day. It does an amazing job on my hair. I have use a couple other popular brand good quality flat iron but they don&#x27;t even come close to this one. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I am AA and have natural 4b hair. I looked at this iron for probably 2 years (versions changed but basically the same). My husband finally purchased it for me for a Christmas gift and I must say I didn&#x27;t use it right away but when I did...I love this thing. It heats up well and even. I don&#x27;t turn it all the way up. I make one pass (I use Shea butter) and my hair is shiny and straight and perfect. Also no touch ups are needed. My hair is very dry so I can go 3 weeks without touching up my hair and then I wash. All I do is twist it up in one or two buns at night and then take it down and go in the morning. I recommend this iron to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several brands, CHI, Babyliss, etc and this one is number one hands down.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product.  I read the reviews first before buying.  It did not disappoint.  Glides through your hair like there&#x27;s built in oil.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this flat iron. It&#x27;s cut her hair prep time in half. Her hair is smooth and sleek after using. She loved this so much, she purchased two more as Christmas gifts for her mom and sister.</li>
    <li> The price of the item was great, plus all I heard were great things about this and they are so true. Best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned</li>
    <li> Tames the friz really well and controls the flyaways. Well worth the extra outlay. Good quality product and the service was excellent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s truly amazing. Best flat iron ever. Worth every penny!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Titanium is the way to go.</li>
    <li> My order arrived in 3 days and I LOVE IT. I must say I am flat iron junky due to my long think hair and by far this iron makes my hair smooth, shiny,  and so bouncy and beautiful.  The price however was 86 and over night went to 94???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good product and it seems to be a strong devic. Im very happy I got it.</li>
    <li> Ordered this last week to replace a relatively new Andis that just stopped heating on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS AMAZING. This flat iron is the best thing to happen to my hair since red dye. It&#x27;s smooth, makes my hair shiny, NO FRIZZ, and gets it super straight. It stays straight longer than it did with the old iron as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron itself is cool too. Heats up incredibly fast (I&#x27;m talking like 10 seconds - it&#x27;s insane), it&#x27;s light, and I don&#x27;t accidentally pinch myself when squeezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few weeks ago.  My hair is dry, frizzy, wiry, and wavy and this Flat Iron along with S Factor Heat Protector has made my hair smooth and straight.  Life changing!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product. I&#x27;m very well versed in straighteners as I have super course hair that has a weird wavy kink in it, so straightening is a must! Anyways I was on the hunt for a new one and my hairstylist was using Izunami. The titanium plates protect your hair and leave it smooth and shiny! This straightener is the best I&#x27;ve had!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Haven&#x27;t used it yet but in love with the slim design and overall feel and look. Will update soon</li>
    <li> Thus is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever purchased!  Heats up really fast and leaves my hair straight as ever!  I have a LOT of wavy hair and this is able to tame it with one pass.  Thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> My wife love it! At fist i didnt know much about this brand butt i read some good reviews and i decided to buy it. Now I can see i did a great choice. Definetly an excellent choice.</li>
    <li> I chosen 5 stars because it delivers the ultimate results leaving your hair surprisingly the way you want it. Very Happy I put extra research into what I was looking for and got my money worth.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It is the best I have come across. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> It does make your hair Shiney in my opinion, straightens and curls beautifully, does pretty much what it says except it really snags your hair.  When straightening my hair would snag on this tool and break, this was the main thing I didn&#x27;t want to happen.  I returned this and found an amazing deal at folica on a sedu!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it.  She wanted one of these flatiron&#x27;s and I&#x27;m glad she found this one after ton&#x27;s of online shopping and this one had great reviews..product lives up to description and she is personally thrilled with it a week later.  She showed me how hot it get&#x27;s in about 20 seconds which I guess is great for women.  I am also happy she found this for the low cost compared to other ones well over 200 dollars.  A+</li>
    <li> I have Keratin treatments done on my hair. My hairdresser uses this flatiron in her salon. She offered to get me one, but i chose to search online to get a better deal. The price was amazing and the result is even better. My hair has never been happier (and neither have I)!</li>
    <li> Heats up super hot and super fast.  Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair due to the wide plates.  Audible signal when ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product last week and received it. My old iron died and was desperate for a new one. I&#x27;ve tried an old Arrojo Izunami ceramic plate that a friend let me borrow and just fell in love!! Unfortunately that style/brand is no longer available. I found this one and hoped for the best. First of all when I received the box it said Izutech??? it stated that Izunami was changing it&#x27;s name to izutech but the iron was the same. I mean the izutech iron works ok, not as good as the Arrojo....did I get a fake? or is izunami really izutech????? Not sure how I feel about it at the moment.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever touched!</li>
    <li> This is the first flat iron I have owned.  I have curly hair and it worked great. Easy to handle and heats up fast.  It also maintains the heat well.</li>
    <li> My T3 flat iron died after 18 months, so I took the opportunity to do a lot of research on flat irons before making a purchase.  I have natural hair in a 3C texture, and a lot of it (thick and medium length).  It typically takes me 2 hours to wash, blow dry and flat iron my hair straight. The flat ironing part always takes the longest amount of time - usually a full hour.  With this flat iron, it only takes about 40 minutes, which is a significant improvement.  I love the weight of the flat iron, as well as the overall look.  It looks and feels substantial, like the quality product it is.  I&#x27;ve been raving about it to others so I&#x27;m happy to add a review on Amazon to continue the support.  As everyone else says, it heats up amazingly quickly and maintains the appropriate heat levels throughout the usage.  I&#x27;ve owned it for a few months now, so I hope it lasts me a few years.</li>
    <li> I have very curly/frizzy hair. Throughout the years I have used a variety of flat irons and products. But every time I walk out the door (I live in Hawaii, so my hair experiences 90-100% humidity every day) my hair begins to kink up!! I was introduced to Izunami by my hair stylist and absolutely love it!! The time it takes to straighten my hair has been cut in half because I don&#x27;t need to go over the same part 6 times. Humidity has no effect on my hair YAY!! Of course if my hair gets wet then the curly Q&#x27;s start to peek out. But in all this is a fantastic product. I have never needed to put the temperature above 360Â° and that is perfect for my hair but everyone is different</li>
    <li> I got this straightener about 8 months ago, and thought I had found the straightener of my dreams. I recommended it to everyone and it cut the time bottom to do my hair in half. I was so very disappointed when it died on my yesterday. It seems the wires have shorted out, as it only works when I hold the cord against the handle in a certain way. I hold it that way until it heats up, then try to straighten quickly as it shuts itself off. Very annoying! I just ordered the Rusk Professional STR8 iron today, and am hoping that my izunami can be rigged up to work until it arrives. Ver disappointing! I think the izunami irons are not very well made. If you research the reviews many people complain that this has happened to them too. Spending 100+ on a flat iron is steep, and NOT worth it if it can&#x27;t even last a year.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick and curly hair that would take me forever to straighten. This is by far the best straightener i have ever used! It has cut my time in half and my hair look amazing when I am done. Buy this straightener because I promise you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> I loved this iron, i do my hair very fast, it used to take an hour to do my hair with other irons and withthis one it only takes like 25 to 30 min. And my hair is very long and thick</li>
    <li> I bought this iron on sale for $85.00.  It&#x27;s the best flatiron I ever used!  I went through 4 different irons before this one and they didn&#x27;t quite work well, I have thick, curly hair.  This works in one pass, if you use 1&amp;#34; strip of hair and go slowly.  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> It definitely works great!</li>
    <li> Love the temp controls. My hair is fine and thin so I don&#x27;t want high heat. My daughter has wavy thick hair and she needs higher heat. The plates are smooth, doesn&#x27;t pull or break my hair. It looks straight, smooth and shiny! Glad I made this purchase!</li>
    <li> works good on the hair.</li>
    <li> Pretty good iron. Its small so hard to get a lot of my hair. Makes my hair frizzy and needs a lot of hair product.</li>
    <li> Is good ,the  heat up very fast like 5sec . The only think I&#x27;m wonder my hair get separate at the end ?</li>
    <li> So I bought this flat iron on Black Friday , it&#x27;s a good flat iron but I have a argan heat flat iron that&#x27;s half the price and works wayyyyy better but I can add it to my collection !</li>
    <li> all went will good product buy</li>
    <li> Admittedly I have no girl skills so it was a big purchase to by this flat iron but can I just say I lOVE IT!!  It works great I have course medium thick hair and have to use it several times to get the look I want but it is awesome.  The only drawback is it does not curl your ends so if your looking for a flat iron that bends the ends this is not the one you want.</li>
    <li> Flat iron came chipped near the plate. Box was torn. I&#x27;m thinking this is NOT an authentic Izutech. Returning and will buy something else. Highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used. My hair is so silky and smooth after using it. It&#x27;s expensive but well worth it. Very high quality flat iron.</li>
    <li> Absolutely FANTASTIC!</li>
    <li> Best straightener I have ever had.  I don&#x27;t have to go over it multiple times.  Buy it..You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I ,ove it, works amazingly well, feels very sturdy, good product, fast shipping. would definately recommend this product for somone looking for a great fairly inexpensive professional hair straightener</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t do product reviews but this product is amazing I have all of Izunami products this one added to the collection shipping was perfect it was here on time. Love the product 5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> This heats up very quick, is easy to hold and works wonderfully. I love this product. Highly recommend it to other consumers.</li>
    <li> After looking at a lot of reviews I decided to splurge on the Izunami to cut down on hair straightening time. For the month that it did work it did the job, but no better than the $40 straighteners you buy at TJ Maxx. I also noticed ceramic is better for frizzy hair like mine, which had a harder time sliding through these plates. I was actually somewhat relieved when it broke without reason after a month so I could get my money back, going back to the $40 ceramic straighteners from now on.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this long, so I&#x27;ll be sure to update in one month. I really think titanium is the way to go. This thing heats up so freaking fast. It does not snag on hair at all. I also found that a lower heat setting than I&#x27;m used to works on this, which is great because that means less damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have that cheap feeling when you hold it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to say that the instruction guide states that warranties are not given for unauthorized sellers, including amazon; so there actually isn&#x27;t a 1 year warranty. Something to take note of.</li>
    <li> Super! Heats up instantly! Glides through hair. Amazing. Autoshut off seems to take a long time if it exists. That&#x27;s the only thing that makes me nervous.</li>
    <li> It heats up in a minute and glides through your hair making this task feel effortless and only one thing else I can say about this flat iron is PERFECTION</li>
    <li> It makes my hair so soft and silky! I&#x27;m really glad I went with this flat iron!</li>
    <li> This is real QUALITY flat iron,&lt;br /&gt;warms up fast and it straightens real good,&lt;br /&gt;especially on THICK HAIR!! Titanium is really good!</li>
    <li> This is the flat iron my hair stylist uses, and I was so pleased with the results, I wanted to try it at home.  I love how quickly it heats up and that it has a cord that doesn&#x27;t twist. It smooths my hair better than any other flat iron I have purchased. Definitely worth the purchase price for me.</li>
    <li> Izunami Flat Iron is now Izutech. I received my first order and the Izutech stopped working after a few days. I received a replacement Izutech that quit working after 3 uses. Gogorgeous was very nice and offered to refund my money without question. My hair stylist has an Izunami flat iron and has not had trouble with it, so I was very disappointed with the newer Izutech model. I would not try this iron again.</li>
    <li> I love this product it was the first flat iron I was able to successfully press my hair with.</li>
    <li> It really good and leave hair really shiny ... I love it</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this heaven sent flat iron long, but this is the best flat iron I have ever had the pleasure to use. I am not a stylist but I definitely achieved the results of one! I assure you, you will not have buyer&#x27;s remorse if you decide to but this. My hair is so straight; I didn&#x27;t have to keep running it through my hair for it to fully straighten it. The flat iron plate&#x27;s glide through the hair, no snags, uneven heating, or burning, heats up extremely fast but doesn&#x27;t not singe your fingertips. This is the BEST FLAT Iron i have ever had. I had an ION iron from Sally&#x27;s then I was a die-hard CHI fan, after my CHI bit the dust I moved on to FHI now Izunami has stolen my heart! The best thing about this iron so far is everything!! I love the look, the feel, the results and I&#x27;m sure you will to. What are you waiting on, Click Buy it NOW!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best flat iron I have ever used.  It leaves my hair straight and silky.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice that you can control the level of heat and it heats up extremely fast.  Applies heat evenly to hair.  Recommended by my beautician and worth every penny.  Better than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!</li>
    <li> I like this iron, I also have the other iron it has a round plate that I like better because I can curl with it&lt;br /&gt;But this iron is good for straightening the hair it does get hot quick and you can get done quicker with the wide plate&lt;br /&gt;I just have to get use to using it and learn how to curl with it . This was my first time ordering this iron online the service Was good and my irons came within a few days I will order again and I was very pleased with the customer service</li>
    <li> My order of KTX 450 from amazon came on time but before the expected range. The product was as I imagined it to be, I reviewed many reviews from prior buyers and watched a few video clip from UTube on this product before finalizing my decision to make this purchase. I originally had my heart set on getting the Sedu Revolution for my daughter, but with all the positive reviews and reading up on the features the KTX 450 has, I decided to take a chance.  BTW, I was also contemplating on the Babyliss titanium (light blue one).  I feel I got a deal with the KTX 450 from Amazon, you can tell the difference in grade, class, category of it&#x27;s own.  Materials feel luxurious and features are salon grade.  I&#x27;d like to compare it to buying a Louis Vuitton handbag vs. something else.  It may not be for everyone, but there is a reason why it is what it is.  Hope my review helps another potential shopper who is looking for a flat iron, and I mean flat!!!</li>
    <li> Failed after less than a year of use.  Manufacturer doesn&#x27;t honor 1yr warranty.  Sick and tired of spending $100 for these things and they fail so frequently.  Might as well buy a cheap&#x27;o $20 unit and replace every 6 months!</li>
    <li> THIS IS FOOD DOOR THE BEST FLAT IRON EVER I HAVE COLORED TREATED HAIR AND EVERY IRON I&#x27;VE USED BEFORE JUST KEPT FRYING MY HAIR BUT THIS ONE DOES NOT IT LEAVES MY HAIR SILKY AND SMOOTH</li>
    <li> Wow this flat iron is amazing!!! My friend/hairstylist recommended it and this is definitely the best flat iron I have ever owned. It gets super hot but doesn&#x27;t fry my hair at all and one of the best things is the plates don&#x27;t snag my hair! I replaced my Chi with this one since it broke after 6 months. Totally worth the money hope it lasts I will update my review after a few months!</li>
    <li> Very good flat iron.  I like it better than the Chi I finally gave to my daughter after always having to get it from her room when I wanted to use it.  It heats up insanely fast and I can straighten my curly, frizzy mop with one pass over each strand.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Just received it and have used it about 8 times. My hair as a whole head is thin, but I have very thick individual course strands, if that makes any sense. My hair is very frizzy and I mean FRIIIZZZZY. this iron heats up in literally 8 seconds! my hair has never been any straighter nor has it stood up to weather like it has. I use leave in treatment in wet hair and when hair is dry and I straighten it the flat iron leaves it smooth, soft and activates the treatment. I recommend. ALSO!!!!!!!! if you got to the Izunami website and send in a picture of your old flat iron with the cord cut off, they send you a 50% OFF coupon for the iron.</li>
    <li> This is worth every penny! I used to have a chi and it seemed like it took me 30min to staighten my hair. Now just a few glides and I am done. Very nice, I love it!</li>
    <li> I have never heard of this brand before but bought it because it was highly reccommended by a friend of mine. I have very curly hair that is pretty wavy on top. I absolutely love this straightener! It makes my hair look like it was professionally done at a salon and it only takes me half the time compared to others I have tried! I have gotten tons of compliments on my hair. It feels super soft and healthy and doesn&#x27;t frizz up or anything in the rain or humidity! I have heard CHI&#x27;s are overrated and now I believe it. I will never use any other straightener!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron to replace my 6-7 year old Sedu Revolution. The Sedu was top-notch when I bought it, but it is time for replacement. I took days to research every flat iron I possibly could, including printed reviews and video reviews/demos. I came very close to buying the Remington Frizz Therapy, which gets great reviews and is quite a bit cheaper, but ultimately I decided to make the investment for a titanium tourmaline iron. I was pleased that this one has just slightly wider and longer plates than a standard 1\\&quot; iron. It makes a nice difference, without adding bulk or affecting maneuverability. The plates are incredibly smooth, like wow smooth. Because titanium distributes heat so well, even though this goes up to 425 I only need the temperature at 380 on my thick wavy hair, which is good because the 425-450 range really damages hair. At 380, this iron straightens my hair better than my Sedu did at 450, and with zero frizz . . . ZERO. The straightness holds so well, I can \\&quot;wake up &amp; go\\&quot; for 2-3 days before washing again, and even a ponytail doesn&#x27;t leave a noticeable dent if I&#x27;m in a hurry and can&#x27;t touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technical Details:&lt;br /&gt;* Swivel cord&lt;br /&gt;* Beeps once when you turn it on, beeps twice when it&#x27;s heated, so you can work on makeup or something without having to watch the light&lt;br /&gt;* Heats up fast, maybe a minute&lt;br /&gt;* Does not have auto shutoff, but I always completely unplug small electrics anyway.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. My hair looks really nice and I takes me 5 minutes to iron my hair. My hair stays straight for all day and looks skinny and healthy!.</li>
    <li> It is worth the money. Well made and so much better than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve had before. There are multiple settings for different kinds of hair and it heats up very quickly.</li>
    <li> I purchased several flat irons that were ok not great. This flat iron gets the job done. You look like you just left the salon. I love love love it.</li>
    <li> Great straightener best I&#x27;ve ever had. I have semi coarse wavy hair and this does my hair on no time without damaging it. Perfect for touch ups because you can control the heat.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for my daughter who has long curly blond hair.  She says this is the best flatiron she has ever used and actually sent me the link to it.  She wanted to make sure this was the one I ordered.</li>
    <li> best flat iron i have purchased in a while!!! I have natural curly hair and it worked awesome!! Must buy!</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I have ever used. I had a chi before getting this iron and the chi has nothing on this. This does not burn my hair it straightens in on go and evenly distributes heat on the plates. I use it regularly and it has not failed me. I have had this for about one year. I have very curly hair.</li>
    <li> i gave this iron 5 stars before, but actually this was for izunami not izutech .  i had doubt on izutech when i was writing the past review , but now i has no doubt that it&#x27;s the worst change that has been happened to any iron ever . izunami was excellent, but izutech is a garbage .   a friend of mine had waste her money on both izutech ktx and izutech itc and she told me that they are nothing but garbage , they never get any hot and she had izunami in the past which is totally different than this garbage .  i&#x27;ve no idea what&#x27;re these recent good reviews about .  may be it&#x27;s just there luck that their irons come not Defective , and may be they are just  liars .    i bought this iron for a friend a year ago, may be more than a year and she used it for her keratin clients , as she is a keratin professionalism , she loved it so much and she said it&#x27;s the best that she ever tried . (notice that this was the old version that called izunami not the newer one that called izutech that i&#x27;m a bit skeptical about) .  personally i try this for a once but i found it a little heavy , i wish it was more lighter and has more thin slim easy to handle shape .  i know that there is a newer version that is more slim, but i&#x27;m afraid of buying something that no one trusted has tried and there is no reviews at all on the slim version .  if it was for me i was giving it 4 stars for its heavy weight, but it was my friends&#x27; opinion and review that i should to write as it was for her .  one more thing i think this brand is not tending to make a false fake reviews , as i&#x27;m following this iron since it had a little reviews and it increased gradually through the time.  i forget to tell that i bought another one for my friend&#x27;s sister, and she used it for herself and for her young daughter (4 years old) who has a bad type hair and she told me that she noticed that this iron improved the girl&#x27;s hair , i got a little surprised, actually the most thing that we expect from a flat iron is not to damage our hair and of course we don&#x27;t expect any improvement in our hair at all, but she insisted that she can see a difference in the girl&#x27;s hair after she washed it .  one more thing, when i told here about its heavy weight she said not at all , she found its weight alright . i don&#x27;t know why i&#x27;m the only one that complains about its weight .</li>
    <li> I love love love this flat iron! Izunami is the Best!! I wish I would have had these years ago! I love all my izunami flat irons! My hair is sooooo straight!</li>
    <li> I love my new flat Iron.  I have very thick hair and this items does wonders.</li>
    <li> Review from my wife:   I finished my hair in less than 7 minutes, and with my last flat iron it took me 15 minutes.    PROS:  * It gets really hot.  * Made my hair look silky.  * Feels good when you hold it. Good grip.  * Cord is great.  * Quick plate heat-up time.    CONS:  * Does not have an auto-shut off.  * The outside of the flat iron gets very hot around the plates (but fine where you normally grip). Just don&#x27;t grip the outside near the hot plates.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife.  According to her, it is far superior than the many others she used including the high-end ceramic one that she just got rid of.  The metal plates heat and cool quickly (much faster than her last ceramic iron) and her fairly course hair takes minutes vs. the 10-20 minutes with the old one.  Where before she would have to iron one section of her hair multiple times to make it straight, now she only has to go over it once and it&#x27;s flat.  The cord is heavy duty and long by comparison.  Izunami has a deal that when the iron is at the end of its lifecycle they will send you a coupon/discount for another provided you take a picture of the old one with the cord cut,</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! It heats up fast and leaves my hair shiny. This is my first time using this brand, it was recommended by my hairstylist.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, better than any other I have used before.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I have ever had.  If you have thick curly hair you will not get a better flat iron than this one.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great! It&#x27;s a very good price doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up and it&#x27; works great</li>
    <li> The plates are a tad wide, making it difficult to create curls or waves, and the height of the plates create a bit of an indent in the hair as you straighten at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;Also you can&#x27;t hold too close to the plates, as the outer casing gets rather hot, as apposed to the GHD for example where you could grip the entire appliance without burning the fingers. It straightens well, and glides smooth as titanium should.&lt;br /&gt;It takes longer than a GHD to heat up. It does not have an auto switch off.</li>
    <li> I am mixed with black/white and this is the BEST straightener I have purchased so far. I have never had a straightener that has gotten my hair  so straight and thin - and may i add this is the first time my hair has ever had movement.  I have one of the biggest, thickest, kinkiest afros you have ever seen. It normally takes 2 hours to straighten my hair to an ok level... With this flat iron, straightening time is cut by almost half and the way it straightens my hair is salon level. So far this is the best flat iron purchase i have ever made. Don&#x27;t use heavy grease though, try Design essentials oil. It&#x27;s a little pricy for a 5 oz bottle, but you only need a little drop so it last a long time!</li>
    <li> very fast very honest product specification best than ceramic izunami i love it recommend it to all stylist very high quality and smart design fantastic best flat iron in the world .</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.  The plates are the smoothest I have ever used.  The heat control is perfect for me as well.</li>
    <li> It is the best I have used as far as a flat iron.  I am a professional stylist&lt;br /&gt;and nothing comes close to the smoothing and striating of the hair.  I also&lt;br /&gt;love the fact there is no waiting period for it to get hot!  The temp is controlled&lt;br /&gt;so very nice!</li>
    <li> One pass over the hair and it&#x27;s so smooth. What a time saver. It&#x27;s also a lot nicer in person than the pictures make it look.</li>
