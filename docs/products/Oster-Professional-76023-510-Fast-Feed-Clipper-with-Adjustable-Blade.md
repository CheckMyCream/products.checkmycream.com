      <li>Would have loved it more if a case came with it??  </li>
      <li>All around nice unit, I hope to get many years of service from this cutter.</li>

      <li>I bought these as an upgrade to the cheap set that I had been using and absolutely love them!  </li>

      <li>and it get a better review</li>
      <li>I have had a much better experience with this trimmer.</li>
      <li>Love the adjustment on the front of the clippers also.</li>
      <li>I saw some very good reviews on this unit, and after deciding that cordless wasn&#x27;t a big requirement for me I picked it up.</li>
      <li>Like I read another reviewer mention, this is light years better than Wahl.</li>
      <li>I believe you could easily shear a Wooly Mammoth with these clippers...........</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did the clippers are great, and very quiet compared to my Andis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I went to my barber for the &amp;#34;Big Shave,&amp;#34; going from a relatively full head of hair to a much more aerodynamic look.  </li>
      <li>I do like the steel look/feel better than the cheap plastic models, and the weight is more substantial in a good, solid way.  </li>
      <li>High quality, professional grade clipper - excellent for full beards/facial hair.  </li>
      <li>Runs smoothly and efficiency.  </li>
      <li>These clippers are simply fantastic and worth the money!  </li>
      <li>I turned it on and it was significantly quieter than the Wahl.  </li>
      <li>The clipper isn very loud which is nice.  </li>
      <li>we&#x27;ll see if that&#x27;s still true in a year or two.  </li>
      <li>This is just what I wanted for my husband without purchasing a complete kit of some kind.  </li>
      <li>Marginally better than my cheap old Wahl.</li>
      <li>I also have to say it seems to cut really well, cleaner/sharper than the cheap ones -</li>
      <li>My first cut went great, and I got down as close as my barber.  </li>
      <li>Another issue is it gets warm very quick making it harder to cut well as you are trying to hurry to finish before it gets too hot.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned many of this model and needed a new one finally, snappy new limited edition is great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be tempted to give this product 3.5 stars if I could because I&#x27;m happy with the look, feel, and cut, but I&#x27;m not quite convinced they&#x27;re worth the extra $, and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend them if you&#x27;re looking for a quiet clipper.  </li>
      <li>Simple quick and easy.</li>
      <li>The machine does not cut as well as I was hoping, especially for being the top known brand for Hair Clippers.</li>
      <li>First one I have ever bought</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>but something to consider if you&#x27;re the first one up in the morning.</li>
      <li>I will put up with this since it allows for easy adjustment and replacement of the blades if necessary.  </li>
      <li>He really hasn&#x27;t had the chance to confirm the efficiency though as this is Christmas stocking stuffer.</li>
      <li>They are smooth, quiet, and produce a high-quality cut.</li>
      <li>If the description mentioned this, I missed it and ordered a $20 set of assorted sizes that I probably don&#x27;t really need.  </li>
      <li>This product functions and works very well.</li>
      <li>IT DOES NOT CUT VERY WELL.  </li>
      <li>bought a bunch of cheap ones ranging from $20-$30 over the last 10 years.  </li>
      <li>The other Oster machines you are able to change out the sizes, but this one does not have that option.</li>
      <li>So far this clipper has done a great job with wet or dry hair.  </li>
      <li>The clipper cuts very evenly and fast, akin to a professional product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t gotten caught on hair, it&#x27;s pretty quiet, and it just feels very well built.</li>
      <li>definitely worth the extra loot.  </li>
      <li>I ordered these and was actually a little excited to do my first self cut.  </li>
      <li>This clipper works, but I have to be careful about not applying too much pressure on the right side when using the clipper, or else it will cut my skin since the guard is broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As you can see from the picture I uploaded, clearly there is hair  between the guard and the blades.</li>
      <li>The cutter head is very consistant, you only have to make one or two sweeps and the hair is all evenly cut,</li>
      <li>replaced my really old Wahl.</li>
      <li>Considering the whole thing is metal, they should just make that metal too, it wouldn&#x27;t cost that much extra.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re going to want to buy an oster classic 76 size 1 blade, which is slightly larger than the stock blade, and place it on this guy.</li>
      <li>The body of this clipper is solid &amp; the finish is very durable — not to mention the cord being beefy &amp; long enough to be useable.</li>
      <li>Cuts easily through thick hair.</li>
      <li>Far superior cutting power to the rechargeable models that I&#x27;ve tried for years.</li>
      <li>Other reviewers said there were numerous length settings with all the accessory pieces, and they are right.</li>
      <li>Then I realized that look needs much more regular maintenance, and I would be stupid to spend $15-25 every 4-5 days for something I should be able to do myself.  </li>
      <li>Not a good fit.</li>
      <li>While the clipper is metal, heavy, and well made, the little plastic depth changer for the blades is cheap and can break if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>

<li> My busy life only just allowed me to sit down and write a review...</li>
<li> The $10 up charge for the Limited Edition silver color is not worth the money as it appears to be silver paint not metalic so the up charge is more a rip-off than not.</li>
<li> I chose this model specifically because of the (alleged) Whisper Quiet motor feature.  </li>
<li> look as the shortest guard is about as long as I would</li>
<li> Also note, the right side of the guard is broken and the blade has no protection.&lt;br</li>
<li> Quiet and sharp.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also a bit noisier that I would have expected which isn&#x27;t a deal break</li>
<li> This product does not work as well as I expected.</li>
<li> Wasn&#x27;t Zero Gapped, was a little hard to Zero Gap them but finally got it on the second try.</li>
<li> The trimmer would get hot and my dog was uncomfortable.</li>
<li> just average.</li>
<li> My only complaint is regarding the two screws that hold the blade in place,  they have to be tightened often</li>
<li> Very sharp blades and well balanced.</li>
<li> /&gt;I am sure this was a 1 in 5,000 chance that this used product would be shipped to a customer, so I am not too upset, but still, seeing someone else&#x27;s hair on what is supposed to be my brand new beard trimmer was disgusting to say the least.</li>
<li> The motor is already dying and overheats in less than 20 mins.</li>
<li> But even with doing the adjustment trick its not as tight a shave.</li>
<li> This is not a killer, but it is a little dissapointing.  </li>
<li> A little pricey</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My busy life only just allowed me to sit down and write a review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product back in January 2015, specifically for trimming my beard. Other reviewers said there were numerous length settings with all the accessory pieces, and they are right. You will be able to trim your beard to the desired length no problem. These clippers and powerful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the reason I only gave 2 stars is because this product came to me used... As you can see from the picture I uploaded, clearly there is hair  between the guard and the blades. Also note, the right side of the guard is broken and the blade has no protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didnt have time to return this product due to me busy life, so I just said &amp;#34;oh well&amp;#34; and cleaned it. This clipper works, but I have to be careful about not applying too much pressure on the right side when using the clipper, or else it will cut my skin since the guard is broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure this was a 1 in 5,000 chance that this used product would be shipped to a customer, so I am not too upset, but still, seeing someone else&#x27;s hair on what is supposed to be my brand new beard trimmer was disgusting to say the least.</li>
    <li> After 20+ years of buying budget models, I decided to splurge on a more expensive clipper.  I chose this model specifically because of the (alleged) Whisper Quiet motor feature.  Be warned, whisper quiet it is not! It&#x27;s actually louder than my crazy-noisy $20 Wahl clipper.  I do like the steel look/feel better than the cheap plastic models, and the weight is more substantial in a good, solid way.  I also have to say it seems to cut really well, cleaner/sharper than the cheap ones - we&#x27;ll see if that&#x27;s still true in a year or two.  I&#x27;d be tempted to give this product 3.5 stars if I could because I&#x27;m happy with the look, feel, and cut, but I&#x27;m not quite convinced they&#x27;re worth the extra $, and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend them if you&#x27;re looking for a quiet clipper.  (Also note, this model comes with four attachments: a blender, 1/4&amp;#34;, 3/8&amp;#34;, and 1/2&amp;#34;.  If the description mentioned this, I missed it and ordered a $20 set of assorted sizes that I probably don&#x27;t really need.  If you know the longest you need is 1/2&amp;#34; then don&#x27;t bother with additional attachments.)</li>
    <li> I have gone through several cheaper beard trimmers, and those experiences finally resulted in facing a reality most of us already know: you get what you pay for. I saw some very good reviews on this unit, and after deciding that cordless wasn&#x27;t a big requirement for me I picked it up. I have had a much better experience with this trimmer. It hasn&#x27;t gotten caught on hair, it&#x27;s pretty quiet, and it just feels very well built.</li>
    <li> Packaging was great, item arrived very fast and was undamaged and had great cushioning. This product does not work as well as I expected. The other Oster machines you are able to change out the sizes, but this one does not have that option. I like the 00000 and this machine only goes to a 000. Although I knew the machine did not come with this size option, I was under the impression I could just order it separately and use it with this machine. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The machine does not cut as well as I was hoping, especially for being the top known brand for Hair Clippers. Another issue is it gets warm very quick making it harder to cut well as you are trying to hurry to finish before it gets too hot.</li>
    <li> Work well just not really for thick hair!alson didn&#x27;t care for the guards.. Sizes only have 4 and they r inconsistent with blending..</li>
    <li> Cuts well. Quiet without the tools.</li>
    <li> This product functions and works very well.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers. First one I have ever bought so I did my research and went with this one. Very happy with it. Cuts easily through thick hair. Very sharp blades and well balanced. Love the adjustment on the front of the clippers also. I&#x27;m cutting my own hair and some of my friends as well. I believe you could easily shear a Wooly Mammoth with these clippers...........but I wouldn&#x27;t try it. Works great on humanoids though and what more can you ask for? Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The best for my purposes. I&#x27;ve owned many of this model and needed a new one finally, snappy new limited edition is great!</li>
    <li> I have had two Wahl trimmers from WalMart. Each one trimmed great for awhile, and then they just wouldn&#x27;t cut. The trimmer would get hot and my dog was uncomfortable. The Oster runs quiet and cooler than the Wahls and I don&#x27;t have problems trimming my schnauzer. I love it.</li>
    <li> My 1/2 inch attachment keeps falling off. Not a good fit. What a disappointment. I will be returning this item and looking for another.</li>
    <li> This product was horrible, broke first week, only used it 2 times, very disappointed</li>
    <li> if you want to cut hair short, this will disappoint out of the box. you&#x27;re going to want to buy an oster classic 76 size 1 blade, which is slightly larger than the stock blade, and place it on this guy. this will give it a perfect zero gap. here&#x27;s a video i followed to find this out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;i-H0EKYi5Z0</li>
    <li> These clippers are simply fantastic and worth the money!  The quality is on point! They glide through hair cuts effortlessly.</li>
    <li> Not any damn atachments for the thing out some attachments with it and it get a better review</li>
    <li> I have been cutting our son&#x27;s hair since he was about 4 months old.  I bought these as an upgrade to the cheap set that I had been using and absolutely love them!  They are smooth, quiet, and produce a high-quality cut.</li>
    <li> This is just what I wanted for my husband without purchasing a complete kit of some kind.  He really hasn&#x27;t had the chance to confirm the efficiency though as this is Christmas stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> IT DOES NOT CUT VERY WELL.  SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT CUT AT ALL.  ITS A SHAME THESE CUTTERS ARE NOT MADE BETTER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOULD NOT RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> High quality, professional grade clipper - excellent for full beards/facial hair.  I would not recommend this for those with very short facial hair or those trying to maintain a &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; look as the shortest guard is about as long as I would go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a bit noisier that I would have expected which isn&#x27;t a deal break but something to consider if you&#x27;re the first one up in the morning.</li>
    <li> Great clippers. Wasn&#x27;t Zero Gapped, was a little hard to Zero Gap them but finally got it on the second try.Cuts great. They aren&#x27;t as quiet as I thought they were going to be but are decently quiet. Shipped on time.</li>
    <li> excellent, nice smooth cut, and very quiet. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> While the clipper is metal, heavy, and well made, the little plastic depth changer for the blades is cheap and can break if you&#x27;re not careful. Considering the whole thing is metal, they should just make that metal too, it wouldn&#x27;t cost that much extra.</li>
    <li> This is a very solid unit.  So far this clipper has done a great job with wet or dry hair.  The clipper isn very loud which is nice.  The cutter head is very consistant, you only have to make one or two sweeps and the hair is all evenly cut, no patchwork left behind like with cheaper cutters.  My only complaint is regarding the two screws that hold the blade in place,  they have to be tightened often or else you get a rattle in the cutter head (which takes seconds to fix) but they don&#x27;t seem to hold their tightness.  I will put up with this since it allows for easy adjustment and replacement of the blades if necessary.  All around nice unit, I hope to get many years of service from this cutter.</li>
    <li> Quiet and sharp.  Would have loved it more if a case came with it??  A very good a nice looking hair clipper.</li>
    <li> Far superior cutting power to the rechargeable models that I&#x27;ve tried for years. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> just average. will be going to the Andis phat master next. I may be biased... i always have had Andis</li>
    <li> 09/2014 Update: Has gone to s***, the blade didn&#x27;t last longer than 5 haircuts. The motor is already dying and overheats in less than 20 mins. You pay s*** you get s***.</li>
    <li> replaced my really old Wahl. Its smoother. But even with doing the adjustment trick its not as tight a shave. Don&#x27;t see all the hype. Marginally better than my cheap old Wahl.</li>
    <li> It does cut as advertised..  It cuts close to the scalp and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair or scrape the scalp.</li>
    <li> Like I read another reviewer mention, this is light years better than Wahl. Well built product, good clean haircuts. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely perfect. It cuts hair even even if you don&#x27;t have alot of experience. Now my friends are coming to me for hair cuts</li>
    <li> Runs smoothly and efficiency.  I use it to shave my beard.  It does so in a non-irritating way.  Quiet too.</li>
    <li> So I recently decided to go the shaved head route, and after looking at numerous reviews, I decided on these clippers.  I went to my barber for the &amp;#34;Big Shave,&amp;#34; going from a relatively full head of hair to a much more aerodynamic look.  Then I realized that look needs much more regular maintenance, and I would be stupid to spend $15-25 every 4-5 days for something I should be able to do myself.  I ordered these and was actually a little excited to do my first self cut.  As it was taking longer to get them than it should have (UPS&#x27; fault, not Amazon&#x27;s), I borrowed a friends Wahl clippers.  My first cut went great, and I got down as close as my barber.  Finally, my Oster came.  I was immediately pleased with the lighter weight and better feel in the hand as compared to the Wahl.  I turned it on and it was significantly quieter than the Wahl.  Unfortunately, it does not cut quite as close as the Wahl.  It is a 000-1 blade, I had it all the way to 000, and it just will not get quite as close as by barber or the Wahl.  This is not a killer, but it is a little dissapointing.  I will be taking it to my barber to se if he knows any trick or adjustment that might help.  It will do as it is, but it&#x27;s not just quite what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> These are simply the best set of clippers I&#x27;ve owned and will surely be buying them again when the time comes.</li>
    <li> The body of this clipper is solid &amp; the finish is very durable — not to mention the cord being beefy &amp; long enough to be useable. Bear in mind that regardless of what is posted in the Amazon listing, this set ships with only ONE blade. There are a few guides with the clipper, blade lube, and a brush, but DO NOT EXPECT TWO BLADES! That said, you might as well forego the guards that are shipped with this set and get the Andis Magnetic blade guards — they fit &amp; function perfectly on the Fast Feed.</li>
    <li> I have been using Andis clippers for sometime and thought I would gives the Oster a try based off various reviews.  I&#x27;m glad I did the clippers are great, and very quiet compared to my Andis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this others who thought Andis was the only way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andre</li>
    <li> Used it same day as received..and what a relief. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. The combs are useless for my balding head,just went with the side lever short over the ears and longer for the rest. Simple quick and easy. The instructions are poor as the fact of no case. Well the world isn&#x27;t perfect. :-)</li>
    <li> The clipper cuts very evenly and fast, akin to a professional product. The $10 up charge for the Limited Edition silver color is not worth the money as it appears to be silver paint not metalic so the up charge is more a rip-off than not.</li>
    <li> bought a bunch of cheap ones ranging from $20-$30 over the last 10 years.  definitely worth the extra loot.  cuts like sharpened knives through chicken mcnuggets.</li>
    <li> So happy I bought these! A little pricey but I cut my own hair and they have paid for themselves over and over! Best I have owned!</li>
