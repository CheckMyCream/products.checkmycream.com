<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is THE BEST product for cuticles! I placed the order as I was unable to find it locally any longer. Was SOOO Suprised by size..Didn&#x27;t think to compare ounces of tub purchased at drug store to ounces as offered and this is 4 times larger than my 1 ounce FOR THE SAME PRICE!!!</li>
    <li> It starts out as a thick white cream and after application, quickly becomes clear, thin, and sticky. The scent is rather medicinal, but that&#x27;s OK since the product works! My nails were thin, brittle, and peeling. After about a week, my nails became strong and healthy. I still apply this cream once or twice a week just for maintenance...A little goes a long way with this product and I&#x27;m pretty sure the 4 fl. oz. will last me years...</li>
    <li> Been using this for years.... Nothing else quite like it. Works quickly, great when you actually use your hands for gardening, cooking, fiber work, crafts, etc:)</li>
    <li> This is a very thick cream that smells of the Noxema my grandfather used long ago. Although, the medicated smell is less than desirable the results are so worth it. As a person who has always been self-conscious of their \\&quot;old\\&quot; looking hands (even to the point I cringed at showing off my gorgeous new engagement ring) &amp; already having dry skin made even worse by a lot of hand washing, I am finally \\&quot;okay\\&quot; with my hands. Healthy Hoof helps. I&#x27;ve tried my share of lotions &amp; potions, some helped better than others. Some were actually pretty good, but required lots of applications due to all the hand washing. With this stuff a little dab will do ya. Considering how thick this stuff is I thought it was going to be greasy &amp; just sit on top of my skin, but to my surprise it absorbs well &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave greasy prints. I have only been using this for a few days &amp; I can already see a difference. For the first time I don&#x27;t see ugly old dry hands. Healthy Hoof has made my dry &amp; rough cuticles much softer &amp; I could be imaging this part, but I think it is helping my nails. At the very least they look better, as to whether they will grow or get stronger that remains to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thankful for finding this stuff. I love the fact that I can put a little on in the morning &amp; not have to reapply after every/other hand washing to still feel &amp; look like I have healthy moist hands. Because I do wash my hands so frequently I do a midday reapplication of a drop of a wonderful smelling lotion, but doesn&#x27;t moisturize at all &amp; a tad of Healthy Hoof &amp; then again before bed. Oh, did I mention what this stuff does for dry cracked heels? Just hoof on down to your local drug store &amp; get yourself some. You won&#x27;t be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healthy Hoof, if you are listening, please see if anything can be done with the scent without sacrificing the awesome quality of your product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh! Just a warning, don&#x27;t put too much on, otherwise it will feel tacky and will last until you scrub it off or a few ordinary hand washes. Sometimes that, \\&quot;if a little is good, more is better\\&quot; attitude doesn&#x27;t pan out.ff or a few ordinary hand washes. Sometimes that, \\&quot;if a little is good, more is better\\&quot; attitude doesn&#x27;t pan out.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and is non iritating.</li>
    <li> Just get careless for 3 or 4 days and not use it, results in the beginning of brittle, cracking nails again.  This solved my weak nails problem but I&#x27;m not cured.  I still am stuck with nail problems if I don&#x27;t use this regularly.  Once a day is all I need to combat my problem.  If you want to alleviate your nail problems, give this stuff a try.  It&#x27;s really good.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have very dry skin on our hands and feet, and this cream has been by far the best one we have ever tried.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks now. My nails look healthier and have grown faster than they normally do. They only feel slightly stronger but I will have to use it longer to make a better judgement. As other reviewers suggested, I tried it on my hands as well and it is amazing. I apply it at night because its quite greasy when using it over large areas. I specifically use it on my knuckles and it has helped a lot with my dry skin. I also used it on a severe dry spot on my arm and it was clear within just a few days. This stuff has many purposes and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I have been using for years. It is especially good for cuticles and softening skin in general.</li>
    <li> I have very dry nails and cuticles.  This is the only cream I&#x27;ve found that really works.  I used to buy it at CVS, but now can&#x27;t find it in any stores.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My nails used to split, my cuticles were always ragged and no lotion could solve my dry hands. Healthy Hoof worked a miracle for me. Every night I massage it into my nails AND hands. It&#x27;s so amazing, I gave it to friends to try. It doesn&#x27;t leave grease marks on my sheets either. The smell is strong--kind of like weedy flowers. But after you see what it does for you, the smell becomes pleasant.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! It does make your nails harder. I put it on three times a day. It is not immediate  Nails grow slowly but if you just keep using it you will be happy!</li>
    <li> Fantastic on heels and hands!  It softens almost overnight.  Well worth the purchase.  I plan to order more to keep this in my home.</li>
    <li> Made my nails weaker.</li>
    <li> Great gift for the office.  Everyone commented on how much they liked the product...Very happy and loved it. Will order it again....</li>
    <li> I love this healthy hoof ointment.  It&#x27;s a healing for little cuts and scratches on my hands.. It softens the cuticles&lt;br /&gt;Of my nails and my hands too. I love it not only as a hand cream but also  a healer.</li>
    <li> This does a good job on my rough heels--very good price .Diva nails charges a lot more.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of the cream the cuticles disappear and the nails become stronger.&lt;br /&gt;It is inexpensive experiment but worthwhile!</li>
    <li> I first purchased this at a mall. The only problem I&#x27;ve ever had with it is finding it in stores. This works miracles on abused hands. They feel soft and smooth after using one time. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It takes 20-30 mins to absorb, but my hands felt better than after a manicure.</li>
    <li> Good for use by men - does NOT leave a gloss !</li>
    <li> MAGIC for hand and cuticle care!</li>
    <li> This is the best cream for nails, cuticles &amp; feet.  I use to buy it all the time.  I got where I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore.  I&#x27;m so excited I found it again!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. The best product I know of for dry hands, feet and cuticles. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> After spending hundreds on nail product to help my thin, weak, &amp; peeling nails. This! It just worked for me.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found that keeps my cuticles soft!</li>
    <li> I use this nightly and I believe it&#x27;s the reason for my great cuticles. If I am traveling and don&#x27;t bring it, I always have peeling.</li>
    <li> After months of using this I haven&#x27;t seen a change in my nails or cuticles, both of which get very dry and split if I don&#x27;t wear gloves whenever my hands are in water. I use it 2-3 times a day. So no miracle cure for me, although I don&#x27;t doubt others&#x27; claims. People often have different results. When I do outside work with shovels, brooms, anything that rubs against the skin on my thumbs, I get beginning splits or punctures on them.  If I rub a little of this into the palm of my hand with my thumb and again before bedtime, it heals them fast without resorting to bandaids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this is gone I&#x27;ll still buy it again;  it&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer even if it didn&#x27;t solve my nail problem (which is probably unsolvable).  I always have to use some kind of separate emollient on them and I think this is the best one I&#x27;ve found. It has a nice fragrance also.</li>
    <li> Nice and thick, only need to use a little to moisturize. I like the herbal scent. I try to use it in the morning and night and it makes my hands super soft. I think it&#x27;s helping my nails, but I also started vitamins at the same time :)</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t seen a lot of improvement in nails.</li>
    <li> So far so good....  The product was recommended by a friend and she couldn&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
    <li> The product is an excellent price and my nails are much healthier.  I put it on my nails every night, and they are much healthier and stronger.</li>
    <li> The Gena Health Hoof Intensive Protein Treatment is perfect for my dry cuticles and for my pedicures.  Absolutely top rate.</li>
    <li> Pleased so far....it may take awhile for me to fully realize the results of my splitting fingernails.  It has made the cuticles and surrounding skin so much softer and less likely to have a hangnail.</li>
    <li> I like this product and I will recommend it to others.  It does help your cuticles to stay soft and no hang nails while using this product as recommended.  Yes I will buy it again.  Also it will make your real nails grow.</li>
    <li> Everyone should try this.  It is wonderful!  DO NOT SUBMIT THIS PUBLICLY!</li>
    <li> My nails were so bad, pealing, breaking and actually the tips of my fingers actually were hurting.  This moisurized my nails and they are growing stronger.  I used some vitamin-type things too.</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for this product after reading all the reviews, but after using it faithfully for 3 1/2 weeks, my nails are not much better than before. I used it twice a day for most days, and some days used it many times. I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all; I love the creamy consistency, but my nails are still peeling and breaking, and my cuticles are not improved either. So disappointed. I realize that what works for one won&#x27;t necessarily work for another, and this did not work for me.</li>
    <li> This product is helping with my dry hands and brittle nails.  I would recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I wanted naturally long, strong nails! Without the poisonous chemicals of nail salons. After reading multiple reviews I bought a bunch of natural nail care products: Czech glass nail file (helps your nails grow healthy), buffing cream and a buffer, and 2 strengthening cremes. This one is wonderful. In combination with the other products my nails are growing! I&#x27;ve never seen the whites of my nail tips get this long naturally before. I think this is my favorite creme because it is made for horses hooves, so I believe that it must be a truly strong product!</li>
    <li> I ordered this online because I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores locally. It&#x27;s not at all like the last jar I had.  Not as thick but more liquidy which is not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be the first to tell you that it does not cure all of your nail problems right away...but it does help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly weak nails and I have horrible cuticles- they are always cracking, splitting, and bleeding on me (even on a day to day basis, without working with them excessively). I use Healthy Hoof every night, and it really helps. If I skip a night I notice the difference the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for nearly 5 years, and it is still the best lotion I can find. I&#x27;ve tried a variety of lotions from homemade to repairing and everywhere in between, and I always come back to Healthy Hoof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros outweigh the cons, but these are the drawbacks I can think of:&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find this in stores, so I have to order online and plan ahead.&lt;br /&gt;Only use this lotion at night. It can be kind of greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t soak in quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Some people might think the smell is a little off, but it&#x27;s not very strong.</li>
    <li> This product may have been formulated for horses, but it is the best product I have found to strengthen nail and also aids in nail growth. Easy to use and the aroma is pleasant.</li>
    <li> This cream seems to work for everyone but me:(&lt;br /&gt;I have used it as suggested on my nails and the dry areas of my feet and have not had any luck.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad it works for so many folks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before, but had trouble finding it at my regular stores. Great product for cuticles and dry feet. Very similar to the Revlon cuticle cream which I used before finding this product.</li>
    <li> The only skin product you will ever need if you have bad skin.</li>
    <li> This jar of protein is the best thing I have used for my cuticles.  I was having problems with them cracking and being very dry. This Health Hoofs has put the moisture back. and it is great for softening your feet.  If you have problems with dry cracked heels it will do wonders. I have recommended it to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> For the first time my nails are beginning to heal and strengthen after only a few weeks of use. I heartily recommend this product for splitting or breaking nails.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It makes my nails feel great. I use it at night and apply a thick layer and let it sink in overnight.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very effective for my cuticles and nails. I use it at bedtime, just a small amount. I keep my nails natural, and this is a standby for conditioning. It also has a very mild fragrance that reminds me of beeswax.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this product for years with great results. One jar-full lasts a long time of daily use and it saved her nails too.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years to mitigate winter&#x27;s drying effects on my hands and feet.  It also contributes to the health of my nails.</li>
    <li> When I ordered Gena Healthy Hoof Intensive Protein Treatment, I wondered if it would really work. My nails used to be weak. They chipped easily and often looked unsightly, especially in winter. I have been using this product for several months.  Now my nails are as strong as they were when I was young. My cuticles used to crack and bleed from the dry indoor air. Not any more. Nothing I have used before every solved that problem. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some time and find it to be extremely helpful in controlling callouses on my feet.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for gosh, at least 15 years.  It&#x27;s my only hand cream that I use.  Yes I said hand cream - while it&#x27;s great for dry cuticles and nail health, I smear this stuff all over my hands!  Works great for rough dry feet too.  I just have not been able to find anything else that is not too greasy or not too drying.  And believe you me, I&#x27;ve tried!  The smell is love it or hate it - slightly medicinal with rosemary and lavender notes (did I just say notes? good lord). The Hoof used to be widely available in drug stores and beauty supply stores, but alas, no one seems to carry it anymore.  Thank goodness for the internets!  And yes, I am a real live hand model.  :)</li>
    <li> My nails were in extremely bad shape.  I had paper thin nails, tearing nails, nails that never, ever got past the nail bed, spoons, dents, and lines.   I use it at least 2 Xs a day and I&#x27;m giving it a low rating because it took four months to get 1/16&amp;#34; of a nail.  I thought the nail would continue to grow but instead, my nails (1/6&amp;#34;) is tearing off again, developing the same spoons and dents, and the nail is not strong but still thin and weak.  They are shiny, thus the one star.</li>
    <li> This product works very well for a time and my nails look great.  Then, even though I continue to use it faithfully, my nail start to crack, chip and peel again.  As keep using it my nails start looking better....just a cycle.</li>
    <li> As a fingerstyle guitarist I have been suffering with nail problems for years.  I wish I had found Healthy Hoof a long time ago.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t had a shattered or split nail since about the second week.  I play almost every day. I don&#x27;t know if it will damage a guitars finish as I am very careful not to get it on them.  I don&#x27;t want to be the one who finds out it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much.  I think this single jar will probably last more than a year if I continue using it twice a day.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had fragile, weak, splitting nails all my life.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products, trying to make my nails stronger.  Most all of those involved painting on some polish that had chemicals in them.  The nail strengthening polishes made them stronger while they were on my nails, but when I had to remove the polish to redo them, the polish remover just wrecked my nails and dried them out and my cuticles too.  I like to work in my garden and can&#x27;t keep a manicure for more than a few days, digging and planting and pruning...  With this product, applied in the morning and before bed, my nails are strong, flexible and look better than they ever have.  I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> The only thing to say about this product is IT ABSOLUTELY WORKS! I have terrible nails but not anymore. I will continue purchasing this product for ever and ever!</li>
    <li> I have peeling nails that break easily.  I put this on my nails a few times a day and notice an immediate improvement. When it &amp;#34;wears off&#x27; I still have the peeling problems, but I see that going away slowly. This is a good immediate, temporary fix. I hate looking at the peeling, and my nails tend to snag if I don&#x27;t put this on, but this cream solves that problem so long as I put it on 2-3 times per day.  I have been using this for about 3 weeks and will update this review when I&#x27;ve been using it longer.</li>
    <li> My nails were so badly damaged, but since I have started using this cream they have improved so much. Thanks!</li>
    <li> love, nails have never looked so good.</li>
    <li> I can see a difference in my nails just after a  few days! I&#x27;m hooked for life.</li>
    <li> Strengthens nails like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> This is GREAT for feet, too!  Gena Healthy Hoof Intensive Protein Treatment has saved my feet from painful cracked heels and calluses.  I always make sure I have an extra jar on hand.  I never want to be without.  USE IT EVERYDAY.</li>
    <li> I purchased two bottles of this cream because of the reviews.  Man, oh man...I wish I hadn&#x27;t.  I cannot even use it.  I wound up giving it away.  It is far too sticky to be able to use it and perform any tasks at all.  The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but, it isn&#x27;t really great.  The major issue is with the consistency and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t soak into the skin at all.  I actually put it on at night and put on gloves so that it was on over night.  It did nothing for my nails (AT ALL!) and hardly soaked in then, either!  This product is not what it claims to be.</li>
    <li> best hand and foot cream out there!</li>
    <li> I note that this product is generally used as a personal grooming aid, but I use it to keep my boots, holsters and saddles supple.  It is not greasy and once it has been worked in it does not come off on clothes.</li>
    <li> Been using this cream for my cuticles and nails for years., great for dry or cracked cuticles.</li>
    <li> works well when weather causes hands to chap and nails to become brittle</li>
    <li> I use this stuff on my nails every night. It helps strengthen them and keep them healthy--especially in the winter. I love it!!</li>
    <li> A friend gave me some of this,  and I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  I have some dishydrotic skin on my feet and my heels are prone to cracking. Nothing has been able to  adequately manage it though i&#x27;ve tried many products over the years.  A loofah scrub, and then this applied each night,  is amazing.  The problem is essentially cured.  The treatment appears to fortify skin, as well as create a barrier of softness.  Not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> This product smells wonderful and really works. My nails are stronger than ever after using this for only a few days. Very good price for the great benefits!</li>
    <li> This is great stuff for hands and nails. It works better than creams costing twice as much and was suggested by my nail stylist</li>
    <li> I moved to ABQ, NM last winter.  My nails, hands and cuticles really took a beating from the cold, dry, and harsh winter air.  I bought this treatment and loved the results.  This is a great product for healthy nails.  And the price is nice!!</li>
    <li> Helps drying and aging nails stay healthy.</li>
    <li> A good cream but I haven&#x27;t seen exceptional results yet</li>
    <li> Surprisingly effective on hands with calluses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of days and already notice a difference. By the time you get to the bottom of the jar all the chemicals in it will def. have killed you (half-joking) but my nails have never looked or felt better. Clear, white tips, and loooong. I also use Nailtiques Protein Plus Formula 2 and I when I file them regularly I have Lana nails. Highly rec.</li>
    <li> This stuff really heals your cuticles and nails. I put it on at night - every night!</li>
    <li> I HAVE WEAK NAILS AND MY JOB IS HARD ON THEM.I CHOSE THIS CREAM CAUSE IT SAID IT WOULD MAKE THEM STRONGER.WELL I DID NOT FIND THAT TO BE TRUE BUT WHAT I DID FIND WAS IT MADE THE DRY SKIN AROUND MY NAILS VERY SOFT AND I DO AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE THIS EVERYDAY.</li>
    <li> My Mom&#x27;s primary care doctor suggested using this to make her fingernails stronger.  Over a period of using it everyday for about 3 weeks, her thin brittle nails did get thicker and grew longer.</li>
    <li> The product works well on my heels &amp; feet. At night I liberly apply it, then put footies on so I don&#x27;t rub it off on my sheets. I also massageit into my nails &amp; cuticles at night. I have seen alittle improvement in my nails, but to be honest, I think it would work better if I applied it often during the day especially after washing my hands. I&#x27;m going to keep using it and see what happens.</li>
    <li> Gave them to all my family for stocking stuffers two years in a row!</li>
    <li> I liked it very much for my nails. Keeps them hydrated and from cracking.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really care for it or the smell of it.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it works, but it smells medicinal.  I have put it on my hands also as some others suggested, but it is to sticky feeling for me.  Maybe it will work on the nails though, if I can tolerate the smell.</li>
    <li> Awesome moisturizer for your heals1</li>
    <li> Love it. Had my nails professionally done for many years. Decided to remove them, which took off the top layer of my nails and revealed dry, paper thin nails. A friend recommended this, and it is definitely working.</li>
    <li> Very good product for hands and cuticles.  Healing, gives that moisture needed for nails.</li>
    <li> Have had problem nails forever and this is the only thing that really works, you have to use daily, and if possible twice a day.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I smatter  this cream on at bedtime with white cotton gloves....my hands look so much better the next day.(less wrinkly) I do this especially when my fake nail are off.....I rub the creme into my nail beds to strengthen them (do the same for toes also)...great stuff for the price!</li>
    <li> works great for healthier and stronger finger and toenails, better than any other lotions or creams used in the past.</li>
    <li> Been using for a few weeks and nails are less brittle (and a papercut on my cuticle finally healed!).  I&#x27;m ready to buy a horse so I have some real hooves to use it on.</li>
    <li> Nothing special but does have a generous amount of product</li>
    <li> I have a lot of problems with my heels drying up and have to get pedicures often. But I have not gotten a pedicure since I tried this product in 4 months! I was recommended to use this protein treatment on my heels during my last pedicure. I put it on every single day after every shower and my feet have never been softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to write this recommendation because all of the reviews seemed to be about nail cuticles and it&#x27;s important to know the versatility of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the 1oz lasted me 4 months and I just bought the 4oz because of the deal and expect to last me over a year (I kept the smaller container for travel)- this stuff is unbelievably cheap for the results you get.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product!  A friend recommended it when I mentioned a problem with splitting and cracking nails. I thought I&#x27;d give it a try -- nothing else had worked so far.  Well, this does work.  In just a few weeks, I&#x27;ve seen a big difference in my nails.  They&#x27;re actually growing out and are noticeably stronger.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and will certainly continue using it.</li>
    <li> I originally got a small jar of this from a manicurist and really liked it. So I sized up and I use it almost every night. I just dab a litle on each nail and massage it into my nail and cuticle. It keeps my cuticles smooth and seems to help strengthen my nails. I have fewer splits and tears. I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Thank you for providing this product on a timely basis,.  I do love it..  I give as gifts too.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh, my customer recommended this to me and I am in awe. Cuticles, nails, skin on hand and feet. Healthy Hooves indeed!</li>
    <li> If you have cracking sore feet this is for you. After you do your feet  your hands feel great and before you know it you have used it on every dry spot.</li>
