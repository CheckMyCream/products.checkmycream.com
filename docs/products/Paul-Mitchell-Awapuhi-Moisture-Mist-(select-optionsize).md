      <li>Hair fees so much softer!</li>
      <li>not like what I remember when I first purchased products in 70&#x27;s</li>

      <li>Win-win the whole way around.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years now and it really helps with &amp;#34;winter scalp&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s works very well for me.  </li>
      <li>It goes on light and sinks right into skin.  </li>
      <li>If you have a child with long hair and it gets knotted easily and she won&#x27;t use a conditioner, this is the ticket.  </li>

<li> i bought this for myself for my dry hair and scalp!</li>

    <li> Love this product, it keeps my hair moisturized, feeling fresh and smelling good.</li>
    <li> Great product! Will do business with again.</li>
    <li> Love it. Hair fees so much softer! I will continue to buy this over and over again</li>
    <li> i bought this for myself for my dry hair and scalp! it works effectively on my hair! but then i remembered my dog has long hair and has many problems with her skin and her hair in summer gets very dry and sheds all over the house! so i actually gave her a quick bath with dog shampoo and conditioner and dried her off with a towel and some hairdryer under her ears (She gets ear infections if i don&#x27;t do this) and when her hair was about 80% dry i gave her about 8 sprays and brushed her hair and rubbed it into a little of my hands and worked it into her itchy/dry spots, its been about 3 days and I&#x27;ve noticed no itching and very minimal shedding! she actually enjoys this stuff and loves when i put it on her! me and my dog are very pleased with this product! very little shedding and my dog is much more comfortable!  the fragrance is pleasant and very very light too! Very refreshing!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair moisture mist and can be used on your body also. Much needed in the summer to control frizzes and make the hair more curly. It also stops the drying out that you get from the sun. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having a hard time believing this is the real thing!  Smells like plastic-awful...</li>
    <li> This product is so easy to use (fine spray) and gives such nice softness to the hair!! Yes, like any leave-in, it could be overused but after a few tries you&#x27;ll figure out the right amount for your hair. I have fine, fragile, wavy hair and it&#x27;s works very well for me.  Still allows the waves to show but helps eliminate the brittle feeling to the hair.  Love hair feels soft and moisturized but not at all greasy or weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be the PERFECT detangler for a child&#x27;s hair.  If you have a child with long hair and it gets knotted easily and she won&#x27;t use a conditioner, this is the ticket.  Is easy for a child to use on themselves (older child/teen) as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this product in the summer as a body moisturizer.  When it&#x27;s too hot to use lotions (high heat/humidity) this is a very light way of providing some after-shower moisturizing to the skin.  It goes on light and sinks right into skin.  Win-win the whole way around.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years now and it really helps with &amp;#34;winter scalp&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Btw, ive found that nearly ever Supercuts location sells this as well as the entire line. Can&#x27;t say enuff . Ima pro makeup artist and use this mainly as a setting /finishing spray for clients. Bit it&#x27;s great to create dewy skin and hair for a beach look.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.  It makes my hair fluffy and pretty.  My hair looks good all day.</li>
    <li> I need more moisture for my leave in. This feels like I&#x27;m misting plain water on my hair. It doesn&#x27;t detangle... At all. My hair feels soft but that&#x27;s pretty much it. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> YEP - ANOTHER HAIR PRODUCT FROM MITCHELL THAT IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I use it on my hair and my skin to feel smooth all over. Also, the scent is fabulous, like I am in a porno movie.</li>
    <li> works great and smells wonderful - I hope they keep making this product</li>
    <li> A+ product for my baby daughter.  She had cradle cap and very dry skin.  This product helped resolve both plus it detangles her hair.</li>
    <li> Works well on frizzy hair. It has no scent which disappoints me but others may find that a plus.</li>
    <li> It was rotten and stunk so bad that I had to throw it away. I tried adding a scent to it but it was too far gone.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have been using it for years as a light conditioner and detangler. My hair is baby fine, so I can&#x27;t use most of the heavier stuff. This is light as a feather, as long as you don&#x27;t load it on. Smells great!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is perfect for the dry winter or summer seasons. I have used this in the past and have had trouble finding it but well worth it, I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It is great to tame flyaway hair not to mention the moisturizing factor..</li>
    <li> Love this to hydrate skin and hair in winter months</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have permed hair and it can get frizzy at times. This product takes away the frizz without making my hair dry and stiff like some other spray products. I use it  on dry hair between washing my hair, which is every 2 days.</li>
    <li> It is not brand new, the product has gone rancid. It&#x27;s scent is musty....very disappointing!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have used it off and on for years. It smells great and it leaves my hair soft and manageable. I have permed and color treated hair now and this is the only thing I put in my hair. It keeps the frizz down without any &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; side affect.</li>
    <li> great for refreshing skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;perfect for the beach and other outside activities.&lt;br /&gt;the smell is nice but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I would never change and it works as a light gel and really makes my hair look healthy and full</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a hair stylist at Supercuts after she commented on my extremely dry hair. I use a flat iron and hair dryer almost daily so I decided to give this product a try. It sprays as a fine mist over your hair and feel essentially like water. However, if my hair gets damp in the shower after spraying this, I feel a sticky film left by the spray. Yucky feeling! It makes my hair minimally softer, but no real change in the dryness or texture. Not recommended if you are looking for lasting or dramatic results.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for many many years. Great for curly hair. Great detangler and really refreshes curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for 20 years.  Very good, especially when you have a swimmer or someone with damaged hair.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this. I have wavy hair and after I wash my hair, I spray some on and my hair just feels and behaves more manageable . Also, it also has been healthier because it aids with dryness. On days that I do not wash my hair, I use it to refresh my hair. A MUST try!!!</li>
    <li> Old do not buy this product at all the packaging it old the spray smell old just go to the salon and purchase</li>
    <li> My bottle came without a cap and it strayed inside the box.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found to help with a dry scalp in the winter.</li>
    <li> I use this nearly every day before I go outside.  Love everything Awapuhi!</li>
    <li> I love this spray...Its great in Summer to keep in the fridge for a refreshing spritz..Light and happy for your skin...I use it in Winter for the moisture benefit...</li>
    <li> I use this product on my scalp after I dye my hair and when it gets irritated.  I used it for a few days and my flaking scalp cleared up. I don&#x27;t like using it in the morning as it changes the texture of my hair, but I drench my scalp in the product.  It may not happen if you used it more conservatively.</li>
    <li> An outstanding  fresh, clean spray;perfect for spritzing after sports, hot weather or whatever...spritz on hair to protect from salt H20, or clorine.  Freshen your body and cool off  with a no rinse moisture mist.  It&#x27;s the best!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katherine,&lt;br /&gt;Long Island, NY</li>
    <li> not like what I remember when I first purchased products in 70&#x27;s so I returned it sorry.</li>
