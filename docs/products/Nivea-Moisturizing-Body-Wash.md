      <li>But this is as good as any I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a body wash to replace my beloved, yet discontinued bath and body works body wash.  </li>
      <li>The product gives rich lather and smells wonderful while you&#x27;re using it --</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve got more wonderful products waiting in the wings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
      <li>Nivea&#x27;s coconut body wash stands right up there with the best of them.</li>
      <li>Not the most luxuriant lather, but very nice.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell and taste of coconut!</li>
      <li>I love the scent too!</li>
      <li>I want palm trees and lovely tanned ladies surrounding me!  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I love the yummy smell of this coconut body wash!</li>
      <li>Not as strong of a scent that I like however I am happy to find a coconut scent in Nivea.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice, is priced well, and provides a luxurious lather while moisturizing and cleaning my skin.</li>
      <li>Nice scent , rinses well</li>
      <li>It lathers nicely and leaves my skin softer than if I had used another body wash or soap.</li>
      <li>The body wash itself has a nice coconut scent, and a creamy consistency.  </li>
      <li>This body wash lathers up nicely.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice, but I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
      <li>It has a nice texture and soaps up well on a wash cloth as well as a scrubby.</li>
      <li>I thought this Nivea coconut body wash has a nice vanilla-like smell and lathers well.</li>
      <li>Very creamy and moisturizes my skin wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>The scent is not overly strong, but pleasant.</li>
      <li>If you like lotion-like, highly moisturizing, coconut scented body washes, this one would be an excellent choice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The first thing that hits you is that incredible coconut scent.</li>
      <li>It lathered very nicely, and rinsed away clean.  </li>
      <li>Nice lather, kind to the skin, and best of all, a totally yummy coconutty smell!</li>
      <li>I went to Amazon, and, of course, there it was, at a good price and FAST via AMAZON PRIME!!!  </li>
      <li>THANKS NIVEA for another good product!  </li>
      <li>It has a very light scent but is non descript.</li>
      <li>There seem to be two distinct types of body washes available these days: those that clean well and have bracing, invigorating scents and those that moisturize the skin and smell like delicious desserts.</li>
      <li>No matter if you are buying this for the coconut smell or for the moisturizing power, you will love this product.</li>
      <li>Yes, probably, most folks should, but the need is not as great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>The lather is good but not crazy soapy.</li>
      <li>However, this aroma is lighter than most</li>
      <li>Exotic Coconut was the scent.  </li>
      <li>so I can stand it, even if I wish for it to me more coconut-scented.</li>
      <li>I love the fragarance of this product.</li>
      <li>What more can you ask from a body wash?</li>
      <li>It works better that the $ 11.oo dollar washes I was buying from a well known retailer.</li>
      <li>The Coconut smell makes me think of warm beaches instead of snowy driveways to clean:)</li>
      <li>It is lightweight and feels creamy and smooth, it goes on easily with a nice flip up top.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am very happy with the way it leaves my winter dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I happen to love coconut-scented soaps and shampoos, so of course I enjoy the scent of this body wash.</li>
      <li>, the scent is a light coconut fragrance which I normally love</li>
      <li>I love the rich moisturizing lather/</li>
      <li>The Coconut is easy on the scent too.</li>
      <li>The coconut smells clean and refreshing.</li>
      <li>The coconut aroma smells so refreshing and clean as you shower.  </li>
      <li>, it rinses off easily and well.</li>
      <li>The coconut scent is initially strong but not offensive, and it fades rapidly.</li>
      <li>A good, high quality product.</li>
      <li>Body wash is a frivolity I seldom indulge but this is a lovely, sweet smelling alternative to deodorant soap and leaves no film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I could smell those fine.  </li>
      <li>Nice body wash, don&#x27;t need too much to get soaped up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the gel texture, the invigorating fragrance, the generous amount of suds, and the super clean feeling after bathing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does not leave a greasy feeling on skin or in the tub--no one wants a slippery tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good size bottle, too, and should last a good while.</li>
      <li>The scent is clean and, yes, refreshing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I think it rinses clean</li>
      <li>The Nivea lathers up very nicely, and rinses off completely, which are really what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
      <li>It lathers very nicely and cleans your body without leaving your skin dry.  </li>
      <li>It is very lightly scented which I like because I am sensitive to strong scents.</li>
      <li>I tried this and loved it, but couldn&#x27;t find it the next week in the stores in this area.  </li>
      <li>The soap lathers nicely, rinses cleaning, and leaves your skin soft.</li>
      <li>I have tried several of the Nivea washes...touch of happiness, smoothness and cashmere.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m more of a soap guy and don&#x27;t like body wash much</li>
      <li>When my shower was complete I felt a nice moisturizing all over my body that did not feel greasy.</li>
      <li>far as the refreshing bit is concerned, I do feel clean and a tad bit more alive after using this body wash, but I believe that that is primarily due to the fact that the coconut scent is so wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Some have a very cherry smell, while others have a creamy tropical smell, Hawaiian Tropic has the best scent, and Nivea reminds me a little of the coconut smell in that product.</li>
      <li>This is a perfectly adequate body wash (soap in a bottle).</li>
      <li>but coconut is too mild a scent to stick around for long.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smelling coconut while I&#x27;m in the shower quickly brings me to the much warmer (okay, really hot) summers of Louisiana.  </li>
      <li>Slathering on an oil or moisturizing cream on slightly moist skin is the best way to provide a moisture barrier that helps keep the skin soft and supple.</li>
      <li>I recently tried the Nivea in-shower nourishing body lotion and really liked it, so when I saw this Nivea moisturizing body wash in the Amazon Vine program, I decided to give it a try as well.  </li>
      <li>This body wash really seems to do a good job moisturizing, especially in conjunction with the Nivea in-shower lotion.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t too powerful after you get out of the shower and get on with your day, but I still smell</li>
      <li>but, no, you won&#x27;t smell like a cupcake after you&#x27;re out of the shower, just fresh.  </li>
      <li>Overall though, I liked this body wash and will use it again.</li>
      <li>But this one is pretty mild and not offensive to no nose.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The lather produced by Nivea Body wash was luxuriously rich, creamy and moisturizing, not thin and bubby.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Coconut goodness! The moisturizing affects helps with the dryness my skin tends to get in the winter. The Coconut smell makes me think of warm beaches instead of snowy driveways to clean:) My teenage daughter keeps stealing it!</li>
    <li> This body wash lathers up nicely.  The scent is not overly strong, but pleasant. A good, high quality product. My only negative is that the product is very slippery and the lather on the shower can cause the tub to be slippery.  So, use it either in the tub sitting down or standing in a tub with a mat or those little anti-slip &amp;#34;adhesive ducks&amp;#34; (as Sheldon Cooper would say).</li>
    <li> This body wash does all the things you want a body wash to do!  It lathers very nicely and cleans your body without leaving your skin dry.  It is very moisturizing and leave my skin feeling soft and supple.  The scent is very nice too!</li>
    <li> My Nivea Coconut Body Wash arrived just in time. It&#x27;s been a pretty harsh winter here in New Jersey. The snow, the cold, and the heat (in the house) have left my skin dry and feeling miserable. Today my body wash arrived and I immediately took a shower with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that hits you is that incredible coconut scent. I love the smell and taste of coconut! I find that coconut fragrance, or what is supposed to be coconut fragrance varies by product. Some have a very cherry smell, while others have a creamy tropical smell, Hawaiian Tropic has the best scent, and Nivea reminds me a little of the coconut smell in that product. The coconut scent does linger gently on your skin after using the product, but you have to get close to smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Nivea Body Wash on a mesh shower ball (some people call it a pouf, but I can&#x27;t get myself to call it that). When applying it I noticed it seemed slightly thicker than other body washes that I have used. All I needed was one squirt for my entire shower, which was something that I never encountered. Usually two or three applications are necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather produced by Nivea Body wash was luxuriously rich, creamy and moisturizing, not thin and bubby. It lasted much longer than other washes, which is why I only needed one application to my mesh shower ball. When my shower was complete I felt a nice moisturizing all over my body that did not feel greasy. Other washes claim to moisturize, but mostly disappoint. Using Nivea Coconut Body Wash will definitely help my dry winter skin.</li>
    <li> There seem to be two distinct types of body washes available these days: those that clean well and have bracing, invigorating scents and those that moisturize the skin and smell like delicious desserts. This Nivea body wash falls into the latter category.....it does a very good job of moisturizing and it smells like a coconut chiffon cake. Yummy delish, if that&#x27;s how you roll with body washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a long time Vitabath Moisturizing Bath Gelee, Original Spring Green user. I love the gel texture, the invigorating fragrance, the generous amount of suds, and the super clean feeling after bathing. In comparison, this Nivea body wash pours from the bottle like a lotion, provides little sudsing (unless one uses a mesh pouf,) smells like a coconut confection, and leaves a soft oily film on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some may not like the feeling, an oily residues post bathing is a very good thing. Slathering on an oil or moisturizing cream on slightly moist skin is the best way to provide a moisture barrier that helps keep the skin soft and supple. This body wash provides this step while you are still in the shower. Do you still need to use a body cream? Yes, probably, most folks should, but the need is not as great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea is an excellent manufacturer known for producing \\&quot;good for you\\&quot; skin care. If you like lotion-like, highly moisturizing, coconut scented body washes, this one would be an excellent choice.</li>
    <li> I love the rich moisturizing lather/ In the summer if I were to use this I bet this could double as my lotion as well. But alas, it is winter and parched skin soaks this up. The scent, while coconut-y just washes away in the shower. I feel like some of the strong tropical scents from other body washes can last a little longer but coconut is too mild a scent to stick around for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea is great for my skin and the scent is not to obnoxious. Especially from someone who is usually not a fan of coconut smells. For some reason I love the smell of Hawaiian Tropic sunscreen but usually hate all other coconut smells. But this one is pretty mild and not offensive to no nose. Win!</li>
    <li> Well, I have been using this body wash for 2 weeks now.  I am very happy with the way it leaves my winter dry skin.  Usually I have to slather half a bottle of lotion on after I bathe, but the Nivea Coconut Body wash leaves my skin considerably softer to begin with.  The body wash itself has a nice coconut scent, and a creamy consistency.  Not the most luxuriant lather, but very nice.  It compares favorably with the Olay body wash that I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> This is a perfectly adequate body wash (soap in a bottle). It is very lightly scented which I like because I am sensitive to strong scents. It seems just a bit too expensive for its quality. On the positive side it does not leave a greasy or waxy feel like some body washes.</li>
    <li> Body wash is a frivolity I seldom indulge but this is a lovely, sweet smelling alternative to deodorant soap and leaves no film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a soft, silky feel, produces no allergic reaction and carries the fresh tropical coconut scent that makes it so much fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a very refreshing body wash and a great companion to the Nivea cream.  Left my skin silky smooth for 24 hours until the next time I showered!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a body wash to replace my beloved, yet discontinued bath and body works body wash.  Exotic Coconut was the scent.  This isn&#x27;t similar to it, but it has that distinct coconut smell I have been searching for!  Thumbs up!!  Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this shower cream.  I have tried several of the Nivea washes...touch of happiness, smoothness and cashmere.  Then this one was on sale so I picked it up.  It has to be the creamiest of all of them!  I have very dry skin and live near Cleveland, OH where we are in the midst of an awful winter.  Today I used this for the first time and I almost forgot to use lotion after my shower!  Plus, I have used other soaps or gels that seem creamy, although not like this, but left a film in the shower which means it did on my skin as well.  This one did not plus even as creamy as it is, it rinses off easily and well. Just what we needed especially this time of year.</li>
    <li> I love the fragarance of this product. The coconut smells clean and refreshing. The soap lathers nicely, rinses cleaning, and leaves your skin soft. What more can you ask from a body wash? I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good product, smells great, just not as thick as other products I&#x27;ve used. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry skin, especially during the cold Michigan winters.  I use a moisturizing soap in the shower, then apply lotion pretty much from head to toe after drying off.  If I do not, my skin will be dry and itchy soon thereafter.  I recently tried the Nivea in-shower nourishing body lotion and really liked it, so when I saw this Nivea moisturizing body wash in the Amazon Vine program, I decided to give it a try as well.  I really like the coconut scent.  This body wash really seems to do a good job moisturizing, especially in conjunction with the Nivea in-shower lotion.  Following both of these products, I still apply lotion after my shower.  (What can I say, my winter skin is high maintenance!)  Using this combination of products keeps my dry winter skin moisturized.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I thought this Nivea coconut body wash has a nice vanilla-like smell and lathers well. I found the body wash to be gentle on the skin (which is important for me, since I have sensitive skin), and the bottle itself to be decently sized (16.9 ounces).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small thing I noticed was that the bottle&#x27;s cap was easily breakable, as it broke off right after I initially opened the bottle--so be careful when opening it. Overall though, I liked this body wash and will use it again.</li>
    <li> Whether or not you like this produce all comes down to the scent. If you like the smell of coconut, then you&#x27;ll like this soap, if not, look for a different scent. The Nivea lathers up very nicely, and rinses off completely, which are really what I&#x27;m looking for. I don&#x27;t want to walk around feeling &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; or lotion-y after I&#x27;ve showered, I simply want to feel clean, and the Nivea does just that.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather up as well as I&#x27;d hoped. Smells nice, but I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> The answer for dry skin and very economical to order from Amazon. It works better that the $ 11.oo dollar washes I was buying from a well known retailer.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing.  Skin feels great after shower.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Nice scent , rinses well</li>
    <li> I love the yummy smell of this coconut body wash! It leaves the skin soft and supple. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Not as strong of a scent that I like however I am happy to find a coconut scent in Nivea.</li>
    <li> Just got these yesterday and it is wonderful.  I have very, very dry skin so I think with just the one time I used it this will help greatly.  The Coconut is easy on the scent too.</li>
    <li> I tried this and loved it, but couldn&#x27;t find it the next week in the stores in this area.  I went to Amazon, and, of course, there it was, at a good price and FAST via AMAZON PRIME!!!  I don&#x27;t have to go out, spending $20 in gas to find what I WANT.  The product gives rich lather and smells wonderful while you&#x27;re using it -- but, no, you won&#x27;t smell like a cupcake after you&#x27;re out of the shower, just fresh.  I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate.&lt;br /&gt;Bet you&#x27;ll like it too . . .  THANKS NIVEA for another good product!  Thanks Amazon Prime!</li>
    <li> At the current price point (around six bucks a bottle), this is a decent deal. I happen to love coconut-scented soaps and shampoos, so of course I enjoy the scent of this body wash. It reminds me a lot of a coconut Suave shampoo / conditioner set I had years back -- definite coconut scent, but with floral hints to it. Much milder than the coconut-scented car air fresheners or beach candles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash itself is plain white, relatively thin (not a gel), and provides a luxurious moisturizing lather when I use it with my shower scrubbie. I can still smell the body wash on my skin halfway through the day -- not strong, but it&#x27;s definitely there and is a nice clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find anything to complain about with this body wash. It smells nice, is priced well, and provides a luxurious lather while moisturizing and cleaning my skin. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many brands of shower washes from generic store brands to organics to moderate priced brands such as Olay to premium high dollar brands such as Perlier, Elaria, Dior, Chanel, etc. Nivea&#x27;s coconut body wash stands right up there with the best of them. My dry skin is left absolutely soft and moisturized from the first few uses. The coconut scent is initially strong but not offensive, and it fades rapidly. There is barely any scent left on the skin after the shower. It makes a good amount of lather using a shower poof, and the best thing - it does not make the bath tub slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If layering scents is your priority, go ahead and pay a fortune for designer gels and washes. If you want soft, smooth skin and a fun fragrance in the tub at a reasonable price, try Nivea Coconut Body Wash.</li>
    <li> Gentle body wash that doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, the scent is a light coconut fragrance which I normally love but with this one I could detect just a slight artificial note to it. Otherwise it does a good job and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth and not overly dried out afterwards.</li>
    <li> This is getting a mixed review in my house. Everyone likes the scent - fresh, and a little coconutty but you won&#x27;t wind up smelling like suntan lotion. It lathers well and I think it rinses clean, it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily like some moisturizing soaps do. One daughter loves it for her winter-dry skin, says it&#x27;s made her skin noticeably softer and much less itchy. The other daughter is having an opposite reaction- her skin is actually flakier after using this product. I don&#x27;t notice much difference either way. I&#x27;m averaging our results (5, 1 and 3) into a 3.</li>
    <li> No matter if you are buying this for the coconut smell or for the moisturizing power, you will love this product. It is below zero here in Michigan right now but it smells like summer at the beach when I lather up with this.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Very nice body wash.  The coconut aroma smells so refreshing and clean as you shower.  The scent does not linger on your skin, so you don&#x27;t go around smelling like coconut all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not leave a greasy feeling on skin or in the tub--no one wants a slippery tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good size bottle, too, and should last a good while.</li>
    <li> At first sniff, I was a bit surprised to find the coconut combined with a light floral scent. For the most part, I&#x27;m a fan of fruity and other food-type scents (such as vanilla or hazelnut), and not the flowery ones. However, this aroma is lighter than most so I can stand it, even if I wish for it to me more coconut-scented. Aroma aside, the bottle is nicely designed, the body wash comes out easily and without and mess or fuss. It lathers nicely and leaves my skin softer than if I had used another body wash or soap. It makes me feel less guilty if I either don&#x27;t have the time or inclination to moisturize after my shower. I believe in the future I&#x27;ll look for other scents in Nivea&#x27;s line, as I&#x27;m overall satisfied with my experience with this product.</li>
    <li> I am only giving this product three stars because I can&#x27;t really smell the coconut scent at all.  I have used it a few times on my shower puff and cannot notice any scent.  I&#x27;ve bought $1 shampoos scented with coconut and I could smell those fine.  Other than that I like the way that it feels.  It is lightweight and feels creamy and smooth, it goes on easily with a nice flip up top.&lt;br /&gt;It lathers well and you don&#x27;t really need to apply much.  I think that Nivea makes good products.</li>
    <li> This body wash smells very yummy, the coconut scent is light enough to not be overpowering, but strong enough to leave a slight scent on your skin.  I suffer from very dry skin, and after washing with this, my skin is noticeably softer.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a film, like soaps do.  It lathered very nicely, and rinsed away clean.  It didn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin, either.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Subtle coconut scent that smells really fresh. My skin likes it &amp; so does my nose!</li>
    <li> Nice body wash, don&#x27;t need too much to get soaped up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Nivea is an excellent brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m more of a soap guy and don&#x27;t like body wash much (it&#x27;s expensive, relative to soap). But this is as good as any I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Smells great and lathers well. I love the smell it is soft and subtle. The lather is good but not crazy soapy. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my daughters exema. It has a nice texture and soaps up well on a wash cloth as well as a scrubby.</li>
    <li> Nivea makes me think of the the summer time with this product.  I want palm trees and lovely tanned ladies surrounding me!  I&#x27;ve always been impressed by Nivea products.  They almost always deliver on any claims that they make, and they come through again with their Coconut Body Wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The claim is that this body wash refreshes and moisturizes the skin.  My skin is notoriously dry, especially during the winter, so I always have lotions and moisturizing body washes handy this time of year.  Does Nivea&#x27;s body wash keep my skin moisturized?  Absolutely.  I&#x27;ve noticed a marked improvement in my skin, especially in my face and hands, which seem to suffer the most this time of year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the refreshing bit is concerned, I do feel clean and a tad bit more alive after using this body wash, but I believe that that is primarily due to the fact that the coconut scent is so wonderful.  Smelling coconut while I&#x27;m in the shower quickly brings me to the much warmer (okay, really hot) summers of Louisiana.  The scent is clean and, yes, refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t too powerful after you get out of the shower and get on with your day, but I still smell clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically this is another great product from Nivea.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve got more wonderful products waiting in the wings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> This product certainly moisturizes well, which is half the reason why I bought it. However, the scent has a sort of plastic-like tinge to it. I can definitely smell the coconut, but it smells slightly fakey.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Nice lather, kind to the skin, and best of all, a totally yummy coconutty smell!</li>
    <li> Very creamy and moisturizes my skin wonderfully.  I love the scent too!</li>
    <li> I was expecting a coconut scent with this body wash but it did not smell tropical nor like coconut. It has a very light scent but is non descript. It contains jojoba oil but my skin did not feel softer than using regular bar soap.  I did not feel extra moisture either.  It is okay as a regular cleanser but I did not experience the extra benefits listed. I have creamier more moisturizing washes that are less expensive.</li>
