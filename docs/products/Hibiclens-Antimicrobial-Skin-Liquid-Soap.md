    <li> Great price! $6 + tax for only 4 oz at local grocery store. Great value!</li>
    <li> works great and delivered quick</li>

    <li> Kept my vicious skin flora at bay post op cardiac Sx.</li>
    <li> Best cleaner ever.  After a surgery, I used for a rash.  Now I use daily.</li>
    <li> I have used it in the past, it works very well for my skin type.</li>
    <li> Remove the alcohol! Besides that, a okay</li>
    <li> I am a physician and use this to wash whenever I come home from the hospital.  Best value for bulk chlorhexidine.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and seller. Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I don&#x27;t use it to wash hands but generally to clean wounds. It works well for dogs with hot spots, too!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a patient of mine to was her better than normal soap.  I was going through it pretty quick and then I saw another Amazon customer&#x27;s review and they said that they put the soap in a foaming dispenser and WOW did that work.  It works for cuts, scrapes, skin issues and I started using it as hand wash now that I don&#x27;t waste so much of it.</li>
    <li> Wish it came in a gel formulation!</li>
    <li> Used this for a staph infection (boil) that otherwise would have required a trip to the doctor. Shrank it down and cleared it up in just a couple days. Key thing is to let it sit on your skin for a couple minutes before rinsing. Also waiting to see if it helps with persistent body acne. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Did not help with acne, but this stuff is still my go-to whenever I need to treat any sort of infection. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Helps to keep my hands healthy.</li>
    <li> Big savings. Product as stated</li>
    <li> Bought this before I researched natural ways to hand sanitizing.  My mistake.</li>
    <li> Since Phisohex was taken off the market, this has been our go-to soap for occasional use on skin issues, and mostly for our dogs.  They are very allergic to flea saliva and, although they follow our vet&#x27;s recommendations and medications to the letter, still get bitten outside.  Hibiclens has proven to be a big help to their skin itching and to assist in the healing process where they&#x27;ve scratched themselves.  We have observed no ill effects at all, and it absolutely does help, obviously when used as directed.</li>
    <li> 2 large bottles for a little over the price of 1 medium bottle at the store?! Pretty awesome deal. Arrived as expected and will purchase again when I need more. :)</li>
    <li> My Son has bad Eczema, his been seeing a specialist since the day he was born. His now 15 and he uses this all the time, best thing on the market. It really help keep his body clear and clean. Highly recommended along with a pump so you can use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> Does what I bought for. Did not expect it to be colored with red dye 40. Price is right for the product.</li>
    <li> Love the soup been using after my surgery.</li>
    <li> I will use this on my face for the rest of my life!  My dermatologist at UCSF recommended I mix it into a bottle with purified water in a 1:1 ratio.  I spray it onto a cotton pad and apply it to my clean face, let it sit 2-3 minutes, and rinse off.  Hibiclens kills bacteria for up to six hours on my skin and has helped control my sensitive rosacea by 60-70%.  This is the same product used in all the hospitals and doctors scrub with it prior to surgery.  It has changed my life, literally.</li>
    <li> use with bottle that makes foam</li>
    <li> Good Price compared to locally purchasing</li>
