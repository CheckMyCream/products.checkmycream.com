      <li>My suggestion is to find the most natural color (one that is close to the lipstick colors you wear) of this Covergirl all day lipcolor and apply it after you line your lips.  </li>
      <li>It also shipped pretty quick too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to clean your lips completely before reapplying.</li>
      <li>Great lip color only need to apply it in the morning and it last all day..</li>
      <li>you pay double or better.</li>
      <li>I love this lipstick and was sad when they stopped making the shade I loved.</li>
      <li>This seriously lasts all day long and what a great price!!</li>
      <li>Lasts much longer than normal lipstick.</li>
      <li>Postage too high for cost of iem .</li>
      <li>It is a little more than natural color with a hint of rosiness.  </li>
      <li>Love it the way it stays on for about half a day without having to constantly reaply.  </li>
      <li>I use the Natural Blush color of this lip color</li>
      <li>I even use it on my bare lips when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing makeup but want to keep my lips moisturized.</li>
      <li>Let dry completely then apply sealer.&lt;br /&gt;Wore</li>

<li> Then once it&#x27;s dry, apply your regular lipstick.  </li>
<li> I know a lot of people complain about the tackiness of the application, but once it&#x27;s completely dry, there are no issues.</li>
<li> I recently found it on Amazon for less (and no crouds to fight or gas to spend!)</li>
<li> I apply this in the morning and put my other lipstick over it.  </li>
<li> If lips get dry during day, just add little lip gloss for moisture.  </li>
<li> It also costs less here.</li>
<li> I think they could eliminate that from the package and adjust the price a little lower.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m always a little hesitant to buy makeup online because the picture almost never matches the shade you end up with.</li>
<li> I use it as sort of a base.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  Lasts much longer than normal lipstick.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m always a little hesitant to buy makeup online because the picture almost never matches the shade you end up with. In this case, it&#x27;s very true to color. I know a lot of people complain about the tackiness of the application, but once it&#x27;s completely dry, there are no issues. The color lasts all day as promised. My friends are always amazed when we spend the day together and my lips are still looking great. The additional lip balm is also wonderful for keeping your lips soft and glossy throughout the day. I even use it on my bare lips when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing makeup but want to keep my lips moisturized.</li>
    <li> Great lip color only need to apply it in the morning and it last all day..</li>
    <li> WILL ALWAYS PURCHASE KIND OF LIPSTICK/BRAND, JUST DIFFERENT COLORS, STAYS ON  NOT ON GLASSES,CUPS ETC.PLUS IT ALSO KEEPS YOU FROM USING CHAP STICK. LOL</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lip stick for about 6 yrs now.  Love it the way it stays on for about half a day without having to constantly reaply.  I used to buy at Walmart but often the color I like was sold out.  I recently found it on Amazon for less (and no crouds to fight or gas to spend!)</li>
    <li> Perfect color &amp; price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lipstick for years.  Put it on and it stays on.  Lots of colors.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t purchase again. Postage too high for cost of iem . Like brand and color</li>
    <li> I am fairly light skinned.  I get a lot of compliments on the color.  It is a little more than natural color with a hint of rosiness.  It is not an overbearing color.  My local Walmart stopped carrying the color, so I found it here on Amazon.  It also costs less here.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Looks natural, but shiny and better!  Lasts all day and perfect color for every day use.  If lips get dry during day, just add little lip gloss for moisture.  Can&#x27;t get this shade in stores and Amazon is much better priced anyway.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love CoverGirl Outlast Lipcolor....  am checking out new colors as the one I&#x27;ve used for years has been cancelled....  #566...</li>
    <li> I use the Natural Blush color of this lip color and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I&#x27;ve been using it about 2 years now.  I apply this in the morning and put my other lipstick over it.  I use it as sort of a base.  When your lipstick wears off, you still have lip color underneath.  I actually never use the gloss stick that comes with it.  I think they could eliminate that from the package and adjust the price a little lower.  My suggestion is to find the most natural color (one that is close to the lipstick colors you wear) of this Covergirl all day lipcolor and apply it after you line your lips.  It doesn&#x27;t bleed and provides a nice foundation.  Then once it&#x27;s dry, apply your regular lipstick.  I use Revlon &amp;#34;Blushing Nude&amp;#34; over it.  This gives me a great look that lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t come off till I wash my face in the evening.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years.  Tried others but always come back to Outlast #621.</li>
    <li> Let dry completely then apply sealer.&lt;br /&gt;Wore nicely</li>
    <li> This seriously lasts all day long and what a great price!! It also shipped pretty quick too. Will buy again soon!</li>
    <li> use it all the time ...stays on all day and it was a great buy in the stores you pay double or better.</li>
    <li> If I don&#x27;t wear lipstick, my lips disappear.  The color goes with everything.  It&#x27;s important to clean your lips completely before reapplying.</li>
