<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the caps,used them on my Mother who is bedridden. I&#x27;m warmed it up n she loved the experience.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to using this product as I recently had surgery and have been unable to wash my hair.  When I opened the package the smell was overwhelming. I am sensitive to different odors and prefer a light fragrance. I tried the product anyway, and it did freshen my hair. But the smell was so overpowering and offensive, that now I am trying to figure out how to get the smell out of my hair. Never again.</li>
    <li> Woks great. I used it when my Mom had surgery. Her hair was shiney and clean.</li>
    <li> Great to use for someone who is unable to bathe or shower.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC IDEA!&lt;br /&gt;works like a charm.  came quickly and did exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> I bought these caps to help my mother and mother-in-law out when they were sick. They got the job done and were very easy to use! They are a great personal care item for anyone who is unable to shower for any reason and need a shampoo!</li>
    <li> These are great in a pinch. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for regular use though. If you have someone who just can&#x27;t wash their hair in a sink or shower this product will at least clean the hair. The problem is it tends to leave a build up in the hair that kind of weighs it down. You don&#x27;t get a freshly washed, shinning hair you get from a good water and shampoo washing. But if your in a pinch and have no other way of washing the persons hair, this is your best alternative.</li>
    <li> Tried one cap and hated the feel of my hair. Was hard to try to even comb hair. I had to be very careful and wash it out of hair. Now I have 4 others left, not sure what to do with.</li>
    <li> These are excellent- my friend was in ICU and a coma for a couple of months - these worked Amazing and helped cheer her up - highly recommend for hospital patients especially&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved it</li>
    <li> If you have fine hair it&#x27;s very difficult to get it all out of your hair without your hair looking greasy still. Works for a pinch but I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money again.</li>
    <li> Bought for my elderly mom. She loves them. She can wash her hair anytime she wants, without having to wait for her bath lady to come.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and refreshing when washing hair the usual way isn&#x27;t possible</li>
    <li> Good price, prompt delivery, ordered a 12 pack after this did so well.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be helpful when traveling instead of taking the No Rinse Shampoo bottle.  The application was just ok.  Next time I will travel with small spray bottles and skip this cap business as I was not happy to see my hair color on the cap!  Not a lot of color, but disturbing enough not to use more than twice on this last trip.  I use permanent red-brownish hair coloring and I have fine thin hair just above my shoulders.  Cannot remember if it leaves much residue if any.  Hair is clean smelling and appears healthy, shiny.</li>
    <li> Awesome- hard these in the hospital</li>
    <li> Bedfast husband loved these to get his hair washed with.</li>
    <li> Shipping and handling was seamless. I used this on a client because she couldn&#x27;t go to the salon to get a haircut. It is a little harsh. Mad her break out into a rash.</li>
    <li> This made life a little easier ! Up until now it was very difficult to wash Mom&#x27;s hair. Follow the instructions and this is easy. No bending over the sink or risking a fall in the bath tub.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for sometime now and I am mostly very satisfied.  My only issue is that it leaves a slight residue on my scalp.  To overcome this problem I use as spray bottle with clear water in it and rinse my hair that way before drying, etc.  I would be at a loss without this product.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for someone who is immobilized for any reason, or who cannot get wet after having surgery. You simply put the cap on, and it suds up your hair. Then you just comb out your hair and you&#x27;re done. Your hair won&#x27;t feel as conditioned as if you shampooed and conditioned it in the shower, but it is a great option for the circumstances mentioned above.</li>
    <li> They are fantastic using for my Mom who is in the hospital. She looks forward to getting a shampoo!</li>
    <li> I bought these since the nurses offered them to me to wash my hair last time in the hospital. I wanted them as a back up since I have a condition in which I cannot shower. I usually use a bottle of water to pour over my hair at the bathroom sink.  I let my hair get really grungy and then used one of these....GREAT results...nearly as if I had actually showered.</li>
    <li> Neat product for someone who cannot wash their hair due to an illness or something.&lt;br /&gt;My dad has Parkinsons and dementia, unable to walk and I really cannot put him into the shower. This product was ideal!&lt;br /&gt;They could improve the product by giving it a nice fragrance like another brand out there but I am pleased with this.</li>
    <li> Husband in hospital for months...these were just great.  Of course, a shower and regular shampoo are the best, but these really came in handy for a situation where I wanted his hair clean and smelling nice.</li>
    <li> Our city experienced a water emergency. This product worked great! My hair and scalp look and feel clean. It was very soothing on my scalp. I will purchase more and add them to my newly created &#x27;&#x27; in case of an emergency &#x27;&#x27;closet. Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 86 year old father who cannot lift his arms high enough to shampoo and who does NOT want any assistance while in the bath. This product is a Godsend! He can sit at the dining room table while one of us &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34; gives him a thorough massage through the no-mess cap then just a quick wipe with a damp washcloth and towel dry. Perfect! He does not have much hair but was developing a pretty heavy buildup of dead skin on his scalp that was irritating. Problem solved once we started using this product. Once a week is all he needs so it is so worth the price. Can&#x27;t recommend this enough!</li>
    <li> My Mom uses them and they work well for her.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. I bought them after a nurse in the hospital used it to wash my mom&#x27;s hair, because she couldn&#x27;t wash her hair over the sink. Great product!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product when you can&#x27;t take a shower. Arrived on time and well packed.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair stiff and sticky feeling and difficult to comb through.  my bangs appeared clean, but the back looked stringy.  The worst part was when later in the day I developed an allergic reaction to top it off.  My scalp started to itch and peal.  I now have a head full of scabs.  Horrible product and waste of money!</li>
    <li> So easy to use. Outcome is good</li>
    <li> Really nice to have when you can&#x27;t get up and into the shower. Made my mother-in-law feel like a human again after 2 weeks in the hospital with only sponge baths.</li>
    <li> My Mom&#x27;s aide uses on my Mom, who &#x27;s body has atrophied. Excellent product! Her hair is fresh and clean thanks to this product!</li>
    <li> great product when hair can&#x27;t be washed.  much more effective than the dry shampoos.  doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy.</li>
    <li> Great time-saving device.  I use it for my husband who is unable to stand any length of time and it works very well.  The fact that is can be heated is a plus.</li>
    <li> These are so much easier to use than no rinse shampoo. I wish they weren&#x27;t so pricey, but I suppose that&#x27;s the cost of ease. My grandma-in-law who is bedridden uses these to clean her hair. Just heat them up in the microwave for 40 seconds, then place on head and massage into the scalp. She loves this as it feels like a head massage.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo cap that I have tried that works so well. It isn&#x27;t messy at all and all of the soap comes out when you towel dry. A really wonderful product for those of us who cannot wash our hair in the shower or sink and for shut-ins.</li>
    <li> Good for emergency boxes like hurricane bin,etc. Found the very helpful while in hospital for 7 months!</li>
    <li> Great product. If you are taking care of someone who cannot bath this is a really easy to wash the hair and works!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my elderly mother. After a few seconds in the microwave this cap works wonders. Fits like a shower cap and lathers her head so nicely. Towel dry and your done. Great concept.</li>
    <li> Perfect for bathing someone who has had multiple strokes.heat it up and use like shampoo .works great. Just towel dry the head after. No rinsing.</li>
    <li> I always restock these.  When you&#x27;re washing someone&#x27;s hair who&#x27;s not able to step into a shower or lay his or her head over the sink, these are superb.  Heat it for no more than 11 seconds (feel inside to be sure it&#x27;s not too hot), massage the scalp vigorously, and have a washcloth at the ready for wiping the person&#x27;s scalp.  These carry plenty of soap, but it wipes clean easily.</li>
    <li> Works great for my Mom, who is in a nursing home, and won&#x27;t let the hairdresser use water to shampoo her hair.</li>
    <li> my hair feels soft and manageable after using...  some experimentation with getting microwave temp.... but great when I can&#x27;t shower (medical reasons)</li>
    <li> I recommend this product. My mother had a stroke and we use these to help keep her hair looking good</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my grandmother to use once a week at the beauty shop. She cannot really move from her wheel chair. However, I cannot find it in bulk low enough priced to purchase it for her on an on going basis.</li>
    <li> love them just wish you could use them more than once seems to be plenty of shampoo left i guess it might be because of bacteria could start if you tried to use them again but my mom loved it put it in the microwave and messaged her hair she cant get up to the sink so this is great.</li>
    <li> love these they are fine service very good</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 92 year old mother who suffered a broken hip.  This product works so much better than I expected.  We like it because  you warm it before you use it and it gets her hair really clean.  I would buy this for anyone who is not able to get into the shower or wash their hair in the sink.  It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I used this for my mom who is paralyze in a wheel chair and can&#x27;t get  her hair wash. This do a awesome to get out all dry spot n dandruff.</li>
    <li> These shampoo caps are great when someone is home recouperating from a surgery and has difficulty making it into the shower. It is also good for touch up freshness in  between showers. They product is exactly as decribed...you can microwave it briefly, and it is extremely soothing. It has  a very light sent, fresh, and it definately needs no rinsing. It made my hair feel nice and clean, and it perked up my spirits just by being able to independently take care of myself instead of relaying on a caregiver to give me a shampoo. I ghighly recommend them. I am serious, microwaving themn according to directions feels GREAT...the warmth is very soothing, and helps reduce the feelings of stress when you are having difficulty taking care of yourself. They are easy, simple, and they leave hair nice and clean. I will use them in the future and recommend them to others.</li>
    <li> perfect when cant get to shower</li>
    <li> U feel very clean after using this , it&#x27;s better then others I try</li>
    <li> These no-rinse shampoo caps worked great for the weeks just after I had had some surgery and was afraid to get into the shower, owing to the cast on my foot and leg. The work well, and my hair felt clean and fresh. However, I was very happy when I could take a shower and wash my hair in the usual way. There was some buildup of the product in my hair, but it was nothing near what I had feared or anticipated.</li>
    <li> I had surgery and couldn&#x27;t wash my hair.  This was nice to get that fresh washed feeling.  However, you&#x27;re not rinsing, so you don&#x27;t feel quite &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; enough, in my opinion.  I gave them to a friend who said she would like to use them while camping...</li>
    <li> i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item unless someone were desperate.  It does not really leave you feeling as if you have had a real shampoo.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  No mess and can be very relaxing for both the patient and caregiver.</li>
    <li> They work just fine. Recommend</li>
    <li> its ok  not the best but ok</li>
    <li> I really liked the ease of this product. Did exactly what it said. I keep them around for myself now. When I am already dressed and in a hurry.</li>
    <li> These shampoo caps are absolutely wonderful. I use them on my 92 year old mother and she loves them too!&lt;br /&gt;Her hair is soft and clean when finished without the hassle of trying to get her to a sink or in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;They are very convenient and do an awesome job!</li>
