    <li> Very sturdy and high quality thinning shears with a good weight to them.</li>
    <li> I have no training, none whatsoever, in hair cuts. None. I don&#x27;t even dare groom the dogs. Imagine my horror when my husband decided I should cut his hair from now on. Uh-oh. Well, he bought the Oster 76 clippers and that went okay (with words of advice from my own hairdresser). But I kept putting in what I now know is called a weight line, though my husband and I call it a Jethro Gibb after the odd haircut supported by a character on the TV show NCIS. And I could never prevent it or really get it out...until now! My physical therapist suggested thinning shears. I bought this set because it&#x27;s the same brand of hair cutting shears I bought (that was for one of the attempts to get rid of the line) and it got good reviews. And guess what - I got rid of the line!! The shears cut crisply, were a good weight, the finger rest was a nice addition, and even though I have average hands, I did not find the finger holes too small like another reviewer did (only the tips of your fingers are needed to hold the scissors). No, there&#x27;s no instructions included - that&#x27;s what YouTube is for! Search for &amp;#34;how to thinning shears.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had them for 3 months now and they cut like new, they&#x27;re sharp and hold up well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t go to salon I cut my hair with my husband hair I&#x27;m not a good cut hair when I received I&#x27;m amazed nice goo quality best for trimming my hair especially like cut my hair with a styles thanks</li>
