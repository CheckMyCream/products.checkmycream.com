<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> it is dark enough for people to think its black but more like the darkest shade of wine purple. i really enjoy this color. my skin is pretty fair and i get so many compliments for my nails when i have this color on!! i love it and it was a good price</li>
    <li> OPI nail polish is legit!  Doesn&#x27;t chip and dries super fast.  Love it, will buy more!</li>
    <li> I love Lincoln Park After Dark!  It is my favorite color of all time.  You only need two coats and you get the total effect.  It is a mix of black, burgandy, and a blood red.  It looks amazing on.  It is just dark enough but not too dark like a black that sometimes is too harsh.  The brush is great and as always love OPI:)</li>
    <li> A deep dark and rich purple that is nearly black. It looks terrific on my pale skin or when I have a slight tan.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like to embellish it with glitters or crackle coats, just plain shiny topcoat makes me very happy with this color. It makes me feel wicked and vampy without the kitsch. I bring my own to the salon (when I go) because it&#x27;s such a popular color there they are always out.</li>
    <li> OPI is a great brand &amp; I love this color - Lincoln Park after Dark.  It is a very dark purple/red/ burgundy color, almost, but yet not black.  Very popular especially in winter.  I also love the name - Lincoln park - referring to the town in Chicago &amp; also the band, which I love. Anyway, OPI is one of the best, long lasting polish that you can buy!! 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> Great nail polish. I&#x27;m really loving this brand! When used with a nice base coat and top coat, I&#x27;ve found this polish to be smooth, even, and easy to apply as well as durable. I&#x27;m the poster of the first customer image. The color is a very deep plum and is subtle and even difficult to see the hue in all but ideal indoor or natural lighting. A sexy and classy color. Make sure to apply all the way to the tip as I noticed a tiny bit of shrinkage after drying (not tip wear). Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> OPI is one of the best and longest lasting nail lacquers on the market. I love the vividness of the colors they offer especially this one. They are long lasting, on my toes they last about 2 weeks without chipping and a week and a half on my hands. Thats without a top or base coat by the way. The picture shown is very accurate for Linoln Park after Dark, it is a beautiful color.</li>
    <li> Wonderful red/purple color that stays unchipped for days! Girls I hang out with constantly ask me \\&quot;what color is that,\\&quot; followed by a \\&quot;where&#x27;d you get it?\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip: if you want a darker shade, paint on two layers. Paint one hand then the next, come back to the first hand you painted (it should be semi-dry) and go once more over it for a smooth and darker color.</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER AS A GIFT.  IT IS HER FAVORITE.  I WAS GLAD TO FIND IT ON AMAZON AND AT SUCH A REASONABLE PRICE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve lived in Chicago all my life and I&#x27;m familiar with \\&quot;Lincoln Park\\&quot;, the neighborhood that the polish is named after of. I applied the polish just this morning and absolutely adore it. Because I&#x27;m a massage therapist, I&#x27;m constantly cutting &amp; filing my fingernails therefore, I never have a polished manicure. That being said I totally obsess over OPI colors in the summer time. Thanks to this rich and gorgeous color my pedicure is perfection!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know about this color until way after it was stopped being made/carried in stores. It&#x27;s a beautiful deep almost black purple color, definitely a nice change and a nice color for the Fall season. OPI proves itself to be a great brand, yet again.</li>
    <li> Love, Love and yes I love the color, but chips two days out.  And yes I added top coat again and again. It chips!</li>
    <li> OPI makes the best nailpolishes out there. They are true to the color in the bottle and last the longest.  Lincoln Park after Dark is an alluring deep purple that&#x27;s classy yet not run-of-the-mill.</li>
    <li> My best friend had this color for such a long time. Im very fair skinned so i used to think that i wouldn&#x27;t be able to wear it, seeing as she is tanner than i am. I have had this color for over a year and i ADORE IT. it goes with everything. Its such a juicy color! its a very dark purple and turns black with just a second coating. seriously though, you will not regret buying this color! not only does it last long but it hardly chips! It dries within a matter of minutes as well. i don&#x27;t get how anyone could just give this 2 stars. 5 stars all around in my book! Don&#x27;t even consider going to buy it at a salon. i never pay 8.50 for nail polish unless i am desperate! amazon has good deals for OPI! buy it!!!</li>
    <li> My sister suggested I get this and I hesitated because I usually wear lighter nail polishes but I purchased it anyway and am not sorry.  It is so pretty!!!    Also purchased \\&quot;Ink\\&quot; by OPI and that was pretty too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just the perfect dark wine color! Looks black from far away but with the red undertone it doesn&#x27;t look like a scary goth black.  Perfect way to add some vamp or edge to your look!</li>
    <li> LPaD is a classic OPI color and a must have.  I like how the number of coats you put on affects the sun shimmer.  Sometimes I just toss on one light and even coat and watch it glimmer in the sun, while putting 2 coats on my toes.</li>
    <li> Lincoln Park After Dark is one of  my all time favorite OPI colors. Even though I believe it&#x27;s retired, it always is available here on amazon and usually at a pretty decent price. I am always reordering it. I try out different purples because it&#x27;s my favorite color, but I always like to have a bottle of this on hand. It has been duplicated many times over by other companies and even OPI has done similar shades.  Even though they come close, they never are as good. This is a very DEEP eggplant matte shade that is almost black. So dark, you have to go in the sunlight to really see the purple. The picture doesnt really show just how dark it is. I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s great for short nails and I love it on  my toes.&lt;br /&gt;For maximum opaqueness, I suggest 2-3 coats, letting it dry fully in between. If you like this, but prefer a bit of shimmer, I would also suggest Lincoln Park at Midnight, also by OPI. It&#x27;s not quite as dark, either.  If you don&#x27;t like really dark shades, then pass on this one, but if you like those vampy, almost black shades, then give this one a try.</li>
    <li> I wore this color during ALL of winter 2010... It goes with all different color outfits and it really compliments my hands and toes!! I seriously love it. It is really classy with the right outfit, but can be very different and daring too. I advise you all to have this in your collection.</li>
    <li> This is a great almost black color. Reminds me of the o.g. Channel &#x27;Vamp&#x27; that stormed on the scene in the mid 90&#x27;s. This color looks great on short nails and tends to match almost anything. Looks great on toes too.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves dark nail polish and Lincoln Park After Dark is perfect!  The color is deep and rich and it goes on smooth and stays on perfectly until she removes it.  OPI is a very good, higher quality nail polish!</li>
    <li> I love it! Word of advice though --- this is very dark. It appears almost black. Black with a very slight purple tint to it. If you are looking for a dark edgy color like that then this is for you.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and received it right away, not a long wait at all. It was in perfect condition and exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend couldn&#x27;t find this color (Lincoln Park After Dark) of OPI nail polish in the store at which she usually buys it and when I was able to give it to her after only a few days, it was greatly appreciated.</li>
    <li> I think it is the darkest purple in OPI...really cant tell it is purple.  Looks like Siberian Night but darker - FYI.</li>
    <li> I love OPI products and purchased this for something a little &#x27;different&#x27;. It&#x27;s very dark but has a nice hint of purple/aubergine which is nice. Makes a great pedicure.</li>
    <li> The color is so pretty and just as decribed!</li>
    <li> Ohkay, so I&#x27;m in love with this color. It&#x27;s a nice alternative to a black polish and is very cute. It&#x27;s a dark dark purple so don&#x27;t get confused thinking its black. It&#x27;s great though. Nice formula as all OPI&#x27;s are. :D</li>
    <li> Dark dark purple. Appears black in some lights. Good staying power especially paired with my seche vite top coat. Good OPI quality. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Favorite fall/winter polish. Such a great color on all skin tones. Takes 2 coats. It&#x27;s so pretty in the sunlight. It&#x27;s the deepest shade of purple. Shipped very fast. Very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> OPI polish works great for me.  Always has.  Doesn&#x27;t  chip like a lot of polishes.&lt;br /&gt;This has always been my favorite color, although one of my business clients asked me one day if I was wearing Black nail polish.  So maybe I&#x27;ve gone too dark, but I really love the color.</li>
    <li> its a favorite color and the packaging was perfect. no damages and absolutely love the color and texture is not lumpy.</li>
    <li> The OPI Lincoln Park After Dark polish is my all time favorite nail polish.  The BEST ever!!!</li>
    <li> Nice almost black color.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is hands down my favorite OPI color and I get it on my toes or fingers almost every time I get a mani/pedi.  Once in awhile I&#x27;ll go light but 9 times out of 10 if I&#x27;m going dark, this is my pick.  If you like dark colors, try it out and you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is a great color. It is a matte which I love so it doesn&#x27;t have glitter or anything like that in it!</li>
    <li> Another great color from OPI  plan on using this for fall a really pretty color very dark purple almost looks black but depending on the light goes on great really looking forward to using this a lot!</li>
    <li> Love opi and this color just rocks&lt;br /&gt;Always goes on perfect lasts soo much longer than the rest&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I keep reaching for it!</li>
    <li> I love this color and the formula is typical OPI. Great product for a good price. I would recommend getting.</li>
    <li> I had heard so much about this color, and how it is a must-have.&lt;br /&gt;So I was very excited when I received it, but it quickly changed when I put the polish on my nail.&lt;br /&gt;Application was pretty bad for me: very thick polish, almost gluey. It was streaky and really hard to get a good coverage because it wouldn&#x27;t flow on the nail.&lt;br /&gt;I had to use 2 coats, and after the second coat the polish was so dark you could barely see the purple. You would have thought it was just a black polish.&lt;br /&gt;After the second coat the texture was fine, but I am still disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I will try again and update my review if I change my mind, but I don&#x27;t think i will.</li>
    <li> I got this for a colleague.  She likes OPI and you can&#x27;t really go wrong with that -- especially on a currently unavailable color.</li>
    <li> Love the color, a very dark purple.  When dry looks black but in the correct lighting you can see the purple.</li>
    <li> I just used this product last night and found it most difficult. The polish is very thick and globs up on the brush. I added a couple of drops of paint thinner and it remained thick and globby. Not sure what to do next. I do like the color.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected! I love OPI nail polish and the color is exactly what you see online! Perfect and great for winter!</li>
    <li> From the bottle and the rave reviews I expected a nice deep purple/maroon color, but the polish is thin, so unless you can get it on perfectly you need more coats, and this causes it to be extremely dark. It&#x27;s still nice, but I feel like I have black nail polish on. In low light it even seems like it is black. I don&#x27;t love it as much as some people must, because I don&#x27;t think I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this color.  It goes on so dark, almost black yet you can still tell its purple.  Its almost like a grape jelly color.  It is perhaps a little darker than the image portrays.  That was fine by me as I love the dark colors.  It last a long time as OPI nail polish generally tends to do.  For the price on amazon you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> the picture color is very misleading!   the first coat comes out as streaky but a beautiful plumy color! but the second coat makes it turn into almost an indistinguishable black-purple! if it kept that plum color, it would have received a 5 star, but unfortunately it didnt ):  be cautious if you are planning to buy this product!</li>
    <li> It is a very nice dark purple as many other reviewers said but def.  isn&#x27;t the color that is shown, which is deceiving but it was my fault not to read previous reviews etc. And it is true that after two coats it can look black almost; especially in certain types of lighting. Anyway I am going to have to get used to it somehow or see if i can make it lighter somehow. Shipping was very accurate and other than the misleading picture I feel okay about this product. Wish i could have put two and half stars instead of two but all well.</li>
    <li> great color. Will order again</li>
    <li> My sister in law showed me this color and it was beautiful but when i ordered this on it seems darker.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite OPI color. HIGHLY recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Love OPI and love this color. It&#x27;s like a reflective black auburn? I&#x27;m not sure theres a way to describe this color.. It&#x27;s just Lincoln Park After Dark....</li>
    <li> This color is one of the best OPI colors of ALL TIME.  And of course, you can&#x27;t beat OPI quality.  Must have color!</li>
    <li> in the bottle, it looks like a deep boysenberry, or even a true blackberry. on the nail, not so much...it&#x27;s just too dark to notice that there is any purple hue to it , at all. it just looks like a dull black. i have black, glossy, \\&quot;bright\\&quot; black - i have deep purples that show as purple - this is no substitute for either.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, i got mine at a store that takes returns. You might want to check this out in a store &amp; be certain that you like it, then go for the ease of \\&quot;re-stocking\\&quot; online, where you might not be able to return.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m an OPI fan, but this one was just a big miss.</li>
    <li> Got this for my sister heard no complaints so far she got exactly the product that was advertised. Good Buy</li>
    <li> The picture is not of Lincoln Park After Dark. The real polish is dark and gorgeous. So not the same. I got the real color so I&#x27;m not mad.</li>
    <li> Polish applies fairly smoothly. Coverage is such that I need only two coats for coverage plus missed spots. Would recommend color and OPI.</li>
    <li> LOVE this color! Fancy and a MUST have for any occasion. Great coverage by the way. This is my 2nd bottle of Lincoln Park after Dark, I am just addicted to this color. Get tons of compliments and I even think it makes my nails grow faster and stronger. :)</li>
    <li> Love this color for fall!</li>
    <li> This is one of OPI&#x27;s most classic colors for a reason. There is just something so sophisticated and classy about this color. Application was great - a one-coater for me. Beware that it does look very close to being black.</li>
    <li> Love this color for my toes</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color.  A sparkly brownish black with a touch of purple.  Its not too dark, still professional but eye catching.</li>
    <li> I think that this polish is really beautiful. the formula is really great and the color is amazing. I will get a lot of use out of this one for sure!</li>
    <li> i love this color for the fall and winter. It&#x27;s dark with a slight red/purple hue in the light. It is work appropriate</li>
    <li> This is an OPI classic. It&#x27;s always my go to color, especially for the fall/winter months. I even use it on my toes in the summer! Very similar to Essie&#x27;s wicked but application/brush and its lasting power is way better. I&#x27;ll take OPI over Essie any day!</li>
    <li> 5 star for this is a great product.  The nail color is great.&lt;br /&gt;Only nail color I use.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, buy</li>
    <li> This is my favorite nail polish. I wear it all year long and I love it on toes too. I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores so I found it here!</li>
    <li> Great color arrived at destination in time and my daughter loved it.  I have considered buying it for me.  We are pink lovers.</li>
    <li> This color was amazing. When I finally got it and opened it up it actually almost looks black. So I was thinking I got the wrong thing. When I applied the polish it was so pretty. I love colors that are so dark they almost look black. It went on so smoothly and it looks great with silver glitter. I recommend this product and the seller. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a rich, beautiful color that is very becoming. At first it looks black but after looking further, it&#x27;s almost a dark brown. Brown doesn&#x27;t sound appealing but the color is really nice. OPI makes a great product; it wears well. The price was right and it arrived very quickly. I recommend this product to all.</li>
    <li> Beautiful dark and wintery color.  I wear this almost all winter long.  Like all OPI it lasts well and doesn&#x27;t chip. I saw this color on pintrest and it did not disappoint!</li>
    <li> Love this color! Two coats for a more opaque color. One coat gives a sort of dark purple clear coat.</li>
    <li> I have other dark polishes that I like but this was just not a flatterring color for my siin tone.</li>
    <li> Love the color! It&#x27;s so pretty, especially in the sun. The purple really stands out. Delivery wasn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
    <li> I go through bottle after bottle of this color because I wear it SO often. I just love it so darn much. it is a gorgeous deep berry purple with a really pretty glossy finish. it really is one of, if not THE, best color by OPI</li>
    <li> The bottle was open and had leaked onto itself in transit</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite nail color. It&#x27;s a rich dark plum almost black. I love dark colors whether it&#x27;s spring, summer, fall or winter. Highly recommend. It also came in a decent amount of time as well.</li>
    <li> I love this colour on my toes and with a top and base coat it lasts for weeks. Good coverage with 1-2 coats.</li>
    <li> If you like dark colors this is perfect.</li>
    <li> loveee this nail polish</li>
