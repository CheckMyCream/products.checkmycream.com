      <li>Looks like it has some kind of oil to it.</li>
      <li>The orange pouch is very trendy, perfect for my little sister.</li>
      <li>Cheap and falling apart before I even started using them!</li>
      <li>These brushes are fantastic!</li>
      <li>My favorite is #1, the fan brush.</li>
      <li>Oh how I love these brushes.</li>
      <li>Just what I needed and more.</li>
      <li>I love these brushes.</li>
      <li>I was definitely a bit ify on buying a brush set online, but when I received my package I couldn&#x27;t have been more delighted!</li>
      <li>The case is adorable &amp; easy to fit into any bag.</li>
      <li>Out of the 22 brushes I received in this kit, I am extremely happy with about 8 of them and while the others are mostly fillers,  i will probably still use them on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>Lastly, I adore the Orange snap shut case, very sleek and stylish, no tying up strings, folds perfectly in place after each use.</li>
      <li>Very recommended !!!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s handy &amp; decent quality.  </li>
      <li>Overall, they are good brushes and get the job done.</li>
      <li>I own several dozen makeup brushes ranging from Sigma,  Mac, Sephora to Lamora, Soho &amp; cheap drug store brands.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fun set</li>
      <li>AMAZING QUALITY, HIGH END PROFESSIONAL DESIGN.</li>
      <li>They are good quality and I have washed them many times and have no experienced any shedding</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these for professional use or beginners, they&#x27;re just fabulous!</li>
      <li>First, off the smell was horrendous...</li>
      <li>The brushes are fabulous and soft and not hush on the my skin...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the quality, especially considering what a deal I got them for!</li>
      <li>Several key brushes missing to make it a perfect set, but for the price and quality of the brushes included, not a bad choice!</li>
      <li>The brushes are so soft and the apply my makeup well!!!!</li>
      <li>They clean well, they&#x27;re inexpensive yet so soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>The fine liner brush for liquid or gel liner works wonderfully, actually, all the brushes do.</li>
      <li>Nice little economic brush set.</li>
      <li>I was really just looking for an affordable set that came with all the brushes I needed.</li>
      <li>I like this brush set very much; however the bristles on the brushes were not as soft as expected, most notably the powder brush and the blush brush are a bit on the rough side.  </li>
      <li>Other than that it was ok.</li>
      <li>The fan brush and the eye brushes are pretty good though, but a few of them have started to feel &amp;#34;wobbly&amp;#34; as though the glue is coming loose.</li>
      <li>There is NO smell on the brushes or the case that I can detect, and I have a very sensitive sniffer!</li>
      <li>The brushes are gorgeous; soft but firm enough to get the job done.</li>
      <li>This set looks very professional.</li>
      <li>No shedding &amp; so, so soft!</li>
      <li>The price is really good don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
      <li>I would definitely say these are a steal for the price because the quality is definitely professional standards.</li>
      <li>but the wrap package is tight and mars the large fan brush and crushes ruins the large fan.</li>
      <li>Also my large powered brush fell apart a few weeks after I received it.</li>

    <li> Unfortunately, one of the brushes (fan brush) broke the second time I used it.  Overall, they are good brushes and get the job done. Good for beginners.</li>
    <li> I was definitely a bit ify on buying a brush set online, but when I received my package I couldn&#x27;t have been more delighted! The brushes are so soft and the apply my makeup well!!!! I would definitely recommend this to others, and there are no funky smells from opening the package.</li>
    <li> Very nice, well put together selection of brushes. They are a quality made item. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Heads are coming off-one came off and I hadn&#x27;t even used it. Angle brush doesn&#x27;t hold its shape. I&#x27;ll stick with Mac.</li>
    <li> AMAZING QUALITY, HIGH END PROFESSIONAL DESIGN. The best set of brushes Ive ever bought, and ive gone through 4 sets in 2 years.</li>
    <li> Very recommended !!! GREAT MAKEUP TOOLS!!!</li>
    <li> Save your money. Invest in good brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the quality, especially considering what a deal I got them for! I loved all my brushes except one of them feels like it&#x27;s going to come apart. The case is adorable &amp; easy to fit into any bag.</li>
    <li> This set looks very professional. But it had a weird smell when I opened the box. Looks like it has some kind of oil to it. Anyway I will be shampooing the brushes before use so hopefully the smell should go away. Otherwise a great product. The orange pouch is very trendy, perfect for my little sister.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fun set but the wrap package is tight and mars the large fan brush and crushes ruins the large fan. The snaps interfere with the proper storage of the fan brush</li>
    <li> Bought this set because I was tired of paying $40 per brush for premium name brand brushes! I was leery because the price was so low, but thought what the heck, I&#x27;ll give it a try. I am SO glad I did!!! These brushes are fantastic! There is NO smell on the brushes or the case that I can detect, and I have a very sensitive sniffer! The brushes are gorgeous; soft but firm enough to get the job done. If you are looking for a really good set of brushes with great variety and without breaking the bank, these are them!!!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I recommend these brushes to anyone trying to build their makeup kit or just need inexpensive brushes. They are good quality and I have washed them many times and have no experienced any shedding</li>
    <li> Purchased this set for school. I was really just looking for an affordable set that came with all the brushes I needed. The quality of these brushes surpassed my expectations. I almost don&#x27;t want to use it for school. I especially love the orange case it comes with. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Does it&#x27;s job.  No hairs fall out.</li>
    <li> The brushes are fabulous and soft and not hush on the my skin...I have washed them and they are still in good condition.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes for my mother and she loves them and the bright orange case!</li>
    <li> Cheap and falling apart before I even started using them!</li>
    <li> Great product brushes feel amazing</li>
    <li> I own several dozen makeup brushes ranging from Sigma,  Mac, Sephora to Lamora, Soho &amp; cheap drug store brands.  These Shany brushes are really good deal.  Out of the 22 brushes I received in this kit, I am extremely happy with about 8 of them and while the others are mostly fillers,  i will probably still use them on a regular basis. My favorite is #1, the fan brush. The sponge brush #20 came broken,  but who uses those anyway?  I do HIGHLY recommend washing these brushes thoroughly before first use as they have a weird powdery substance in and on the hairs. The orange case it comes in isn&#x27;t the prettiest but it&#x27;s handy &amp; decent quality.  I would definitely recommend these brushes for the price to use as a backup, a travel set,  or a starter. They are by no means equal to Mac, Sephora or Sigma but  still a good purchase in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Nice little economic brush set. Several key brushes missing to make it a perfect set, but for the price and quality of the brushes included, not a bad choice!</li>
    <li> I gave two stars becuase two brushes were used, freaking gross.</li>
    <li> First, off the smell was horrendous... I had to air it out outside after I sprayed Febreeze over it (not on it). The concealer brush head was off and the fan brush bristle was bent.... Other than that it was ok. I did went a head and wash the brushes before I used them.</li>
    <li> Omg I&#x27;m in love with these brushes! No shedding &amp; so, so soft! The fine liner brush for liquid or gel liner works wonderfully, actually, all the brushes do. I would definitely say these are a steal for the price because the quality is definitely professional standards. Lastly, I adore the Orange snap shut case, very sleek and stylish, no tying up strings, folds perfectly in place after each use. I highly recommend these for professional use or beginners, they&#x27;re just fabulous!</li>
    <li> Oh how I love these brushes. They clean well, they&#x27;re inexpensive yet so soft to the touch. My only issue is that the glue on 2 of them came loose and I had to reglue them. Otherwise for everyday use they have held up well and I will be repurchase ngh them.</li>
    <li> I like this brush set very much; however the bristles on the brushes were not as soft as expected, most notably the powder brush and the blush brush are a bit on the rough side.  Also my large powered brush fell apart a few weeks after I received it. The fan brush and the eye brushes are pretty good though, but a few of them have started to feel &amp;#34;wobbly&amp;#34; as though the glue is coming loose. I take care when I am washing them to make sure no water gets above the metal so it is a bit disappointing.</li>
    <li> The brushes are in fact very soft but that is all I can say due to false advertisement. The title has these brushes as pony and goat bristles. What i received was pony and raccoon brush kit. The price is really good don&#x27;t get me wrong BUT the reason I decided on this product was because of the description that was given.</li>
