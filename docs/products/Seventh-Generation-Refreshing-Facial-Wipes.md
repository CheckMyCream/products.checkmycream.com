### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very happy with these.</li>
      <li>And best of all, they&#x27;re made in America.</li>
      <li>They also smell wonderful!</li>
      <li>In addition to a pleasant scent, the quality of the cloth is superb.</li>
      <li>The wipes do remove makeup and dirt very nicely.</li>
      <li>The mandarin smell is really nice, very pleasant.  </li>
      <li>They feel good on the skin, and I could feel a difference as I wiped.</li>
      <li>good size and leave my skin feeling clean and dewy, best of all&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love them!  </li>
      <li>Ended up ordering 3 more so that I won&#x27;t run out!  </li>
      <li>They have a wonderful relaxing smell that is also very calming.</li>
      <li>A nice product.</li>
      <li>So, while I would have loved to be able to use these, the search is still on.</li>
      <li>I honestly cannot think of one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>These have a nice scent and they take off what they are supposed to take off.  </li>
      <li>They have a light &#x27;feel good&#x27; kind of scent.</li>
      <li>Most importantly for cleansing wipes, they do a good job of cleaning my face, taking off makeup, leaving my skin feeling nice without being either oily or too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love Seventh Generation and was thrilled to see these.</li>
      <li>mandarin orange scent when you take them out of the package that&lt;br /&gt;quickly dissipates and leaves a pleasant clean smell.  </li>
      <li>These are excellent when you&#x27;re gross at the gym, but want to use your own shower when you get home.  </li>
      <li>They seemed to do a good job of removing my makeup and make my face feel clean.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic!  </li>
      <li>There is quite a bit of solution in the package, more than others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>is why I love them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Seventh Generation products-</li>
      <li>This are my favorite brand of face wipes.</li>
      <li>love the mandarin scent.</li>
      <li>What I really love about them is the smell.</li>
      <li>These are refreshing.  </li>
      <li>On the plus side, they have a nice, light fragrance that did not trigger my allergies.</li>
      <li>but they aren&#x27;t a love for me.  </li>
      <li>Nice to keep in the truck to clean you</li>
      <li>They do a pretty good job of removing makeup and don&#x27;t leave my face feeling slimy or stripped.</li>
      <li>The cloths are handy to have on the go, or even by the sofa or your desk for a quick refresher, and I don&#x27;t feel the need to go and slap on moisturizer immediately afterwards.</li>
      <li>They are very soft and great at removing make-up, even mascara.</li>
      <li>They do a good job at removing makeup and making your face feel fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>Not too much lotion or cleaning product on it and smells good.</li>
      <li>honestly clean my face better than toner does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are easy to use.  </li>
      <li>These facial wipes are great for refreshing yourself or removing make up.</li>
      <li>and I was blown away by the scent - sweet, refreshing, but not over powering.</li>
      <li>Looks like it cleans fine.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent, which is fresh and very mild...</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Seventh Generation(tm) from Smiley360</li>
      <li>/&gt;Added plus: my daughter can use these, as they are nut free.</li>
      <li>I received a free sample of Seventh Generation(tm)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Seventh Generation products for a while now and enjoy its products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The label claims that the product is alcohol free and</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a better product out there that is as close to natural, effective, and as affordable as these wipes.  </li>
      <li>I also use them to clean my kid&#x27;s faces once in awhile.  </li>
      <li>With Seventh Generation I feel clean and refreshed, not like I need to throw water over my face thus defeating the purpose of a convenient wipe.</li>
      <li>So then I went to the Seventh Generation website for more information and found this \\&quot;Treat your face to a gentle, thorough clean whenever you like.</li>
      <li>I really like my burt&#x27;s bees wipes much better.  </li>
      <li>I love them that much that I want to be ahead on my supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was full of \\&quot;unpronounceable\\&quot; words, so I started \\&quot;googling\\&quot; them.</li>
      <li>They smell a little strong, but the cleaning power is great.</li>
      <li>The cloths are soft, and really the only way it could be better is if they came out warm! :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;They smell pretty good when you first open the package, and it&#x27;s not an overwhelming smell.</li>
      <li>I rinsed it off quickly, and within 10-15 minutes the redness was gone.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the solution drying out too quickly.  </li>
      <li>The real test would in warm weather when the face gets very oily.</li>
      <li>Keep these in the fridge for a quick pick-me-up.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The smell of them is very strong and smells like something I would clean the bathroom with, not a facial cleanser!  </li>
      <li>these little wipes smell great with the orange scent.</li>
      <li>primarily use the wipes to remove eye makeup, as I don&#x27;t wear much foundation (if at all) or anything on my cheeks.  </li>
      <li>While it made for a fun selfie, it&#x27;s a wee bit</li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees (white tea) was the best out of the four options I&#x27;d tried above, for removing makeup and not irritating my skin/eyes</li>
      <li>real bummer for me is that I would love to be able to find some more natural facial items instead of what I&#x27;ve been using - but most of them don&#x27;t work with my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>packaging is simple, not overdone, but seals nicely</li>
      <li>The cloths have a very gentle/subtle scent (I&#x27;m very sensitive to strong odors), so that was a huge plus for me.</li>
      <li>The package is not too large, fairly standard for those types that don&#x27;t come in their own large plastic bin, so it&#x27;s not a problem to stick a package in a suitcase when traveling.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I do a lot of baking, and that often translates to a rushed, hot kitchen.</li>
      <li>I loves these wipes because they have a low toxicity rating, they work well at taking off make up, and they are refreshing to my skin without burning.  </li>
      <li>face on a hot day.</li>
      <li>you really can&#x27;t beat them!</li>
      <li>One time, rushing around to get 4 yogurt cakes out it got so hot</li>
      <li>Well, before you even pull out a wipe, as soon as the package is open, you can smell the mandarin scent, and I really love this smell.</li>
      <li>Seventh Generation Refreshing Facial Wipes are a bit too dry and they do not dispense easily.</li>
      <li>Like another reviewer, my skin gets irritated easily by certain products, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems at all with this product.</li>
      <li>They did not irritate/burn my skin at all, and did a pretty decent job removing eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>Reasonably priced too.  </li>
      <li>These wipes make my morning routine much easier and faster&lt;</li>
      <li>wipe itself is very soft.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I try to avoid a full-on wash in the morning, because I do one at night and too much</li>
      <li>I do really like these</li>
      <li>It is rather large too - you could include your neck and hands in your refreshing wipe down with some product to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was hoping that these facial wipes would fit the bill - just enough to get a quick refresh before my moisturizer.</li>
      <li>like that these wipes are quite large, allowing for lots of cleaning area, not making me feel like I&#x27;m trying to clean my face with something the size of a square of toilet</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to feel refreshed.  </li>
      <li>These facial wipes just have a light fresh citrus smell and I can use them in the same room with him without him getting a headache.</li>
      <li>Once you begin wiping your face, there is also a bit of a \\&quot;baby wipes\\&quot; generic scent, but it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
      <li>Seventh Generation is a reputable company;  I look forward to trying some of their other new hand soaps and lotions.</li>
      <li>They are much drier than the Neutrogena cloths I normally use, to the extent that I had to struggle to remove my mascara with the cloth from the newly opened package.</li>
      <li>Many times natural products contain things like Shea oil or butter, or macadamia or other nut derivitives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I loved that my skin did not feel tight and dry after usage.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The wipes are moist enough to guarantee a thorough cleaning and they have a delicate citrus aroma that is pleasant to use.  </li>
      <li>My body is very sensitive</li>
      <li>First off I have never been a fan of facial wipes, however these have changed my view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use them after my workouts, not so much to remove makeup.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s refreshing, leaving a subtle scente to your face &amp; neck area</li>
      <li>They smell nice, but feel very dry and a little greasy out of the package.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I loves these wipes because they have a low toxicity rating, they work well at taking off make up, and they are refreshing to my skin without burning.  I don&#x27;t feel a need to rinse my face off with water afterwards like I did with other brands.</li>
    <li> A nice product. Not too much lotion or cleaning product on it and smells good. Just enough to wipe down the skin when needed.</li>
    <li> I love Seventh Generation products- I use several of their cleaning products, dish soap, and laundry detergent- so I felt reasonably assured that I would like these facial wipes.  The smell of them is very strong and smells like something I would clean the bathroom with, not a facial cleanser!  Even my husband noted when I opened the package that he could smell them from several feet away.  They seemed to do a good job of removing my makeup and make my face feel clean.  But the smell is overpowering and I will not be buying these again.</li>
    <li> This are my favorite brand of face wipes. They are not drying, they remove makeup and oils, and your skin feels refreshed afterwards. Not sticky or greasy like some brands. They also smell wonderful!</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  Love them!  I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to feel refreshed.  They have a wonderful relaxing smell that is also very calming.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of seventh generation products but this one irritated my skin immediately after use. It started burning and I quickly had to wash my face with very cold water.  I even applied ice and was scared that I would break out by morning.  I was really shocked since I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and can use just about anything.  Maybe it was the Mandarin but I won&#x27;t try these facial wipes again.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed by these! They smell nice, but feel very dry and a little greasy out of the package. They are much drier than the Neutrogena cloths I normally use, to the extent that I had to struggle to remove my mascara with the cloth from the newly opened package. Shortly after removing my makeup with the wipe, I realized my face had turned an alarming, blotchy red color, and felt a little hot/inflamed. I rinsed my face with water and it settled down after a couple of minutes, but seriously? I do not typically have sensitive skin. I am thinking that the citrus oils probably cause the irritation, but who knows? I hate to throw out a brand new package, but out it will go!</li>
    <li> I use them after my workouts, not so much to remove makeup.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s refreshing, leaving a subtle scente to your face &amp; neck area</li>
    <li> My body is very sensitive so I try to stick with organic/natural products whenever I can.  I&#x27;ve been using Seventh Generation products for a while now and enjoy its products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased these facial wipes (Tangerine), after having used the following in the last couple years:&lt;br /&gt;- Burt&#x27;s Bees (white tee)&lt;br /&gt;- Burt&#x27;s Bees (grapefruit)&lt;br /&gt;- Burt&#x27;s Bees (sensitive)&lt;br /&gt;- Say Yes to Cucumbers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I primarily use the wipes to remove eye makeup, as I don&#x27;t wear much foundation (if at all) or anything on my cheeks.  Burt&#x27;s Bees (white tea) was the best out of the four options I&#x27;d tried above, for removing makeup and not irritating my skin/eyes--though, it sometimes stung just a bit; Say Yes to Cucumbers absolutely burned my eyes like crazy.  After a couple uses, I had to quit--I literally feared going blind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I found SG&#x27;s wipes on Amazon.  They did not irritate/burn my skin at all, and did a pretty decent job removing eye makeup.  I love the scent, which is fresh and very mild...it doesn&#x27;t smell artificial at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a better product out there that is as close to natural, effective, and as affordable as these wipes.  For these reasons, these wipes are now my go-to brand.</li>
    <li> Seventh Generation Refreshing Facial Wipes are a bit too dry and they do not dispense easily. On the plus side, they have a nice, light fragrance that did not trigger my allergies.</li>
    <li> I like that they don&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals.  Reasonably priced too.  Seventh Generation is a reputable company;  I look forward to trying some of their other new hand soaps and lotions.</li>
    <li> I am a stay at home mom and I don&#x27;t always get to take a shower in the morning.  These make me feel refreshed.  I also use them to clean my kid&#x27;s faces once in awhile.  The ingredients are way less harsh than regular baby wipes that I used to use.</li>
    <li> I like that these are mostly natural. They do a pretty good job of removing makeup and don&#x27;t leave my face feeling slimy or stripped. What I really love about them is the smell. My husband is very sensitive to odors especially chemical ones. These facial wipes just have a light fresh citrus smell and I can use them in the same room with him without him getting a headache.</li>
    <li> These facial wipes are great for refreshing yourself or removing make up. However, my facial skin does feel somewhat sticky after using them.</li>
    <li> theses irritated my skin, so I gave them to my sister, and they made her face all red too....</li>
    <li> I like almost everything about these wipes, especially compared to some others I&#x27;ve tried.  Most importantly for cleansing wipes, they do a good job of cleaning my face, taking off makeup, leaving my skin feeling nice without being either oily or too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that these wipes are quite large, allowing for lots of cleaning area, not making me feel like I&#x27;m trying to clean my face with something the size of a square of toilet paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I like the smell, but with a caveat.  The mandarin smell is really nice, very pleasant.  However, there is another smell that seems a little odd and unpleasant to me.  I think this is from the disposable cloths themselves and not from the solution on them.  That smell is the only negative for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is simple, not overdone, but seals nicely so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the solution drying out too quickly.  The seal is hard plastic rather than those little sticky flaps that stop sticking after a few uses.  There is quite a bit of solution in the package, more than others I&#x27;ve tried.  The package is not too large, fairly standard for those types that don&#x27;t come in their own large plastic bin, so it&#x27;s not a problem to stick a package in a suitcase when traveling.  The simplicity and ease of use, plus the cleansing ability, makes these wipes a winner in my book.</li>
    <li> I love Seventh Generation and was thrilled to see these. They are very soft and great at removing make-up, even mascara. I have extra sensitive skin but these did not dry out my skin or break me out, my skin was actually left soft. The mandarin smell is very nice, not strong, very subtle. Besides all that for $3 a pack you really can&#x27;t beat them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different types of cleansing cloths and was always left with some dissatisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;Either the cloths weren&#x27;t big enough, left an unpleasant tightness on&lt;br /&gt;my skin, or were too heavily scented, these disposable little cloths have a&lt;br /&gt;nice mandarin orange scent when you take them out of the package that&lt;br /&gt;quickly dissipates and leaves a pleasant clean smell.  They are also&lt;br /&gt;a good size and leave my skin feeling clean and dewy, best of all&lt;br /&gt;they don&#x27;t dry out before the package is finished.</li>
    <li> If anyone can attest to a facial product being gentle it is me. I am on the downhill side of the 60&#x27;s and have found hardly any skin products that I can tolerate.  Seventh Generation Facial Wipes did the job of cleaning my face without leaving me with a red, itchy after effect.  The label claims that the product is alcohol free and hypoallergenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes are moist enough to guarantee a thorough cleaning and they have a delicate citrus aroma that is pleasant to use.  And best of all, they&#x27;re made in America.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin. I try to avoid a full-on wash in the morning, because I do one at night and too much gives me flakes and tightness. I was hoping that these facial wipes would fit the bill - just enough to get a quick refresh before my moisturizer. Unfortunately, I cannot use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They smell pretty good when you first open the package, and it&#x27;s not an overwhelming smell. They feel good on the skin, and I could feel a difference as I wiped. However, within 3 minutes of using the wipes, my face began to burn and I ended up with red blotches all over the place. I rinsed it off quickly, and within 10-15 minutes the redness was gone. However, it&#x27;s not an experience I will be looking to repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real bummer for me is that I would love to be able to find some more natural facial items instead of what I&#x27;ve been using - but most of them don&#x27;t work with my sensitive skin. So, while I would have loved to be able to use these, the search is still on.</li>
    <li> These are excellent when you&#x27;re gross at the gym, but want to use your own shower when you get home.  Just use on face and trouble spots, and you&#x27;re fresh enough for the ride home.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of facial wipes for a mid-day freshening or a make up remover at the end of the day.  I&#x27;ve used different brands as well as baby wipes to do the job.  They all take off make up and dirt, but only Seventh Generation wipes leaves your face feeling like it was gently wiped, not vigorously scrubbed.  I loved that my skin did not feel tight and dry after usage.  Normally with this type of product you have to wipe thoroughly and sometimes wiping multiple times to get all the dirt off your face.  I highly recommend this product to anyone, especially those with combination skin!  I have very sensitive dry skin with spots of oily and this evens it all out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Seventh Generation(tm) from Smiley360</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried facial cleansing cloths before, so I can&#x27;t compare to other products - but that said I did like what I sampled here. The cloths have a very gentle/subtle scent (I&#x27;m very sensitive to strong odors), so that was a huge plus for me. Like another reviewer, my skin gets irritated easily by certain products, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems at all with this product. The cloths are handy to have on the go, or even by the sofa or your desk for a quick refresher, and I don&#x27;t feel the need to go and slap on moisturizer immediately afterwards. This is a product I will use and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell. Looks like it cleans fine.  The real test would in warm weather when the face gets very oily.</li>
    <li> I like Seventh Generation products but this is a disappointment.  It has a very unpleasant smell to it.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> These are refreshing.  love the mandarin scent. I&#x27;ve tried others and have had to use three wipes to get all my make up off. I only use two or sometimes one of these.  They do a good job at removing makeup and making your face feel fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> First off I have never been a fan of facial wipes, however these have changed my view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is why I love them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They take off old smeared black eye makeup like nobody&#x27;s business!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can wipe your eye lids and they are gentle enough not to make your eyes burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effortlessly they remove everything off of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipe itself is very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mandarin scent is energizing in the morning.  I feel awake and refreshed after using these in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They honestly clean my face better than toner does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to use.  These wipes make my morning routine much easier and faster&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes don&#x27;t dry out in the container, nor or they too wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons about this product??  None.  I honestly cannot think of one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these for teens also.  Matter of fact I initially had them in mine for my daughter.  They have never made my face red and my skin tends to be on the sensitive side.  Ended up ordering 3 more so that I won&#x27;t run out!  I love them that much that I want to be ahead on my supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I have not tried these in lavender, but I have tried other seventh generation products in lavender and the mandarin, in my opinion, is the one to opt for.  So if you can&#x27;t decide which scent, go for the mandarin, just trust me on this one. Especially if you are buying them to use in the morning.</li>
    <li> I am picky about my facial wipes.&lt;br /&gt;I had never tried this brand before, and they are &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; but certainly nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy them again, I will stick with my regular brand that I know that I like so well.</li>
    <li> I already like Seventh Generation brand before receiving these wipes, because I know they are a company that cares about what goes into their products and our environment, however I have to say I was shocked when I first read the ingredient label. It was full of \\&quot;unpronounceable\\&quot; words, so I started \\&quot;googling\\&quot; them. My fears were all for naught because each ingredient is plant-based! So then I went to the Seventh Generation website for more information and found this \\&quot;Treat your face to a gentle, thorough clean whenever you like. Gentle facial cleansing cloths are infused with 100% plant-based cleansers that leave delicate facial skin feeling nurtured and healthy. Choose Mandarin to refresh, Lavender to soothe.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so far I&#x27;m sold, but how is the actual product? Well, before you even pull out a wipe, as soon as the package is open, you can smell the mandarin scent, and I really love this smell. The wipes do remove makeup and dirt very nicely. Once you begin wiping your face, there is also a bit of a \\&quot;baby wipes\\&quot; generic scent, but it&#x27;s not bad at all. The cloths are soft, and really the only way it could be better is if they came out warm! :) Seriously, though, I really like this product because of the three reasons I stated:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. All natural product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Wipes are soft, do what they are meant to do; cleanse your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added plus: my daughter can use these, as they are nut free. Many times natural products contain things like Shea oil or butter, or macadamia or other nut derivitives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these Seventh Generation facial wipes.</li>
    <li> Keep these in the fridge for a quick pick-me-up.&lt;br /&gt;I do a lot of baking, and that often translates to a rushed, hot kitchen. In the hot summer months it can be brutal. One time, rushing around to get 4 yogurt cakes out it got so hot I smeared cold yogurt on my face! While it made for a fun selfie, it&#x27;s a wee bit messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with these in the fridge, you can get a 10 second refresh and get back to what you&#x27;re doing. They have a light &#x27;feel good&#x27; kind of scent. Very happy with these.</li>
    <li> I do really like these but they aren&#x27;t a love for me.  I really like my burt&#x27;s bees wipes much better.  These have a nice scent and they take off what they are supposed to take off.  They aren&#x27;t too thin or too thick.  I would recommend them but they just didn&#x27;t WOW me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure my face has felt so clean before as with using these wipes.  They smell a little strong, but the cleaning power is great.</li>
    <li> these little wipes smell great with the orange scent. Nice to keep in the truck to clean you face on a hot day.</li>
    <li> I have used facial cleansing wipes for years, and of all the brands I have tried Seventh Generation is one of my favorites. I received a free sample of Seventh Generation(tm) Mandarin facial wipes from Smiley360 and I was blown away by the scent - sweet, refreshing, but not over powering. One of my complaints about the other brands that I have used is that the scents are rather soapy and tend to leave a residue. With Seventh Generation I feel clean and refreshed, not like I need to throw water over my face thus defeating the purpose of a convenient wipe. Since receiving my sample, I have purchased the Lavender wipes and that scent is just as pleasing. In addition to a pleasant scent, the quality of the cloth is superb. It is tough enough to handle the dirtiest faces, but gentle enough to leave soft skin after you are done. It is rather large too - you could include your neck and hands in your refreshing wipe down with some product to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend either scent depending on your mood, and the quality cannot be beat.</li>
