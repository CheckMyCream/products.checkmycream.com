<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this stuff.  This is my second bottle.  It feels very light when you put it on and it smells great.  My teenage son often comments that I smell good when he gives me a kiss on the cheek goodnight.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good cream . Yet to see benefits. Smells good</li>
    <li> Not oily. Natural. Hydrating.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot so far. My face is nice and smooth. My skin looks and is healthy.</li>
    <li> This is a large bottle of face lotion; it&#x27;s lasted me almost six months and there is a lot more! I used in sparingly during the winter and early spring because the lotion is thin and it just wasn&#x27;t enough. I&#x27;m 30 years old and have mostly normal skin, but our Midwestern winters just require a thicker face cream, especially for the nighttime. Even putting it on twice after washing my face left my skin dry and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of that, I use the lotion both in the morning and at night. I use it after washing my face with the Alaffia EveryDay Coconut face wash.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, now that it is hot and humid, this lotion is perfect for my skin. It rubs in easily; in the morning, it is fully absorbed by the time I put on my makeup. It doesn&#x27;t cause my face to break out either.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the better ingredients, too.</li>
    <li> for the price you cannot beat it.</li>
    <li> Did not like the smell</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. However it just didn&#x27;t do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: great coconut smell, a lot of product for the price, not a super thick consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It clogged my pores, not just the little blackheads, but that acne that&#x27;s deep in your pores and is red all around it. Yeah it did that. As soon as I switched off the Alaffia cleanser and moisturizer, my acne began to heal within a day. What a bummer. :(</li>
    <li> can something be both light and rich at the same time? because that is what this is. my skin drinks it up and looks better for it</li>
    <li> The only thing that works on my sensitive skin...</li>
    <li> I am just in love with this brand.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews and enjoying other Alaffia products I purchased this cream to be used as a day cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light enough to soak in quickly but still get the job done.  I just use a powder foundation on top of it, so I can&#x27;t promise it would work as well for heavier makeups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a bit of a natural fragrance, which I enjoy quite a bit despite the fact that I typically dislike anything that has a smell.  The fragrance is fresh smelling and fades as soon as the lotion absorbs and you aren&#x27;t left with a perfumey face all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can across this product looking to use it as a day cream as well as, or instead of a night cream, I can say that it work great for me!</li>
    <li> Smells great and feels silky. I will use this forever. I&#x27;m glad I found it</li>
    <li> I have really come to love the Alaffia products! We are making our household more chemical free and natural. I love coconut and how great it is for your skin and hair. This company offers such a great variety of things. I just bought this night cream, among other products for my face and skin, and I love them so far. They absorb nicely into the skin and there is no greasy residue! This night cream has a nice lavender scent! My skin feels great! I would recommend these for sure!</li>
    <li> I love these products. I was scared to switch because my skin is extremely sensitive to everything. This works perfect on my sensitive skin. I use it at night &amp; during the day under makeup.</li>
    <li> I love it. I will buy it from now on. Thank you for making &amp; selling this awesome lotion.</li>
    <li> Love it, even my husband likes it for after shave</li>
    <li> Just starting using product. but so far so good. Not heavy or greasy. Smells so good, very light and calming, great for bedtime.</li>
    <li> I have used this for several months now after making the switch to all-natural skincare. My skin has never been happier! Definitely worth a little more $ compared to conventional, CHEMICAL skincare which keeps your skin dry and breakout-prone! Haven&#x27;t had more than a minor, &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34; hormonal breakout since I&#x27;ve been using EDC products. Make the switch, splurge a little, and enjoy how HAPPY your skin will be!</li>
    <li> Great product with natural products that&#x27;s paraben free.</li>
    <li> Update: So after i wrote my initial review below....i realized this broke me out. Then i stopped for a while and started again , still broke me out. So i left it alone for 6 months and in between that time lots of things made me break out so i thought id give it another shot bc the bottle is so big and i dont want to waste it...yet i broke out agin. I hate the fact that this happens. I think it&#x27;s the coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its nice smelling and smooth. Makes my akin feel good, and I feel good about buying it fair trade and such. Love it.</li>
