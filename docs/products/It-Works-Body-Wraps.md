      <li>However, they stayed on securely and I was able to wear them when I worked out.</li>
      <li>You wear it and secure with either the tape that they put on when you donate blood or use plastic wrap you wear for an hour or more or all night..  </li>
      <li>Just do the original routines like, excercising, drinking water, and eating healthy.</li>
      <li>and I saw great results with the diy wrap and barely saw anything with</li>
      <li>and I can tell I huge difference in my waist&amp; the amount of fat</li>

      <li>THE RIGHT WAY EAT HEALTHY EXCERSISE</li>
      <li>and I am very pleased so far!</li>
      <li>The wraps also have to be stored in a cool spot again not guaranteed here.</li>

      <li>Arrived on time and thats the only good thing about the product.</li>
      <li>A full treatment is a box of four wraps.</li>
      <li>YOU KNOW that one wrap is actually Â¼ of a FULL treatment?</li>
      <li>A full treatment is a box of FOUR (4) wraps.</li>

      <li>You get my cell phone, email, Facebook (English and Spanish) whatever it takes for me to help you on the road to better HEALTH and a BEAUTIFUL looking</li>
      <li>Also you can find it cheaper when you sign up with a distributor elsewhere for their loyal customer discount but means you have to deal with monthly shipments.</li>

      <li>I address with my clients BEFORE, DURING and AFTER wrapping them because I follow the company&#x27;s policies and my clients have tremendous success!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>less then a hour is great for me.</li>
      <li>They were delivered within 2 days, but they were hardly worth it.</li>
      <li>to pay 100 bucks for a box of wraps is so worth it.</li>
      <li>Wanted to try it before buying a full set, glad I didn&#x27;t waste any more money than I did.</li>
      <li>It DOESN&#x27;T work, maybe because I didn&#x27;t purchase the special wrapping material, used Glad Sticky Wrap (not  saran wrap) and left it on for the night......</li>
      <li>Do you know which soaps to stay away from right BEFORE wrapping?</li>
      <li>Anyone who said didn&#x27;t work wasn&#x27;t doing it right probably.</li>

    <li> Beware!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you want fresh wraps from a real distributor that can help you use these the CORRECT way, contact me! Wraps dry out! If any of these are over a year old... Beware!! They won&#x27;t work!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunteritworks@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;My personal leg results below!</li>
    <li> Does not work...don&#x27;t wast your money like i did</li>
    <li> It worked I was really surprised lol</li>
    <li> Never buy online through Amazon for it works products! You can not guarantee the freshness they could be expired! I have been with it works for 3 years and have never seen that bottle if that tells you how old those are!!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews but still ordered because i know products like this doesnt work for everyone. It felt like it was doing something but i Didnt see a difference after i took it off. I waited till the next morning.. still nothing. Waste</li>
    <li> I have before me the catalog with all their products.  What I find odd is that the before and after photo of the person using Lip and Eye product has been retouched. I placed A to E marks on the darken eye photo and POOF, the now full of light photo shows, shows up with the same area I marked...the eyebrows.....perfect match.  This tells me, the product used does not work, because why do a retouch?  Funny about the \\&quot;miracle photo\\&quot;, is the the iris of the eye is in the middle of the eye socket position, which means they pull the skin down, so the wrinkles would not appear and did touch up.&lt;br /&gt;Even on the photo here, where it show a female with fat stomach..wearing black pants then after photo she is in jeans, you can see where the side of the body was smooth out.  Also look at the lady with the legs and white shoes.  In both photos, the shoe on the left foot is in the same position.&lt;br /&gt;The excuse the company will use, is that customer&#x27;s turn those photos in.  The customer is their own people.  Folks...look at the photos and see slight differences.  Best thing for you to do is watch what you eat and exercise.  Use your money to buy quality food, not fast fad weight loss gimmicks  which are a myth.  If it&#x27;s too good to be true............</li>
    <li> Did not find it to work</li>
    <li> Would give a zero if I could. Wanted to try it before buying a full set, glad I didn&#x27;t waste any more money than I did.</li>
    <li> it does NOTHING. Do not waste your money.  We all need to learnn to stop eating fat, sugar and unhealthy food if we want to get rid of a muffin top. I am still worrking on mine. :(</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me after 1 application.</li>
    <li> It Works products are amazing but is against compliance to be sold online. Purchase from www.premowrapper.com, these could be expired, etc! Contact me there for questions or help also.</li>
    <li> Please everyone read what I have to say. This annoying girl I went to middle school with randomly started spamming Facebook with this &amp;#34;it works!&amp;#34; Crap. Non stop posts about losing weight and how great this stupid expensive product is. I go to the Facebook page of the site and see a bunch of girls all posting about it &amp;#34;changing their life&#x27;s&amp;#34; and how they &amp;#34;lost over fifty pounds&amp;#34; with it. I started clicking all of their pages and they are all &amp;#34;distributors&amp;#34; of this bogus scam. All the good reviews are faked by &amp;#34;distributors&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t know what they are getting out of it, maybe some kind of discount but there is absolutely no way Saran Wrap will burn fat, physically impossible. I think the company tells them to post a bunch of good reviews and has them post it all over their Facebook page in order to receive discounts. If you go to these girls pages you will see how brainwashed they are. You will only lose weight by burning more calories than you eat, not by putting plastic on your stomach. The owner of this &amp;#34;company&amp;#34; should be arrested for the cult like scam. Please buy a pair of running shoes instead of this scam.</li>
    <li> This is wasted money, don&#x27;t buy this, it doesn&#x27;t work at all..ð¡ð¡ð¡</li>
    <li> Didnt work at all :(!</li>
    <li> The lotion was dried out and chunky on this wrap!</li>
    <li> My friend was a distributor &amp; I bought one from her, &amp; the never next day after I used it I had to get an emergency appendectomy because my appendix became super inflamed over night.. Can&#x27;t be sure it was the product.. But either way didn&#x27;t have any positive results</li>
    <li> For stars only bc I expect to loose more.</li>
    <li> The body wrap did absolutely nothing.  No inches gone or tightened skin at all.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Does not work well, suppose you would need more than one treatment</li>
    <li> This wrap doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s all a mind trick. When the wrap is applied you feel a stingy feeling that makes it feel like it&#x27;s working, maybe some type of cream for the skin. I wouldn&#x27;t spend my money on this item again. There is no way over losing weight. Just do the original routines like, excercising, drinking water, and eating healthy. That&#x27;s about it, but there is no way around losing weight.</li>
    <li> It actually worked! I can&#x27;t believe my eyes!</li>
    <li> I had read one lady had done this and where she didn&#x27;t lose any inches it helped get rid of her stretch marks. It did neither for me. Waste of 20 bucks.</li>
    <li> These products rock!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying from the same lady for a while and she rocks and is beyond helpful.&lt;br /&gt;You should only buy these items from an actual It Works distributor.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t know one,  my girls site and info is at Prettylittlewraps.com</li>
    <li> Violation of Policy or not some people don&#x27;t have 99.00 + s&amp;h to try a product that may or may not work for them. Not everyone knows a distributor either. Wrap came in a sealed package and wasn&#x27;t expired, dried up, or used. Directions for the wrap were on the package. I understand this is for generating a revenue but why be greedy? Posting all over people&#x27;s sales because you want to steal their customers and generate your own revenue. These wraps were already PAID FOR by the seller. Once they OWN them what they choose to do with them should be their business. I really don&#x27;t understand how selling a product through Amazon who has very STRICT seller policies is a bad thing. Sorry you aren&#x27;t turning a profit off my purchase but thanks for your extensive description. I knew exactly what to do. It was great paying 20 bucks to try 1 wrap to see if it works for me.</li>
    <li> loved this thing in the army and to get that tummy fat that just wont be exersiced away this works wonders</li>
    <li> What a surprise!! Loved it!!</li>
    <li> This may not be a fair rating just because of me but as usual, I was hopeful that something would help jump-start losing my bulges and as usual, this didn&#x27;t.  Perhaps it works for others (I hope so).</li>
    <li> This was okay maybe if I used them more than once I would have had bette results</li>
    <li> YOU ARE BEING RIPPED OFF!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It Works Global, the company that created and markets the Ultimate Body Applicator, SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITS distributors from selling their products on Amazon, Ebay, Craigslist as well as other places such as these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ultimate Body Applicator is made with ALL NATURAL ingredients and has a shelf life. When items are ordered through these venues, by sellers who are violating company policies, there is no guarantee as to the purchase or expiration date(s) of the product. In addition, due to the natural makeup of the ingredients, these products need to be stored in cool (not refrigerated) temperature. There is no guarantee as to where the seller obtained the items or how they were stored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, is that our company is designed to provide ongoing support. We are a team - a FAMILY. When someone purchases through me, I guide them EVERY step of the way. If at all possible, the first time, I will wrap the client myself (I&#x27;ve done it on the phone and via text as well). I will explain the ingredients, the way the product is supposed to be applied, the way the product is designed to work, the way the product may affect the body, what to expect from the Ultimate Body Applicator after 1st application (1/4 of a FULL treatment) and what they need to do to have the GREATEST success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR INSTANCE...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DID YOU KNOW that one wrap is actually Â¼ of a FULL treatment? A full treatment is a box of FOUR (4) wraps. DID YOU KNOW that the wrap continues to work for 72 hours after you put it on? DID YOU KNOW that you need to drink LOTS of water while wearing it, (preferably) before wearing the wrap and during the 72 hours it continues to work? Half your body weight in ounces is the right amount. DID YOU KNOW that you are supposed to measure in 3 places before, after and then in 72 hours after applying the wrap to track your results better? DID YOU KNOW it is highly recommended you take BEFORE and AFTER pictures because they help track your progress? DID YOU KNOW that you cannot have any lotions on before wrapping? Do you know which soaps to stay away from right BEFORE wrapping?

    <li> hard to keep on, but did the job</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother. :( doesn&#x27;t work for more than a day or 2.</li>
    <li> This is the stupidest thing in life. I will never ever ever buy one of these stinky wraps..... waist of my time and patience.....</li>
    <li> I have a lot of friends who sell this and I have one question... And I&#x27;m worried about asking my friends who sell this stuff for fear of offending them... Here is my question: to all my friends who sell this weight loss and body toning bru-haw, why are you all FAT?</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this body wrap. It was an epic fail...Did not work and wiuld not recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> THESE DON&#x27;T WORK. WITH A NAME LIKE \\&quot;IT WORKS\\&quot; I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SMARTER.  I SEE NO DIFFERENCE. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> First of thank you Tracey for following up to see how the product was that showed me you really care about your customers and after this review i&#x27;ll be ordering my next one. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ecstatic product worked. I&#x27;ve spent so much time working out and struggling to get rid of my muffin top. I definitely see a difference which has helped motivate me to continue working out and not give up. After this review i&#x27;m ordering my second one. Thank You soo much.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know. It wasn&#x27;t horrible but I can&#x27;t see how it really works. Glad I tried it out though. It scratched an itch... lol</li>
    <li> I tired this after seeing alot of before and after pictures from my distributor.&lt;br /&gt;I did all four wraps, 72 hours apart. I drank 90 ounces of water.&lt;br /&gt;I did not lose one inch. When I asked the distributor, she said they don&#x27;t guarantee results and it wasn&#x27;t meant for weight loss, but for toning and firming the skin.&lt;br /&gt;News flash....if it tightens and firms, you would lose an inch.&lt;br /&gt;I lost nothing but money.</li>
    <li> I have used these wraps for about two months and unfournately didn&#x27;t see results.  However, they stayed on securely and I was able to wear them when I worked out.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these wraps. They were delivered within 2 days, but they were hardly worth it. Both wraps appeared to be old. The cream on the wraps were a nasty brownish color. I performed both wraps on my thighs just as the ItWorks site intrustions say to, and my results were pretty disappointing. There was absolutely no difference 72 hours later. Although these are cheaper than the ones fsold on the actual ItWorks website, it&#x27;s not worth it at all. Just spend the extra $ so you get a product that actually works.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;work&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Ate these wraps for three weeks... No change.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and thats the only good thing about the product. Other then that It was a waist of money. It did not work and I will not be purchasing again</li>
    <li> Follow all the directions and unfortunately did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Received an empty box  wrap was missing.</li>
    <li> Did not work well for me.</li>
    <li> The one wrap worked. I could tell a slight difference. Will need a full box of 4 I realized. Love It!!</li>
    <li> So I did not buy my applicator hear off amazon but rather eBay. BUT I needed to write a review after trying this product. Initially after taking off the wrap I didn&#x27;t see much of any difference other than a reduce in post baby stretch marks. But you really need to have some patience and follow the instructions to a T! What I did: A) Took a HOT shower using no soap whatsoever. Used a scrub brush to exfoliate and help open up the pores. B) I unwrapped the thin messy wrap and plopped it on my skin. I smoothed it out as much as possibly and wrapped with plastic wrap. I loved the smell and tingling feeling! Then I put a belly workout band over just for extra protection.  Then I went to bed and kept it on for about 4 hours. C) I rubbed the excess lotion into my skin and went back to bed. For the next 72 hours I guzzled at LEAST half my body weight in ounces and minimized my caffeine/sugar intake. Voila! I lost 3 inches and I can tell I huge difference in my waist&amp; the amount of fat I can pinch (haha) I even noticed my c section scar lightened up a bit! I promise I am not a distributor. I have only done 1 wrap and I have another one in the mail im expecting ;) I was impressed. Follow the instructions.  Drink LOTS of water (im 160 lbs and I made sure to drink a minimum of 90 oz of water a day) and eat healthy and you wont be disappointed :) its not a miracle product by any means but it certainly does work!</li>
    <li> Bought these through a consultant. Does not work at all.</li>
    <li> I lost a total of 6 inches with my first application (i measured 3 places on my belly). Also noticed a lot of tightening and toning. The texture of my tummy was definitely smoother (I hv 2 children so I had some loose skin). After this wrap I bought the box of 4. Although I noticed more tightening and toning I only lost a total of 3 inches from 3 wraps so I was sorta disappointed since I wanted to lose at least another 6 inches.</li>
    <li> I did Loose an inch or two i wouldnt recomend it for someone who is drastically trying to loose weight its a lot of money... you would save hundreds if you just dieted and excersized</li>
    <li> Daughter in law liked</li>
    <li> Works for about an hour or 2.</li>
    <li> I did not see any of the promised  results. The product was messy and felt gross against my skin. I would skip this product.</li>
    <li> I seen results roght after I used it. You can feel it burn.</li>
    <li> I would give it 0 stars if I could! My friend sold this stuff and I can say that several of us did this exactly what it said and did it for quiet some time and NOBODY lost inches! This stuff is a joke! My friend stop selling this product because no one had any slight results</li>
    <li> I tried this, only one applicator. I did feel the cold sensation soon after application. I left it for about 4 hours, removed it and my stomach did not feel or look any different. I did measure myself before and 2 days later and I had a reduced measurement. I think it probably does work with a full application(4 applicators) but as I was looking for it to firm some of my gut as I&#x27;ve seen in the immediately-after photos/videos, it did not. I will try a full application in the future to confirm.</li>
    <li> CANCER people!  This s*** will give you cancer!  STOP the madness</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me I don&#x27;t know what happen I probably put it on wrong</li>
    <li> when i order this, i thought i was getting a tube cream because that&#x27;s what they shows on the picture and  i just got a single applicator... you probably need to use a tube cream.. i didn&#x27;t get the results from one application that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
    <li> I used it for prep for a bodybuilding competition and I think it worked</li>
    <li> DOESNT WORK, MADE ME  SICK ,  DOESNT WORK,,</li>
    <li> I put money back just to continuously buy these!! Results are amazing! I was so happy I cried lol! &amp; I that was my first  4 applications!!! Please treat yourself!</li>
    <li> Do not buy! My wrap was so tiny it didn&#x27;t fit my stomach at all and it was half dry &amp; brown which is nothing like I&#x27;ve seen them look like so I know it was old. I deserve a refund!!!! Scam!!!!</li>
    <li> bought this because i heard how great they were.  i did everything it said.  i saw nothing different.  i am glad i tried just this one instead of being hooked into buying a set.....sorry i guess i will stick with my flabby belly and stretch marks from losing weight.</li>
    <li> I did one of these IT Works wraps and one of those diy homemade wraps. I did everything the same for both of them and I saw great results with the diy wrap and barely saw anything with the IT works wrap!!</li>
    <li> This product worked great!!!! You have to drink TONS of water but it does work! I was so very happy with my results.</li>
    <li> This product was dried out like it was expired. Will never purchase again. Just send people what they order. I work hard for my money I don&#x27;t have it to waste!</li>
    <li> The wrap worked great... I ordered from an actual distributor after I ordered this one and got them cheaper.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work..... I didn&#x27;t see any results.....</li>
    <li> Lost several inches. Was very happy.</li>
    <li> This is just cosmetic does not work....read my blog to learn how to get healthy from the inside out PlexusDrink.net</li>
    <li> Saw no difference.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Took before and after I didn&#x27;t see anything maybe it was out of date.</li>
    <li> I lost an inch or two my first time using it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see results!:( I drank lots of water and kept it on for 4 hours! I use two wraps, two weeks in a row.</li>
    <li> I bought it a month ago and I still don&#x27;t receive it. don&#x27;t waste your time buy it somewhere else!&lt;br /&gt;If I could give it 0 stars I would !!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, you have to keep buying for it to work and only gets rid of water weight. I used to distribute these. It&#x27;s a scam .</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice that it worked at all.</li>
    <li> You can order and get 4 for $59 and be a loyal for life!!! I love these products&lt;br /&gt;Tracyoh.myitworks.com</li>
    <li> Sold me a dry wrap. Looks like the reviews are true and old wraps are being sold. I have bought from a distributor in the past and those definitely worked... Buying this here was a waste of my money. Not content.</li>
    <li> It works! doesn&#x27;t work on me.  NOTHING HAPPENED!  Smells like tea tree oil and mint.  Save money don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> did nothing!!! what is this????</li>
    <li> Did nada zero nothing for me</li>
    <li> It was brown and coagulated. Smelled a bit off. It did not do a dang thing. I&#x27;m not pleased at all.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It Works Global, the company that creates these wraps and other IT WORKS products directly states that it is against compliance for any distributor to sell their products on Amazon, Ebay, and other third party sites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wrap is made with all natural botanical ingredients and has a shelf life. When items are ordered through sites such as these by distributors who are going against company compliance. These wraps could be expired! The wraps also have to be stored in a cool spot again not guaranteed here. You must buy from a reputable distributor and get the correct instructions on how and when to wrap it is also a lot less money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DID YOU KNOW that one wrap is actually only a quarter of a FULL treatment? A full treatment is a box of four wraps. The wrap continues working 72 hours after applying IF you follow the guidelines you must drink half your body weight in water the day your going going to wrap during the wrap and the 3 days following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do this the safe way get tips purchase them safely and legally through the website I would love to share before and afters with you including my own. I can help every step of the way because that&#x27;s my job :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jenreilly56.myitworks.(com)</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical but I bought some anyways.  I AM AMAZED!!  I have used 1 wrap so far and lost 3 inches off my mid section and I look 100 time better!!  I was shocked and I am very pleased so far!</li>
    <li> Dose not woke just gets rid of water weight</li>
    <li> I have researched this product and though I saw quite a few negative reviews, I decided to give it a try anyways. It took about two weeks to receive this item and I was very disappointed in the results of this product. It gives a very strong tingling sensation that it is almost to strong to manage. I kept it on for four hours and saw no immediate results and three days later, I still see no results. I would not recommended this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product works great for people with cellulite, stretch marks and saggy skin. Otherwise, you need to save your $$. Also you can find it cheaper when you sign up with a distributor elsewhere for their loyal customer discount but means you have to deal with monthly shipments.</li>
    <li> This is a gimmick I did everything they said I Ali used it with the waist shaper it did not work i was an inch bigger I guess this was wishful thinking that a product can make u get smaller without exercise</li>
    <li> It DOESN&#x27;T work, maybe because I didn&#x27;t purchase the special wrapping material, used Glad Sticky Wrap (not  saran wrap) and left it on for the night......woke up and BAM ....  not so ultimate!!  Wonder if this is expired products or something?</li>
    <li> The wrap had a very interesting smell to it and you could actually feel it working. As soon as you apply it to your body your skin almost gets this interesting tingley feeling to it. I heard a lot about the wraps so I wanted to try it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the wraps is the cost. But overall they are a great product to get into you just have to remember the results will not last forever if you are only wrapping and not also eating healthy and working out on the side. You will not get a new body eating the same junk and sitting on your butt.</li>
    <li> I wish I had more than one application. I was hesitant and that is why I only got one, with so many mixed reviews, but it did work! My tummy did look and feel flatter, I measured everyday for three days on the upper, middle and lower stomach. I lost a 1/2&amp;#34;, 3/4&amp;#34; and 1/4&amp;#34; from just one application. Will buy a box now that I know it works. Thanks for selling singles!</li>
    <li> Before I used this product I made sure I edcated my self... First of all your supposed to drink lots of water ( half your body weight ) No Caffeine No Alcohol. Depending on your body type.. some people bloat because of all those nasty toxins in your body. Drink more water.. Lots of it. You cant expect on application to work the first time... especially if you eat unhealthy and arent active. This wrap helps tone firm and tighten skin... on top of that loose weight doing a full treatment the correct way... I was a size 16 and now a size 12 within three weeks. Its call dedication and the reality of it is you have to commit. If it doesn&#x27;t work for you ... your not doing something right. And you know it. Quit blaming the product, blame yourself. If you have any questions. Email me: Myriam.perez713@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;Myri perez . My it works . Com</li>
    <li> Saw a difference after using three wraps. But results didn&#x27;t last. This product is good if you have an event you want to use it for. But don&#x27;t expect long term results</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product. Instant results, just follow the instructions. Drink plenty of water and eat for a healthy life as we all should everyday.</li>
    <li> It was a brownish color. Didn&#x27;t know what side was the application side because everything was wet and sticky. Still bought it despite the bad reviews. Should have listened</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for me,i don&#x27;t like this product, and I did extra and a little more. second time using this product.no!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ready to purchase another package I even give one for my sis so she can try them 2</li>
    <li> this wrap did nothing for me at all.</li>
    <li> It works and you cAn feel it working I liked it a lot and bought more !!!! Because it really works not hard to use</li>
    <li> I have no doubt that It Works products work but it is illegal for these distributors or customers to sell these products on Amazon.com, Ebay, Craigslist, etc - My sister sells these products... Please visit her website at deewrapped.myitworks.com to get these products MUCH cheaper and without supporting illegal practices. God bless everyone but the people who are doing this is just wrong and they know this is not acceptable in any instance as they provide training materials and set specific guidelines for distributors. Either way, my sister will be happy to serve you and do it the right way... The IT WORKS WAY :-)</li>
    <li> Wish I could give it zero stars. &amp;#34;It Works!&amp;#34; Doesn&#x27;t work.  Big surpise.</li>
    <li> I wore the wrap for 8 hours and I seen a difference. It wasn&#x27;t a huge difference but I did see a change and that was only with 1 wrap!</li>
    <li> Felt it working but you need more than one application so buy 3 or more.the sensation you feel is different I left mine on for 8 hours</li>
    <li> I am writing a review as a customer but as a distributor as well.  I started buying these and they worked amazing. Anyone who said didn&#x27;t work wasn&#x27;t doing it right probably. You wear it and secure with either the tape that they put on when you donate blood or use plastic wrap you wear for an hour or more or all night..  Don&#x27;t take a shower after for at least 4 hours to let gel set in..  Drink half your weight in ounces during the application and keep drinking king water..  Lastly make sure if you buy from Amazon you&#x27;re probably getting something that is expired..  It&#x27;s actually against our company to sell this way..  Contact me at Tapiastephanie.myitworks.Com and buys yours today or email me tapiastephaniev@gmail.com and I can get you one for $28 shipped but at least you you&#x27;re getting one with the right expiration.. I also have a prize drawing right now whoever signs up gets put in for $25 in free product a free wrap or facial..  So email me today!!</li>
    <li> it really did work  i just wish i didnt have to wait so long to get it</li>
    <li> Everything came earlier than expected but the product is a crock of major bull. Get a steel boned corset if you really want help losing weight.</li>
    <li> Only used it once, saw improvement but due to costs discontinued.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It made no changes at all, waste!!</li>
    <li> I purchased one wrap on ebay just to see if it will work. I tell you this I&#x27;m a plus size woman to lose a few inches in less then a hour is great for me.Considering I have been working out eating better but I wasn&#x27;t losing any inches in my stomach.  I even paid a good sum of money getting mesotherapy done which I might add is very painful!!! to pay 100 bucks for a box of wraps is so worth it. Here&#x27;s my measurements before, my waist starting at 48 inches after the 3days it was 45. I have to tell you in order for to work properly you have to drink half your body weight in water and you have to eat clean to get your best results. It&#x27;s best buy from a distributor if you want to be a loyal customer you get better pricing versus buying from someone on Amazon or Ebay. I became a loyal customer and pay $59 now for a box of wraps..&lt;br /&gt;getrightgettightn45.myitwork.com</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a distributor and this product works but this is against policy. U don&#x27;t know if they are expired. And u can get from a distributor for $25 a wrap if local to them or become a loyal for $59 for four. U will most likely need more then one. I&#x27;m seeing amazing results and so are my customers. If u are gonna buy buy from it works directly so u get perfect product</li>
    <li> Makes you very hungry.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS!......DOESNT WORK KEEP YOUR MONEY THIS IS A TOTAL WASTE DO IT THE RIGHT WAY EAT HEALTHY EXCERSISE</li>
    <li> I like it, it did work. I need to buy another one, I have a class reunion coming up and I want to make sure my stomach is flat.</li>
    <li> Did not see any changes like stated online. Will stick to my regular workout routine.</li>
    <li> So upset I just recently order one &amp; the application on the wrap was old the wrap didn&#x27;t even stick &amp; didn&#x27;t even work what a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love them and they last up to 3-6months or longer.  Goal is to at least wrap with 8 wraps then wrap monthly to keep results for good.  Please however buy them from a distributor like myself to assure are good and not expired.  My website 2btoned.com.  or email me sbolenwrapping@gmail.com</li>
    <li> I loved it. Saw a difference with one wrap</li>
</ol>
