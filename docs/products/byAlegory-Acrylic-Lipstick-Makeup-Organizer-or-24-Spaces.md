      <li>My brand is Mary Kay, the round tubes all fit well.</li>
      <li>only lipsticks of mine that don&#x27;t fit are my Kat Von D and other larger lipsticks.</li>
      <li>The holder is nice and heavy, the plastic is thick, it feels weighted.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant at first after reading other reviews because numerous people said it did not hold MAC lipsticks (and that is the only lipstick I wear).  </li>
      <li>she said it ends those endless searches for a particular color</li>

    <li> Got my package in a day earlier than expected. very light and will fit in a 2 inch drawer. Can fit most lipsticks and is pretty sturdy. thank you for your prompt service! :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE makeup, and especially lipsticks...of all kinds!  If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ve stored them in drawers, baskets, bowls.  All different brands, with squared tubes fit perfectly.  Even the rounded tubes, with flat bottoms sit nicely.  I&#x27;ve got mine organized by color and I save lots of time not having to rummage through drawers.</li>
    <li> Love it... Along with the compact holder. Nice and compact, holds alot without taking up valuable vanity space, yet looks very organized and polished!</li>
    <li> I shopped for a while for the perfect lipstick holder, I love lipstick, lipgloss, etc. I have several dozen and needed to store them upright to be able to see the colors. My brand is Mary Kay, the round tubes all fit well. I have the glosses turned upside down so I can see the colors. The others all have the actual color on the top of the tube or have a clear top so I can see them. The holder is nice and heavy, the plastic is thick, it feels weighted. I filled mine. I may get another one, it&#x27;s a decent price for how many lipsticks it holds.</li>
    <li> Awesome Quality !!! I have a got number of lipsticks and lipgloss and hence wanted to purchase some storage for them as it was hard for me to find something from my collection especially when I am in a hurry..This organizer is perfect for holding my lipsticks. It is very very sturdy and definitely you cannot beat the quality for the price you pay. Good product I would definitely recommend to anyone who is  trying to organize their lip products.</li>
    <li> Lovely and sleek- just know that some lipsticks are wider (Estee Lauder, Tom Ford, Clarins,Chanel) and will not fit. That said it&#x27;s a lovely small container and fits sizes like MAC perfectly.</li>
    <li> great product love it all my lipsticks are nice and organize now. My drawer looks nice, clean and organize. love it</li>
    <li> What can I say?? These are must haves keep my makeup organized.. The spaces are a bit big for a traditional size lipstick, but that doesnt bothered me.. As my lipsticks are neatly kept... And they arrived on time</li>
    <li> love this I will be ordering anoth</li>
    <li> I LOVE this and NEEDED it ! My tall/short/ round lipsticks were getting out of control ! I want another one but I&#x27;ll have to make space lol.</li>
    <li> I gave this 4 stars because the holder is to short in height.  I wish the slots were just a little taller. Then you could put your taller lipsticks in there and they wont fall over.  It is very compact fits nice in a drawer not bulky.  It is good for just lipstick.</li>
    <li> This lipstick Holder is just as pictured. I ordered Black I am very glad I ordered it. It works well for All lipstick shapes and sizes. If I need another one I will definitely reorder. Delivered within in promised date. Very Pleased!</li>
