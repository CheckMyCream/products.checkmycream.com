<li> I tried CVS&#x27;s own brand of brush picks but they were so thick they didn&#x27;t fit between my teeth - very disappointing.</li>
<li> Upon opening the package about 15 minutes ago (package delivered this afternoon), I found a single 2 pack in the box.</li>
<li> Everything as expected.</li>
<li> Hands down this is the pick on the market.</li>
<li> But the price has gone up a little but still cheaper than from drug stores.  </li>
<li> I was worried the stiff little brushes would erode my gums over time, but faculty members at the Columbia Dental School clinic here in NYC assured me that there would not be a problem.</li>
<li> My teeth are tight and hard to floss.  </li>
<li> I have use BrushPicks for the past 10 years.</li>
<li> My wife and I use these picks all the time, and placed an order here for a pack of six; which I assumed would be 3 of the usual 2 pack packages.</li>
<li> I am addicted to these!  </li>

    <li> Hands down this is the pick on the market. The small footprint container makes it easy to carry them in the car.</li>
    <li> Only toothpicks I will use.  What else can I say about toothpicks?</li>
    <li> Great product, the toothpick perfected.</li>
    <li> My favorite portable picks.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products we&#x27;ve ever bought.  It works very well, and is discreet.  The brush end is far more effective than the toothpick end at getting food out of the cracks in your teeth... I know that&#x27;s bordering on Too Much Information, but I just wanted to explain how well it works and why.  We really do love this product.</li>
    <li> These are great.  Little comtainers are very handy.</li>
    <li> I love these but can&#x27;t find them locally. I tried CVS&#x27;s own brand of brush picks but they were so thick they didn&#x27;t fit between my teeth - very disappointing. I was very happy to find these on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I use this often when I can&#x27;t use floss.  Very good in cleaning between teeth.  Also it is good for cleaning below connected crowns, very good and convenient.  To thread a floss below crown, one needs too much time and effort.  But the price has gone up a little but still cheaper than from drug stores.  I carry with me all the time.</li>
    <li> the best toothpicks on the market</li>
    <li> Everything as expected. Will deal with seller again.</li>
    <li> Love Them! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Must be an April Fool&#x27;s package. If so, I hope to receive the rest shortly. My wife and I use these picks all the time, and placed an order here for a pack of six; which I assumed would be 3 of the usual 2 pack packages. Upon opening the package about 15 minutes ago (package delivered this afternoon), I found a single 2 pack in the box. This would be a five star review, if the advertised amount had been received. We enjoy, and have enjoyed, the product for quite some time now, and the shipping time was acceptable, but the quantity of this product, per the advertised amount, was not.</li>
    <li> I love these. I can&#x27;t find them locally, so will continue to order them from this seller. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The best for removing food from between the teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to these!  Use them daily.  My teeth are tight and hard to floss.  These help me to clean in between my teeth.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was worried the stiff little brushes would erode my gums over time, but faculty members at the Columbia Dental School clinic here in NYC assured me that there would not be a problem. Prefer these to flossing.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Keep Them in the Car and my Wallet</li>
    <li> I have use BrushPicks for the past 10 years. I keep a box handy around the home, in my car and my golf bag. My gums improved their healthy condition with use of the picks, better the floss. Don&#x27;t leave home without your picks.</li>
    <li> Theses are the best, I use after every meal</li>
