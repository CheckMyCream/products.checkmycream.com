      <li>I am able to use these for 5 mL bottles without any problems.</li>
      <li>They FIT!</li>
      <li>Fits most oil bottles.</li>
      <li>cool color!</li>
      <li>easy to use and see bottles.  </li>
      <li>Great for storing essential oils safely</li>
      <li>I can easily stack and store them in my cupboard.</li>
      <li>I store my oils in it in alphabetical order, and easily travel with them by just zipping the top.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>The bottles barely fit in the slots</li>
      <li>I am using this for 30ml eyedropper bottles and the bottles are too tall to fit well</li>
      <li>This is a great product for holding your essential oils!</li>
      <li>and they all fit snuggly.</li>
      <li>I love this case so much!</li>
      <li>Perfect size for someone just starting with oils for personal use.</li>
      <li>No, it really doesn&#x27;t fit 30ml bottles.</li>
      <li>I did not expect the color to be that deep, but its still nice.</li>
      <li>but it holds my 15ml vials nicely (altho as of right now I only have 8!!).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought 3, as I like them so much!</li>
      <li>Bag is very sturdy and well made!</li>
      <li>My third case, holds even the 15 mm bottles, I love them.</li>
      <li>I will order another case when my next order of EO comes in the mail. :)</li>
      <li>I want to get another on and cut out the back rows to keep my diffuser safe when I travel.</li>
      <li>Love it actually need another</li>
      <li>but because it&#x27;s soft, I am still able to zip the top down.</li>
      <li>This item fits all my Young Living Essential oils and the color is nice.</li>
      <li>nothing I&#x27;d really complain about.</li>
      <li>Very roomy.</li>
      <li>I have not had problems with the bottles falling into the bottom, but I believe having it full and having larger bottles also helps keep them from falling to the bottom.</li>
      <li>Just found hidden pocket underneath :)</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>Not too big but lets you take most of your oils when gone for a long time.</li>
      <li>enjoy it but do wish it was like the other case I have from my oils.</li>
      <li>holds some larger oils... not as pretty doing that as in the picture... but who cares?  </li>
      <li>This is such a handy little case!</li>
      <li>The bottom is firm, the separators go almost to the bottom, the zipper works just fine.</li>
      <li>You can fit some 30ml bottles but you will have to leave empty spaces because there isn&#x27;t enough room in the grid.</li>
      <li>I have no trouble with the bottles moving or coming out of their sections.</li>
      <li>I have not had any problems so far, I think this will work well.</li>
      <li>The separators inside the cases are adjustable and can be moved back and forth and also from side to side to adjust to how much space you need.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it for travel, as the soft sides would not prevent breakage in the event of mis-handling.</li>
      <li>I really like it that the dividers can be pushed around to accommodate various sized items.</li>

<li> so I bought a pink and a blue case too.</li>
<li> Does the job as expected</li>
<li> Its really not designed for them but you can sort of make it work.</li>
<li> The bottles often fall down to the bottom when moved.</li>

<li> I have found, I wish the handle was built a little stronger for longer durability</li>
<li> I like that the cases have handles and a small pocket on the bottom of the case.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s somewhat of a cheesy material but</li>
<li> I have to fish them out, it&#x27;s rather annoying.</li>

    <li> Great for holding oils to take on a trip.  Not too big but lets you take most of your oils when gone for a long time.</li>
    <li> Really great size and pretty color. Fits my oils wonderfully. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Perfect, lightweight, well made, and pretty!</li>
    <li> Does the job as expected</li>
    <li> Love the size and convince of this</li>
    <li> Bottles fit great. Handle is a necessity. Never worry about bottles breaking. I need two more!!</li>
    <li> Excellent storage for my oils</li>
    <li> This is a great product for holding your essential oils! I even have 30ml bottles in it. Durable and well made.</li>
    <li> Good case. Very roomy. Just found hidden pocket underneath :)</li>
    <li> love this...easily fits my growing collection</li>
    <li> Awesome carrying case! cool color! fits all size bottles, perfect for all my oils! great for traveling as well..great purchase!</li>
    <li> Perfect starter/travel case.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Great for storing essential oils safely</li>
    <li> I Love it, best bag for oil bottles up to 15 ml I have found, I wish the handle was built a little stronger for longer durability however I have not had any problems with it. Bag is very sturdy and well made!</li>
    <li> I find no issues with this case....maybe the design has been changed a little to complaints of bottles sliding through and ending up in a heaping mess on the bottom. I have a mixture of 20-15-5 ml bottles and they all fit snuggly. I did not expect the color to be that deep, but its still nice. I will order another case when my next order of EO comes in the mail. :)</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a bit over-priced but it holds my 15ml vials nicely (altho as of right now I only have 8!!). The bottom is firm, the separators go almost to the bottom, the zipper works just fine. It&#x27;s somewhat of a cheesy material but nothing I&#x27;d really complain about. I have the purple one &amp; the color isn&#x27;t as nice as the picture but that&#x27;s no big deal either. Overall I&#x27;m content with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it actually need another</li>
    <li> Great product....I&#x27;ve bought 3, as I like them so much!</li>
    <li> Nice way to store my oils.</li>
    <li> This is such a handy little case! I really like it that the dividers can be pushed around to accommodate various sized items. I have essential oils (up to 2 oz. bottles) in the front and larger items in the back. I want to get another on and cut out the back rows to keep my diffuser safe when I travel.</li>
    <li> I use this case at home to keep my oils sorted and safe. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it for travel, as the soft sides would not prevent breakage in the event of mis-handling. However, it meets my expectations perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought the purple case first and was happy with it so I bought a pink and a blue case too. All came in really good condition. The purple is slightly larger than the pink and blue. I am able to use these for 5 mL bottles without any problems. The separators inside the cases are adjustable and can be moved back and forth and also from side to side to adjust to how much space you need. I can easily stack and store them in my cupboard. I like that the cases have handles and a small pocket on the bottom of the case. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with my oils falling out of the slots and laying in the bottom of the case.</li>
    <li> Love these cases, I have 3 of them now.  The best part is that it fits any size bottle up to 30ml.  Yes even my 5ml&#x27;s work great in it.</li>
    <li> I love my purple case. It holds all of my Do Terra oils and has a slot on the bottom for my Essentials of the earth book. Fits like a glove!</li>
    <li> I love this case so much! It&#x27;s perfect for my doterra oils, and looks great at presentations. I have no trouble with the bottles moving or coming out of their sections. Will buy more!</li>
    <li> My third case, holds even the 15 mm bottles, I love them.</li>
    <li> Great case. Fits most oil bottles.</li>
    <li> This item fits all my Young Living Essential oils and the color is nice.It arrived on the date promised.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for someone just starting with oils for personal use.</li>
    <li> Love it will be getting another</li>
    <li> Love love love, I need more!</li>
    <li> works well for me. easy to use and see bottles.  like enough that I ordered a second one</li>
    <li> The bottles often fall down to the bottom when moved. I have to fish them out, it&#x27;s rather annoying. It serves it&#x27;s basic purpose though, especially if I leave the oils in one place.</li>
    <li> I have 22  of 10ml size bottles and 8 of the 30ml bottles that fit in this case perfectly. The dividers are padded as well as the case itself. There is somewhat of a hard-ish type of board in the bottom of the case to stabilize the bottles. I have not had problems with the bottles falling into the bottom, but I believe having it full and having larger bottles also helps keep them from falling to the bottom. I have not had any problems so far, I think this will work well.</li>
    <li> Very handy.  Nice quality</li>
    <li> I use it all the time.  I store my oils in it in alphabetical order, and easily travel with them by just zipping the top.&lt;br /&gt;Also holds some larger oils... not as pretty doing that as in the picture... but who cares?  They FIT!</li>
    <li> No, it really doesn&#x27;t fit 30ml bottles. The bottles in the picture are 15ml. You can fit some 30ml bottles but you will have to leave empty spaces because there isn&#x27;t enough room in the grid. I am using this for 30ml eyedropper bottles and the bottles are too tall to fit well but because it&#x27;s soft, I am still able to zip the top down. The bottles barely fit in the slots and I had to leave an entire row across and a 2nd row up and down, empty because there was not enough room to fill the entire case with 30ml bottles. Its really not designed for them but you can sort of make it work. I&#x27;m keeping it because it beats a cardboard box.</li>
    <li> great starter case to grow with</li>
    <li> enjoy it but do wish it was like the other case I have from my oils.</li>
