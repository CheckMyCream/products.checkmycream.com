### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Unless you have perfectly aligned teeth</li>
      <li>:D</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
      <li>It works just as great as day 1.</li>
      <li>After using the water flosser for three weeks, I&#x27;m so happy to see the huge improvement in my gum!!!</li>
      <li>But I believe this product is good.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Edited: I&#x27;m still loving this and still using it.</li>
      <li>- I use a Listerine 6-benefits one that leaves my mouth very nice and clean afterwards, and fight plaque, hardens enamel, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>but now I love it.  </li>
      <li>i love it ,include two heads.</li>
      <li>Even if it doesn&#x27;t, I do enjoy using it.  </li>
      <li>i really love it and it works very well</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s how powerful the squirt</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s important to fill it to the max if you plan on having enough &amp;#34;squirts&amp;#34; to do all your gaps more than once.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s worth a try...  </li>
      <li>This is still pretty new, but I love it.  </li>
      <li>: The head needs to rest at the gum line between the teeth - pointing right into the gap.</li>
      <li>Overall it works ok - more &amp;#34;convenient&amp;#34; than floss, but not quite as good as getting loose some larger particles that are lodged in.</li>
      <li>I tried using this Airfloss then a regular floss right after to see how good a job it did - there were still some debris that the old fashioned floss was able to remove that the Airfloss left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Should be able to dislodge most food particles between teeth if properly aligned to the gap.&lt;br /&gt;Can use mouthwash or other oral irrigation liquids.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I LOVE PINK ðŸ’—</li>
      <li>forget to turn off the power when done - I&#x27;ve left it on several times and began to clean it and gotten squirted by accidentally pushing the trigger</li>
      <li>/&gt;Rechargeable battery can last more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;Recharge using the same charger as the SonicCare charger (the newer 2nd generation one) - requiring only one charger on your bathroom counter.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I search high &amp; low for pink...</li>

    <li> Another tool to fight tooth decay.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied.Inexpensive</li>
    <li> This is still pretty new, but I love it.  I am hoping it will help with my deep pockets.  I guess it&#x27;s worth a try...  Even if it doesn&#x27;t, I do enjoy using it.  :D Edited: I&#x27;m still loving this and still using it. It works just as great as day 1.</li>
    <li> Found the airfloss acceptable.  I would reccomend to others.</li>
    <li> No more little bits of gross string.  This does the job and gets those pesky particles that hide in my gums.  This has paid off in less chiding from my dentist about flossing and compliments on improvements in my gums.</li>
    <li> Overall it works ok - more &amp;#34;convenient&amp;#34; than floss, but not quite as good as getting loose some larger particles that are lodged in. I tried using this Airfloss then a regular floss right after to see how good a job it did - there were still some debris that the old fashioned floss was able to remove that the Airfloss left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say its any faster as sometimes I need to redo some gaps, and the prep time of filling the chamber and cleaning makes this a questionable improvement on time.&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to turn off the power when done - I&#x27;ve left it on several times and began to clean it and gotten squirted by accidentally pushing the trigger button.&lt;br /&gt;Use a mouthwash instead of just water - I use a Listerine 6-benefits one that leaves my mouth very nice and clean afterwards, and fight plaque, hardens enamel, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Chamber for the liquid - (I use mouthwash, but you can just use water) - is too small - unless you fill it to overflow, it&#x27;s really difficult to gauge when it&#x27;s full and it&#x27;s important to fill it to the max if you plan on having enough &amp;#34;squirts&amp;#34; to do all your gaps more than once. I find that some gaps require a couple of squirts.&lt;br /&gt;Angle: The head needs to rest at the gum line between the teeth - pointing right into the gap. Unless you have perfectly aligned teeth, it&#x27;s bit tricky. Sometimes I can feel the jet hit my tongue and it stings slightly - that&#x27;s how powerful the squirt is.&lt;br /&gt;If you open your mouth while squirting, it can spray your mirror and face - keep your mouth close - though this doesn&#x27;t prevent liquid from dribbling out onto your chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Powerful jet can sting your tongue if you miss. Should be able to dislodge most food particles between teeth if properly aligned to the gap.&lt;br /&gt;Can use mouthwash or other oral irrigation liquids.&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable battery can last more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;Recharge using the same charger as the SonicCare charger (the newer 2nd generation one) - requiring only one charger on your bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;No parts to replace or consume</li>
    <li> I had been using a waterpik for years and when it died I decided to give this a try.  I was not sure what I thought about it about first but now I love it.  Its much less messy to use than a waterpik and convenient for travel.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome! I hate regular flossing but I&#x27;m afraid of getting gum disease and this is what my dentist suggested. I search high &amp; low for pink... I LOVE PINK ðŸ’—ðŸ˜‡ðŸ’Ÿ</li>
    <li> My gum was in really bad health situation, inflamed and often bleed while I brush my teeth. After using the water flosser for three weeks, I&#x27;m so happy to see the huge improvement in my gum!!! Although it hurt from time to time (because my gum isn&#x27;t 100% healthy yet), the painful feelings are fading away!! Love it. Totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> i love it ,include two heads.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m afraid that I can&#x27;t evaluate it.I didn&#x27;t receive this package.And I don&#x27;t know what happened.But I believe this product is good.</li>
    <li> The pulse of the water was very weak and not at all what I expected.  I returned it after one try.</li>
    <li> i really love it and it works very well</li>
