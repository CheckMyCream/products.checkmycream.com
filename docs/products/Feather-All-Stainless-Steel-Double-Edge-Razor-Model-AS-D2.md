<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Many reviewers say that this razor is mild. It isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s so far beyond mild, that there really isn&#x27;t a word that adequately describes how mild it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a harshness scale of 1-10, if a Bic single blade disposable is a 10, and an Edwin Jagger is a 3, then the Feather AS-D2 would have to be a negative 4. That&#x27;s because the Feather is to the Jagger, what the Jagger is to the Bic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s good about the razor is the obvious quality. The whole thing just feels totally solid and precisely manufactured. The lines are all straight and deliberate, and the knurling on the handle is perfectly grippy without being sharp. Also, if you want an EXTREMELY mild razor then it fits the bill perfectly. You would really have to try (press) hard to get a rough shave with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s bad about the razor is that it&#x27;s way too mild. When I get the angle just right, I can get a decent shave in about 7-8 passes. With the Jagger I can get a comparable shave in 3. That leads me to the second shortcoming; it&#x27;s really hard to get the proper angle. The first time I used it, it actually felt like I was just rubbing a smooth billiard ball across my lathered face. I felt nothing but the smooth roundness of the guard. After some practice I learned that you need to use a much steeper angle with this thing. For example, I typically hold the handle of my Jagger at a 30-40 degree angle to my face. With the Feather, I have to hold the handle at a 60 degree angle. Using a different angle isn&#x27;t a problem in and of itself, but there is a problem in that there is a very, very small window where the thing is effective. If you are only a couple of degrees off, then the razor does virtually nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I only use Feather blades, and you&#x27;d also want to use them with this razor due to the extreme mildness.</li>
    <li> Speaking as a man with a thick/coarse beard and sensitive skin shaving has always been a terrible experience... until now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you  to the Japanese people of Feather!</li>
    <li> Japanese make better product than any other country in the world  , they high quality products and , they will last forever trust me people</li>
    <li> Wow wow wow.  Just finished my first shave with the feather.  Incredible.  ive been using the Gillette family of disposables for ever.  I got tired of all the darn replacement cartridges so I wanted to try something upscale and different.  This is it.  Some differences.  First I only shaved with the grain and not against it as a test.  It was smooth. Thepaeutic to have this blade and the stainless head running aginst your skin.  The downside : I believe the Gillette products with their multiple blades give you an&amp;#34;closer&amp;#34; shave : but they alo really cut deep and can irritate the skin, give me ingrown hair issues. I will try also going &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; next time but either way I am sold. This product is high quality, will last a lifetime and won&#x27;t be as annoying when you need to replace those cartridges!</li>
    <li> Shave is so unsatisfactory that I&#x27;ve had to follow up with a different double edge razor afterward every time I&#x27;ve tried it. Some reviewers have said it&#x27;s \\&quot;mild\\&quot;, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s just ineffectual. I&#x27;d return it if I could, but Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow for this item. The razor is well made, which would almost earn it two stars in light of its poor performance, but at this price, that&#x27;s not enough to eclipse a poor shave. You can do much better for half the cost with other DE safety razors.</li>
    <li> High end products differentiate themselves in many ways. This one does it through high quality material, high quality construction, high quality of control off the production line... It is incredible simple so it will last. It is incredibly sturdy so it won&#x27;t break. It is precisely manufactured so it looks good. This is the kind of product you buy once and never look back. No upgrading needed, no changing, no worries. Save up and do it.</li>
    <li> If you can&#x27;t get a BBS (baby butt smooth) shave with this try going ATG (against the grain).  I get a BBS every morning with no weepers or red spots.  This is the best you can get, buy it and be done.</li>
    <li> Best razor I own. I have several other good razors because of my R.A.D, {razor acquisition disease.} They include an Above The Tie slant, an Ikon DLC slant, two other aluminum Ikons, a Merkur 37 slant, a Merkur 34 hd, a Hoffritz Futura etc. I only shaved with the Feather once with a Feather blade, but it was the closest shave yet. It was smooth and comfortable. I must say that the only razors I dislike is the very aggressive Muhle 41 and the Razorock Matador Toro Mastiff. Shaving can be fun and refreshing. If you want to save money in the long run buy and stick with the Feather AS D2. Forget the others. Feb.27 Still love it above the others for a very comfortable shave. Too bad I didn&#x27;t buy this first.10/15/2015  Price drop od almost $ 30 since I bought. Puts all other DE razors to shame. Don&#x27;t miss out!</li>
    <li> Really love this razor.  Great look, nice weight, feels good when using it.  Easy to keep clean as well.</li>
    <li> I was a bit sceptic about spending that amount of money on a Razor, but after reading reviews I could not resist when the Feather showed up on Massdrop. It arrived the other day, and I made my first shave (of course with a Feather blade loaded). I have a negative relationship to the Feather blades since they are way to sharp for me, I keep cutting myself on the sensitive areas. The Feather met up to all expectations. The shave I received was my best so far, no cuts and a superb result. It is very smooth and precise and cuts your beard in a surgical way. Very well recommended!</li>
    <li> This is the finest double edged razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. The quality of construction is apparent as soon as you pick it up. It is solid and very well balanced. The razor gives an incredible shave, better than any other I&#x27;ve had with the exception of a straight razor wielded by a very experienced barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor will last at least the lifetime of the owner. There were no shortcuts in quality. Given the inexpensive cost of the Feather double sided blades, this razor will pay for itself when compared to the cost of replacement blades for razors like Gilette&#x27;s Proglide and others. Who wants to pay about $19 or more for four replacement blades for a Gilette razor system when you can buy 100 quality razors by Feather for about $24? That&#x27;s about $0.24 per blade! I recommend cleaning and drying the razor thoroughly after each use just to keep it in top working order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this exceptionally well made razor.</li>
    <li> Yup. This is what you&#x27;ve been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first Double Edge Safety Razor I&#x27;ve ever owned, so hard to compare it to anything else. As for what I used before this, I&#x27;ve been fairly cheap when it comes to shaving. I used to use disposable razors and an electric razor for all my trimming/shaving needs. No shaving creams, aftershave, or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan of reddit and stumbled across the wicked_edge subreddit which is all about DE and straight razors. There&#x27;s a ton of great razors to choose from, but the way I look at it, I want something that lasts. In this day in age, quality products are hard to find. We&#x27;ve been subjected to quantity over quality and forced to change with it in many of the things we buy today. I didn&#x27;t want to go that route here. My thinking was, I&#x27;ll either love it or it won&#x27;t be much better than what I had going before, but it&#x27;ll cost less than my other options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this razor for a little under a month now and I try to shave every other day. Let me tell ya, AWESOME. I haven&#x27;t nicked myself once, super close shave, and a majority of the time, you&#x27;re wondering if it&#x27;s cutting anything at all because it&#x27;s so smooth. I love it. It&#x27;s pretty dang heavy for its size and you can just tell the build quality is amazing. I&#x27;ve heard the Feather razor blades are some of the sharpest out there, so I was a little hesitant, but this razor was built specifically with those in mind and I honestly don&#x27;t know if I could cut myself if I wanted to (please don&#x27;t try).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you&#x27;re on the fence about spending this much money for a razor, just remember you&#x27;ll never have to replace this again, assuming you don&#x27;t lose it or have someone close to you &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; it forever. I bought 50 Feather razorblades for around $15 and I should be set for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20/10 BUY IT NOW</li>
    <li> This Seki Edge Feather razor gives me a very close shave without razor burn or cuts (two things I&#x27;m very prone, unfortunately). I bought this razor to replace my Ikon Shavecraft 101 razor. If you have sensitive skin like me and want a blood free shave for &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; ($80), the Shavecraft works great. However, the Seki gives me as close a shave in one pass as the Ikon could do in two and it&#x27;s just as gentle on my skin. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Best shave he has ever had!  After reading a ton of reviews on safety razors, I decided to get my husband the best I could find.  Everyone said this one is worth the money, it is!  He no longer gets razor burn or bumps and his face is baby smooth.  His sensitive skin just couldn&#x27;t handle cartridge razors, they irritaded his face too much.  He says that he will never go back to overpriced cartridge blades again!</li>
    <li> The package contains razor and pack of blades. There&#x27;s a space in the box for a stand but stand is not included. I wish it was explained if there&#x27;s option to buy it with a stand.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor - absolutely worth the money...</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Doesn&#x27;t shave extremely close which I like because my skin is sensitive and I can go over the area a few times without raking the hell outta my skin.  Why 4 stars, apparently the insert embedded in the shaft that the head screws into isn&#x27;t SS.  After having it only a month I noticed rust.  Now after every use I have to clean it out really well and make sure it is dry.</li>
    <li> Bye  far one of the finest shaving machines on the planet.  Smooth as silk and beautifully crafted.  I would most definitely recommend this to any shaving enthusiast !</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and delivery from the seller. The product is class-A as advertised.  The heft of the razor coupled with the fine grip and Feather brand blades makes shaving a breeze. Removing hair now is effortless...it&#x27;s like a hot knife slicing through a cold block of butter. A bit pricey, but well worth it in the long run with regard to the lower costs of blades and the superb construction of the shaving mechanism.  Most of all, not shaving rash, bumps and ingrown hairs!  Wish I had this while I served in the military, it would&#x27;ve made life a lot easier 😄</li>
    <li> Works very well. Takes some time to get used to this old fashioned type of razor. Also my skin needed to get used to it as well. Make sure to use a good shaving cream.</li>
    <li> i am a newbie to safety razors,but i decided to go out and buy the best(i will never ever ever go back to disposable razors again).i bought this with the art of shaving kit and with a lil help from youtube learned how to give myself the perfect shave after about 3-4 days(you dont even feel the razor against your skin,your beard just disappears!).......i highly recommend this razor and the art of shaving full size kit.....</li>
    <li> I have previously used some very expensive DE razors.  This is the Lexus of razors.  This razor gives a very close shave with feather blades, and is perfectly balanced.  I wished I would have bought this razor sooner.  It is also great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have recommended this racer to everyone I know light easy and his great easy to clean great shape</li>
    <li> Great shave. Doesn&#x27;t inflame your face like other razors. Will cut you without you realizing it (blades and technique have a part in that too). Expensive, but in my opinion, worth it. Solid stainless steel. Will probably last the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Okay this is a well made, precision razor but I have to give it a knock for the breathtaking price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a good size group of vintage Gillette&#x27;s and contemporary Merkur&#x27;s. Shave-wise this razor is on the medium/mild side. Not the most mild I&#x27;ve used (that title goes to the Merkur 180 aka 23C) but good nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor features 3 piece design which harkens back to the earliest days of safety razor design more than 100 years ago. The handle appears milled from bar stock and the head components (at least the base) appears to be a precision casting. A loaded blade is firmly and precisely gripped, as one would expect from a razor at this pricing level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well packaged in an attractive, tightly fitted foam housing. It is definitely quality with noticeable heft in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the Feather AS-D2 superior to other precision designs that cost a fraction of its price? That would depend on the user. One thing is certain - you will never wear out this razor, and it will easily be capable of outliving multiple generations of shavers in your family as it&#x27;s handed down one to the next.</li>
    <li> I thought my Feather AS-D1 couldn&#x27;t be beat, but the new AS-D2 improves on the finest razor available.  It&#x27;s slightly more aggressive and has a better audible feedback than the previous version.</li>
    <li> Solid safety razor but I would not buy it again. I am in the Navy and have to shave every day. This means against the grain shaving daily with my 38HD. For 40 dollars it was pretty good and my razor burn/redness was minimal. I was in search for a super mild shaver and that lead me to the feather asd2, which is apparently as good as it gets on the mild scale. I have been using feather razors (where I used astra on my 38HD) and got a few nicks on my stash, and lower chin. This is no doubt a combination of feather razors which are super in your face sharp, a unique shaving angle that I have yet to master for the asd2 to cut well, and general lack of technique. Overall I feel like there has been minimal difference in shaves between my 40 dollar 38HD and the feather. If you want a high quality ss safety razor, I would go with an above-the-tie razor instead (100% stainless steel instead of feather&#x27;s casting shenanigans, made in America, and customizable base plates make it the better choice for a bit more money), and the only reason I didn&#x27;t was because the hype of the feather is that you won&#x27;t have razor burn, redness, or irritation. Maybe over time I will develop better technique for the feather and experience that dream shave, but at the present it feels just like another safety razor. I am confident an edwin jager could do just as well for 30 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR this razor has been said to be super mild and the end to post-shave irritation. It hasn&#x27;t done that for me, so it&#x27;s price can&#x27;t be justified. An Edwin Jager DE89 for 35 bucks will give you a mild shave with post shave irritate just like this one. If you want a SS razor, go for an above-the-tie as it is American made, 100% stainless steel (instead of the casting shenanigans feather pulled here), and fully customizable base-plates and handles. I may just need more time with the Feather to get it&#x27;s technique down to get that perfect, no irritation, daily shave I desire but I don&#x27;t have it yet, and I feel likefor the money, I should have went with American SS that is 100% SS.</li>
    <li> The Seki Edge Feather is an outstanding safety razor.  First and foremost is the exceptional build quality.  This is obvious from the moment you remove the razor from the beautiful box.  The fit and finish are excellent, as is the solid feel.  As for the main importance...the experience of shaving...it performed flawlessly.  Facial hair was easily removed, without a cut or nick.  For those who use safety razors, this feat is rare.  The shave was extremely close with only two passes.  I would describe using the Seki Edge Feather as easy as using a cartridge shaver.  A quick 1-2-3 over the face and I was finished  Is it a pricey razor...yes.  But, it shaves effortlessly, super close...and leaves no cuts / nicks.  Also...will last you a lifetime  For comparison, I also own the Merkur 34C (also excellent) and Edwin Jagger DE89</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried the AS-D1, but I own over a dozen DE razors and the Feather AS-D2 has got to be the smoothest most forgiving razor I&#x27;ve tried.  In my opinion it is a mild razor, but unlike some razors it will get the job done, it just takes more passes.  I could shave twice a day and it takes at least 4-5 passes with the AS-D2 for my beard.  At first I thought this was just too mild for me, but then I noticed that the shave was incredibly consistent where I didn&#x27;t need to go back and hit certain spots again.  It also has to be the most forgiving razor I&#x27;ve tried.  I don&#x27;t get any irritation or nicks no matter how I whip this razor around my face; I don&#x27;t think it matters what level your technique is at.  It&#x27;s also a very well made razor.  This is just one of those products that \\&quot;reeks\\&quot; of quality.  If you can afford the price tag and want the more forgiving DE razor around, I think this may be it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the D1, but I received the D2.  My husband was very happy with the D2, even though he wanted the other one.  Compared to his Mercur the Feather is much more solid and provides a more mild shave, but still a very close shave without causing ingrown hairs.  He&#x27;s very happy.</li>
    <li> I was drawn, or rather pushed towards safety razors because of the ridiculous prices being charged for cartridge razors (I was a Mach III user for years).  It has gotten to the point where Mach III blades are locked in cases at Wal-Mart, as if they are cameras, cell phones, or other high-value items.  At ~$3 per cartridge, for something that SHOULD be an inexpensive consumable; I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.  I bought the Seki Edge Feather because of the great reviews, and I liked the design; classic yet modern, simple yet sophisticated.  I decided I would buy a quality item rather than mess around replacing cheaper ones every couple years.  This is another case where you get what you pay for.  Yes, this is a pricy item, but my blade budget has been SLASHED.  I bought Feather blades for 28 cents a piece, and it is common for me to get about 2 weeks (10 shaves) from each blade.  That&#x27;s 2.8 cents per shave!  Screw those greedy pigs at Gillette!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about the shave you ask?  Simply outstanding.  There is a technique, which becomes second-nature after a while.  There are lots of videos on YouTube which show how to achieve best results with safety razors.  I no longer have issues with razor burn that I had while using cartridge razors (sensitive skin on neck in particular).  The occasional nicks you get with these blades seem to close up and heal almost immediately, unlike cartridge razors that cause redness and irritation for hours, if not the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yes this razor provides an excellent shave, and yes it will pay for itself in the long run.  I would be remiss if I did not also mention the wonderful aesthetics of this razor.  It is a precision-machined and beautiful work of art.  It has perfect feel and heft in the hand, and turns a typically mundane task into something enjoyable.  It is an heirloom quality item.  This was my first, and I suspect last safety razor purchase.</li>
    <li> This was an through amazon purchase. The item came in perfectly. I use this Safety Razor with Feather or Merkur double edge safety blades. For me, the combination is perfect. I&#x27;m am very happy to get rid of the plastic disposable razors. If you decide to get one, I think you will be happy with your purchase.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a mild to medium safety razor this is it. Its probably the only thing I&#x27;ve ever given 5 stars to. I own a Merkur classic which is OK and a Merkur Vision which I paid hundreds for only to find out its a piece of junk despite people high praise for it.</li>
    <li> I think I may be cheating and not paying my dues but I decided if I was going to do this DE shaving thing I wanted to do it right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a newbie at DE shaving and only at it a few weeks. I inherited my granddads 1958 red tip and a 62 superspeed and trying to find a blade / cream combo that will work best for me. I have not given up on my classics but my face has been on fire almost every day the last few weeks. I know I am doing everything wrong but I am learning and things are getting better but I think I just moved to the front of the class with my purchase today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending lots of time on the net researching what folks like and don&#x27;t like I just had to purchase a Feather D2! I received my new Feather AS-D2 stainless razor today and just had my 1st shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is WONDERFUL! No razor burn at all! 1st time ever my Clubman aftershave did not burn me! I found this razor to be mild but I like that. It did not scare me and I was using the Feather blades that I understand are about as sharp as anything.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to see what the buzz was with this Japanese Razor. Based on my limited experience I do think the Feather is a very forgiving razor and does not care if I have bad technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think most folks would recommend spending this money for a Newbie... but why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t drive the best car and I don&#x27;t have the best house but I can afford one of the best razors when I think about the burn and cuts and the joy of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this razor to the newbie that does not want to butcher his face because of lack of experience / technique / blade choice. This razor just works with no learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compare the feel, fit and finish of this razor to a Japanese Mitutoyo micrometer that I used in my machine shop days. If any of you have ever worked in a machine shop you know exactly what I am talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can hold a Mitutoyo micrometer or thisFeather razor in you hand and feel the superior Japanese precision compared to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a wonderful razor and what a perfect shave I received today!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a splurge, for sure, but it is also HANDS DOWN the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used! It&#x27;s a work of art, and gives the best shave ever! Treat yourself - you deserve it (well... I assume you do. I know I did!)</li>
    <li> Are you afraid of using a double edge razor because of nicks and razor burn?  Well, I was too.  I inherited my father-in-law&#x27;s old Gillette Double Edge Razor.  I tried a variety pack of razor blades, which included feather razor blades and they all caused nicks and razor burn if I was not extremely careful shaving.  So, after doing some research and reading other reviews about the Feather Double Edge Razor, I decided to take the plunge and spend some money.  Well, those reviews were right.  The Feather Razor is worth every penny. No more nicks and razor burn!  It offers the smoothest shave.  I can now shave with confidence.  There is one catch with using the Feather Razor.  You need to use Feather Razor Blades!  I tried some of the other blades I had left in my variety pack and the shaves were not very close.  They all left some stubble, even when I shaved across the grain. I hope this will help you in making a decision about investing in a Feather Razor.  It is well worth the money, I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really great but way over priced. The Merkur works just as well but not quite as heavy which is a benefit of this razor. If you have money to burn buy it. I will keep mine but would never buy it again because of the price. Update: I have now used this every other day in conjunction with the Merkur 34C Safety Razor. I prefer the Merkur 34C. They both do the job equally but the Merkur is a much better design in use and cleaning. It is also $39 at Amazon. Way better the $175. for the Seki Edge. There is really no comparison in value. I&#x27;m so sorry I didn&#x27;t return the Seki. If anyone wants to buy it from me that would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK now that I&#x27;ve used this for over 6 months here is my current review. It&#x27;s a rip off!!! Finish is totally coming off the top. My Merkur is still perfect and it&#x27;s older. Does not work any better then the Merkur 38C and much harder to use. Would never buy it again.</li>
    <li> This razor is about as good as it gets!  A very smooth shave that makes shaving a pleasure.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great Razor.  Excellent weight and design.  The detail in finish is what you&#x27;d expect for the price.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Great quality.  Very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> super impressed with this razor. For the past month I have been using a $19.00 butterfly too double edge razor, which was ok, but I could feel the blade against my face along with the occasional cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can barely feel, if at all, the blade on this razor. No cuts, super smooth shave, even when against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you appreciate the craftsmanship and performance of high end items, get this razor. Well worth the price when you take into account its performance.</li>
    <li> I have rather coarse hair. I have never used a DE razor prior to this one. I use it with feather razors blades to shave my face and head and haven&#x27;t nicked myself once. I usually make two passes. One with the grain and one across the grain. I went against the grain once on my head and though it was baby smooth I was itching like mad for a couple of days after the shave. I also had razor bumps. I like that this razor is stainless steel, well crafted and should last for life.  The other razors I considered were the Merkur Futur, which I read wasn&#x27;t a good starting DE because most people get caught up with adjusting the blade and never learn proper technique. Various sites (probably all using the same source) stated that this leads to nicks, frustration and sometimes turning away from DE razor altogether. Most of the other Merkur razors were made with nickel plated steel and many reviews said that the nickel plating chips over time. I don&#x27;t want toxic, microscopic pieces of metal all over my skin. This is expensive but with such a solid design, great shave and being stainless steel I should never have to buy another one again. I use the Van Der Hagan shave kit that I brought for about $8 at my local Rite Aid which includes soap (light, clean smell), ceramic bowl and boar-hair brush with a plastic handle. Everything works great for my coarse, thick hair.</li>
    <li> I am a total newbie so I cannot really speak to the quality of the product based on other safety razors.  I have owned electric razors all of my life.  Dozens of them in fact.  I purchased a new electric razor about a year ago and was very happy with the purchase.  Then when I got new blades for the razor I found it to be terrible.  I can say the electric razors I have owned did a credible job but was never a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not want to buy a straight razor because I didn&#x27;t want to engage in a ritual in the morning.  I just want to get to work.  Shaving was never fun and I just wanted to get it over with and continue with getting ready for work.  When I found myself spending more time with the electric razor I decided maybe I need to take a new approach.  So I researched straight razors and then moved to safety razors.  I almost went for the straight razor when I caught myself saying to myself, &amp;#34;self are you nuts!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many choices and when I read about different razors there were always mixed reviews.  Whenever I read about the Feather all I found were glowing reviews.  Yes, they were sprinkled with this blade is mild but then most said they still loved it.  Ok there were a few that didn&#x27;t like it because it is a mild razor and the expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take a newbie to appreciate the quality of this razor.  It is a precision instrument and really is beautiful to hold.  For my first shave I looked like I came from a war zone.  Hmm, if this is mild then I am not sure I want to see aggressive.  The second and third shave were much better.  I shaved for three days on one side of the razor.  Did this mean my improving style was the direct result from a dulling blade?  On the fourth day I shaved with the other end of the double blade.  The bloodbath was really over.  I was getting the hang of it.  It seems when I do still get the occasional cut it is from the second pass shaving against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often wondered why people say they throw the blade out after the third day.  Then reading one review with the responses I discovered many people switch sides of the blade as they shave the other half of the face.  I shaved both sides with the same blade for three days.  I then switched sides for the next three days.  Seems to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is the verdict.  My face doesn&#x27;t feel like a babies bottom but getting close.  The neck appears to be the problem area whether with an electric or with a safety razor.  Except with the safety razor it is very close.  It does feel like the stubble grows back stiffer.  I assume it is because the electric razor never really cut close.  I do feel some after burn but with a good after shave lotion it is no longer a problem.  To my surprise I am enjoying the ritual and my biggest fear never really materialized.  That is the fear of spending more time shaving with a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to safety razors I say...go for it!  This is a quality product and to my surprise fun to use.  Yes, shaving has become fun again.</li>
    <li> The price was the only reason for the 4 star rating. Still glad I purchased though. It&#x27;s just the right weight though a tad short in length.</li>
    <li> Very mild on the face, and when I pair it with a sharp blade like a feather, or a Gillette Silver Blue it gives a close comfortable shave. It is definitely one of my favorite razors if not my absolute favorite.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent double edged razor. Great construction. Has great grip to it. And the box it came in is very elegant. Came with a pack of several Feather blades.</li>
    <li> I had been using the Merkur Classic with Feather blades; nice close shave, but not comfortable, and I always chafed or bled a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe how much difference the razor body makes, using identical (Feather) blades: The AS-D2 is the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve had, ever. It is an utterly different experience from any other razor I&#x27;ve used. I find I&#x27;m actually looking forward to shaving. In this case, money really does buy happiness.</li>
    <li> This was my fourth and best safety razor. Best shave you could imagine. Well worth the price. Smooth and nick free.</li>
    <li> I know, I know, I know: this razor is RIDICULOUSLY expensive. My amazon.com buddies... I have to say.... it is completely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Function:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this razor with the Feather razor blades. It is a mild shave and not very aggressive. I have a soft full beard and the Feather razor feels very gentle while in use - deceptively so. At one point I promise you I couldn&#x27;t even feel the blade, but I saw the hair being removed so it definitely does it&#x27;s job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The balance is great and the length is more than sufficient. If you have an extremely dense, thick stiff bristle beard this may not be the razor for you though. In this case the feather razor may not present the razor blade an enough of an extreme angle/exposure to really get the job done. For normal or less than normal beard growth it&#x27;s a champ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering this is solid stainless steel which as a material is roughly 3 - 4x more expensive than the cheap pot metal that most other safety razors are made of (then dipped in a higher quality metal for a thin coating) the feather razor is actually a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolute top quality. Great knurling to hold on to, precision milling of every single detail. This is a machined master-piece to a very tight tolerance. The handle appears milled out of a solid block (it is heavy too). The head is probably sintered from the look and feel of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparison:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No comparison, the feather is the best I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Merkur 38C HD long handle razor already. The Merkur I thought was mostly fine before I received the Feather. Now in comparison I think the Merkur is absolute crap that is not worth the $60 or so that it&#x27;s asking price these days. I feel upset that I wasted my money on the Merkur just because in my mind I was saving money by buying it two years ago versus something that is made better, will last longer, and gives a much better shaving feel. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave with the Merkur + Feather blade was good, but I had to be *extremely* careful and fairly slow not to draw blood. I thought it was just the sharpness of the Feather razor blade or perhaps I needed to improve my technique. I was wrong. I got MUCH less irritation and NO blood drawn at all with the Feather Razor + Feather Razor Blade combination. I&#x27;ve used Merkur razor blades but they just didn&#x27;t seem sharp enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur razor ra harder to hold on to than the Feather. Both have knurling, but the Feather has deeper knurling and a different pattern making it much easier to grip. The merkur has a much finer and slick knurling making it easier to slip in a wet hand - definitely not a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur is 1/3 the price of the Feather. I still say it&#x27;s not a good deal though! After two years I have spots where the chrome dip of the cheap pot metal is wearing thin and the color of the cheap base metal is coming through! This continues eventually rust will form or I have to try to find some place that will re-chrome the darn thing, or toss it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Feather because it&#x27;s a solid piece of stainless steel that is one thing I will never have to worry about. The materials alone  (remember stainless is about 3 - 4x more expensive than regular steel) justify the increase in cost. The better design and more precise milling is just icing on the cake! This actually pisses me off... I think the Merkur should be 1/2 the asking price - and of course the Feather should be less expensive too. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in comparison to what you are getting... the Feather is the winner hands down. Hey, still better than buying those ripoff Mach 3 (3 blades), Fusion (5 blades), Fusion Squared (25 blades -&amp;#62; future?) disposable cartridges!</li>
    <li> A comfortable, close shave. A Noticeably better shaving experience than the one I got  using the fancy, expensive Gillette shavers.  Follow the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions on rinsing and drying the razor &amp; blade, use a quality shaving brush (I use Escali brand), quality shaving soap (I use Taylor of Old Bond Street soap) and of course the Feather brand blades.</li>
    <li> This is my third DE razor.  I will not be buying another.  Nothing i could purchase  could surpass this razor in terms of build quality or the ability to give a BBS shave time after time. I am a very  happy shaver!  I know you want to end the search as well, go ahead and pull the trigger, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> Great quality easy to clean &amp; easy to shave with. The closest shaves ever!</li>
    <li> I own 6 razors. In order to keep it simple I&#x27;m comparing this razor to the Edwin Jagger DE89bl chrome ($37) and the Merkur #50 Progress long handle adjustable ($75). First for fit and finish the Feather is number one. Can&#x27;t beat the look and feel of the solid stainless steel construction. Shaving performance is another thing. This get&#x27;s really subjective as each razor has a slightly different feel and I emphasize the word slightly. Any of these razors when used with the proper preparation and accessories, soap, blades, etc., will give a really good, close, smooth shave. Finally, the price. In my opinion, the Feather does not deliver a shave that is so different from the other razors to warrant the price tag, hence the 3 stars. On the other hand, if price is not a big deal to you, sooner or later you&#x27;ll want to try it.</li>
    <li> This razor is absolutely awesome.  The blade goes into battery in the same location every time and symmetrically from one side to the other. I have tried different blades, but the Feather blades are the best.  I started off with a double edged razor many years ago and have tried injectors, cartridges and electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor beats them all and over time will quickly amortize, but the real deal is that the shave that it produces is smooth and close. I would buy it again.  I have already recommended to family and friends. Hands down, this is the best shave going!</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a splurge.  I let my face grow out for a few days in anticipation of this razor&#x27;s arrival.  After decent facial prep and brush-applied Proraso soap....this gem glided through the growth with absolutely NO tugging, pulling, bleeding, discomfort.  It was like sliding a stick of soft butter across my cheek.  What it did on one pass was awfully close to three passes with an EJ89 with Personna red blades.  A quick re-lather and going ATG on the second pass...the absolutely best shave I&#x27;ve ever had at my own hand...bar NONE.  I used the included Feather blades and honestly...see no reason to EVER experiment with other blades in this razor.  Besides, it was engineered/designed with their ultra-sharp blades in the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO irritation, weepers or whiskers left behind. Nirvana.  Yes: it&#x27;s a splurge.  YES: it&#x27;s absolutely worth it.  This would be the last razor you would buy.</li>
    <li> I have not used a DE razor in 40 years and was anxious to sample my new feather. I put a new blade in and lathersd up. No matter how hard I pressed or what angle I used no beard came off. I had read that the feather was a gentle shave and thought this razor was just not for me. I was very dissapointed and was ready to give up on it when I noticed the base of the blade holder was installed upside down, an easy mistake to make if you are not paying attention. I went back, lathered up again and VIOLA it works great. This is a very good shaver for me, close, no cuts, easy to use. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This razor is so mild that I can&#x27;t shave with it. I loved the feel though.... the fit and finish are amazing. I had to sell it.... just too mild for an average Joe&#x27;s face.</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  It is super smooth ans weighted perfectly.  I started using this as a beginner and  did not find it overly agressive even when paired with a feather blade.  It&#x27;s worth the price.  It use not only on my face but legs and armpits too.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am new to DE shaving. I have found the marketplace of related products to be full of grossly overpriced &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; brushes, creams, balms, razors stands, oils, etc...&lt;br /&gt;The Feather ASD2 is way up on the price scale of DE razors - costing over 5 times what many other highly reviewed razors cost. It is worth every penny! It gives the finest shave imaginable and seems to be the only DE razor that doesn&#x27;t put gouges in my skin when using Feather or Kia blades. I am very glad for all the reviews that convinced me to try this razor as the price made me very hesitant. What makes it so much better?  I have no idea. It just is.&lt;br /&gt;This review is yet another in the long string of great reviews for this perfectly machined tool.</li>
    <li> This razor is a great execution of a a great design. Paired with a Feather blade it provides an excellent ratio of closeness to irritation. This week I shaved with this razor four days in row, completing three full passes plus cleanup each day. From the first stroke on the first pass, I&#x27;ve enjoyed zero irritation with this razor. This razor shaved close on my first go. Admittedly, it took me a few times to get it to shave REALLY close. Overall, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is true that this razor is exceptionally mild. I doubt it would perform well without an extremely sharp blade such as the Feather. I also anticipate that I will look for something more aggressive when needing to remove more than a day&#x27;s worth of growth or when needing a close shave with time for just one or two passes. Indeed if I had to pick only one razor for every shave for the rest of my life (fortunately I don&#x27;t), I&#x27;d probably stick with my Weber Classic. That said, the razor&#x27;s mildness is ultimately a selling point as it is the reason the razor is so very smooth. I anticipate I may even end up using a more aggressive razor for the first pass or two, and then switching to the AS-D2 for any cleanup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, due to its mildness, this razor is often described as forgiving. My initial reaction was to affirm this description. However, the more I shave with it, the less I think that \\&quot;forgiving\\&quot; tells the whole story. True enough, this razor is extremely unlikely to nick or cause irritation no matter how you sloppy you are. In this sense, it is very forgiving. However, the razor won&#x27;t deliver an extremely close shave unless your technique is precise.. In this sense, it is one of the most demanding razors I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is certainly one of the finest razors I&#x27;ve ever used. However, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s perfect. I think I prefer the handle of my Weber Classic to the handle on the Feather. Compared to most safety razors out there, the Feather handle is fantastic. But the Weber handle is slightly longer, slightly heavier, and the knurling is slightly more pronounced. Also, I can&#x27;t quite decide about the finish. It is absolutely beautiful and masterfully done but it has some sort of coating that is notably distinct from the polished stainless steel of my Weber. I can&#x27;t decide which approach I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this razor worth the steep price tag? For many, probably not. But for the double edged wet shaver looking to spoil himself, I&#x27;d say absolutely. I definitely have no regrets about buying mine.But the Weber handle is slightly longer, slightly heavier, and the knurling is slightly more pronounced.

    <li> Beautifully finished razor of nice weight. A joy to look at and use. A little demanding of the blade angle. Mild but very efficient.</li>
    <li> Over priced...way overpriced. If it were $70 I may give it 4 stars, but save your money and just buy a Merkur 180. This razor turns your Feather blades into thrice used Derby blades. If you want a nice stainless steel razor, look into a Weber for $70 (Amazon sells Weber handles, which will fit a Merkur 180, but you&#x27;ll need to visit Weberrazor.com to buy the razor). Just be aware that the Weber is a little more aggressive than the Merkur 180, which is a little more aggressive than the Feather AS-D2.</li>
    <li> I wanted to  get my husband the best safety edge razor for his transition from a traditional disposable multi blade edge razor.  I researched razors for a few weeks and I am so pleased with my husbands excitement when he opened his gift!  The razor is packaged beautifully it has wonderful weight in the handling of it. It does not disappoint! It does an excellent job and he has gotten the smoothest shave he has ever had!  I do wish the base/stand was available for purchase separate from the razor. I just was not willing to pay the extra amount for the stand with the razor on a razor I was not personally familiar with! We will be getting all our future blade products (finger nail clippers, grooming products) from SEki edge! Do not hesitate to buy it.</li>
    <li> Had strange finish on edges - looked like a second quality.&lt;br /&gt;Finish appeared wavey and not smooth toward edges.&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; feel but not well balanced - look at: Above The Tie, iKon, or Weber for a higher quality stainless razor.&lt;br /&gt;For the price this should be flawless.&lt;br /&gt;Returned.</li>
    <li> I have been tearing up my head and face with Gillette Sensor and Sensor Excel cartridges for about fifteen years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Feather (AS-D2) is my first DE razor and I have no intent of buying another; it is everything I wanted it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am more interested in a safe and comfortable shave than in the ability to prove my skill by the fact that I am not irritated or bleeding.  This led me to search ebay for Gillette Super Speed razors.  The condition of the older plated razors left me seeking a stainless razor.  That limited my choice to about three razors and the Feather seemed most suitable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Feather rewards care without the threat of a scalping.  My shaves are better, less irritating, and more interesting than ever before.  I have so far failed to draw blood even in places that gave me trouble with cartridges - behind my ears and at the back &amp;#34;corners&amp;#34; of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of this razor was not trivial to me, but I&#x27;m glad I paid it.</li>
    <li> If my father, God rest his soul, is looking down at me and knew what I paid for this razor, he would surely ask the Lord to zap me with a lightening bolt to remind me that frugality is next to Godliness. That said, this razor is by far the best razor ever made by mankind and well worth the money. I have a very heavy and course beard with very sensitive skin underneath. I also have a lot of clefts and hills and valleys to maneuver around. I&#x27;ve been shaving with a double edge for over 40 years. I can&#x27;t begin to imagine the number of layers of skin I have taken off with the Merkur HD. All I know is I have left blood with every shave.  I broke down and ordered the Feather razor a month ago. The styptic pencil is no longer in use as I have yet to draw blood with a shave and I shave everyday. Equipped with a  feather blade, get about three shaves per blade and seldom do I have to make more than one pass unless I am taking the wife out to dinner. Easily the most comfortable double edge shave you will ever have.  On the down side, no one has ever designed a double edge that shaves just inside the nostril very well. I keep an old Sensor around for that that task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had bought one of these things years ago.</li>
    <li> Light weight. Excellent shave!</li>
    <li> TAKES A WEEK OR TWO TO GET USED TO THE DIFFERENT SHAVING ANGLE NEEDED WITH THIS RAZOR.  THEN PERFECT!  YOU NEED TO USE FEATHER BLADES WITH THIS RAZOR.  IT FEELS VERY MILD AND FORGIVING, BUT IT DOES A GREAT JOB.  WAS DISAPPOINTED AT FIRST, BUT NOW THAT I AM USED TO THE DIFFERENT SHAVING ANGLE, IT IS THE ONLY RAZOR THAT I USE.</li>
    <li> Husband bought this.  This is truly a fine piece of craftsmanship.  My husband looks forward to each shave.  everything works as you would expect for a tool of this price.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever owned. and like some other reviewers I will agree that this is the closest shave ever, even better than my straight razors. this is my second safety razor after starting with a Merkur. the Merkur is nice and it convinced me that the DE razor was clearly the way to go. After wondering if the price difference would be worth it, and having read dozens of reviews, I decided to try a Feather. Clearly the best razor I have used to date. The shave is extremely mild, but not in a negative way as some reviewers suggest. because of the close blade gap, guard profile, and blade exposure the angle might take some people a few shaves to get used to. Feather has found that perfect combination of those three variables to make the perfect razor. It worked for me on the first shave.  The price is a bit steep, but after twenty years of hating the thought of shaving I am so glad i found the AS-D2. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I was very concerned about spending so much money on a simple double edge razor. And the competition was half the price or less so I had extremely high expectations. All of them were exceeded by far as this is made to such higher standards than all the others. This is made like a fine knife or a surgical instrument. No fancy mechanisms only absolute precision craftsmanship on every bit of this razor. I highly recommend this to anyone that wants a perfect shave and can afford it.</li>
    <li> No way this razor is worth $200.  $40 would be more realistic.  I did not find the Feather&#x27;s shave to be that good.  Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s return policy, I was able to get a full refund.  For me, the Merkur 34C gives the best shave.  This may or may not be true for you; all faces are different.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor.  I have shaved with double edge razors for several years, most recently with a Merkur Futura.  I have gentle skin and am easily cut so I have favored adjustable razors.  This razor is accurately known for a gentle shave.  I decided to splurge and give it a shot.  I am delighted with my decision.  I paired the razor with my feather blades, which are very aggressive and can cause nicks.  The shave is absolutely the smoothest and closest I have ever experienced.  I have not even come close to a nick or cut.  If you need a sensitive shave, you will be thrilled with this razor.  Another factor is obvious before your first shave.  This is a flawless, stainless steel razor. It has the weight, feel and appearance of a precision instrument and is beautifully designed.  It is a three-piece design featuring safe blade replacement that is secure and provides a perfectly even cutting surface.  I am not rich and it was a difficult decision to spend this much money on a razor.  I know longer have any doubt.  I am convinced that this is the last razor I will ever own.</li>
    <li> Arguably, as in YMMV, this is one of the better razors on the market. This razor will deliver a BBS shave to the degree you have a decent technique, and have selected a compatible blade. You will find it to be a very smooth, relaxing and forgiving experience. I am very fond of aggressive razors that require proper attention and respect. This one allows you to just enjoy the moment without gritted teeth and white knuckles.</li>
    <li> A perfect shave almost every time.</li>
    <li> This razor is a real luxury item. For starters, it is built to last forever. The two parts that sandwich the blade between them have a precise fit that is second to none. In fact, that simple phrase really sums this razor up: second to none. Most reviews I&#x27;ve read call it a mild razor, but I would rank it somewhere in the middle range of aggressiveness; similar to an ATT M1 or a Weber. The balance is very good, and it feels great in my hand. If you&#x27;re looking for a luxury DE razor, this is a great choice. The [[ASIN:B00LDPHOZU Ikon ShaveCraft 101 Razor razor by Ikon]] is another luxury shaver at less than half the price of a Feather. Both are wonderful razors.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t justify spending what I did on this, but I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;m certain there are other double edge razors that will work just as well. But, I really love this razor. The quality is impeccable, the feel (weight, heft, size) is spot on. It&#x27;s a very precisely made product. The three pieces fit together perfectly. Shave quality is top-notch if you pair with the right blade for your skin type. I use the Feather blades but you should try others until you find what works best for you.</li>
    <li> Pretty mild shave.  You do need to watch the angle to make it effective.  Solid piece.  No issues with blade alignment.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I do have sensitive skin and based on reviews this is the bomb!!! Well it actually is a Bomb for me. My Beard is heavy and that is an understatement! This razor will never work on my Face. If I don&#x27;t want a close shave it might but then what&#x27;s the point of shaving?&lt;br /&gt;  The blade when in place in inset in the razor. What happens is the cutting edge does not contact the skin and if so then just barely. That is why people say it is smooth. May work on Peach Fuzz but not on a tough beard.&lt;br /&gt;  So yes I do not like it and just printed the return label. I use a Merkur Futur with Personna blades and pre-shave oil by ZIRH and that is what works for me. With the Futur I have the capability to adjust it so it almost feels like I am using a straight edge razor. Also if the SEKI only works with Feather Blades which I can&#x27;t understand why? Then why would you want to be limited to the use of Feather blades only?&lt;br /&gt;  Too be logical and consider that this razor works with Feather blades then one must assume that Feather blades are larger in width? I do believe that all Double Edge blades are manufactured to a universal size. So I don&#x27;t buy that Bull. So basically how can a blade cut your stubble if it is inset or recessed into the razor? It&#x27;s just not physically possible. If the blade does not make contact or reach the target then it just can not do its job.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m not done yet!! Do you want to talk about build quality? Well it is not built any better than the Merkur Futur. I think the blade fits better a aligns up squarer on the Futur than the Feather.&lt;br /&gt;  This review is being written by me with out prejudice. I just don&#x27;t want you guys or girls out there to buy into this product with your Eyes closed. My review is the real deal and I hope this helps with your decision making?</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t find a better made DE razor. This is a very mild razor, which makes it great for the final pass. I wouldn&#x27;t try to knock down a 36 hr growth with it on the the first pass. I do 2-3 passes with my Weber, then follow up with the AS-D2. It takes down what&#x27;s left without any skin irritation. That&#x27;s particularly nice on the odd spots where the hairs grow in every direction in a small area. I can go over it repeatedly with the Feather until it&#x27;s perfect. The combination of the two razors, the first moderately aggressive and the second mild and smooth, gives me a perfectly comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> As a long time wet shaver and user of many different types of shaving razors, blades, soaps and brushes, I can honestly say that the Feather AS-D2 razor is the best i&#x27;ve ever used. It gives a fantastic shave. There is minimal razor burn and the glide across the skin is comfortable. This razor paired with Feather razor blades, makes for an incredible shave. I had no problems slicing through a four day growth. The price is high, no doubt, but the quality of the razor is excellent. It will last a lifetime (a few in fact). The razor, with care, will be handed down from generation to generation. I whole-heartedly recommend this razor. It came quickly and in a great package. I wish I was able to buy the stand with it but I think that may have been a promotional item that was included when bought from an online shaving retailer. I have not been able to find the stand sold separately. If I do, I will buy immediately.</li>
    <li> Love this razor close shave and it&#x27;s hard to cut your self when rushing. You can play with the angle of the shave to see what is best of you. The angle of this razors best cut is different than any of my other razors. Good quality I will hand this down to my son for his first razor.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor!  Some say it&#x27;s too mild and I have to disagree.  It shaves so well that it appears to be mild but it&#x27;s simply that good.  The quality is amazing and this razor will certainly last forever...at least my lifetime.  I upgraded from the Merkur HD Barber pole and it was very nice but Feather is much nicer.  The HD has now become my travel buddy.  The price is steep but you get what you pay for and yes this is the Rolls Royce of shavers.</li>
    <li> Here is a case of getting what you pay for. I was very hesitant to spend this much money on yet another safety razor. In the past I&#x27;ve purchased three different Merkur razors and found them all lacking. By chance I tried a very inexpensive Feather razor (less than $20 here on Amazon) and found it to be very very good. It has a plastic handle and a rather cheap butterfly head, but it gave a very smooth shave with minimal irritation. This led me to investigate the high-end Feather razor and this model in particular which replaces the AS-D1. The reviews were very good. Many reviewers describe it as not being very aggressive, which I&#x27;ll say I agree with. You are very very unlikely to cut yourself with this razor. Having said that, you will also get a very fine shave with virtually no irritation. It feels almost as if there is no blade in the razor, except the beard disappears. The head is just the right size. The weight of the razor feels good in the hand. The fact that it is stainless steel ensures it will last forever, so this is surely the last razor I will ever have to buy. Granted, the price of this razor is a significant initial investment on par with a high-end electric razor. However, the consumables such as blades, soap and alum are so inexpensive that, in the end, even with an expensive razor, this style of shaving is very inexpensive while also delivering the best shave. If you can manage the price, I strongly recommend this razor. If the price is more than you can justify, I recommend the inexpensive Feather razor (about $18 here on Amazon).</li>
    <li> I purchased this after looking at a number of reviews here and else where. Near as I could figure based on the reviews it would either do nothing or rip my face off! Expensive but I decided to give it a try. Long story short I have been extremely pleased! I have a fairly thick beard and even after not shaving for three days it does just fine. Even works at night for a quick touch up without any moisture on the face at all! I guess you could cut your self with it but would be pretty hard.  It&#x27;s bullet proof with only one screw in part and is extremely well made. I have a beard and I was a bit concerned the added length (about 1/8) might be a problem over my shorter disposables. It actually works better since I have a longer straight edge to work from. I order 100 Feather Blades (it comes with 5) and the neatest thing is I can basically have 200 (double edge so 100 x 2) blades stored in just a few inches of space as opposed to what would be about 20 bag of disposables.</li>
    <li> Great product, delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and will last a few years. Shaving experience is mild compared with other razors so have to pass more frequently.</li>
    <li> This razor was well worth the money. Despite my cynicism, it is substantially better than my Weishi butterfly razor. Just like cars, the Japanese strike a perfect balance between performance and comfort compared to the Germans with exquisite craftsmanship. This is not an aggressive razor, has just the right amount of heft, and a perfectly sized handle that is not too long or short.</li>
    <li> This razor did&#x27;nt shave anything, It&#x27;s very expensive and in fact you havn&#x27;t to pay such price for this!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite safety razor I own...  Smooth yet effective shave everyday!  I would by again for sure.  The price is high but so is the quality.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money. Gives a mild, smooth, but very close shave without the facial and neck burn or nicks and cuts of more (so-called) aggressive razors. One hardly notices the razor doing its job as it glides across one&#x27;s face.Great for sensitive skins. I&#x27;ve only used Feather blades in it, so don&#x27;t know how it performs with other blades. I&#x27;ve tested other razors against it, the tested razor and Feather on each side of my face at the same time, same lather, same strokes, etc. (i.e. a controlled experiment), and found that more aggressive (and highly regarded) razors did not provide a closer shave, but that the more aggressive razors did cause more irritation and took more care when shaving to prevent razor burn/irritation/nicks/cuts. The price premium, to me, is in the smoothness of the shave without burns/irritation/nicks/cuts, and the quality of the construction. As with any premium tool, some of the quality of experience is in using a tool of superior craftsmanship. In the end, the additional price was recouped by only experimenting with a limited number of other razors, rather than running a gauntlet of multiple razors.</li>
    <li> Solid Stainless Steal&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully machined&lt;br /&gt;Shave is absolutely wonderful, mild and close&lt;br /&gt;Any number of passes creates completed without any hint of razor burn, i run three to four passes&lt;br /&gt;I combine this Feather with Feather Blades, Proraso shaving soap and finish with Proraso Dioibarba after shave lotion liquid, a heavenly combination.</li>
    <li> Sometimes in life you got to say, &amp;#34;F it!&amp;#34;  That girl out of your league you throw a line on her... And she&#x27;s yours in 6 months.  Or she says never in a million years!  Either way you still learn something.  I learned that paying more ended up a good decision.  I love this razor.  It&#x27;s the smoothest razor I have and I have all of them.  It does not beat the aggressiveness of my hoffritz or fatboy but it makes up for it in so many ways.&lt;br /&gt;  The weight is awesome, like holding a sword.  The way it wisps over the skin so evenly is riduculous.  It does take a few more strokes to get where you want to go, but hey I don&#x27;t mind to be in the zone a little longer, just me shaving before I kick the days ass.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wait, just get it.  Glad I didn&#x27;t go anymore days without her.&lt;br /&gt;The one razor I don&#x27;t have is the American made above the tie 7 piece razor system.  For $400 I think I will wait since I have my feather now.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers to the brotherhood of shavers out there!</li>
    <li> If you enjoy the finer things in life and appreciate real quality craftsmanship, then this DE razor is for you. My beard is what I consider to be medium coarseness and I shave every other day. I&#x27;m also a head shaver, the feather is very smooth(with feather blades or Personna Med preps) and controllable. Some have said the feather ASD2 is too mild. I say it&#x27;s all angle of attack, the feather likes to be held at a steeper (handle away from face) angle. The top cap should be contacting the skin, you&#x27;ll know when it&#x27;s in the zone as the blade will sing sweet music. It&#x27;s not a one pass razor, none of them are. Prep your face make a WTG, XTG and touch up with ATG...no pressure man just glide this baby on down the DFS highway.</li>
    <li> JACKPOT!!! In my opinion this is hands down the very best razor you can own. This is what you want to use with Feather blades. The Japanese along with the Germans are the very best engineers in the world in my opinion. This time Japan is a few steps ahead. I have the Merkur 34c also. Its good - but not great. This AS-D2 is great. In my hand it feels relaxing. The length of the handle is perfect. Its a balanced precision tool. You&#x27;re relaxing the whole time and then your face is baby smooth with no nicks. Beautiful. The Merkur? It makes my thumb a little tired. Its not relaxed shaving for me. With the feather blades its more aggressive and if I&#x27;m not careful I&#x27;ll get nicked in the sensitive neck areas. Its a very good backup razor, or one to take on vacation. But the feather razor is the Rolls Royce of shaving. You cannot get better. This razor will not leave my house!! Would never want to lose it!! Bravo Osaka Japan. This is an A+ work of art in engineering. Now credit back to the Germans too. Their electric razor the Braun 7 is superb. That is a great razor. I think if you have this with the feather razor for wet shaving you have it all. Then you can go out there and kick butt every day with a fresh shave. For me electric shaving just does not work in hot weather or on my neck. But as a touch up razor after wet shaving its unbeatable - and also for shaving the back of your neck. If you have little time to shave some mornings the Braun electric shaver will take care of you quickly and well. But again, for me there is nothing like a wet shave with the feather razor and some touch up with the Braun.</li>
    <li> This safety razor shaves noticeably better than any other razor I have ever used.  The razor has a great weight to it and the stainless steel construction appears to be precise.  The feather blades that come with this razor cuts through my stubble like butter and leaves my face feeling clean and smooth.  This will probably be the last razor I buy.</li>
    <li> My first safety razor. After much research this one looked to be the all around highest quality safety razor I could find. It will last more than my lifetime, and is made of all high quality sturdy stainless steel. The feather blades fit in it tight and perfect every time. It is very easy to clean. The grip is very grippy. It shaves great on my average to thick beard hair, and was very easy to get used to shaving with it after a lifetime (15+ years) of shaving with cartridge razors only. Combined with an alum block (Razorock block, best value per unit weight) I never get razor burn now either after a lifetime of razor burn and razor rash on my neck area. This razor has already paid for itself in savings on cartridge replacements, and will last forever. And it looks/feels so much better than the old cheezy looking Fusion razor. This is the razor to get that will look and shave like new for longer than I will be around to enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Not sure why it took me so long to figure this one out but this razor is amazing. Blade choice does matter but even though the cost is somewhat expensive the long-term payback is very high. The quattro and name brand mega blades are just too expensive and they take a lot of your face off. I do have some nice straight razors thinking they could give me a better shave, they did, but what a pain. I love the look for my straight blades but I will now only use them for touch up. This Feather DE is well worth the price. Simple to use everyday.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this is one of the best Safety Razors ever made. It has a perfect balance, feels great in hand (due to matte finish and great texture of the handle), is easy to clean and has a perfect blade angle. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this Safety Razor. Perfection!</li>
    <li> This is my first double edge razor and it took some getting used to it. When they say not to apply any pressure, they mean it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing just glides over your skin and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing anything provided that you&#x27;ve prepared your skin adequately, are using a.good lather, a new, sharp blade and you&#x27;re using a good angle. Also, short strokes seem to work better than long ones because you&#x27;re more likely to get the angle right.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and make sure you&#x27;ve screwed the thing together firmly or you will nick yourself.</li>
    <li> I own $500.00 worth of razors.  I was still searching before i bought this one.  Wow.  Comfort and close.  Best one I have. Joy to hold.  Smooth.  I don&#x27;t believe what other say that different people need different razors.  This one&#x27;s for everyone.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a double-edge razor for over a year now, and this is the third razor that I&#x27;ve purchased. I know many people are hobbyists and collectors, I&#x27;ve just been looking for the right one.  I started with the Merkur 23C Long-Handle safety razor and a variety pack of blade. I narrowed down a few of my favorite blades and creams, but wasn&#x27;t crazy about the shave I was getting.  I then tried the Merkur Progress. I really liked the concept of being able to change the aggressiveness of the razor to fit the blade to my face, but I would still get the occasional weeper depending on which blade and setting I used, and I was forever changing the setting to find the right balance.  Based on the comments in previous reviews for this razor (Feather AS-D2) I thought it might be worth trying out. It has been the best razor/experience I&#x27;ve had.  I get a close shave without any nicks with different blades. What else could I ask for, this is it! (FYI...the blades I&#x27;ve had success with are the Feather Hi-Stainless, Astra Superior Premium Platinum, and Personna).</li>
    <li> Excellent in every way!</li>
    <li> I sort of backed into buying this razor. I am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;I started my return to safety razors about 4 months ago. I bought a Merkur Progress adjustable (long handle), and went though a mini razorblade sampling trial, with the razor on setting 1-2 (the &amp;#34;least agressive&amp;#34;). For me the Gillette Silver Blues worked the best.but I still had to be very careful I liked the Feathers, but did not have much confidence in using them, as any sort of slip, or inattention on my part and I was bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;So I was back to using the Merkur for the weekend, so I was not getting snarky remarks at work over the &amp;#34;battle scars&amp;#34;. I found that with a nice badger brush and decent shaving cream (I like the TOBS &amp;#34;Jermyn Street&amp;#34; and the Trufitt&amp;Hill 1805) and doing the three direction shave thing, I could actually get a really nice &amp;#34;nick free&amp;#34;shave with the old multiblade ). I was a little discouraged.&lt;br /&gt;Then I read some reviews for the cheap Feathers razor and bought it to try (its on Amazon for about $15). As others have remarked, it is cheap looking, but I was pleased to find that it was much more &amp;#34;user friendly&amp;#34; than the Merkur - was still getting the odd nick but nothing like the potential blood bath with the Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;So on the premise of &amp;#34;$15 good, $170 better&amp;#34;, and the many good reviews from fellow face hackers on Amazon, I plopped down the big bucks and bought the razor.&lt;br /&gt;It is very simple construction, but all the parts fit very accurately together. I do some woodworking, and for things like plane blades to make that super smooth glass-like cut, the blade must be a) sharp and b) well supported in the plane body and by the chip breaker to prevent blade flex and blade &amp;#34;chatter&amp;#34;. It is the same with the razor. This razor is designed for one purpose - to hold that blade at a fixed angle and support it firmly to prevent movement and &amp;#34;chatter&amp;#34; during the cut.It does that supremely well. For the woodworking fans out there, if L-N ever make a razor, I think it would look a lot like this one.&lt;br /&gt;Since I got it, I took my courage in my hand and loaded the Feathers blades in it from day 1. Get the angle right and it cuts very nicely and cleanly without irritation. It has a little extra heft and weight that the $15 one doesn&#x27;t, so I have more confidence to let the razor do the work without extra pressure from me. I don&#x27;t need (or want) to use a razor more aggressive than this - I prefer to make blood donations at the blood bank, not in my bathroom sink. So far a couple of very small weepers and one nick (definitely operator error that one). Life is better.&lt;br /&gt;So for me buying this razor really made the difference between giving up on the whole safety razor deal, and starting to enjoy the experience (I particularly do not miss the smart remarks from friends and family!)&lt;br /&gt;No regrets about buying it.</li>
    <li> No more trial and error...no more bloodletting...&lt;br /&gt;Just the sheer delight of a clean, smooth and soothing shave.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing I&#x27;ve had and no longer have compares.&lt;br /&gt;This belong in every shaving dude shave Kit...</li>
    <li> Well balanced, beautifully made, effortless shaving with no razor burn.  Best as a daily razor.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product, it&#x27;s a very high quality product.  Well balanced and it gives a very nice shave.  I&#x27;ve tried feather blades in other razors and really couldn&#x27;t use them without discomfort and nicks, however in this razor it&#x27;s a perfect match.  Like all double edge razors, you need to use good technique to get the closest shave but on a day to day basis, it&#x27;s easy to use, produces a comfortable shave, and the blades are a very reasonable price (I purchased 50 for $25).  Overall I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to DE shaving.  In fact, the AS-D2 is the first DE razor I have ever used.  I decided to start with a high-end razor because I knew I would stick with it.  Let&#x27;s face it, if you spend this much money on a razor, there is no way you can live with yourself if you ever reach for the Gillette Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving with the AS-D2 with Feather blades for the last month.  I have also been using an Art of Shaving silver tip badger brush, Proraso pre-shaving cream and Proraso shaving cream.  After shaving I&#x27;m using an alum bar and finishing with either Pinead Clubman or Proraso after shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my &amp;#34;pros n&#x27; cons&amp;#34; list for those who don&#x27;t want to read the entire review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Simply beautiful&lt;br /&gt;2.) Very high quality manufacturing and finishing (I&#x27;m a practicing metallurgical engineer, so trust me on this point)&lt;br /&gt;3.) After a lot of practice, the razor gives me the best shave I have ever had in my life outside of a professional barber shop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.) The handle is too short for me, and I always feel like I am about to drop it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that most people claim that the AS-D2 is a &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; razor.  But if this is a mild razor, I would hate to have started DE shaving with an aggressive one.  My first few shaving experiences with the AS-D2 involved lots and lots of blood, searing pain from the alum bar and after shave, and repeated promises to myself like &amp;#34;I&#x27;m a real man, I can take it!&amp;#34;  After a month I&#x27;m at the point where I can shave daily with only the occasional nick (although I do have to remind myself daily of my manliness when I use the Clubman after shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem was that I was used to shaving &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; with my Gillette Fusion in order to achieve a close shave.  If I start my shave with the AS-D2 against the grain of my beard, my face is in rough shape when I&#x27;m finished.  If I shave with the grain of my beard, I have no problems  with nicks or irritation, but I&#x27;m unable to achieve a close shave.  It took me two weeks to figure out that when I make the first pass with the grain, and then follow up with a single pass against the grain, I&#x27;m baby-butt smooth. Now I do a couple passes with the grain, quickly re-lather, and do a single pass against the grain.  The trick is to apply little to no pressure, otherwise the three passes with this razor and Feather blades will give you a good case of razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a medium thick beard that grows pretty fast.  With the Fusion, I had to shave daily during the work week.  With the AS-D2, I can get away with skipping a day without too much trouble.  I still shave with the Fusion when I travel, and my stubble is noticeably longer 24 hours after shaving with the Fusion compared to the AS-D2.  That being said, my stubble is all exactly the same length a day after shaving with the Fusion, whereas I have patches of different length stubble a day after shaving with the AS-D2.  This tells me that I need to continue to work on my technique and angle to get a uniform shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite shocked by the reviews that say the AS-D2 razor is too mild, or not aggressive enough.  As I said, I have never used another DE razor, but I am able to achieve a super close shave with the AS-D2 and a Feather blade. And as I pointed out earlier, I was certainly able to draw blood during my first few tries.  I shudder to think what would have happened if I had started with an &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the bottom line: the only time I ever experience a better shave is when I go to a professional barber shop and get the hot towel treatment.  I know that the AS-D2 is pricey, but considering that I was spending $4 per week on Fusion cartridges, I figure it will only take a year to &amp;#34;break even&amp;#34; assuming I continue to replace my Feather blades 2 times per week. I am extremely happy with this purchase.eard, I have no problems  with nicks or irritation, but I&#x27;m unable to achieve a close shave.

    <li> I truly enjoy this razor, I love the balance and workmanship. When I hear people say it is not aggressive enough I have to wonder. If you  take 3 pass&#x27;s at shaving it will give you as good a shave as any razor but with a most enjoyable experience.  Shave 1 with the gain, shave 2 somewhat against the grain, shave against the grain. Feel your face and go over what you feel are the rough area&#x27;s. I use Feather blades and one of my soaps (I use 8 soaps and creams) is Pedal Pushes Fancies. I normally like 2 pass&#x27;s for a great shave, BBS only when I&#x27;m going to be kissing.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulously mild razor, even with the original Feather blades, which are thought of as the sharpest blades in the industry. For me this razor goes through 3 to 4 day growth like a knife through butter. It is virtually impossible to nick yourself with this tool and, sometimes, that&#x27;s just what I need when I stumble out of bed early in the morning with sore muscles and stiff joints from working out the night before. This razor is mild enough to be comparable to a disposable plastic razor and can easily be used with any canned shaving foam or gel if time is of the essence. But truth be told, this mildness does come at a small price: I find the shave is by a hair not as close as with my other more aggressive DE razor. Not that there is any kind of visible difference, just the feel here and there gives that away.</li>
    <li> I have owned many DE Razors. This is nice, but not $174.50 nice. You can get a Edwin Jagger Razor and others that shave just as good or better. They are a fraction of the price. So what if you break one of these cheaper razors? Just buy 2 and have a spare. I also noted some uneven blade alignment on this Seki razor. For the price it should be flawless. Why is it so high ?  You can buy a set of Knifes made from high quality stainless steel cheaper than this razor. Also stainless steel does not feel as smooth to the face as a good Chrome razor.</li>
    <li> Outstanding, once you get used to the angle. Took me a few shaves for me because your angle has to be just right. Not as forgiving as my Edwin Jagger. If not held right, you just won&#x27;t cut off as much of your whiskers. Very nice weight, very nice feedback, outstanding craftsmanship and mild razor.</li>
    <li> Double edge razor shaving is pretty scary.  I have an adjustable Merkur double edge razor and after nearly slitting my throat with it, I&#x27;m terrified to use it.  I went back to the hated 2, 3, 4, and 5 blade shavers, not changing the blade for months at a time because I had to choose whether to spend my paycheck on my mortgage or razor blades.  Then I read the reviews of this way-too-expensive-but-oh-so-beautiful razor and succumbed to it&#x27;s siren call.  It&#x27;s billed as being a non-aggressive shave, meaning it&#x27;s not going to take your face off with the whiskers.  And that is absolutely true.  I use Feather double edge blades in it (Feather blades are the scariest and sharpest blades made) and I have never gotten a serious nick.  This razor glides across the skin and after a few weeks usage, you will shave without terror.  I do.</li>
    <li> Let me de-hype and de-mistify safety razor shaving for you. Even if you aren&#x27;t a hipster and don&#x27;t want to turn shaving into a manly artform, there is good reason to do a traditional wet shave. Pick your shaving soap or cream carefully, and it&#x27;s much better for your skin and provides a more comfortable shave than the drugstore brands. I&#x27;m not a chemist, so I think it&#x27;s unfair to pick on a particular brand with terminology I barely understand. But do this on your own: Look up a popular shaving cream on the EWG&#x27;s (the environmental working group&#x27;s) \\&quot;skin deep cosmetic safety database.\\&quot; You know how to google. Anything with a fragrance, isobutane, or propylpareben is a pretty high risk for allergies and irritation. The good stuff, more often than not, isn&#x27;t peed from a can like a fire extinguisher. The good stuff lends itself to be brushed on. Still with me? Good. That&#x27;s the important part. Stop here if you want and use a decent two-bladed cartridge. 5 blades is simply not necessary! This is the important part and it can really improve how you look and feel.    Or... if you want even more comfort and lower recurring costs, get a safety razor. Admittedly it is not as fast or as close a shave (pass for pass). Don&#x27;t let the hobbyists convince you otherwise. I&#x27;d rather have you make a choice for the right reasons and avoid the hype. For 8 cents a day I use each side of a double edged blade once and only once. That&#x27;s comfortable. When I paid $4-5 per cartridge I was tempted to make those babies last. That&#x27;s anything but comfort.    And finally, why this particular safety razor? Well, if you have gone so far as to choose brushing on a quality shaving soap or cream (I truly hope so) and want to take the next step, there is no more sure-fire, can&#x27;t miss choice than this razor. I&#x27;m not going to repeat the description. That&#x27;s silly. If the one-time expense doesn&#x27;t make you blanch, then it should be an easy decision.</li>
    <li> Impeccable quality, with a wonderful shave.  Trick is to hold it at a 45 degree angle for a great smooth shave.  Highly recommended for a lifetime of shaves.</li>
    <li> I started out a month ago with a $34 Merkur razor and blades.  The blades were not very sharp at all--so I got feather blades.  After getting feather blades, i started to wonder how much better their Feather DE $175 razor was.  so...i took the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not believe how much better the shave was.  it was AWESOME.  couldn&#x27;t even feel it cutting hair.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  if you don&#x27;t like it, put it on Ebay or badgerandblade.com.  I&#x27;m sure you could get most of your money back.</li>
    <li> I do not understand how someone would feel this is so mild, although, perhaps  because it is so precise. I get a BSS with 3 passes and 1 touch up. I am new to DE,  but if i am not bleeding and my shave is smooth, what is the issue ? :)</li>
    <li> Great razor.  As soon as you pick it up you can feel the quality.  It just feels well made and designed.  At first I was disappointed with the length of the handle, but after using it I&#x27;ve found that it helps you to properly angle the razor.  As others have stated, the razor definitely is mild, but that adds to the safety I think.  I can still quickly get a close shave and would have to try to cut myself.  I do have two complaints however, 1) the blade spacing makes detail trimming such as under the nose a little time consuming, and 2) the assembly method.  A butterfly mechanism is so much more convenient.  Neither are deal breakers by any means as this is hands down the best razor I&#x27;ve used.  Totally worth the investment.</li>
    <li> if you can afford it get this razor. I have many. This is by far the best. See my combo kit pic. Love the Razoroc soap too. Awesome.</li>
    <li> The best razor ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, sorry for the hyperbole. This is the first double edge safety razor I have tried in 40 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of high-end over-priced Fu*ion-compatible razors made of chrome-plated plastic that shed their chrome plating after a couple of years. I was attracted by the reviews that said this solid-stainless wonder shaved more comfortably and closer than contemporary high-end multi-blade models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a high-quality brush and shaving creme (e.g. Art of Shaving) I don&#x27;t even feel the blade on my skin. The only sense I have that there is actually a blade in the razor and that I actually am removing stubble is the sound of stubble being removed. But the shave is closer than I ever get with my AOS Fusion-compatible plastic wonder. I can even follow up with another shave against the grain -- after which my fairly tough beard now feels baby soft -- without any razor burn or ingrown hairs in the following days. I love it, and if you can afford the price this razor is well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative note is that I have a full beard, but shave a narrow strip between my nose and mustache. (Hey, Sean Connery did it in later years!) I can&#x27;t get there with this razor, and took a couple of cuts until I gave up and trimmed either with the trimmer blade on a Fusion-compatible, or with an old Trac II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this razor (when used with Feather blades) is WELL WORTH the minor extra hassle in the morning. HIGHLY recommended!</li>
    <li> I have tried at least 10 Saftey razors and this is one blows them all away. It gives a super smooth shave with no irritation and is very mild you will not be disappointed I even got one for my wife she loves it too legs have never been smoother!</li>
    <li> Originally I loved this razor, felt solid and balanced in your hand and a nice close shave. For what you pay I would think I could pass it on to grandchildren, not so... the stud has pulled off the razor and officially broke. No I don&#x27;t use a wrench to tighten I just put it finger tight, enough to just keep it together and not spin during shaving. MY ADVICE IS TO KEEP LOOKING!</li>
    <li> So yeah, you might be butt-hurt over the price and how it can decimate your wallet, but it completely owns any safety razor I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s crafted beautifully, the heft of the instrument just feels good in the hand, and allows the razor to do most of the work. I can do a 3 pass shave no problem, without any nicks or irritation. I even did a few 4 pass shaves to see how my skin would hold up, and still no issues. Because it is a milder shave, I find myself being more confident and shaving faster as time goes on. This is not a good razor for the beginner. You should know your face and how the hairs grow in different sections before attempting to shave with this. The angle at which you hold the razor to your face is very important too, and different than typical DE safety razors. It only took me a few strokes to adjust, but after that, it was smooth sailing. BBS no problem. I also use this with Feather Blades.</li>
    <li> The best razor money can buy and well worth it.  I can&#x27;t put it down and ever since I bought it at a low price, it has went up more than $20.00.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Very well made. Non-aggressive shave, but cuts the beard. I was amazed it was even shaving as i heard no scraping. I had no razor burn, no nicks. Uses the sharpest blade available but is designed to tame the beast.</li>
    <li> This is my second Feather.  I bought this one for my travel kit.  Simply the best safety razor for my skin.  It helps keep the bumps down.  Great quality.  Easy to clean.  Good hand feel.</li>
    <li> This razor is fantastic. I started using a DE razor 45 years ago and I am glad to have another one.</li>
    <li> Best safety razor ever!!!!!</li>
    <li> I got my first DE razor as a gift from my dad when growing up. Like so many of us I also later got hooked on the &amp;#34;throw away&amp;#34; cartridge type razor. In college it was very convenient to use the disposable type razors. After years of &amp;#34;quick&amp;#34; shaves, paying outrageous prices for the 4 and 5 blade razors I decided to retun to my &amp;#34;roots!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing a LOT of research via the internet, including reading the reviews here at Amazon I decided to make the &amp;#34;investement&amp;#34; in purchasing the Feather AS-D2. Granted, the Feather brand razor blade will fit many other brands of razors the design and manufacturing process for the AS-D2 is what sold me on making the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned having a back ground as a machinist, comparing the AS-D2 to a finely crafted instrument. I to have the same back ground (tool and die) and I must say that the production process for this razor is &amp;#34;top notch.&amp;#34; The &amp;#34;knurling&amp;#34; pattern for the handle as well as the internal threads are without question high quality. The AS-D2 is &amp;#34;heir loom&amp;#34; quality that will endure generations of reliable use with proper care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about care: If you want your AS-D2 to be handed down for generations to come, I advise thoroughly rinsing it clean in hot water after each shave once the razor blade is removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, soak your razor in rubbing alcohol (preferably 95%, plus, isoprophyl.) Allow the alcohol to drain and air dry. This will displace all moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, place the threaded end of the handle in Baby Oil. (Submerge the entire handle and the other two components in oil would be better.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, rinse the razor blade thoroughly in hot water. Take a towel and very carefully wipe away the built-up &amp;#34;residue.&amp;#34; Best to do this holding the ends and wiping from the middle of the razor blade out toward the &amp;#34;cutting edge.&amp;#34; Do both edges, as well as, both side of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next, reassemble the razor with the razor blade installed. Use a small bowl to keep the head of the razor and the blade completely submerged in the baby oil until next use. You could also have a small tray to keep the entire &amp;#34;assembled&amp;#34; razor submerged in baby oil until the next sahve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stainless steel, unlike regular steel will not rust. However, it will &amp;#34;corrode&amp;#34; over time which is a form of rust. It can be just as destructive but takes much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above tip can also be used for chrome plated &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;adjustable&amp;#34; type razors.</li>
    <li> An outstanding product with careful attention to detail given to manufacturing. The materials and finish are very high quality. This razor looks good and the grip is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thoughts on the performance are a little more reserved. As many have said in the past, this razor delivers close shave with minimal skin irritation. My personal impression is that it is not significantly better than a $30 butterfly mount version. I have compared it head to head with several other double edge models and I find that they all do an acceptable job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make no mistake, I am very satisfied with my Feather razor. It is an engineering masterpiece that will last for a lifetime. if you have an extra $175 and are interested in owning the best available, the Feather is the right razor for you.</li>
    <li> I have used the notoriously-sharp Feather blades in other razors before and always ended up bleeding. This razor; however, works perfectly with the blades. You can tell that they&#x27;re made for each other. The result is a silky smooth shave that just seems to make the toughest whiskers disappear without resistance. The razor is heavy in the hand like and feels very high-quality. Definitely a luxury.</li>
    <li> Very well made. Has a great weight and feel for shaving. Most of my razors are adjustable but this one puts the blade at a perfect angle.</li>
    <li> A long review but hope its helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was skeptical when i saw the reviews. Studies have shown that perceived quality is increased by price. People will choose and prefer expensive wines and rate them better even if a switch has been made and they are actually drinking the cheaper wine. Also people tend to justify their purchases and rate them better than they are, no one wants to be seen as a fool for spending a lot and will argue that the high price is justified. This razor justifies its price for me, TOTALLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a hemophiliac (if we get cut, we bleed a lot) so safety is important to me. The feather blade used with this is sharp but it seems a perfect match. You are highly unlikely to get cut. I am relatively new to DE shaving. I got a small nick with this razor and the only reason was that I rushed. ANY razor will cut you if you are foolish, this razor is very forgiving unless you throw caution to the wind you will not get cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that I have zero irritation with this razor, I always got razor irritation with other razors despite a good pre-shave routine (shower, lather well). Its a mild razor and you will appreciate that your face isn&#x27;t itching and dry during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor will require multiple passes to get a smooth shave. But it does it well, shaving once with the beard grain and once against the grain does the trick for me and the shave is totally smooth with no feeling of stubble. Its really smooth even running fingers against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this razor is exceptional, premium materials combined with excellent manufacturing processes and stringent quality controls make for a razor you will enjoy for many years. Its not as some have said a work of art, sorry I cant get emotional over a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note I keep thin side burns and goatee so I cant comment on how this razor performs going over the jaw line and chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone newto DE shaving, my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy this first as it would have saved me a lot of money  that was spent on other razors. I will not buy another razor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About my shaving, I do realise that a good shave needs good prep, good skills and good equipment. I now enjoy my shaving since I moved away from disposables. Shaving is not a hobby for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford it I sincerely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Amazing safety razor. Has a great heft/right weight when holding it. Worked perfectly the first time with the Feather blades for a light-weight shave without nicks. Easy to assemble and clean. Materials feel good and solid and I expect it to last a long long time.</li>
    <li> I ordered and received this razor a few days ago.  I ordered it mostly because of all the fine reviews.  I am not sure if I understand  the expense of this razor.  I am not ignorant to razors,  I have several thousand dollars in straight razors consisting of vintage to  new.  They range from; Dovo, CaseXX, Broker etc.  Some of these razors costs less than this safety razor.  I have several double  edge razors ranging from 18 to 50 dollars. I give this razor in question 5 stars for it&#x27;s construction without hesitation.    I have shaved twice with this razor,  I can&#x27;t say that there is much difference than the 18 dollar feather razor.  ( I am not being a  smart ass ),  I would like for someone to give me a comment and explain this huge difference in the price.  I know there are  people out there who are more knowledgeable than I,  concerning double edged razors.  Again, this razor is very, very, well made,  that is 5 stars.  To be quite candid with you,  I needed another razor like we need more taxes.    But,  all these high reviews I couldn&#x27;t resist buying this razor.  I just don&#x27;t want to be sorry that I did.  I hope that my review helps  someone to decide to buy this razor.  I don&#x27;t mean to be redundant, I can say that my review is all about the quality of this razor.  I don&#x27;t believe that a double edged razor could be engineered any better.  Hope you understand what I conveying to you as a  buyer...    1-5-15    I now completely understand why this razor is priced very high.  I have only been shaving with this razor since I bought it a   month or so ago.  All I can say that it&#x27;s worth the money.  It does take some getting used to because, it is NOT an aggressive  razor, it&#x27;s somewhat on the mild side.  If you go a couple of days without shaving it takes a little patience to get the clean  smooth shave that you want.  You need not worry about scrapes, nicks or cuts when you shave fast.  When you get used to the feel  of this razor,  I do believe that you will be happy that you purchased it.  Again, in my opinion I don&#x27;t believe that a safety  razor could be constructed any better...</li>
    <li> This razor is wonderful.  I use the Feather blade in it and the first shave I gave myself, the day after the razor arrived (two days ago) was the best shave I have ever given myself.  The main complaint that appears to surround this razor is that it gives a &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; shave.  Somehow, I don&#x27;t understand why that is a complaint.  It passes so smoothly over the face that it provides a shave as comfortable as one can imagine.  Yes, in certain areas, I had to pass over more than once, but I have had to do this with all my razors.  The question is what&#x27;s left after the second pass.  The answer: nothing!  I have no question that this is the best razor that I have ever purchased and I have the comfort that it will keep working indefinitely.  One more thing, I am comparing this razor to two Merkur razors that I own.  After four years of use, the Futur seized up and I can no long turn the handle to make any adjustments (and I did clean it regularly), and the Vision is excellent but, down the road, judging from the reviews I&#x27;ve read, there seems the possibility of some kind of construction failure.  I know that won&#x27;t happen with this razor.  It is perfect, and I can&#x27;t imagine how it could be improved.</li>
    <li> Should have made this purchase long ago! I have a coarse beard and was hesitant about this purchase because of the razors mild non aggressive  ratings. Not to mention the price! Best shave ever! Close,nick free &amp; BBS Smooth. Only needed a 2 pass shave.</li>
    <li> Received this as a gift from my wife - I just would not have paid that much for a razor. That said, when matched with a Feather blade, this razor provides the smoothest and closest of shaves. The AS-D2 is perfectly mated to the Feather blades. I have absolutely 0 irritation when using a good cream/soap with a 3 pass shave. I have been using this razor for the past 3 months and my technique has gotten much better, contributing to the closeness. I have several vintage Gillettes and although I can get an excellent shave with a couple, not one will deliver such smoothness on the first pass. Truly amazing and consistently great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the $$$$ doesn&#x27;t deter you, pick one up. I think this is categorized as a gentle razor, so for those of you with a coarse beard (I don&#x27;t have one) YMMV. However, don&#x27;t forget the Feather Hi Stainless is one of the sharpest blades made, so that may compensate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product - great wife : )</li>
    <li> Due to its unique construction, the razor hits the face at the same angle as the multi-blade cartridges. This makes the shave mild but also safe, smooth, and effective.  The blades is firmly locked in place thereby minimizing vibrations and noisy feedback while shaving.  The construction and materials are very classy.  A collector&#x27;s item.</li>
    <li> Nice razor, it is definitely like the other person said that it turns sharp blades into dull ones in some respecs, but that makes it easy to use without worry.  To me it&#x27;s just good to have that option.  Also easy to get started with and my girl was able to use it on her legs very easily.</li>
    <li> I really love this razor. I get a very close shave, and I find it almost impossible to give myself razor burn. I&#x27;ve shaved with the EJ98L, and a Weber razor. This is easily the best. The EJ98L was fine, it gave a good shave. The Weber was too difficult to use for me. The Feather is perfect. It takes off the all the hair and allows me to go in different directions without fear of razor burn that I might get if I were using a different razor. I am familiar with the concept of &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; razors. I disagree with the notion that &#x27;aggressive&#x27; and &#x27;closer&#x27; go hand it hand. I think that to get a great shave you have to be able to go against the grain without fear of snagging. This well engineered razor keeps the blade firm and it doesn&#x27;t snag on even the wiriest of facial stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to cost: is it worth it? This I can&#x27;t answer. Over my lifetime I will assuredly save money on blades using this razor. I will also have spent so much more on a razor that I can&#x27;t really justify it as a cost saver. What I can say is that you shouldn&#x27;t be scared off by the cost. The &amp;#34;razor and blades&amp;#34; model has ingrained low barriers to entry to trying a new razor. This is the opposite, and allows more money to accrue in your pocket as opposed to Gillettes.  It requires a substantial initial investment but will provide a lifetime of quality shaves easily better than the latest Fusion razors. This is the easiest razor to use, so I can&#x27;t recommend it more to someone who is *shocker* new to DE shaving. Yes it does require a leap of faith, but that is why you are reading this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Very pricey but seems to be worth every penny if you want a great DE razor for rougher and/or sensitive skin.  Nice less aggressive profile.  Blade cap is a little tall for getting close to under my nose.  This is my go to primary of my four DE razors.</li>
    <li> I have several DE razors, but this seems to shave the smoothest with the least irritation. I have sensitive skin around the upper chin, and lower neck. This is the first razor I&#x27;ve used where it did not eliminate irritation, but greatly reduced it. Other people have stated you can&#x27;t feel it shave, only hear it, not true for me. It&#x27;s less effort to shave but I still feel it shave, perhaps my beard is tougher than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually when I shave at 7am redness on my neck has diminished by 10-11am. With this razor it was far less redness &amp; irritation to begin with, and was gone within 30-45 minutes. For this reason I do highly recommend the razor. It cut very well and I was able to still put a little pressure on the razor against my skin. I prefer the look of my old Edwin Jagger in heavy chrome but Feather performs better. The handle is unlikely to slip in your wet hand as the grip is extremely good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, just go ahead and get this razor, you&#x27;ll stand a good chance of getting it anyway, save your money buying other razors and get this. My other razors that this out performs are the Merkur Futur, Edwin Jagger ( EJ is My Second Favorite) Parker super heavy weight butterfly 99R &amp; Parker 92R. The Feather out performs them all. The Parkers allow the sharp edge of the razor to poke out the left &amp; right side of the razor (On the short end of the rectangular head) and it sliced me pretty good, that prompted me to get the Merkur Futur as the blade is fully enclosed, but the head was massive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aggressiveness in this razor seems to be a subject of debate. I&#x27;ll put it this way for me. It&#x27;s very mild on my skin, but the result of using it I can only say it&#x27;s aggressive on facial hair, the perfect combo for me. Aggressive on hair, mild on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps. Having used many razors, I can tell you I&#x27;ve landed on my final razor.&lt;br /&gt;I do use Feather blades &amp; highly recommend them. I would be careful of them in other razors as they are extremely sharp &amp; angles of blade and gap between the blade &amp; safety bar vary greatly between razors even if they don&#x27;t really look like they do. If you want to feel how sharp they are, cut a piece of thick paper with your old razor, then the Feather &amp; feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, don&#x27;t give up, you&#x27;ll cut yourself in the beginning no matter what razor you get, it will take about 3 weeks approx to get to a nick free shave. Try going with the grain and across the grain for a few weeks, later you can go against it if you skin allows it. Get yourself from Walmart, a $2 styptic pencil. Just wet the end and dab it on your nick, you&#x27;ll get a little sting for two seconds but it stops bleeding there and then with no scab, &amp; no need for tissue paper. Happy Shaving!!!</li>
    <li> If you want the best this is it.  This safety razor used with the excellent Feather blades is the smoothest closest shave I have experienced.  Expensive yes but the quality and function is well worth the cost</li>
    <li> I see a lot of posts stating how this razor is un-aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first safety razor, so I&#x27;m not one to know what other safety razors are like, however.&lt;br /&gt;Over the past few months I did notice the difficulty in getting at certain areas of stubble on my face with this razor, but one day I noticed the razor being very aggressive.  Mistakenly, I didn&#x27;t tighten the handle all the way in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I would tighten down the handle until it bottoms out, but now I will back off about a quarter turn or so.  This will reduce the amount of flex in the blade and allows the blade to protrude out a bit more.  The handle will still be tight enough to remain in place while shaving.  This little adjustment really changed the characteristic of my shaving experience with this razor.  My shaving times are lower, and my shave is much closer.  Once again, more practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please give it a try.  I would like to know if others have the same experience.</li>
    <li> It cuts the heck out of my face.  I get a better and safer shave with a disposable.  Now it&#x27;s an expensive paperweight.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor out there - its precise, deep and so so smooth. My dad used the same razor for the past 40 years. Also it has a balanced price compared to its german and American peers. I think Japanese steel is a notch above all others. Seki is really one double razor you should try before making up your mind about what razor is right for you.</li>
    <li> Two warring components of my brain clashed upon utilizing this, shall I say, \\&quot;sharp-looking\\&quot; razor (spoken slowly to add emphasis, reminiscent of Dr. Evil&#x27;s lip-pursed smirk). I was eventually enraged my first \\&quot;brush\\&quot; (Dr. Evil smirk) with the Seki Feather Razor. Adapted to the Edwin Jagger DE89lbl, I used the same angle using this razor. It glided like butter along my chubby Asian face. I could hardly hear it cut - what people raved about in their reviews. I almost cried during my first pass, when I would run a stream of water down the longest facet of the razor head, watching as if in slow mo the cascading waterfall, dancing in and out of the vented metal plate, babbling like the brook in that Coleridge poem. Or, the nuance of how the contour of the blade&#x27;s bottom plate directs the water&#x27;s stream through a major feat in hydrodynamic (is that a science term?) to thoroughly wash away every speck of shaving cream down to the molecular structure in 3.5 seconds. Then as I leaned in, grinned a big, teethy one, and ran my fingers along my jawline, my joker smile slowly drooped, then fell, into a pronounced frown. Sandpaper? Bristles? What the? It wasn&#x27;t a very close shave. Don&#x27;t panic! It&#x27;s just what it is when you go with the grain. During the third pass, earning the right to go against the grain, I bit my nails in anticipation (the first time my shave came with a manicure).    Bristles again!    First thought running through my mind: \\&quot;I wonder if I polished it and gently placed it back in the box, could I return it?\\&quot; Panic set in. My hands blindly felt for that damned glittery box, eyes and head straight fixed on my image in the mirror. Why did I leave the Edwin Jagger?! It scraped a little. It wasn&#x27;t nearly as smooth of a stroke. More skin irritation, maybe a small nick here and there. But it yielded a closer shave, even with a Derby. I&#x27;ve been tricked!    Reading more reviews, I squinted my eyes and mentally voiced profanities at those who beamed with pride over thecloseness of the Feather&#x27;s shave. I can picture them all laughing around me. Then a stroke of envy filled my satanic eyes upon the Adams and Eves of the shaving world. They must have that face curvature - undermined by my Asianness yet again! Too much chub.    Dipping into Amazon&#x27;s negative reviews on this product, my eyes fell upon a solution I should have thought up myself. Change the angle. Push a little into it. Break some rules, lad! My next shave, I did just that. I&#x27;m not good at Geometry, but I estimate that I tilted it from 35 degrees to at least 45 degrees. Probably more. I thought I would scrape so hard, it would spell the end of competition wet shaving for me.    But.    It would not, could not, scrape. With matching Feather blade and razor, I would go even as far to say it should not scrape you, despite the cliché that blades work differently from face to face. In fact, that shave I not only shifted to a bold angle, but I ventured to push in. And by the end, I had the smoothest shave I have ever had, including those straight razor days. Relieved, I was. But ultimately, conflicted. The traditional part of me felt I had to abandon fundamental technique to get that close shave.    Then at some point down the shaves, I told myself, \\&quot;Screw it! You only live once! Besides, rules are meant to be broken. Thou shalt let the blade shave the face. Rule, deleted. Thou shalt shave at a 25 to 40 degree angle. Rule, discontinued.\\&quot; Here is what I discovered in this Buddha journey of self-discovery. It may not be a bad thing that Feather gives a very wide spectrum of angles to experiment with. I&#x27;m no Wet Shave guru, but I may want to try shaving with the grain at a mild 30 degrees, and gradually increase the angle. Add more passes than the typical three, due to lack of skin irritation, and I may end up with a better shaving experience. No matter what, a higher degree just doesn&#x27;t seem to cut or scrape me. I&#x27;m not sure if I understood myself at the time, but I thought, \\&quot;This may be the safest safety razor ever.\\&quot;     And it turned out -- I did earn the closest shave I have ever had from this razor, to boot!    To make it sweeter, I didn&#x27;t have to break one commandment. The awkward angling was enough, and I discovered a few shaves later, I can still rake straight down and allow the razor to cut the hairs without having to push in. I was relieved. (When I felt compelled to push in, the Last Samurai in me wanted to fall to my knees, as ruthless assailants cut away at my ponytail.)</li>
    <li> This razor is extremely well-made- it&#x27;s actually quite beautiful of its own accord outside of its function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s helpful information, this was an upgrade for me from an Edwin Jager DE89LBl.&lt;br /&gt;I have only shaved with this razor twice since it arrived a few days ago, but the initial assessment is very good. I am usually unable to shave against the growth of my upper lip without considerable irritation, but this razor seems to be able to handle it. I am sure it will only get better as I adapt to shaving with this as opposed to the Edwin Jager I have been using for the last year or so as my entry-level DE razor. Something of note which I thought was interesting is that this razor holds blades differently from any other I have seen- but you can probably tell that from the photos. It also makes for a good means of pushing spent shaving cream and hair away from the cutting edge. What I didn&#x27;t realize is that while on my Edwin Jager the non-cutting sides of the blade extended beyond the sides of the razor head, this Feather razor covers the whole width of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers are correct in that this razor provides a more mild shave than most- at least more mild than a DE89 in my personal experience. I have somewhat sensitive skin on my face, so this is a plus for me. With the same number of passes (usually about 3 or 4- one or two down, one up, and one up and angled against the grain) as the Edwin Jager I get a closer shave with less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Proraso &amp;#34;White&amp;#34; (green tea and oatmeal extract) pre-shave cream, Taylor of Old Bond Street Jermyn Street sensitive shaving cream in cooperation with a best badger brush, and Dove aftershave lotion. It&#x27;s the best combination I&#x27;ve found after trying various permutations with different shaving creams and aftershave lotions. I haven&#x27;t tried any other pre-shave creams, but the Proraso seems pretty nice.</li>
    <li> I have coarse hair and very sensitive skin.  I had previously been using a Weber Stainless razor with Feather blades until I purchased this razor.  I like the Weber, but the difference is incredible.  The Feather Stainless is so smooth with Feather blades that I can hardly feel the razor gliding over my skin.  I only wish I had gotten over the sticker shop earlier.</li>
    <li> Best Shave ever. I have used Slant edge and regular Safety razors. I have read the pros and cons. This is without doubt the best I have used. It has a light feel yet the head is heavy. Sorry for all the bests, but it is. It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Great razor.... Plain and simple!!! I came from Mirco Touch One to and EDWIN JAGGER DE89L and finally to this beauty of a gem. This razor combined with a feather blade is so mild and yet mows down stubble like nobody&#x27;s business. I keep hearing how mild this is but that has NO BEARING what so ever on it&#x27;s ability to cut hair. This razor requires a steeper angle than others but once you get used to the fact this razor shaves like a dream!</li>
    <li> Razor is of great quality, it is made to last for a lifetime or more. The only problem is it took almost 2 weeks for the delivery. Other razor sites will deliver either overnight or in 2 days time.</li>
    <li> I have been blade shaving for over 50 years. I am far from a novice. My beard is just as heavy as it was when I was a teenager. My neck is the problem area. The hair lies very flat against the skin and the grain direction is lateral, across my neck from left to right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day the Edge arrived i marveled at what a beautiful razor it is. It is flawless. I hot-toweled my face and lathered up with my favorite brush and soap. I loaded the Edge with a Feather blade. It aligned perfectly and locked down securely. The blade does not extend out the sides of the razor. I like that it is covered like that. While shaving, I could scarcely feel the razor against my cheeks although I could easily hear the beard being cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pattern on the handle gives a good grip. The handle is narrower than on any other razor I&#x27;ve used. I found that I could hold it comfortably and it never tried to work its way out of my grasp. The shape of the head allows me to shave well around my nose with no nicks. It feels like I am using a precision instrument when I shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This the mildest DE razor I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used quite a few. As mild as this razor feels I am amazed that subsequent passes with open comb aggressive razors don&#x27;t knock down the stubble any further. Since the Seki shaves just as closely with far less irritation it is my razor of choice now. I am impressed. After years of shaving, I have found no better razor than this one. If I make a few more passes over the problem areas it gets close enough to satisfy me. This is exactly the same number it takes with my open comb Muhle except I am not red and irritated afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who may be interested, this razor fits perfectly in the Muhle razor stand which holds it securely and vertically as it should.in toss whether one highly rated razor will work better than another on YOUR face. I knew this beforehand, but chose to ignore it because I was so head-over-heels in love with the razor just from looking at the pictures and reading glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure that this razor is wonderful for others. I am also sure that it is perfectly awful for others. Perhaps one day somebody will make a ridiculously expensive beautiful razor that I can get excited about that will work on my beard. Until then, I am staying with my Merkur, if it will take me back.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money. I have from Merkur Progressives to electric Braun Series 7 to Dovo straight razors. But hands down Seki Edge Feather is the best razor for me.</li>
    <li> The combination of Feather blades and this razor makes for a shave that you hear, but don&#x27;t feel. It gives me the smoothest shave of any razor I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may say that this razor is too mild, but it is the only razor I have used with [[ASIN:B004RWTQTS Feather razor blades]] (generally recognized as the sharpest on the market) without a single nick or bump. It cut though a 5-day growth without clogging and with minimal need for second passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solid stainless steel construction makes this feel like a fine tool that will last a lifetime and beyond, unlike the chrome-plated Merkurs. True, it is almost jaw-droppingly expensive, but based on my experience with Merkur razors (my 38C is losing chrome after only 3 years of light use), I would probably need to buy at least 4 or 5 of those throughout my lifetime, whereas I am very confident that I will be able to leave this razor to my future grandchildren in my will; the cost is a wash, at worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades seat in the head precisely and they are perfectly centered. My Merkur shaves more aggressively on one side than the other because the blade does not center properly (either that or the head was cast off-center). Not so with the Feather: Both sides shave exactly the same, and the very slight curve to the blade makes it seem less springy, if that makes any sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are about the handle: 1) It is a bit thin--almost dainty--compared to my former favorite razor, the [[ASIN:3812028492 Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor 38C]]; and 2) there is no knob at the end of the handle, again, like the 38C, which would make it a bit easier to hold without fear of slippage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I use the Feather over the next 40 or 50 years, though, I expect I&#x27;ll get used to those small quirks and grow to love them. I hope the same is true for whoever is lucky enough to inherit this fine razor from me when I shuffle off this mortal coil.</li>
    <li> This razor is everything it&#x27;s known for. For the light to average beard the shaver will enjoy a smooth clean shave with few , if any, nicks or burn. The shaver with a very heavy beard might be disappointed with this razor unless they use Feather&#x27;s super sharp blades.  The high price puts this razor out of many shavers reach but if you can get your hands on one you will have a fine razor for life.</li>
    <li> I hesitated spending the money for this razor, but after reading all the reviews I decided to go for it.  I can honestly say I now enjoy the shaving experience.  It use to be more of a chore, but now I actually enjoy whipping up my own lather with a brush, massaging it onto my face, and getting an ever so close shave with the Feather Stainless Razor.  I got a couple of small nicks on the very first shave, but none since.  I&#x27;m a daily shaver, and I&#x27;m still on the first blade after over two weeks.  The Feather blades are very sharp.  The only problem I have...what to do with the box of unused disposable razors I was previously using.</li>
    <li> I waited 30 days before writing this review to ensure it was a consistent performer.  This feather razor is simply amazing! I grew up a wet shaver in the late 70s but followed my father to carts and electric. I finally returned a few months ago and this Feather makes my return incredibly great, to say the least.  It&#x27;s well balanced and cuts my whiskers like a dream. It&#x27;s makes a 2 pass DFS (darn fine shave)  almost effortless. And if I&#x27;m so inclined, I can go for a BBS (baby bottom smooth) by adding a third pass.   I only have superlatives about the AS-D2. While expensive, this razor is going to be in my family for generations.  The AS-D2 is perfect.</li>
    <li> Long story long....  I&#x27;ve been shaving with DE razors on and off for over 30 years.  For a few years I tried electric razors and fancy disposables  (This was while I couldn&#x27;t find my safety razor for a few years after moving..  it was in a box that got buried somehow - and I didn&#x27;t know where to look for a new safety razor or blades).  The results were frustrating enough that I gave up on shaving and just trimmed to a 8&#x27;oclock shadow with a beard trimmer.  I really missed shaving with a DE safety razor - Not necessarily just regarding the quality of the shave but the quality of the experience - DE razors don&#x27;t require beating the crap out of the handle on the sink edge to get them unclogged.  They just never clog up.  Finally I came across a cutlery store in a mall that had some spendy DE razors... after some cringing at the cost I bought a Merkur Futur.  Great razor, adjustable, a very cool feature - even with (what I now think of as crappy) merkur blades.  I just never could go against the grain (ATG).  ATG caused a lot of neck irritation for me.  Not knowing any better I accepted the advantages of DE shaving and stuck to with the grain shaving (WTG).  Recently I came across some shaving vids online and thought maybe I could improve my technique and try ATG shaving again - since this is the way to get a really smooth shave.  I still failed with the merkur - even on the mildest settings I was getting too much razor burn..  and by now this was with the Astra blades (far better than merkur).  Astra blades were a big leap in enjoyment with the merkur - no more tugging on my lip whiskers.  Still, I wanted to get smoother with ATG shaving but didn&#x27;t want the irritation.    Zoom forward..  I added a shaving cream scuttle, silvertip badger brush, pre shave oil, some quality shaving cream.  Still not the greatest results.  I don&#x27;t know if this had anything to do with it - but the merkur adjustable head had a little slop and allowed the head and back plate to shift ever soslightly.  Looking at photos of the Feather&#x27;s head I believed that if it was executed properly the locking slot design of the head and back plate should make this a really precision instrument.  Well - it is.  It&#x27;s a thing of beauty and a work of art.  It shaves mildly but with the uber sharp feather blades it&#x27;s the right combination.  Razor burn disappeared right away and I&#x27;m getting the closest shave ever without irritation.  The slim head makes getting whiskers under the nose quite a bit easier than the bulkier merkur futur. This thing isn&#x27;t cheap but the way I see it - not buying cartridges, it pays for itself in under a year $$, and it pays for itself quicker than that in the quality of the experience.  It&#x27;s just a part of the overall shaving kit but a very important part.  I like it so much I&#x27;m going to buy another for travel.    In all fairness the merkur may have performed better with the feather blades, but I&#x27;m positively enjoying the feather.</li>
    <li> I found a Gillette 195 fat boy razor produced from 1957 to 1961 in an antique store years ago and tried it a couple of times and wondered how people used to shave with these back in the day.  Jump to today I saw youtube videos on proper DE razor shaving techniques and decided to give it a try again with Feather blades. After learning the proper shaving techniques I got a lot more comfortable shaving with the Gillette razor. However the 195 razor was unforgiving and I would get nicks and razor burn if I was not paying complete attention to every stroke. After reading the Seki Feather reviews I decided to give it a try. It was like night and day. The Seki gave me a close, comfortable, and forgiving shave with no nicks or razor burn using the Feather blades. I think the combination of learning proper DE shaving technique and the better engineering and tighter tolerances of this razor make for a forgiving, smooth, and comfortable shave that I did not think was possible for a DE razor. I am now hooked on DE razors thanks to the Seki Feather. It’s a lot to pay up front but at 50 cents a blade it will pay for itself. Those 5 bladed Gillette’s are truly the best blades that modern shaving technology has to offer but at 4 dollars each they add up.</li>
    <li> This razor to me is perfection. Yes it&#x27;s expensive. But it&#x27;s 100% worth it. It&#x27;s just awesome to look at, feels perfect in my hand, and shaves delightfully. I did some research on it before I made the investment. And I found out that it is mild shaver, which surprised me because I know feather blades to be the sharpest around. I was a bit worried about how it would shave but I bought it anyway, and you don&#x27;t feel it at all like you do a more aggressive razor. Yet the sharpness of the feather blades provided the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I absolutely recommend you invest in this razor.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to let everyone know that that this is the AS-D2 even though the pic is of the AS-D1 and in my opinion its a great razor.</li>
