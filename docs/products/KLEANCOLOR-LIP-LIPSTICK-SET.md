<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> So, first and foremost, these lipsticks DO work. The color shows up, although some colors are thinner than others. These lipsticks in general are very soft and will smear easily, but the pigment is very clear and you don&#x27;t need to put half a stick on for them to show. My favorite colors are the darker blues, greens and purples, as they have a tiny bit of a sheen to them. The yellow in particular is very thin, so you&#x27;ll need a few swipes for it to show. The darker green is a different tint than I expected, but it still looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do also have a floral scent to them, which might be too strong for some. This might be the &amp;#34;play-dough smell&amp;#34; other people have mentioned. It isn&#x27;t overwhelming to me, but I can&#x27;t speak for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint is with the condition they were in upon arrival. The orange was absolutely smashed to pieces, like someone had put the cap on after fully unscrewing it. However, these lipsticks are sealed to keep them from unscrewing, so I have no idea how this happened. Some of the others had their tips smushed in similarly, but the orange is the only one that&#x27;s difficult to use because of it. I found this rather disappointing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing: The lipstick works fine, it&#x27;s the way that it was handled by the manufacturer that bothers me.</li>
    <li> Very unique colors that go on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Not what i was expecting gave it to my kids its lime kid makeup</li>
    <li> Received all colors in product advertisement. The orange color broke on first application and was rendered useless.</li>
    <li> Colors are awesome exactly what I was looking for and came fast</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. When these arrived, most of them looked like a toddler rolled it up with the cap on. They were gross and melted, and smushed all at the top.  I don&#x27;t know if they became like this during shipping or what. The few that were still intact were very light and needed to be reapplied every 20 minutes. I will be returning these, which is a shame because online they look like very fun colors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this product! All of the colors look great on my skintone (except maybe the lightest pink but it&#x27;s not bad). The pigments are pretty solid, though first application needs to be a bit heavier for more opacity. Lightly patting a translucent powder over the first application helps to both mattify it and make it stay on longer. all in all i highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When recieved, all lipsticks were broken. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Awesome colourful lipstick, some colours are slightly thin though</li>
    <li> These lipsticks are really cute I recommend using a base color similar to the color you&#x27;re going to apply such as a lip liner</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like them at all ....</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these! Color is super vibrant and it was delivered much faster than expected.</li>
    <li> Love the colors. Love the smell of them. HAAAATE the oily texture. They feel like they are seeping outside your lip line, and they don&#x27;t go on nearly as colorful as they look. However, they do make a good base coat, then if you take vibrant eye shadow and pat a small layer over the lipstick, it does a good job. I&#x27;d just say &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34; and won&#x27;t buy them myself...But as a gift....Oh well.</li>
    <li> Colors are nice, not as long-lasting...but that was expected. Packaging was exact as pictured.</li>
    <li> Eh, the lipsticks are oily and not very usable. The colors are alright.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I shipped extremely fast and my daughter loved it!!</li>
    <li> These were fantastic. They go on so smoothly and last a while. They are not sheer at all, they cover your lips completely.</li>
    <li> This are amazing beautiful I love them the color are just what I expected to be</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter, she is a runway model.the colors are bright, bold and beautiful . great product</li>
    <li> All 12 are there! I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised, as I was expecting a lot of the colors to be see-through and need several layers. All only need to be applied once-except for the two greens. A great deal for the price. Not five stars because some of the lipsticks broke off and stuck to the top. My order was fulfilled by Amazon and it was a hot day-who knows what the issue was. Otherwise, a great deal!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, but a little TOO creamy. It feels more like a gloss.</li>
    <li> I just received these about 10 minutes ago, and every single one was broken. It looks like they fell apart in production and were hastily shoved back together and then had the sticker put on to keep the lid on. I immediately called Amazon customer service and am receiving a full refund. Don&#x27;t waste your time, I know the price is good, but save the money and get MAC, NYX or OCC</li>
    <li> Buying These lipsticks are like buying play makeup for a 3 year old. I felt like I was rubbing a crayon on my face. They are not smooth at all, very gritty. You have to rub them on really hard just for the color to show up and they still look terrible</li>
    <li> They Are All Pretty Colors They Look Amazing</li>
    <li> Really poor quality -- might be good for kids playing w/ makeup or something but shouldn&#x27;t be used for anyone over the age of 10 probably</li>
    <li> They smell great. Very wearable and conditions my lips too.</li>
    <li> love the colors! made my lips so soft, they smell devine also. :) just amazing id buy them again.</li>
    <li> Nice. It&#x27;s exactly what I expected. I already knew what the quality would be like, so I&#x27;m not disappointed. There&#x27;s ways of making it look like top quality. It&#x27;s a little extra work but I&#x27;m ok with that. A couple melted off the base, but that&#x27;s OK. It&#x27;s hot here and I just stuck them in the bridge to harden them. Other than that I liked hot the lipsticks felt on my skin, and I actually like when lipstick is a little translucent.</li>
    <li> Half of rhe lipsticks fell out and got smushed in the cap...</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful when applied over a white lip primer, however they have a strange smell... I don&#x27;t know quite how to describe it, the best i can come up with is Froot Loops, 3 days past due milk, and wax.</li>
    <li> They are more like chapstick. They are really transparent and watery.</li>
    <li> So many colors, so few accessories.  These are playful and have a nice taste.  They apply easily and stay on for hours.  Lots of fun.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on long, and doesn&#x27;t cover well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 12 year old niece. She loves it!</li>
    <li> this reminds me of the lip sticks that came in little girls makeup sets&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them, however, they&#x27;re fun to play with with my little one.</li>
    <li> Bag was open and 4 of 12 lipsticks were broken.</li>
    <li> I really like most of the colors, however, two of the lipsticks were damaged. Some colors seem more pigmented than others, as you can see from the photo attached, the yellow, green, and light green are somewhat sheer but they all apply very smoothly. I must say, the &amp;#34;creamier&amp;#34; colors (such as the purples and pinks) looked awesome.</li>
    <li> Colors are beautiful. Came earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> I love it and it is so cute when you get it you&#x27;ll be amazed</li>
    <li> Several lipstick tubes were broken when they arrived. Colors look great!!!</li>
    <li> They work on me. I&#x27;m not use to so much wetness on my lips. Buy n try for yourself</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m DONE, I don&#x27;t even know how u geys make these!! They r herroble, they are so sticky like a gluee steck. And I tried to melt it but I ended up burning my hair!!! That&#x27;s how bad it is!</li>
    <li> Not as opaque as I would like</li>
    <li> I like it but half of them were damaged :(</li>
    <li> this was so morsteriseing and soothing to the lips it made my lips soft and i dident think the colors would go on that clear but i was amazed if you want blue lips you get blue lips loved this product</li>
    <li> Love the colors and everything was in very good condition and me and my lil girl are enjoying them.. Thank you</li>
    <li> Some of the colors were great but there were other colors the weren&#x27;t opaque enough. they didn&#x27;t dry up my lips like other lipsticks though.</li>
    <li> Really don&#x27;t like how it looks when you put it on...doesn&#x27;t stick good to me...like all the colors I get though..</li>
    <li> I am pretty light skinned so I had little problem with the colors showing. The darker purple and darker blue aren&#x27;t as dark as I would like. I figured that may happen when I read other reviews. I also knew about some getting loose. Some were a little smashed at the tip, but I just pushed them back in.  The aloe keeps your lips from feeling dry, like with regular lipstick. I had to apply a little extra to get the colors a little deeper and even. I blended the mid range blue with a darker one from another brand. It was fantastic. Definitely worth the price. I would have given 5 stars if they came without being loose or smashed.</li>
    <li> Most of the lipsticks were broken. Colors are nice though.</li>
    <li> One came broken but the rest were fine. They go on easy but this is not your topical lipstick, it&#x27;s oily and you have to put on more than one coat to make it bold. It&#x27;s decent...</li>
    <li> Despite working just fine I only received a SINGLE tube of yellow and didn&#x27;t get 12. I feel fooled because I was expecting 12 tubes of various colors, not a single tube.</li>
    <li> Bought as play makeup for 7 yr old who loves makeup. She likes it. Some were melted when they came so that ticked me off but too much effort to try and return.</li>
    <li> Good product, just wish the colors were more vibrant.  After a few coats, they become more vibrant, however!</li>
    <li> Does not go on as expected. And is very waxy not very pigmented</li>
    <li> The colors were so sheer! also they have a really perfumy scent.</li>
    <li> worst product ever&lt;br /&gt;application/coverage&lt;br /&gt;you buy what you pay for</li>
    <li> I love the colors and have gotten great compliments.</li>
    <li> I bought these on a whim.  The texture is a bit chalkier than I expected, but at this price it&#x27;s okay.  Some colors need several swipes to build on the color, but it is at least buildable.  I was pleasantly surprised at how wearable the greens were!  These would be pretty topped with gloss.  They need frequent application only because they are not as opaque as some lipsticks.  They actually stayed on pretty well.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase them again because of the texture, but if you like the colors the set might be worth it for you.</li>
    <li> for the price, this is an awesome set to experiment with intense/bright non traditional lip colors. It&#x27;s super creamy, which seems to make the color uneven to apply, but with a little powder it can be brought to a nice matte, intense look. keep it on hand with a mirror though, as it does come off easily.</li>
    <li> The three color I wanted the most ended up melting or breaking by the time I got it. Kinda mad at the fact that I was given product I was not happy with.</li>
    <li> Great value. Bought for little girl dress up. Non irritating for all you fairy princesses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because 1/2 of the colors spread really well, while the other 1/2 is just terrible. I&#x27;m really liking the light purple right now. Smells nice, the Aloe Vera and Vitamin E is really soft.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors...Yes!! beautiful colors,are really  as the pictures,pleasant odor,very good seller,But l received my lipstiks very broken. Melted by the heat received during transit up here. Although I received my full refund l have liked to receive my product in optimal conditions</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a little sheer but hey. Who cares. 2 broke already :( but that was my fault. Overall I love them.</li>
    <li> This was not worth ordering it&#x27;s like the play lipstick for little girls that you buy from the dollar store I</li>
    <li> As one reviewer stated, the only colors worth purchasing are the lighter purples and pinks. The dark ones are just that: too dark. I&#x27;ve had dark lipsticks before, blue for example, but they did not make me look like a gothic hot mess. The one pictured here is one of the lighter pinks (I think the lightest, if I&#x27;m not mistaken.) I was only taking the picture to see how it looked on me. This one pictured, not one of my favorite pinks. Too light. However, in general it&#x27;s a decent buy, especially if you have a 7 year old daughter like me :) The yellow one, the green and the darker blues... eh &#x3D;|</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I expected. The lipsticks be loose. If not set up right, when I pick one up, it&#x27;s loose.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this product, I knew they wouldn&#x27;t be close to Lime Crime quality but was hoping that I could at least get some fun colors. I am not a &amp;#34;makeup snob&amp;#34;, I use mostly drugstore products every day and I&#x27;m not very picky when it comes to lipsticks. 3 of the lipsticks came smushed at the top so when I opened them they were not actually in the tube but stuck smashed to the top. I got them out and stuck them in the tube and cleaned off the tube and it&#x27;s been fine, but it&#x27;s always a bummer to receive badly packaged items. The lipsticks themselves all smell very strongly of PlayDoh and are VERY a greasy/oily, some to the point where barely any pigment was coming out besides a thin, lightly colored oily glaze (light green, yellow). The oiliness of the lipsticks causes some of them to skip over parts of your lips and expose your lip color. However, some of the pinks and purples are nice, although that&#x27;s not why I bought such a multicolored set. The dark blue and purple were quite thin and patchy but the color payoff was somewhat okay after lots of coats. The lipsticks smear and completely wipe off with any contact, they also never really &#x27;dry&#x27;, but I found dabbing some translucent powder helped that. Using a base (I used NYX jumbo pencil in milk) can help brighten them, and if you continue dabbing on powder and adding another layer of lipstick you can get a little bit darker color. Overall the lipsticks are less than a dollar in this set, you get some fun colors, and the others are pretty much unusable (although some are somewhat usable but you have to work with it.) The packaging is cute and I overall am satisfied with the price and some of the lipsticks. I&#x27;ll just have to learn to work with some of the others, not that I was that interested in the limegreen or dull yellow anyways.</li>
    <li> Love the colour omg coool</li>
    <li> leaves a funny taste in your mouth. i have to chew gum or eat a mint while wearing it.</li>
    <li> This colors are funky, like a smooth crayon. Fun for a night out or teens, loved it!</li>
    <li> Amazing quality for the price. All the colors are super pigmented with VERY high color payoff, extremely moisturizing and smooth on the lips. I will definitely buy again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I did a wrong feedback, I want to say that my niece loved the lipstick I gave her.</li>
    <li> Awesome for the price</li>
    <li> I love the colors. So many pretty colors im very pleased with this order I love btite colors. Reminds me of summer time.</li>
    <li> So I bought these because it is rare to find such fun colors at a bargain. Great deal and each lipstick came with a sticker seal to show no tampering. The safer colors in the rage are the orange and two darker pinks. The orange one Tingling Mimosa was a good stand alone color. but the two pinks where kind of streaky. They all have a slightly oily base and move around a lot on the lips, so with the more potent colors you may be able to wear them out for a quick trip, but I would dab a matching pigment or eye shadow over it to make it stay and make the color more vibrant.The yellow Lighting Struck and green Envious Desire broke in the tube when applying and where two of my favorites that had such difficult formulas. The pastel shades go on the best and are good stand alone. Still all the colors are shifty and the dark blue and purple along with the yellow and Magic Lime are the most difficult shades. Has a powdery floral scent and a soapy like taste.</li>
    <li> This lipsitcks are beautiful, they have lovely colors and the texture is very soft. I really like them.&lt;br /&gt;I recomended them.</li>
    <li> Thay was shipped very fast and I Love Love Love Love the colors only thing they don&#x27;t stay on very long if you eat or drink something</li>
    <li> I noticed if I apply chap stick prior before the lipstick it will stick better and have a smoother look. Some colors come on smoother than others...</li>
    <li> This was the best deal I&#x27;ve seen in these lipsticks and I&#x27;m enjoying them! Will buy more!</li>
    <li> The colors are unique and come on as pictured.  The product was exactly as described.  Have referred other friends to this product.  Like very much and I am an older woman!</li>
    <li> I did not recieve all of the colors shown. I have kleancolor lipstick i have purchased before and what i received doesn&#x27;t look like kleancolor lipstick. and its two of each color. not the variety shown. disappointed</li>
    <li> Only two of them arrived unbroken. The only colors that look good were purple and orange. Probably best to wear concealer or lip primer base, and blot a little once applying so it doesn&#x27;t get all over your teeth :( pretty disappointed though</li>
    <li> They are glossy  colors but I honestly like them I can wear them night and day</li>
    <li> I bought these from another website (Shop Miss A) where they&#x27;re a dollar a piece, and you get what you pay for, really. Only about two of them that I own actually go on correctly, but even those I had to use for several days in a row before they would go on and actually pigment my lips properly. I have two blue ones and a silver one, none of which go on right at all. I have a lighter pink and a dark purple, and they&#x27;re okay but need to be reapplied very often.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended, unless you&#x27;re buying some cheap makeup for a child who wants something to play with.</li>
    <li> I just received these today, the only two I&#x27;m not crazy about is the Magic Lime, and After Hours but I love the other 10.</li>
    <li> They all suck..EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS TOO LIGHT! I thought it would be like a matte but its very light on your lips.</li>
    <li> I adore this brand. I got my first set for Christmas and fell on absolute love. The colors are great, the formula feels so silky. I plan on growing my collection as much as I can.</li>
    <li> For the price, it was worth it. The colors are amazing! It isn&#x27;t a matte finish so do not expect for it to be. Its more creamy finish you often have to reapply every so often. 12 different colors to have fun with! A must have and for the price of 12, you&#x27;re actually getting a deal. Just for one its half of the price you&#x27;re receiving for 12!</li>
    <li> this product was listed with MOOD lipsticks and thought it was the same thing....NOT! I don&#x27;t need all of those ridiculous colors since they were listed where they should&#x27;t have been......</li>
    <li> The other reviews weren&#x27;t that good but the colors are better than I could imagine, worth it.( well, the discounted price</li>
    <li> All lipsticks were perfect and were not broken except for the lightest blue one, very disappointed cause i looked forward to it the most</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find all these colors in one set but I was shocked that it only took 2 days to arrive in perfect condition. The colors are vibrant and great quality!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the reviews until after I ordered this so I was really anxious for them to arrive as I didn&#x27;t know how good they would be. I must say I&#x27;m very happy. They don&#x27;t taste funny or smell weird to me. No bad feeling on my lips... And the color is very vibrant with just a couple passes over my lips. Very pleased!! None were broken and one of each color arrived. Btw the bottles are way cute!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I bought them for homestuck cosplay and yet I have an issue. Certain colors do not appear bright even if you apply multiple coats. Along with recieving the product, many of the items were smashed against the clear cap! I was disappointed with this because of the colors I needed were smashed. Great product, I would buy again but in hopes that they will come just as pictured.</li>
    <li> Only gave 4 stars because some had a some what perfumy smell, other then that no complaints</li>
    <li> Flirty tango is melted. 1 out of 12 not so bad. Love the colors! No way to contact seller😕</li>
    <li> Great lipstick, yet one was broken, and another one broke. otherwise, vibrant colors. but, it feels as it is made out of crayons. it does not blend, but great product.</li>
    <li> LOVE! I received every color shown. Packaging is a little different. Arrived earlier than expected. As for quality, we&#x27;re not to MAC standards here, but with a little lip primer these colors pop. As for the smell mentioned, it honestly doesn&#x27;t smell bad to me. Just a little like wax. Reminds me of those Halloween lipsticks you get as a kid. I definitely recommend these lippies and this seller. No complaints here!</li>
    <li> These are not as bright as I thought. Plus they don&#x27;t show up that good when on your lips. I wanted colors that Will be just as bright when you wearin it.</li>
    <li> Some of my lipsticks were broke. Colors are pretty. Some lipsticks smeared at the top,before I opened them</li>
    <li> I bought these four my 9 year old to play with but I&#x27;d use them too! They&#x27;re very creamy and easily melt so use them gently. The quality is good for the price. When u hit then some were melting into the lid a little but I tapped then down and stuck them in the freezer and now they are fine. I would only use them with a lip brush. Again, for the price they are a good buy. Not top quality but they work!</li>
    <li> I gave to my daughter as a gift.  She just loves all the colors.</li>
    <li> omg it was great they came packaged very well, and all the colors are very nice...the shipping time was before expected which is always a plus in my book!!!</li>
    <li> Has a funny smell and taste not happy!!!</li>
    <li> These are nasty! They stink and give up a nasty taste in your mouth. Save your money. The only good thing I can say is the colrs are fun.</li>
    <li> Highly pigmented!!!! But horrible plastic smell and taste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this two stars only because the the product is as described/depicted.  But, besides that, I personally will never buy these again. They smell bad, I don&#x27;t even know how to describe it. I do not recommend. Also, a few arrived broken.</li>
    <li> Goes on very transparent. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is not the best quality lipstick.  You definitely get what you pay for.  The colors are very bright and pretty although the lime green is gross.  The lipsticks don&#x27;t go on evenly, however, and show every crack and line on my lips.  I had to apply several times and it still didn&#x27;t look all that great.  They would probably make great &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; lipsticks for a little girl, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with Lime Crime for fun colored lipsticks from now on.  Oh and a lot of people have mentioned the smell, it didn&#x27;t really bother me.  Kind of reminded me of Play-Doh.</li>
    <li> it as a smell that i do not like</li>
    <li> Smells like playdough and has no pigment! It&#x27;s basically a lip gloss that tastes bad and smells terrible.</li>
    <li> Looks like some of the seals have been broken and seems some has been used , this is quite irresponsible on the part of this seller...i feel disgusted..</li>
    <li> The colors of the lipsticks are phenominal! They don&#x27;t apply very well though unless you use a base or something on your lips first. But I still like them very much! They smell and feel good too!</li>
    <li> Came in in perfect condition and smells nice which was in expected</li>
    <li> I love them soooooo much thanks :)</li>
    <li> I love the kleancolor lipstick all the colors in the amount that was shown in the picture came with it because sometimes it don&#x27;t be  so thumbs up for that!!</li>
    <li> my lip colors were all melted i had to throw 7 colors away</li>
    <li> this one I am very very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love ❤ the colors the smell is sweet 2 me the look of the sticks are pretty but I don&#x27;t like the chalky look on the lips that it gives but all in all its cool 😎</li>
    <li> This is my first odd color lipsticks,but i like it.Colors are very vibrant.You need lip base for good result.</li>
    <li> I just ordered some on Sunday and after reading the reviews, I&#x27;m just going to say this right now. I had better get exactly what I paid for, and that&#x27;s 1 of each color shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be cheating me out of what Im expecting because unlike some people, I don&#x27;t have a lot of money to waste. I have a baby to take care of and this is my Christmas present to myself.</li>
    <li> I originally got these for a neon party but none of the colors actually illuminate under the black light. As far as just having multiple colored lipsticks at a good price, it works.</li>
    <li> out of 12 colors only 1 was good. bad quality though. when i was trying them all on it was extremely cheap,,,</li>
    <li> I loved everything super smooth its so worth it if you love to be bold</li>
    <li> I was super happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I saw some very poor reviews about this product, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, the price was under $8! So I thought, &amp;#34;Might as well. As long as a few colors are workable, it&#x27;s worth it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got these, I was so happy! Shipping was fast, and all the colors were included (12 DIFFERENT colors, as pictured).&lt;br /&gt;No seals were broken, and all of the lipsticks had a fresh clean tip.&lt;br /&gt;But the moment of truth was the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say ALL of the colors are very workable.&lt;br /&gt;I see some ladies on here bashing on these lipsticks, well if you want the highest quality lipstick go with Limecrime.&lt;br /&gt;I own Limecrime, and will probably use these lipsticks just as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These aren&#x27;t as high of quality.&lt;br /&gt;But, if you:&lt;br /&gt;1. Exfoliate your lips before hand (The colors can make flakey lips obvious.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Prime the lips (I use my MAC Paint Pot in Painterly, but also tested my Elf lip primer, both get the job done.)&lt;br /&gt;ALSO NOTE: The dryer your lips are, the thicker the lipstick applies. The wetter they are, the streaker they apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Bring the lipstick in your purse if you&#x27;re going out (You may need to reapply later if you wear these out, or after eating and drinking.)&lt;br /&gt;If you follow these steps, you will get a great application out of these lipsticks, and they will look of a much higher quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is interesting. It reminds me of crayons, soap, and flowers. Oddly enough, I enjoy the smell.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is clean and sterile, instead of foul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is interesting too, kind of like sour candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am one happy customer. If you&#x27;re looking for fun colors at a cheaper price than Limecrime, or Nyx&#x27;s Macaron lipsticks, I highly recommend. Just keep in mind these babies are cheap, so some extra effort should be taken to get the most out of them.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous colors but deff need a primer to help stay on</li>
    <li> They smell a bit funky and are not as opaque as more expensive brands, but great for the price. The bright blue is wonderful</li>
    <li> Colors amudge very bleh size of sample lipstick</li>
    <li> I adore these. They are great. They are bright and vibrant and they smell like coconut oil, but doesn&#x27;t feel like oil. It goes on super soft and are vibrant. I love them. They arrived super fast and i an 100 % satisfied with my order and would totally buy again.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is cool</li>
    <li> The colors are very cute.  However, they are cheaply made and most of the lipsticks did break prior to me taking off the plastic.  You also have to put a lot on in order for it to show on your lips.</li>
    <li> Definitely get what you pay for with these, they are very nicely packaged and look great, everywhere but on your lips. they are quite oily and do not put on an even coat no matter how many layers you apply. They are scented and smell nice, i would recommend these as perhaps a little tykes &amp;#34;play make up&amp;#34; set if that.</li>
    <li> Nice colors,  but they taste  horrible and don&#x27;t last long on the lips.</li>
    <li> Colors are blotchy and don&#x27;t show up well</li>
    <li> Oil based not very good its like colored ChapStick</li>
    <li> Every lipstick except three of them, were disconnected from there bases, but with a little push they went back in. Very bold bright colors. Just what i wanted.</li>
    <li> the blue and green is the best</li>
    <li> I love the lipsticks!</li>
    <li> They are pretty bright....they are wet almost when you use them and they wear off quickly. When I got them half of them were broken.......</li>
    <li> Almost half of them came either broken or smushed!</li>
    <li> Great fun colors , smell good too. Just don&#x27;t let them get warm or sit in the sun they melt super easy!</li>
    <li> My daughter (aged 7) was desperate for some lipsticks and I chose these because of their light, sheer colors. They are perfect for her (once I had confiscated the brightest color for me which is also a lovely color).</li>
    <li> Five of the lipsticks were smudged when I got them, and three were broken.  I am very disappointed with the lipsticks that I got.</li>
    <li> it was alright i gave them to my daugther and the colors looked great on her, every color was beautiful on her.</li>
    <li> some colors are not what they should be. you have to apply a lip primer to get maximum results</li>
    <li> During shipping most where smashed up on lid. Color is thin best with a lip liner.</li>
    <li> I sent them back I really liked the colors but the had melted by the time I got them.</li>
    <li> Very liquidy. Very cheap. Like for a little girl. The dark purple and Blues are the only ones I will wear.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed on the seller, I got this product including 8 more L&#x27;oreal make up tools for a surprise for my girlfriend, and it turned out to be turned because they couldn&#x27;t find the address when the other 7 products are being delivered tomorrow.</li>
    <li> I just did a swatch of every color on my hand. They colors are muted and translucent. Makeup is not supposed to smell like this. Very chemically sweet smell that I would never put near my lips. The tubes say made in China which worries me because Chinese manufacturers get cited for tainted makeup all the time. Save your money and invest good quality stuff. I recommend hourglass, melt, kat von d, bite beauty, and kaoir cosmetics.</li>
    <li> bad smell&lt;br /&gt;dont like the color on my lips they arn&#x27;t smooth&lt;br /&gt;dont buy them unless u want neon lips</li>
    <li> Use these for photo shoots that need bold color. Still have to plot with extra tint on top to get the color I need. Not the worse lipsticks I&#x27;ve had, but do basically smell like play-dough, and does not work very well for long lasting wear. Reapplying always needed.</li>
    <li> The Kleancolor Femme Lipticks were great,good for the price.,great pigmentatio,nbold,bright,fun and for about a $1 a piece I think everyone should have it in their lipstick collection.Im very glad I purchased them!!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my almost-3-year-old who is obsessed with lipstick.  The color IS thin, but still looks just fine.  If you rub a couple times across your lips it&#x27;ll darken out.</li>
    <li> These go on smooth and are glossy so the color needs to be applied a little heavier than a standard lipstick. A couple broke in shipping but were easily put back in the tube. The two lighter blues are close in color but there are indeed 12 different colors. Since I had no preconceived expectations, I am very satisfied with the quality of these and the sale cost was unbeatable.</li>
    <li> very bad quality they were broken an the colors dont even show i do not recommend it</li>
    <li> love it all except when i opened the magic lime, the lipstick just fell out so they do need to definitely do something about that but everything else was awesome.</li>
    <li> Obsessed with all of the colors but the yellow. The pastels seemed to show up the most, and the darkest shades look great when the pastels are layered overtop</li>
    <li> Aboout four broke as I was applying the first time.  The light purple and light blue were sooo pretty on me.</li>
    <li> Way too much aloe. The color doesn&#x27;t come out nearly as vibrant as expected and the slimy texture is gruesome. I was so exited about these and I&#x27;m left terribly disappointed. It&#x27;s like little girl makeup that came in a Barbie kit instead of actual lipstick</li>
    <li> Nice bright colors that show up well on me. (I have a very light complexion) Everything arrived in good condition, but as soft as these lipsticks are I would advise caution in having them shipped to a very warm climate without making sure that you could get them inside immediately. They seem like they&#x27;d melt quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lipsticks do have a slight crayon odor, however it wasn&#x27;t enough to bother me. They wear off quickly. but that&#x27;s my experience with most lipsticks. I just keep the tube handy for a quick re-application.</li>
    <li> Hit or miss with the colors. Most of them go on very faint. Some of the lipsticks snapped off at the base. Cheap price, but as with many cosmetics, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Were nice colors, most of them showed pretty well, a few of the lipsticks were broken and unusable but that most likely happened during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Really creamy/oily lipsticks, almost feel like chapstick.</li>
    <li> Colors are not bright and shiny. They all has  dull whitish tent to them when applied. Lipstick stays on moderately.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them</li>
    <li> I was told that these lipsticks would go on opaque, but most are very transparent. I have to apply multiple coats to get a nice, even color. The dark blue especially is very light, though the purple works well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed because two of the twelve were distorted when they arrived so I called Amazon. Of course Amazon is amazing and they gave me a full refund and told me to keep the product. I put the distorted ones in the trash. I&#x27;m going to try to order another set again and see if I can get another full set. I want this set more for display than for wear. I know it sounds silly but it is what it is.</li>
    <li> The colors are so beautiful. I would use every single one. Every one of them came in tacked, which I was happy about and they all showed on nicely on my lips.</li>
    <li> I got this on a deal day so it was worth the price. One of the lipsticks was broken in half upon arrival, but it was the yellow one, so I did not return it or complain. The lipsticks break vary easily as I have found out from using them. They have broken while I was applying them... not hard or with the stick all the way rolled out. I applied it and some would just snap in half. Also they have a very distinct chemical taste/aftertaste when you put them on. On the good side the color is pretty vibrant and it would be hard to get such an array of colors in general, but especially all together in a bundle this was a decent buy.</li>
    <li> They were poor quality, the color doesn&#x27;t really show up at all, its like you put grease on your lips with a hint of color so needless to say I won&#x27;t be using them</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 5 year old to play with.</li>
    <li> I was so happy when these cane in the mail I just had to try them all out!! The shipping was super fast, the colors are awesome. They go on smooth and I absolutely LOVE this product. I must say I am very pleased with this seller and will definitely be ordering from them again. Their foundation palette and eye liners ar3 also AMAZING ^_^</li>
    <li> So! I have mostly good things to say about these lipsticks - most of them come out brilliantly! I LOVE the deeper blue, pastel pink, light and dark purples, dark green and orange especially. The tubes are really cute looking as well. The really light colors (yellow, light blue, neon green) came out a bit thin when applied normally, but I expect if I lightened my lips a tad with concealer and layered the color, that it would come out great. The dark green was a tiny bit pressed into the lid, but there was very little damage to it. I would press a bit of transparent powder onto it to help seal the color from any possible bleeding and help against constant reapplication, but a lip liner could probably do the job too. Overall, I love them, and they&#x27;re arranged in a nice rainbow on my desk. (:</li>
    <li> I dont see what all the guff is about in the lower rated comments. They have a sweet smell to them, yes. Its not off putting its just an aroma exists. They are a little on the greasy side but i am 100% okay with that. The colors are all vibrant. I lined my lips with matching eyeliners to bring the full effect of the lipstick. Ive been having a great time with them.</li>
    <li> The colors are fun, but this is only acceptable for halloween as the lickstick smells/tastes aweful.</li>
    <li> I like them...They just go on like cream makeup...so they don&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
    <li> These colors worked well for me I would of gave it a 5 but when the arrived the lipstick was falling out of the hole and I had to push them back in. But the colors themselves was very pretty.</li>
    <li> I Did Not Like These At All And I Would Not Recommend Them To Anyone! I Really Don&#x27;t Have Anything Else To Say But This Site Makes You Say More Ughhh</li>
    <li> I used to get these at the hair store, but they were cheaper than buying them all individual. I like to do makeup, so this was perfect for me. I got every color that was should. It came fast, which made me very happy. Great product. I would buy this again!</li>
    <li> Some of the colors like the yellow and the green are quite sheer but otherwise I absolutely love these lipsticks.</li>
    <li> I got these yesterday.  I&#x27;ve so far only tried a couple colors, purple being my favorite!  I got really disappointed when I tried one of the pinks, it was way too shear, reminded me of putting on a slightly tinted chapstick and it tastes like plato, strong fumes that are unpleasant.  But, later in the day I was trying the other colors and even gave my mom a few since I didn&#x27;t think I liked them and when she put on one of the light blues, I was like wow!  It really showed up bright on her lips.  So then I tried the purple and I love it, minus the smell/fumes/taste!  So, all in all I do love a few of the colors and if you put enough on of certain colors, the darker colors are the brightest.  I hate the taste/smell of them but these are pretty to look at.  This morning I put on my regular lipstick and put the dark purple on top and it looks really pretty.</li>
    <li> These Lipsticks are totally amazing</li>
    <li> I liked them, you have to put a base for some of them, like concealer or a lip primer, but all in all i was satisfied. For the price I was not expecting too much any way. I will recommend these. Low price and you can always figure out a way to make them pop alil more.</li>
    <li> I think their so cute, but the lighter colors did NOT show, they were very sheer especially the yellow. Other wise, they all applied on very nice, very creamy.</li>
    <li> They did not meet my expectations. They do not go on clear, they are heavy and the color shown is how they remain. I expected them to change into shades of red, pink, etc. I am only able to use three of the twelve that were shipped.</li>
    <li> So yes, I read the other reviews before buying this and wanted to try for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally think they smell great! And I do feel like they have the vitamins and stuff in it cos it did make my lips soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, yes they are a very light lipstick pack. I coated my lips several times to achieve a viable colored lip - but they do work - just have to add A LOT more than you usually would with a normal lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like them especially for the price - very reasonable for the diverse colors you can choose from.aw</li>
    <li> I hate this product literally</li>
    <li> Most came broken and only couple actually show up on lips.</li>
    <li> colors could have been more lighter but overall not too bad</li>
    <li> Gross smell. REALLY gross smell. Like toxic chemicals. I threw them away.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter on her 18th birthday, I could not find all these colors anywhere but Amazon, my baby LOVES them, AWESOME LIPSTICK COLORS, THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> These ladies are at the nearest beauty store, your welcome 1.49 each</li>
    <li> I expected it to be of a bad quality, and oh boy it was. I threw all of them out because of their nasty smell(smells like foul playdough). When I tried i, it got in my mouth and the nasty taste was there for hours. Do not buy. You will have to throw your money away. also when I tried it, I had to apply so many layers for it to show. I tried the blue on and it looked grey on my lips. BAD QUALITY WORSE SMELL EVER DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> I love the fun colors. However, you&#x27;ll need to put some kind of primer down first, whether you use eyemakeup primer, lip primer, or BB cream/ foundation. Otherwise the color won&#x27;t come through in the proper shade and it will smear. When you put it on it settles into those little lines on your lips and it quickly rubs away from the rest of your mouth. Overall these are very saturated colors, which I like alot, and the price is much cheaper then comparable brightly colored lipsticks, but I will have to wait to try these again once I get some proper lip primer.</li>
    <li> So love these. They are lighter than I thought like like lip gloss but they look adorable and are so fun to wear. You need lip liners though with them for all day wear.</li>
    <li> To be honest the lipstick is good but not great 3 of the came in messed up but I didn&#x27;t complain I mean it lipstick so anyways I fixed It u have to put a lot on then use a napkin to dap your lips once to make it look cute in my case these lipstick are not like something u should wear to a date or something it like lipsticks to take selfie with which wasn&#x27;t a problem to me so for all u people who don&#x27;t like to read the reviews u should because when I read the review two ppl said the same thing I said came in messed up so yea I wasn&#x27;t surprise to see that</li>
    <li> Will not be ordering again. Broken and worn lipstick is not what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Out of the twelve, 8 were damaged, and two were broken. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Well they smell good they look pretty... must reapply for better pigments... I guess I bought it because they are pretty :)</li>
    <li> My lipsticks are all melted</li>
    <li> Terrible,  greasy and taste terrible. Yucky, too cheap color shows on tissue  when removing. Lip gloss has more viscosity than this...I sorry but it&#x27;s bad...</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get these in the mail after debating on the purchase for several months! lol I like to play around with makeup and my daughter and I often do fashion or costume makeup for fun in our spare time. I tried every single one on and I&#x27;m very pleased! I knew they wouldn&#x27;t be perfect lipsticks, but the exceeded my expectations. Yes, some of the lipsticks arrived &amp;#34;damaged&amp;#34;, meaning they were jostled from their spot inside the container. A few hard slams on my table shook them loose and straight back down into their spot, so not a problem for me. I&#x27;ve included a picture with all the lipsticks shown and unedited in natural lighting. I would recommend dry lips and perhaps a base of primer to help it stay on. They smell kinda coconut like and are very slick/creamy. Adding some powder and then applying again might help staying power as well. If you want to try some crazy colors (most of which are surprisingly flattering!), I say go for it! :)</li>
    <li> Great!  But some of the lighter colors (the greens and yellow) don&#x27;t come out well.</li>
    <li> Kleancolor Lipstick everyone except for a few was broke fell right off as soon as I open...I guess you get what you pay for..</li>
    <li> Vibrant colors that I&#x27;m not going to wear very often, but nice for costuming. Product came in about 75% okay the last part was melted or smushed.</li>
    <li> The colors are ok, but made my granddaughters&#x27; lips break out. We are returning them.</li>
    <li> These lipsticks are very low quality. They go on like cream makeup and won&#x27;t last. The color is muted. The taste is HORRIBLE and lasts forever. Put this lipstick on and wiped it off immediately.. they taste like my grandmother&#x27;s perfume. When I opened one, the lipstick had broken off and was stuck in the cap.</li>
    <li> USED DURING A PHOTO SHOOT LOVED THEM...</li>
    <li> they are slimy and dont work at all, the colors arent opaque and they smear like crazy, wouldnt be worth the money if they cost 5 cents</li>
    <li> Delivery was on time, but one of the lipsticks came broken</li>
    <li> Great amount of colors and they stay on relatively well. My lips don&#x27;t get chapped with them too, but I guess because  they&#x27;re odd colored lipsticks that they don&#x27;t stay on perfectly throughout the day.</li>
    <li> The colors are very pigmented . Love them. Some did come broken ! Didn&#x27;t take long to recieve them!</li>
    <li> Luv all the colors and lipstick is nice and smooth</li>
    <li> They are better than some cheap lipstick sets I&#x27;ve encountered in my past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very awkward smell to it. A bit of a turn off to my nose but I will deal with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a total waste of money. But you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is going in my gift bags for NYE - I am ordering another set very soon just to have to give away</li>
    <li> I love it f what bi exspected tried simmering new and all colors look good on me lol</li>
</ol>
