<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fan of the regular rose balm, so decided to this.  The lid was really difficult to get off; eventually had to cut a small notch in the lid just so I could stop asking other people to open it for me.</li>
    <li> Where have you been all my life??? Amazing product!</li>
    <li> During the Spring/Summer months, my lips are nice and normal to the point where I almost don&#x27;t need chapstick. But during the winter/fall, my lips are CRAZY dry. I&#x27;m talking constant peeling, pain, cracking, you name it. I tried nivea, EOS, baby lips, blitz super intense moisturizer (which made it 100x worse), regular chapstick, EVERYTHING. Then I came across this. This wonderful little jar of healing. Mint and rose are coincidentally my favorite scents/tastes ever, so that&#x27;s a plus. I put it on and wait a bit and my lips are perfectly moisturized. I feel like I have baby lips, literally. Only complaint is that the packaging is HORRIBLE. So hard to get open when its freezing outside, and it&#x27;s unsanitary (I use my knuckles sometimes but still). And if I don&#x27;t constantly use this, my lips go back to being a dry hot mess. But that just goes with the weather. Regardless, this is the only product that has ever worked for me. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived in a timely manner and great price.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t rate this highly enough. Smells amazing, feels amazing (cool peppermint!), makes my lips super soft, and stays on for hours. Will be buying many more.</li>
    <li> Not a bad lip balm. Not sticky at all. It feels like petroleum jelly. Sometimes I have a hard time opening the tin, but other than that I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> love the scent and feel~ Will repurchase!</li>
    <li> Loved this for 20+ years!</li>
    <li> Dries my lips and smells like old ladies.</li>
    <li> Like it a lot :) good scent</li>
    <li> Still using it! Love it, and love the tin, although not too sanitary. Hate using my fingers</li>
    <li> using this balm is a nice experience. you feel fancy, and it works very well, freshens breath slightly.</li>
    <li> its like fancy vaseline for your lips. But it really works wonders on mine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty much petroleum jelly with a couple additions.  The rose gives it a nice scent and a very slight pink tone.  The mint gives a subtle cooling feeling. I like it, but it&#x27;s basically petroleum jelly and has a similar feel.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm! The texture is great the taste is great and the little tin pot it comes with is adorable! It is better than most balms chap sticks and petroleum jellies such as aquaphor, berts bees , blistex, and carmex. Those all have one ingredient responsible for drying out lips:&lt;br /&gt;Camphor. This lip balm has no camphor in it or lanolin which can also dry out lips. The only lip balm that can beat this is dr. Lipp natural nipple balm which is primary used for pregnant women&#x27;s breasts but can also be used on lips, elbows, cuticles and other areas like this balm.</li>
    <li> Although it was really hard for me to open it at the first time of using， but the result is great! It in fact works for not only my lip but also my whole face. Love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item after it was recommended by the Young wild and polished youtuber, Niceole rocks. Anyhow, this really works, i do apply it a few times a day, but then i like the way it leaves my lips soft and smooth. I started using sometime in the spring, after i had a few split lips with the weather changes. I am waiting to really test it in the summer.</li>
    <li> This product is just amazing!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I am so annoyed right now that I cannot wait to write a review for this product, even before trying it.  I just received this lip balm and was super excited to try it, yet here I am, 15 mins later STILL trying to open the container!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Its design is absolutely ridiculous and I have already chipped a nail trying to open it, with absolutely no luck!  How am I supposed to enjoy the lip balm everyone raves about if I cannot even open it to try it?  Will this be my daily battle trying to hydrate my lip?  I may change my rating if I ever get to use the product inside of this stupid tin can!!!!  Update:  A couple if weeks later, it is still a daily struggle to open the container, so I am not even enclined to use the product.</li>
    <li> I quite like this lip balm, although it isn&#x27;t what I expected. Shame on me for not noticing that it is made of petrolatum. I had assumed it was beeswax. That being said, it is quite soft and almost sticky to the touch. It sticks on lips well, and I also apply it on my nostrils when they&#x27;re dry because of a cold or allergies. The mint has a lightly tingly texture and the rose scent is mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only potential drawback I&#x27;ve found is with what to do with the residual balm on my finger after applying it. It sounds like a minute detail, but I don&#x27;t want oil stains on my clothes, especially if I put too much balm on my finger. It is a benefit that it stays on lips for so long, but is slightly more annoying when the oils won&#x27;t heave my fingertips.</li>
    <li> great. I didn&#x27;t expect it would be this soft on my lips. I love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best lips balm and it really smells good. I like it.</li>
    <li> This is great as a prep for red lipstick or just applied at night or prior to going outside in bad weather conditions. It feels amazing on my lips and you can get it online for a much better price than Sephora. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm! Generous size and just a hint of color! It immediately soothed my chapped lips. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is hands down my favorite lip balm. After experimenting with LOTS of other brands, EOS, Blistex, ChapStick, Burts Bee&#x27;s, Nivea... this is the one that I love the most. The smell is soooo nice; I love the combination of rose and menthol. It&#x27;s super moisturizing and I don&#x27;t need to reapply it as often as other lip balms I&#x27;ve tried. I probably reapply it 3-4 times a day. Usually I try a balm and it works for a few months, but my lips then get accustomed to it, almost as if my lips have become immune to it. I have gone through 5 tins of these (and each one lasts me 4 months) and they&#x27;re still as awesome as ever. Don&#x27;t leave these in a hot car because they will melt. But it did resolidify and it leveled out so that turned out to be a good thing. I was so sad when I lost one of these, and I had barely used it... I usually have 3 tins, one for my purse, one for my makeup vanity, and one in my work desk. Love these!!!</li>
    <li> I like this lip balm in that it works well to moisturize, but the color is quite pink. I dislike using my fingers to apply lip gloss, and the lid itself can be difficult to remove. It&#x27;s ok, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  The smell is nice though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this and only this for years now, It&#x27;s not too thick or sticky, and keeps my lips moisturized more than any other balm I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the most moisturizing balm, but its okay.  I would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these about two years ago and still had plenty left.  Unfortunately, I left it in my bag when I went to the beach and it melted shut.  This stuff is great and lasts forever!  Subtle tint and great minty feeling after you apply.</li>
    <li> I used to have a weird chapstick obsession. I&#x27;ve moved onto rosebud. Moisturizes, lasts a long time, comes in a large size. I recommend. It&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon too.</li>
    <li> I love the flavour and smell of this lip balm. The only reason I removed a star is because for basically colored vaseline, this is expensive.</li>
    <li> Perfect lip balm!  My favorite and I have tried many!  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the tin is very hard to open!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I love it.</li>
    <li> somehow this is  irritating my throat, as using at night treatment to smooth my lips.&lt;br /&gt;it has caused burning  sensation sore throat and even stuff-nose- sinus infection</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of this product for my lips. The mint made it really drying and mildly irritating. It smells nice, but having to apply it so frequently was annoying. HOWEVER! This product is amazing as a cuticle balm. Cotton Seed oil is also in Essie&#x27;s Cuticle oil, but the extra ingredients in this make it absorb a lot better. I&#x27;ll probably repurchase for my cuticles but not my lips.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find a comparable lip balm! The Minted Rose happens to be my favorite since it leaves a lasting cool minty flavor. One tin lasts me a solid month or two; well worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product but the lid keeps getting stuck, wish they would come up with better container&lt;br /&gt;But I still use it everyday</li>
    <li> Love this stuff I put it on everything from chapped lips to cuts . Helps with healing corns and callouses. Dry cracked skin.</li>
    <li> I like the texture and lasting power, but I had to take away a star for the packaging. The whole vintage tin thing may be aesthetically pleasing and all, but it makes it beyond difficult to open sometimes. I may wind up wrapping rubber bands around the top and bottom to make it easier to open.</li>
    <li> I like it but it gets melty in the heat &amp; then it moves around in the tin container. I opened it yesterday &amp; the balm was half up the top &amp; half down the bottom. It caused a little mess.</li>
    <li> I love this gloss because it&#x27;s so smooth and not greasy or sticky at all. It feels nice on the lips and has a minty cool sensation. One of my absolute favorite beauty products.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very nice ,i like it very much,this lip cream smells good,i&#x27;ll buy it next time if more cheap  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</li>
    <li> Shipped super fast and has a lovely scent. Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff!  I will always keep some in my purse.  As long as I have used this product it is smooth and very soft not too oily and not too sticky.</li>
    <li> My lips get chapped pretty easily.  I used to use Nivea Medicated for years and it worked pretty well but winters in NYC make my lips feel like sandpaper.  I received my first jar from a co-worker and it worked like a charm this past winter.  I apply 2-3 times a day and it keeps my lips hydrated for hours without a greasy feel.  This has a mint feel to it but its not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Having extremely chapped lips, I am always on the lookout for a holy grail lip balm.  I wouldn&#x27;t consider this holy grail, but it kind of close.  So far, this product makes my lips feel the smoothest and most moisturized compared to all the others.  The product moves around a lot and will spread to other areas and needs to be reapplied more frequently than I would like.  So, I will still be on the hunt for a perfect lip balm.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t open the friggin&#x27; thing!!!!  finally, opened it. ridiculous.  so far, it feels good on my lips. we&#x27;ll see if it lasts. but please, please, please make it easier to open</li>
    <li> Found this lip balm from a friend and hands down better than any other lip balm I have used (Burt&#x27;s, Bath &amp; Body, EOS, VS, etc.). My chapped lips are always better when I use this!</li>
    <li> love how it looks when applied to your lips</li>
    <li> I finally found my perfect Lip balm. I tried lot of varieties (Vaseline, body shop, ....)but nothing worked for my dry and cracked lips. This lip balm has a light minted flavor with rose texture and I love it. When you first apply it will be moist  and greasy and after couple of minutes it gives perfect tint and moisture as required. I highly recommend this product for any dry lips.</li>
    <li> One of my cases didn&#x27;t open properly. However, that was a one-time flaw. This is a wonderful product, and the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Product lost its texture during shipping. Container is difficult to open and the balm is more like a sticky goop. Smells good though.</li>
    <li> one of the best balm I used</li>
    <li> Awesome salve! Keeps my lips moisturized throughout the day and there is a TON of product in here! Definitely going to be a staple for the upcoming winter season!</li>
    <li> bought this after searching around for a highly touted lip balm and this appeared in most top reviews . This does a great job. You get a lot of product in this tub (it&#x27;s filled right up) and a little goes a very long way. The finish is a bit shiny, I suppose from all the oil ingredients, and with great slip. I usually use this before I go to bed and where I previously had really chapped lips when I woke up, this solved this perfectly. There is a nice tingling when applied (just gives me an inexplicable sense that it&#x27;s really working) but goes away after a while.The product looks tinted but goes on clear, so this makes a perfect gift to the dudes as well. I gave my bf this and he uses it religiously as well.&lt;br /&gt;One minor quibble is that the tin is SO tight. I had to pry it open with a knife. Had the brilliant idea to &#x27;lubricate&#x27; the edges with some of the balm.DON&#x27;T. It seals it tighter than epoxy. I now have to leave it slightly ajar.&lt;br /&gt;Will repurchase when it finishes...whenever that is</li>
    <li> This is my favorite flavor.</li>
    <li> Not sure about its rank as one of the best out there but its does the job.</li>
    <li> This is relieving when you have dry lips but not very healing. Love the smell and feeling but I lean towards natural honey comb lip products for healing.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Came really fast!</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balm!</li>
    <li> One of my friends was complaining that no matter what she used on her lips, they were always chapped.  I bought her this lip balm to see if it worked better.  She says this is the best lip balm she&#x27;s ever used &amp; in addition works beautifully on her cuticles.  Since then, I bought more for myself and other friends.  Good find!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff....may even be slightly addicted. I love how the mint tingles on your lips. It&#x27;s a very slight blush color and one application lasts quite a bit. It&#x27;s practically all I use anymore (after 22 years of finally weaning off my bonnie bell obsession).</li>
    <li> Super soft kissable lips!!! This made my lips stay hydRated and free of dead skin peelings!! 👄</li>
    <li> It seemed to heal my seriously dry chapped lips in 2 days. It&#x27;s really good. I recommend this product 100%</li>
    <li> Love the texture and the not overbearing fragrance. Feels wonderful on my lips with a subtle pretty glow. May try another one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smooth and it goes on easily. My lips always feel soft when i use it I use it several times during the day and especially right before bed.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm! It&#x27;s so smooth and soft on your lips. I love the little tingle from the peppermint and it looks fantastic.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after seeing rave reviews online. Meh. It&#x27;s extremely difficult to open and I feel like my lips are more dry after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> My favorite lip gloss</li>
    <li> Rosebud Salve is the best balm for your chapped skin/face. It&#x27;s a lifesaver in the winter!&lt;br /&gt;1. If you have dry, chapped hands or cheeks in the winter, use Rosebud on them, and it de-chaps and protects those areas- makes it feel so much better.&lt;br /&gt;2. I use it on my lips at night, and they are so smooth in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;3. When I get a cold, I put it under my nose to prevent dry skin from blowing my nose frequently.&lt;br /&gt;4. I even put it on mild burns, and it helps alleviate the pain and promote healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose and Mint Rose are my favorite- they have very light and clean rose scents.&lt;br /&gt;Menthol is VERY minty.&lt;br /&gt;Strawberry is very sweet and artificial smelling.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I have used.  In fact, I don&#x27;t like lip balms because they feel like I&#x27;m putting wax on my lips.  Smith&#x27;s is smooth and gives just a little color, plus it smells and tastes like mint!  I like it so much that I have given it to my sister and a friend.  We all love it!</li>
    <li> My fella didn&#x27;t really believe he was addicted to a drugstore brand lip balm that comes in a little yellow pot until I asked him to just please try something else for a few days. He picked the Smith&#x27;s minted rose and it was only two days later that he agreed, yep, that Carmax stuff wasn&#x27;t as awesome as he&#x27;d always thought. He needs to use Smith&#x27;s less often than his previous stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smith&#x27;s minted rose is great. It does not transfer color to your lips, the scent is mild and not perfumy - it&#x27;s definitely not too &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; for my manly man. One minor warning - this product might be a bit softer than you&#x27;re used to. Approach with a gentle swipe, no need to press!</li>
    <li> although the product is good, the packaging is bad. At times, i find it difficult to open the product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having such problems with dry skin and chapped lips. I have to have something on at all times. This stuff is awesome. Love the smell and refreshing feel. It has great lasting power, which is essential for me.</li>
    <li> I found the name when I googled &amp;#34;Best lip balm ever&amp;#34; and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. I love the mintiness, the pretty smell, the texture...and most of all, how soft my lips are after I use it!!  This will definitely be one of my staples forever now.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I only bought this to help keep my lips moisturized through the night. I apply it before bed and it keeps my lips moisturized til I wake up! I wish it were easier to apply but I usually just use my finger to apply it and wash my hands after. In the morning, I usually just wipe my mouth on a towel to make sure all of it comes off. So far, it&#x27;s done a great job of doing what I want!</li>
    <li> I have tried many lip balms. All seem to have the same effect as the other one, which is a slight moisturizing effect while the lip balm remains on the lips but the effects fade. This one has almost a cooling effect when you first put it on. I don&#x27;t smell an extreme rose smell or an extreme mint smell. It smells almost like a medicated mint lip balm. I would recommend this lip balm. I myself love it and you get a good amount of this lip balm in this tin. Will absolutely repurchase this item.</li>
    <li> The lip balm is good, but it&#x27;s so hard to open the container so I hardly use it...</li>
    <li> I was super excited to get this product but was a bit disappointed after receiving it.  It goes on wonderfully smooth but smells nasty and has a foul flavor.  Don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing this again anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, gentle rose and mint smell and taste; light feel. A challenge to open, but worth the effort</li>
    <li> Had a hard time getting the tin open!  When I finally pried it open half went all over me and the counter!!!!  Liked the product but half went flying.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Works really well. Moisturizing</li>
    <li> Love this!  I use it morning and night.  The only problem is the lid is difficult to remove, so I leave it in a bathroom drawer with the lid halfway on, and do not carry it in my purse...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for good lip balm and this one is wonderful. It has a similar texture and consistency as Vaseline, but the minty feeling is great and it gives your lips the very slightest hint of a pink tint. I keep this by my bedside for night time moisturizing and it&#x27;s very soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this 5 stars if not for the fact that the tin was almost impossible to open. I actually considered returning it unopened, but after about half an hour of struggling with different techniques, I finally got the lid off, tried it out, and then immediately scooped it all out and into a different container. I know, it&#x27;s a lot of work for some lip balm, but I got stubborn about it. Anyway, no regrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro-tip: A sample sized honey jar makes for a perfect new container for this lip balm. Once I scooped it all into the jar, there were a lot of bubbles and gaps, so I melted it down by putting the jar into a bowl of hot water for a few minutes. Then I put the jar in the fridge for a while until it set again. It came out perfect and smooth! Now I can easily use this lip balm whenever I want, and I love it.</li>
    <li> friends said they love it</li>
    <li> Every household ought to have a few of these around all the time !</li>
    <li> Fantastic lip balm that has the amazing rose flavor I love with an added overlying mint that freshens my lips and my breath. It protects chapped lips very well and I noticed a difference after one application. Continued use yields soft lips without the greasy smears that most petroleum products leave. This product stays with me throughout the day with an tin on my nightstand as well!</li>
    <li> (Male reviewer, if that&#x27;s important to you.) I was introduced to the C.O. Bigelow rose salve by a friend and loved it. While ordering another little tin of that, I stumbled upon this one. The mint adds a really touch, and the rose scent is a bit lighter than the BIgelow, but this has replaced it as my go to! The mint is soothing for my very dry and perpetually cracked lips, which I should mention are rarely if ever dry and never cracked since I started using this. And I&#x27;ve tried everything from Burt&#x27;s Bees, Blistex, Desert Essence, etc. to Aquafor. It goes on easily and stays there forever. I&#x27;ve eaten and drank to be surprised when I went to reapply that I didn&#x27;t need to because it was still there. Not too oily either.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the scent that I remember from years ago. I used to love this product in high school. I know that&#x27;s now 7 years ago but I remember the rose scent being much stronger in this product. I also remember it being more soothing and less goopy. Wish it was how I remembered it.  Will not buy again.</li>
