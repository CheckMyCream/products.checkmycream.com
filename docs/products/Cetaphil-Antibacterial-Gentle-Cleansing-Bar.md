### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is the best face wash ever!</li>
      <li>I suffer from boils in one area of my body, and after seeing my GYN she told me about this incredible soap.</li>
      <li>Great lather and smell.</li>
      <li>and she loved it.</li>
      <li>It also leaves me feeling clean and it has a very pleasant smell.  </li>
      <li>But I&#x27;d honestly say the price is well worth it based on how wonderful this soap is.</li>
      <li>Best face soap for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Best soap for sensitive skin and face washing</li>
      <li>I love it and now use it all the time.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and feel of this soap when I&#x27;m in the shower.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this soap for many years.</li>
      <li>I love this soap.</li>
      <li>Only drawback is that it isn&#x27;t a deodorant soap so probably not for those who need that feature, BUT the chemicals that make a deodorant soap probably lead to the dryness I experienced.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, I love that it&#x27;s sudsy, and smells fresh, and rinses off well.</li>
      <li>makes my face feel clean without leaving residue</li>
      <li>Cleanses, but doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, and it feels and smell great.</li>
      <li>My skin feels far more hydrated</li>
      <li>It could also be that my face is more sensitive to the soap than hers.</li>
      <li>Cetaphil is the only thing that keeps them in check Just ordered more can not be with out it  Won&#x27;t be without it</li>
      <li>I promise you after a week, the boils will go away and stay away!&lt;br /&gt;Also, taking a hot bath in Epsom salt treats boils as well.</li>
      <li>A pit pricey, and doesn&#x27;t last long, but a great product and very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Normally I&#x27;d say antibacterial soaps are unnecessary for many people but after doing battle with a rash, this stuff and some tea tree oil cleared it up quite nicely..</li>
      <li>good gentle cleansing, non-drying, and non irritating to sensitive skin types without the overwhelming perfume of some soaps.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cetaphil Antibacterial Gentle Cleansing Bar,... Cetaphil  Love this soap, is Antibacterial, but still mild enough to use daily.</li>
      <li>I have skin that tends to dry up pretty easily after showering.  </li>
      <li>But after trying this soap, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>I normally use a face wash instead of soap, but I wanted to give this a try.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist  recommended that I use it for my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Not heavily laden with scent...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Luxurious creamy lather each and every time.  Not heavily laden with scent...just the&lt;br /&gt;way I like it.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil is my go to brand for a reason.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It&#x27;s not supposed to be scented but it still leaved you with a fresh smelling scent that is very subtle and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Best face soap for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a recommendation from a friend - I smelled it on her one day and she told this is what she&#x27;s been using and she loved it. I love the smell and feel of this soap when I&#x27;m in the shower. However, once I get out, my face feels incredibly dry. It says it is for face and body and my friend thought it had improved her (face) complexion after using it for a few weeks. It&#x27;s hard to know if my face dryness is from the soap or just the fact that it&#x27;s winter where I live and temperatures have been really low. It could also be that my face is more sensitive to the soap than hers. I normally use a face wash instead of soap, but I wanted to give this a try. I gave 4 starts because I&#x27;m not completely sure if the soap is drying me out. Otherwise, I love that it&#x27;s sudsy, and smells fresh, and rinses off well.</li>
    <li> Best soap for sensitive skin and face washing</li>
    <li> When you have an antibacterial soap that is dermatologist recommended,  you have a win-win.&lt;br /&gt;Very good gentle cleansing, non-drying, and non irritating to sensitive skin types without the overwhelming perfume of some soaps.&lt;br /&gt;Normally I&#x27;d say antibacterial soaps are unnecessary for many people but after doing battle with a rash, this stuff and some tea tree oil cleared it up quite nicely.. and when you find a product that works, you don&#x27;t stop using it.</li>
    <li> My face used to break out often.  Not after using this soap twice a day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for many years. I&#x27;ve noticed the packaging is the same, but the bar size has diminished.</li>
    <li> I am prone to boils I&#x27;ve tried everything Cetaphil is the only thing that keeps them in check Just ordered more can not be with out it  Won&#x27;t be without it</li>
    <li> I suffer from boils in one area of my body, and after seeing my GYN she told me about this incredible soap. Often I have used other antibacterial soaps to keep them away, like Dial, but they tend to dry my skin out. This soap is like Dove. Cleanses, but doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, and it feels and smell great. Anyone suffering from boils or cyst, need to use this soap. I promise you after a week, the boils will go away and stay away!&lt;br /&gt;Also, taking a hot bath in Epsom salt treats boils as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleansing bar for over ten year&#x27;s.  My dermatologist  recommended that I use it for my sensitive skin.  It is very moisturizing.  I use it on my body and face.  It is the best face wash ever!</li>
    <li> Made me break out everywhere. My body and my face.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil Antibacterial Gentle Cleansing Bar,... Cetaphil  Love this soap, is Antibacterial, but still mild enough to use daily.</li>
    <li> makes my face feel clean without leaving residue</li>
    <li> A pit pricey, and doesn&#x27;t last long, but a great product and very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I have skin that tends to dry up pretty easily after showering.  But after trying this soap, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a huge difference.  After getting out the shower, my skin isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as it is with every other soap or bath wash I&#x27;ve used.  My skin feels far more hydrated and I don&#x27;t have to coat myself in lotion per my usual routine. It also leaves me feeling clean and it has a very pleasant smell.  About the only thing I could almost complain about is the price.  Yes, its more expensive than regular soap.  But I&#x27;d honestly say the price is well worth it based on how wonderful this soap is.</li>
    <li> I began using this bar when regular soap was too drying and causing a rash during winter months. I love it and now use it all the time. Great lather and smell. Only drawback is that it isn&#x27;t a deodorant soap so probably not for those who need that feature, BUT the chemicals that make a deodorant soap probably lead to the dryness I experienced.  Give this product a try!</li>
