      <li>I love how it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
      <li>Goes on like a foundation and dries more like a powder.</li>
      <li>Just ok.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in LOVE with this foundation.</li>
      <li>I was searching for a natural finish foundation with good coverage for summer and wowza - this stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>but for a fraction of the cost I was paying at the spa.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light and perfect for every day use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite foundation.</li>
      <li>Very creamy &amp; feels like I payed a lot more for it than I did.</li>
      <li>Great color and texture, does not cake or get too dry, comes on just right.</li>
      <li>(I just ordered another bottle of a lighter shade for blending), but this formula just MELTS into your skin and is super buildable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve recently re-ordered it and am very pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>It covers very well and I will never buy anything else!!</li>
      <li>I have pretty clear skin, but my pores get clogged very easily</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what color I would be and emailed Treat-ur-skin and got an answer back within minutes!</li>
      <li>I usually pay $58 for a good foundation at Sephora</li>
      <li>have oily skin with large pores.</li>
      <li>quick tip in color matching - click on some of the other color options and a few of them have color pallets in their pictures so you can more easily pick the right shade.</li>
      <li>I really like this foundation plus</li>
      <li>Goes on so smooth and is just a terrific product.</li>
      <li>it ships fast.</li>
      <li>Much darker than expected and not really that happy with the application.  </li>
      <li>If you have combination skin and want to keep your pores unclogged, I highly recommend giving this a try!</li>
      <li>It was my first time ordering this foundation, and I must say I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>Seller shipped right on time and will definitely be ordering again...</li>
      <li>I was only guessing at which shade to use and somehow got it right.</li>
      <li>Very soft and natural looking, but covers well.</li>
      <li>but this one is just as good if not better!!!</li>
      <li>It blends well and looks natural.</li>
      <li>For reference I am light-skinned hispanic and got natural beige.</li>
      <li>The color chart I found online matches the product, but it does not nearly go on as dark as chart.</li>
      <li>I first learned about this product a few years ago at a spa in upstate New York.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very oily and usually get very shiny.</li>
      <li>I have combo skin with a complexion similar to Beyonce&#x27;s, and have tried countless foundations (ranging from cheap to SUPER expensive) over the years...</li>
      <li>however after a few months of using this foundation, I RARELY ever even get a minor blemish anymore.</li>
      <li>Covers very evenly, it&#x27;s a little thinker</li>

    <li> I first learned about this product a few years ago at a spa in upstate New York.&lt;br /&gt;One day they were out of my color so I opted to check online. Not only did I find it - but for a fraction of the cost I was paying at the spa.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light and perfect for every day use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
    <li> Not that thrilled with this foundation.  Much darker than expected and not really that happy with the application.  Just ok.</li>
    <li> Covers very evenly, it&#x27;s a little thinker than I&#x27;m use to so I blend it with another foundation and it&#x27;s soooo prefect. Goes on like a foundation and dries more like a powder.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful.  Goes on so smooth and is just a terrific product.</li>
