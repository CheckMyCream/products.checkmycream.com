    <li> It is small, make no mistake. Having said that I still think it&#x27;ll work for what I need, which is just hold my hair back while I wash. It&#x27;s very soft so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to worry about it making my hair frizzy. I&#x27;m considering cutting it, sewing the edges and putting Velcro. If you plan on wearing it for more than a facewash it may be too tight.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s great quality but too small. You have to have a pretty small head. Lol. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m only giving it 2 stars.</li>
    <li> really cute, however very small for an adult head...way too tight.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of people had issues with it being too small but I didn&#x27;t have that issue. I have a normal head but really thick hair and it fit perfectly. I even had 2 of my friends with different sizes heads and it fit them just fine too.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this way too small for our head! 太小了 带不上！</li>
    <li> This cloth band is perfect for keeping my hair out of my face when I do at home spa treatments and I just love how cute it is. Fits very snug but that&#x27;s what you want in an item like this. Very pleased with my order. :)</li>

    <li> Super cute, but a little small. Still works, but I have a small head.</li>
    <li> This product is garbage and matches their customer service quality level.  It is way too small and will not fit an adult head.  Also, if you try to return it you will need to pay for shipping to China and the seller will only reimburse 40% of the item value.  They also require a photograph to initiate any type of return process.  Do not buy anything from them and waste your time with them.</li>
    <li> This is VERY tight. More for kids than for adult women.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery got it much sooner than expected. Product however is a bit tight and lacks elasticity. Cute color and soft fabric though.</li>
