      <li>Best foundation I&#x27;ve found.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;d be happy to provide pictures.  </li>
      <li>It evens out skin tones and looks (I think) great.</li>
      <li>So glad Amazon had it for a great price.</li>
      <li>There are doubtless better products out there for what I want and need but given the price, I&#x27;ve not been compelled to stop buying it yet!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked the way it makes my skin feel and</li>
      <li>Cream makeup goes on so smooth!</li>

      <li>This make up is wonderful, it has spf and covers a lot of freckles and small age spots.  </li>
      <li>I really do like it better than anything else I have tried.  </li>
      <li>A quick blending and</li>
      <li>Using make up applicator sponges (latex free), I&#x27;ve found that this Covergirl &amp; Olay product is not difficult to apply but it&#x27;s thickness means that it drags somewhat.</li>
      <li>Sure enough they have it</li>

<li> Doesn&#x27;t look like heavy make up yet</li>
<li> Not a good experience.</li>

    <li> I love the moisturiazer mixed in with the foundation.</li>
    <li> This make up is wonderful, it has spf and covers a lot of freckles and small age spots.  I wish it were still available in stores!</li>
    <li> I rec&#x27;d eye concealer.  I like this product and did not send back because it feels good to put on around my eyes and looks good all day.  will order again.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for several years now.  I really do like it better than anything else I have tried.  I have tried several other products during&lt;br /&gt;the last couple of years but always return to this product.  It is a winner!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot and have used it for several years.  I buy 210 for winter and 215 for summer</li>
    <li> Having used this product for years (Ellen initially got me onto it), I must say I can count on it. I wish it was a little moister application, however. I think they could improve upon that feature. Using make up applicator sponges (latex free), I&#x27;ve found that this Covergirl &amp; Olay product is not difficult to apply but it&#x27;s thickness means that it drags somewhat. I&#x27;m always surprised when I remove it at night just how much I get off my face. By that time, hours after applying, it also has a slightly orangey cast to it. I wonder if that&#x27;s inherent in the formula. due to air pollution or simply the resulting impact of &#x27;riding&#x27; on my face for hours. Nonetheless, I use Eucerin and soft tissues to gently remove the make-up followed by cotton make up pads moistened by a deep cleaning toner. There are doubtless better products out there for what I want and need but given the price, I&#x27;ve not been compelled to stop buying it yet!</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for a few years and the price at Amazon is extremely reasonable.  If you have the skin tone number you need, there is no difference online from retail.</li>
    <li> This color has been hard to find locally so I decided to check Amazon out!  Sure enough they have it (is there anything they don&#x27;t have?!?!) and the price was better than purchasing locally!  Its a product that I like and plan to continue to use for years--as long as I can find it!  I&#x27;ve always liked the way it makes my skin feel and its barely there!  It evens out skin tones and looks (I think) great.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years. It&#x27;s reasonably priced on the Internet and expensive in the store, but you have to know your color before ordering.  I put on my moisturizer, then with still-creamy fingers, put this on immediately after.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a little dry.</li>
    <li> The product arrived with the seal broken, and the makeup was either melted because it wasn&#x27;t packaged correctly, or it wasn&#x27;t stored properly.  I&#x27;d be happy to provide pictures.  Not a good experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got those age spots on my forehead and this covers them without looking caking.  A quick blending and I&#x27;m &#x27;fresh and clear&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Cream makeup goes on so smooth!</li>
    <li> I was searching for this color in the Simply Ageless Foundation but couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. So glad Amazon had it for a great price. It&#x27;s perfect for my fair skin that has a bit of a tan during summer.</li>
    <li> Best foundation I&#x27;ve found.  Doesn&#x27;t look like heavy make up yet covers completely!</li>
    <li> Its the only foundation that I will use and have used for awhile now. Goes on smooth and lasts all day. Covers well - just love Covergirl &amp; Olay Simply Ageless Foundation.</li>
    <li> The 2 star review is deceiving. It was based on my third purchase.  On two occasions I ordered from Amazon and was pleased with the product.  However, the last time the foundation was not effective.  The product was dried and not as creamy as it should be.  It seemed to be old and or left in heat to dry.  Thus, I will not be ordering this product from Amazon in the future.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and will be buying it from local stores in the future.</li>
