      <li>, well, let&#x27;s just say it could smell not so nice</li>
      <li>I have really liked Nexxus products in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I really liked this conditioner.</li>
      <li>My hair felt nice and looked nice</li>

      <li>Best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
      <li>She has been using it for a couple of weeks, and so far, she is very happy with this fountain of Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner!</li>
      <li>and I honestly think it works better.</li>
      <li>But I liked the Tresemme results so much better</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t mind spending more, then this is a nice conditioner.</li>
      <li>As with all Nexxus products, it smells wonderful, and my  leaves my hart very soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I would have figured out a better way to say it)</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner is just okay.</li>
      <li>Renewal\\&quot; claims that it will help overprocessed, damaged, and thinning hair achieve a more healthy, shiny, and stronger consistency.</li>
      <li>I tried the entire line, the elixir does nothing, but the shampoo and conditioner are awesome.</li>
      <li>The Nexxus Youth Renewal Conditioner not only smells heavenly but leaves your hair feeling absolutely wonderful.  </li>
      <li>After a week of use, my hair is not glossier, fuller or more radiant.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light conditioner and smells nice.</li>
      <li>conditioner smells great, floral but not overpowering, and leaves my hair feeling really soft and nice.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells and the way it makes my hair smell.  </li>
      <li>so this makes me even more grateful.</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t use conditioner that often, but i love this.</li>
      <li>but there are better products for addressing them.</li>
      <li>and she would still use it. :)</li>
      <li>Her hair has been getting thinner, and so she is very happy to have some of the thickness and fullness back.</li>
      <li>I fear that I will not be able to find this anymore.</li>
      <li>that I use that all the time and don&#x27;t use the Nexxus any more.  </li>
      <li>As always, Nexxus has outdone most of the competition.  </li>
      <li>and my hair has never been in better condition.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good option for anyone willing to pay the price.</li>
      <li>All of that is great, but as I said, no one thought it performed noticeably better than any other good shampoo/conditioner combo, so we don&#x27;t have anything against it, but probably won&#x27;t be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>More importantly, the results were great: my hair (which leans towards being dry) was nicely moisterized and sported a healthy shine.  </li>
      <li>It does seem to have more volume, so if that&#x27;s your primary need, it may work for you, but as for me, I&#x27;ll be sticking with my Hydralight.</li>
      <li>The consensus on this one is that it&#x27;s a good shampoo and conditioner, but not noticeably better than any of the other good over the counter</li>
      <li>Very mild fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger...</li>
      <li>The fragrance is not as strong as the matching shampoo.</li>
      <li>I truly enjoyed using the Amazon sample of this fine product and will have no hesitation seeking out a new supply at my own expense.</li>
      <li>A mild, pleasant scent and decent but not-too-heavy texture made this Nexxus conditioner a pleasure to use.  </li>
      <li>I have used many conditioners low to high price point - Nexxus conditioner is the best - in fact the shampoo rates the same - great product.</li>
      <li>have fine hair so usually light weight conditioners work well for me</li>
      <li>Maybe sulfate free?</li>
      <li>/&gt;Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner is a great conditioner overall, even without seeing and drastic changes or improvements to my hair.</li>
      <li>I used to find it in CVS, Walgreens, WalMart, etc – it was widely available.</li>
      <li>But as it has been nearly a year, I have faith that this line will continue to keep my hair in good shape.   </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rename this in the style of &amp;#34;the detangler,&amp;#34; though I know that 1) that particular name has been taken and 2) selling youth in a bottle is always popular.</li>
      <li>Even at the end of the next day it still leaves your hair smelling good and feeling clean.</li>
      <li>Fast forward many years, add a career and children and my hair is no longer what it used to be.</li>
      <li>Since that texture has remained with my hair, good conditioning is key.  </li>
      <li>conditioner has a mild fragrance, and together with the shampoo, leaves hair clean, manageable, bouncy and shiny.  </li>
      <li>The result was nice: my hair was soft and silky.</li>
      <li>What it does is keep it healthy, light (not weighed down), clean, and because it is healthy and fully but lightly conditioned, it does have more volume and appears to have just slightly more hair (which I believe is a visual effect).   </li>
      <li>This lightly moisturizing conditioner works nicely with the matching shampoo for occasional use.  </li>
      <li>&quot; My wife is very reasonable, and so she tried it.....and lady luck was sitting on my shoulder!</li>
      <li>for several months and love the way it conditions my hair, and decided to try the Youth Renewal formulation in the hopes that it would give me the same great conditioning while adding some brightness and shine to my faded blond hair.</li>
      <li>; the shine is great and nothing feels weighed down.  </li>
      <li>It is quite conditioning, almost as much as the post home hair color conditioner I use, yet rinses cleanly and leaves my hair feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>I definitely don&#x27;t see any more shine or added color vibrancy, and honestly, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as soft and smooth as with the Hydralight either.</li>
      <li>This conditioner feels silky smooth going in (not waxy/gunky like some others) and rinses out easily and completely.</li>
      <li>This is also great for everyday.</li>
      <li>: The favorite in our comparison so far, has been [[ASIN:B00A0IWRT4 Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Shampoo]] and [[ASIN:B00AVWJUA8</li>
      <li>Finally, as a treat for my own birthday, I faced up to the youth issue and bought this and the shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice now, but I am thrilled.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent is very feminine, but not heavy - sort of a floral smell and it is really nice.</li>
      <li>this did not seem to move through my hair with ease thus making it harder to get good coverage.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s up to you if you feel its worth it.</li>
      <li>I have very long color treated hair which, according to my stylist, is in the best shape she&#x27;s ever seen for hair this long.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I tried this conditioner and it&#x27;s matching shampoo in desperation. After putting my hair through constant coloring and highlighting torture, I have achieved a state of straw-like, frizzy, scraggly hair. The \\&quot;Youth Renewal\\&quot; claims that it will help overprocessed, damaged, and thinning hair achieve a more healthy, shiny, and stronger consistency. Well it didn&#x27;t. This conditioner seemed a little thin, and it didn&#x27;t seem at all shinier or more manageable. I know, I know, I KNOW that you cannot put anything on your hair to transform it into what it would be if you&#x27;d never colored or heat styled it in it&#x27;s life, but I was hoping the claims the bottle made help just a little... but no. I was able to return this product and get a refund, so I&#x27;m satisfied with that at least. This product might work for someone with a little healthier hair but, if like me, you&#x27;ve ruined your hair with chemicals and heat, then you may want to keep searching for something better. Maybe sulfate free? That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to try next.... Either that or I may chop it all off and start again.</li>
    <li> I have been using both the shampoo and conditioner from the Youth Renewal line for almost a year now and my hair has never been in better condition. I have very fine and thin hair – I always have, but obviously it gets worse with age and the texture changes on top of that. I have had problems with my hair being very dry and looking like straw. I have used other brands that work for a while and then my hair gets nasty again so I am on the search for a new shampoo/conditioner. But as it has been nearly a year, I have faith that this line will continue to keep my hair in good shape.   It won’t completely transform your hair and make it thicker and super full. What it does is keep it healthy, light (not weighed down), clean, and because it is healthy and fully but lightly conditioned, it does have more volume and appears to have just slightly more hair (which I believe is a visual effect).   I use this nearly every day. One day a week I use the Humectress line just to break up the routine. Humectress is way too heavy for my hair to use more than that.   I fear that I will not be able to find this anymore. I used to find it in CVS, Walgreens, WalMart, etc – it was widely available. Recently I cannot find it in any stores but Ulta, which is not convenient. It seems whoever stocks the local stores removed Youth Renewal and replaced it with Hydralight. I tried the Hydralight to see if it was an acceptable alternative. But it left my hair very flat, somewhat greasy and yet it felt dry. I immediately went out of my way to pick the Youth Renewal up at Ulta.   Please Nexxus never stop making this line and I hope to find it local stores again soon.</li>
    <li> I can feel and see the difference in my hair...it makes my hair shine, my hair feels thicker and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> My hair look awesome! Hasn&#x27;t looked this great in over 10 years! My hair is very thick (but fine), long and colored and I have tried so many hair care systems that I have lost count trying to get the hair back I had when I was younger. I had almost given up hope, but this system really works and does everything it claims! My search is finally over. NOTE: It doesn&#x27;t happen overnight. It took about 2 weeks to see the drastic change.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a devoted fan of the sleektress conditioner from Nexxus.  I&#x27;ve ordered it here on Amazon several times since it is hard to find in stores now since it has been discontinued.  Unhappy with my attempts with other Nexxus conditioners (the hydra one left me with snarls, pro-mend didn&#x27;t smell good enough for my tastes, and humectress, while nice at times, is just too heavy for everyday for my fine but healthy hair), I procrastinated on this youth assure line since 1)I didn&#x27;t like the whole &amp;#34;youth&amp;#34; aspect and 2)it is expensive.  Finally, as a treat for my own birthday, I faced up to the youth issue and bought this and the shampoo.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice now, but I am thrilled.  My post-shoulder length hair moves naturally and smoothly; the shine is great and nothing feels weighed down.  The conditioner smells fantastic, as I&#x27;ve come to expect with Nexxus products generally.  It makes me think of oatmeal cookies and honey.  Extra perk?  &amp;#34;Younger&amp;#34; looking hair makes for a &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; looking me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note, however, this product also does wonders for the tangled spots my 2 year old daughter encounters.  She doesn&#x27;t need a &amp;#34;youth&amp;#34; angle, of course.  I&#x27;d rename this in the style of &amp;#34;the detangler,&amp;#34; though I know that 1) that particular name has been taken and 2) selling youth in a bottle is always popular.</li>
    <li> I have used nexxus in my salon for over 30 yrs.  this line is unlike any line they have ever made!  It is a treatment line.. Shampoo condition and apply elixir every thine you shampoo your hair.. And in a couple months you&#x27;ll have different hair!!!  Just Amazing!!</li>
    <li> Came open in the box :(</li>
    <li> A mild, pleasant scent and decent but not-too-heavy texture made this Nexxus conditioner a pleasure to use.  More importantly, the results were great: my hair (which leans towards being dry) was nicely moisterized and sported a healthy shine.  I truly enjoyed using the Amazon sample of this fine product and will have no hesitation seeking out a new supply at my own expense.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of products designed for fine hair, and this is the first one that made me feel as if I actually got my monies worth. I really liked this conditioner. It has a great smell and did everything I expected it to do for my fine, limp hair. It&#x27;s a good option for anyone willing to pay the price.</li>
    <li> After using the Nexxus Youth Renewal Shampoo and liking it, I decided to purchase the matching conditioner.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;m having a problem with it.  After using it (I shampoo and condition my hair in the shower), there remains a scummy white residue on the tub which is a nuisance to rinse out.  And the next day when I get in the shower, the bath mat is dangerously slippery due to the \\&quot;coating\\&quot; from the conditioner.  As a result, I have to constantly launder the bath mat in the washing machine, with strong detergent.  On the plus side, I like the fragrance.  However, this product is just not worth the hassle - or the safety risk - of using it.  Unless you condition your hair in the sink, I would be wary of purchasing Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner.</li>
    <li> I like the salon like fragrance I get from this. Even at the end of the next day it still leaves your hair smelling good and feeling clean.</li>
    <li> really not sure for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is just okay. I like other Nexxus products better. I have frizzy curly hair and it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I tried the entire line, the elixir does nothing, but the shampoo and conditioner are awesome. They cleanse well and add volume and moisture at once. I have oily hair and this line really cleansed all the oil and added volume while not overdrying. Best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> After 3 years of illness my hair was dry, dull and brittle.  Then I discovered this line of hair products and became an instant convert to Nexxus Youth Renewal line.  Over the past 3 years I have used a mountain of costly brand name products that either weighted my hair down and made it dull and greasy or did not any effect at all.  May I also suggest the entire Youth Renewal line, I have not been this happy with my hair in years.  I am getting compliments from coworkers so this makes me even more grateful.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about the Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner was the sweet berry-like fragrance that I found very pleasing. I followed the directions (comb in and leave on 3 minutes - rinse) and used it along with the [[ASIN:B00AE07FUE Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo, 13.5 Ounce]], (as recommended). I found that my hair did feel softer but it seemed to be weighed down and lacking the volume that I get using [[ASIN:B0098JU8T2 Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Conditioner 8.4 Fl Oz]] I discovered that my hair ended up greasy looking by the next morning, creating a demand that I have to wash it every day. I tried using less of the conditioner and rinsing more, but after a week of using it with no change, I&#x27;m really not pleased with the results. My almost 50 year old hair is fine and thinning, so I need all the help I can get. What this conditioner promises is not what it delivers.</li>
    <li> This does everything right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔Scent: butterscotch/good n plenty/sugar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔Spreadability: creamy, not too thick nor too thin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔Rinceability: rinses out completely and quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔Detangling ability:  excellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔Shine, body, bounce: excellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔thickening ability: slight but definintely there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this and use it as my main everyday conditioner.</li>
    <li> One of the main disappointments for me along the road of aging was the rough, course texture my hair took on in my 40s.  That was the first time I started to panic.  Since that texture has remained with my hair, good conditioning is key.  Currently I use a well known but inexpensive brand I get when I buy my groceries, and I&#x27;ve always wondered whether pricier brands like Nexxus would work even better.  Other pricier brands might, but Nexxus doesn&#x27;t.  I found that the rough texture I try to keep at bay returned only a couple of hours after conditioning.  It could be that this conditioner works better with other hair types, but if your hair has a similar texture, I would try another product.</li>
    <li> Changed formula!  This conditioner no longer has the same perfumed scent that it had before.  It&#x27;s still scented, but the scent is different, and I prefer the old.</li>
    <li> I have somewhat dry hair, and found Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner disappointing. It really didn&#x27;t do much for my hair at all. It&#x27;s a light conditioner and smells nice. The fragrance is not as strong as the matching shampoo. It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down of make it feel greasy, which is good. As with the shampoo, it is not the Fountain of Youth though. My hair&#x27;s condition didn&#x27;t seem much different at all after using it. Considering it costs about 3x more than other quality conditioners, I would consider alternatives.</li>
    <li> The Nexxus Youth Renewal Conditioner not only smells heavenly but leaves your hair feeling absolutely wonderful.  Use this with the shampoo and you have yourself a really nice head of hair when done. I am happy that this isn&#x27;t leaving a heavy build up on my hair after showering but leaves it soft, silky and with some life to it.  It shines and considering I&#x27;m graying and gray hair is hard to take care of this Nexxus product is a perfect match for my needs.  Cheaper than salon conditioners and I honestly think it works better.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t use conditioner that often, but i love this. I love the way it smells and the way it makes my hair smell.  would recommend to others</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for the Youth Renewal line from Nexxus. I have really liked Nexxus products in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a concentrate feeling conditioner. It is thick rich. It smells great. But it rinsed out leaving my hair feeling very dry. As it dried I had horrible tangles. I have very long hair and avoiding tangles is paramount. I tried is several times but each time I ended up with bad tangling and dryness. It did seem to give volume. But overall I saw no noticeable Renewal of Youth. There are definitely changes that our hair goes through as we age but there are better products for addressing them.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is a bit on the thin/runny side, but it does work really well. It conditions and detangles very nicely. It rinses well and does not leave any build up and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair. I typically prefer a thicker conditioner, but this worked surprisingly well for being so thin. I need a lot of moisturization and really good detangling - this conditioner was perfect for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any transformation of my hair in regards to the \\&quot;Youth Renewal,\\&quot;  but I still liked this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very feminine, but not heavy - sort of a floral smell and it is really nice. It doesn&#x27;t seem to linger much or stay on the hair long, but that&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner is a great conditioner overall, even without seeing and drastic changes or improvements to my hair. I would use it again and recommend it.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is $14+ per bottle. It makes the claim of restoring a youthful appearance and strength to your hair. I saw no change in my hair whatsoever using both the shampoo and conditioner. Paying nearly $30 for shampoo/conditioner every month simply because it smells good seems crazy to me. I realize Nexxus is a popular brand and I&#x27;ve never had complaints about it, but this shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t deliver on their promise. It cleans your hair, it conditions your hair and it smells nice, but I did not notice any difference in shine, texture or otherwise after a month of usage. While I&#x27;m at it, I don&#x27;t care for the bottle design and color. Maybe that seems irrelevant, but sometimes consumers buy with their eyes before anything else.</li>
    <li> Makes scalp greasy, and if you &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; it through, masses of hair come out!  No magic rejuvenation for MY hair!  Not worth the price and the special order.</li>
    <li> I have used many conditioners low to high price point - Nexxus conditioner is the best - in fact the shampoo rates the same - great product.</li>
    <li> I have long-ish, flat, easily tangled hair. I tried this conditioner and it did nothing to improve my hair&#x27;s texture or shine. In fact, the opposite-- it seemed to emphasize the flyaways and make my hair look more damaged than it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s funny how the same product can be so good for some people and bad for others. I guess that&#x27;s just how beauty products are... I see that most people loved this conditioner, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not just terrible quality, but it sure didn&#x27;t work well on my hair type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B00ALV8EJW Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 13.5 Ounce]] for several months and love the way it conditions my hair, and decided to try the Youth Renewal formulation in the hopes that it would give me the same great conditioning while adding some brightness and shine to my faded blond hair. Unfortunately, this product just doesn&#x27;t seem to be right for me... I definitely don&#x27;t see any more shine or added color vibrancy, and honestly, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as soft and smooth as with the Hydralight either. It does seem to have more volume, so if that&#x27;s your primary need, it may work for you, but as for me, I&#x27;ll be sticking with my Hydralight.</li>
    <li> I ordered several Nexus Youth Renewal products at the same time I ordered the Platinum Line from Tresemme.  I found the Tresemme products worked as well as (or better in some instances as with leave in conditioners) as the Nexxus line - with quite a bit less of a price tag.  I originally thought to use the Nexxus sparingly, at times before big meetings, and use the Tresemme line for daily use.  But I liked the Tresemme results so much better that I use that all the time and don&#x27;t use the Nexxus any more.  I have thinning, dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, I find this all new hype about youth renewal for hair (what&#x27;s next, teeth?) a bit too much.  Seems like a marketing ploy rather than a viable product.</li>
    <li> This is a good conditioner.  It left my long fine hair soft and smooth without being weighed down.  However, I feel that there are other conditioners, particularly those in the Clear and Suave lines, that work as well for half the price.  If you don&#x27;t mind spending more, then this is a nice conditioner. It&#x27;s up to you if you feel its worth it. I will be sticking with the cheaper ones.</li>
    <li> I really love the Nexxus line, and the Youth Renewal is no different.  I have long, straight, recently-for-the-first-time-ever-dyed, white girl hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner smells great, floral but not overpowering, and leaves my hair feeling really soft and nice. I use it with the same lines shampoo.</li>
    <li> Typically I really like Nexxus product.&lt;br /&gt;This is a lightweight conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair so usually light weight conditioners work well for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however this did not seem to move through my hair with ease thus making it harder to get good coverage.</li>
    <li> I am using this conditioner with the shampoo, and it is wonderful. As with all Nexxus products, it smells wonderful, and my  leaves my hart very soft and smooth. I have wavy, thick hair that curls up and frizzes in any humidity, so I really love how this conditioner smooths my hair without making it greasy looking or weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know these shampoo and conditioners are called \\&quot;Youth Renewal,\\&quot; so in full disclosure, I am 44 years old, shoulder length, untreated hair. It tends to be dry. I work out, so my hair gets washed a lot, too. This shampoo/conditioner combo is excellent, and I am really pleased with it. I will definitely be using this shampoo in the future. My favorite! As it is now, I am alternating with my less fancy shampoo and conditioner to make this stuff last!</li>
    <li> So, how do you tell your wife, \\&quot;I got you some rejuvinating hair conditioner to try, it&#x27;s for aging hair,\\&quot; without getting into trouble? Well, clearly I don&#x27;t know, because I said  it just like that....and what a look I got. I know that look. I&#x27;m no rookie. I&#x27;m also smart enough (well probably not that smart or else I would have figured out a better way to say it) to know I have to say something before she does. So I said, \\&quot;Try it. It&#x27;s gotten great reviews. Maybe you&#x27;ll like it.\\&quot; My wife is very reasonable, and so she tried it.....and lady luck was sitting on my shoulder! She liked it. She has been using it for a couple of weeks, and so far, she is very happy with this fountain of Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner! Her hair is visibly thicker and soft. Her hair has been getting thinner, and so she is very happy to have some of the thickness and fullness back. She says it is also not thick and goes on easily. She also likes the fragrance,but I think it could smell like, well, let&#x27;s just say it could smell not so nice and she would still use it. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally blown away by this Youth Renewal line from Nexus - these products are lightweight and make my hair look and feel wonderful. This conditioner feels silky smooth going in (not waxy/gunky like some others) and rinses out easily and completely. It leaves my hair feeling very soft, smooth, and tangle-free. After blow drying my hair is noticeably softer and smoother with a noticeable decrease in frizz as well. This line has a light, pleasant scent and a little goes a long way. All in all an excellent product!</li>
    <li> I love the scent of the product but after a few days use of both shampoo/conditioner and leave-in I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
    <li> This conditioner worked quite well.  I do not have the matching shampoo and used the conditioner with my everyday shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus:&lt;br /&gt;* creamy, even consistency that spread nicely throughout wet hair - much nicer than other conditioners I have used&lt;br /&gt;* pleasant fragrance&lt;br /&gt;* made my hair very soft and luxurious feeling when wet - surprisingly so&lt;br /&gt;* no tangles! when combing wet hair&lt;br /&gt;* the feeling of my hair when wet (smooth, no tangles) gave the impression that no other styling products would be needed to have nice soft, managed hair (but see TBD below)&lt;br /&gt;* soft hair when dry, lightly shiny&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus:&lt;br /&gt;* fragrance maybe a little too strong and lingering&lt;br /&gt;* made my skin itchy, likely due to too much fragrance (bordering on \\&quot;yellow perfume smell\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;* high price (but it was complimentary for me for Vine evaluation)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comments:&lt;br /&gt;* once my hair dried, it sort of frizzed out - it seemed like the majority of my hair was smooth underlying with a fuzzy top surface (different from most conditioners). Use of a leave-in or styling product is likely still necessary&lt;br /&gt;* not sure about \\&quot;youth renewal\\&quot; \\&quot;rejuvenating\\&quot; marketing claim - I did not feel my hair looked any younger or rejuvenated, whatever than means&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, decent but I probably will not repurchase since it is fairly high cost and there are other products just as good for less.</li>
    <li> If your hair is not dry or damaged then this conditioner could work okay.  Unfortunately, that doesn&#x27;t describe the majority of women, myself included.  I have very long color treated hair which, according to my stylist, is in the best shape she&#x27;s ever seen for hair this long.  But even within those parameters, this conditioner failed to impress.  My hair was not very manageable, it was difficult to comb out when wet, there was a lot of breakage and it was not very shiny.  In addition, the ends of my hair felt dry instead of soft and silky like they normally do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have hair that doesn&#x27;t have any issues then this might work \\&quot;okay\\&quot; for you.  For me, I found it neither renewing nor rejuvenating.  I also didn&#x27;t like the smell.  It reminded me of something that I just couldn&#x27;t put my finger on but the smell was obvious when I opened the bottle, while my hair was wet and even, to some extent, after it was dry.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> As always, Nexxus has outdone most of the competition.  This lightly moisturizing conditioner works nicely with the matching shampoo for occasional use.  The combination is a bit too rich and moisturizing for daily use on very fine, thin hair, which tends to be dry but needs to be allowed to fluff up a bit.  I&#x27;d recommend using it a couple of times a week with the shampoo in order to give average, dry hair that extra boost of shine and healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Now that I&#x27;ve had time to use this product and the matching shampoo for a few weeks, I can definitely say I love them both!  My concern over buildup on my fine, thin, dry hair proved to be unnecessary, as this product rinses clean and leaves my hair feeling bouncy and full of life.  Great product, and I&#x27;m upgrading it to five stars!</li>
    <li> This is a great-smelling, lightweight conditioner. I have pin-straight, fairly fine hair - but unfortunately, my hair is also very dry. While I didn&#x27;t experience the tangling problem that several reviewers seemed to have, it&#x27;s very likely (obviously) that this is due to my hair type rather than the conditioner being all that great. I was hoping for a conditioner that would actually help in the renewal department, would make my hair feel softer, less dry. While I didn&#x27;t have issues with tangling, and while the conditioner at least didn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or weight it down, it also - unfortunately - didn&#x27;t lead to any positive, mentionable results.</li>
    <li> My hair is wavy and tends to get a little frizzy with the wrong products. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for a few weeks, and it makes my hair too fluffy and slightly fizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed because I do really like the scent, and it lathers up nicely. It just doesn&#x27;t work great for my hair. If you want to add volume though, this should do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair gets the frizzies, or you usually use a moisturizing-type product, I would try the weightless moisture shampoo and conditioner instead of this one.</li>
    <li> Wont leave your hair dried out and brittle. The Nexxus Youth Renewal conditioner will bring your limp hair back to life. It will make your hair feel great without it leaving it oily and greasy. It does not give you a caked on feeling by  adding these products together. This is also great for everyday. Rinses out easy and leavesd you hair looking good.</li>
    <li> My family compared this conditioner and its [[ASIN:B00AE07FUE matching shampoo]], along with several other shampoo/conditioner combos.  The consensus on this one is that it&#x27;s a good shampoo and conditioner, but not noticeably better than any of the other good over the counter options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner has a mild fragrance, and together with the shampoo, leaves hair clean, manageable, bouncy and shiny.  All of that is great, but as I said, no one thought it performed noticeably better than any other good shampoo/conditioner combo, so we don&#x27;t have anything against it, but probably won&#x27;t be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that we did appreciate is that the shampoo and conditioner have different colored caps, which makes them easier to tell apart in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(p.s.: The favorite in our comparison so far, has been [[ASIN:B00A0IWRT4 Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Shampoo]] and [[ASIN:B00AVWJUA8 Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner]], which we thought produced the best luster and shine at a very good price).</li>
    <li> When I was young I had thick, glossy hair that I was so proud of. Fast forward many years, add a career and children and my hair is no longer what it used to be. It&#x27;s thinner and dull looking. When I saw this product, I jumped at the chance to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good conditioner. I did not use it with the accompanying shampoo like it suggested but instead used it with my Herbal Essences shampoo. The result was nice: my hair was soft and silky. It was light with a little bounce. But it did not meet my expectations. After a week of use, my hair is not glossier, fuller or more radiant. My hair felt nice and looked nice but it did not de-tangle very well. I had to wrestle some major knots out with a comb which was unusual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, it&#x27;s a decent conditioner but the \\&quot;youth renewal\\&quot; claim doesn&#x27;t bear out.</li>
    <li> I have this product as part of a system to \\&quot;rejuvenate old hair\\&quot;. I like this conditioner a lot. Very mild fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger... just leaves your hair smelling nice, not overpowering. It is quite conditioning, almost as much as the post home hair color conditioner I use, yet rinses cleanly and leaves my hair feeling smooth. Does it rejuvenate? Well, my hair doesn&#x27;t look any younger after using this, but it does look better. I wish they would create a leave-in product that did something similar as another conditioning option.</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner with the recommended shampoo (the Nexxus Rejuvenating Shampoo) and the results are not very impressive. Right after I wash the conditioner off, my hairs still a little rigid. I feel likie they are somewhat glued together. I feel quite a lot of friction when I try to comb my hair with my fingers. However, an hour after the shower, when my hairs are completely dry, the feeling is quite nice. My hairs are soft and smooth. By the way, this conditioner is for woman only. If you walk into Macy&#x27;s cosmetic department (where they sell lotions, make-ups, perfumes etc), you will notice that womanly smell of the product. This conditioner has the same smell which is not for men.</li>
    <li> I really liked this conditioner in combination with the youth renewal shampoo.  My hair seemed softer and shinier.  Can&#x27;t really be sure if it caused \\&quot;less volume loss\\&quot;.  I comb it through in the shower and leave it in for a few minutes and I have no tangles.</li>
</ol>
