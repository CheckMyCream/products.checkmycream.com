      <li>and it really works good.</li>
      <li>The Watts Retinol Face Cream goes on smoothly and feels good, but it is not as effective as the Afirm 3x (which will cause your skin to peel, so you have to exfoliate daily).</li>
      <li>Not to mention smoothing fine lines ect.</li>
      <li>Fabulous.</li>
      <li>Fabulous.</li>
      <li>Skin smooth after application.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product as a replacement for another retinol product that works amazingly well, but the price was going up so much</li>

      <li>Cheap for the retinol and organic content.</li>
      <li>I use it at night and it goes on light.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 33 years old with fair acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>I happened to stumble upon Watt&#x27;s Retinol Face Cream and decided to try it after all the great reviews.</li>
      <li>If it sounds too good to be true, then it likely is.  </li>
      <li>pump, it arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>I also really like the fact that it is such a good moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>-my daughter noticed right away.  </li>
      <li>I keep coming back for more.  </li>
      <li>I bought this moisturizer based on the positive reviews I read and because it includes most of the key anti-aging ingredients I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I will be using this product as long as they keep making it. :)</li>
      <li>and I actually had my skin texture and fine lines</li>
      <li>Really helps with discoloration too.</li>
      <li>Affective, it did more than expected.</li>
      <li>Not irritating or problematic, just no result.</li>
      <li>Thanks Watts</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>and it REALLY WORKS.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be re-purchasing this product in the future :))</li>
      <li>it really works making my skin young n</li>
      <li>This cream didn&#x27;t work for my combination skin (oily and normal).</li>
      <li>I definitely think they got this right.</li>
      <li>I am young, in my 20&#x27;s, but I&#x27;ve had a stressful life which was showing on my face, and now my skin is better than when I was 15 after just a few months of using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>editing because I question if there is really THAT much Retinol in it... &amp; to say it worked well for a friend who has similar acne problems.</li>
      <li>After a few steady months of using it almost every night, I am seeing huge, permanent changes in my face.</li>
      <li>I have problems with adult acne and hyper pigmentation and have tried EVERYTHING.</li>
      <li>But I like it so far because it dos not make my face oily and not breaking out.</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>and i must not have completely removed my make up.</li>
      <li>No heavy smell or consistency.</li>
      <li>makes skin soft and works on acne somehow.  </li>
      <li>This product is priced very well when you see the prices of all the similar products out there.  </li>
      <li>first two weeks I used this product I did go through a &#x27;rough patch&#x27;</li>
      <li>It speeds up the healing of red marks/scars from old breakouts.</li>
      <li>This is so much cheaper than the other brands</li>
      <li>sun spots were much lighter or gone, smoother texture and less blotchy appearance.&lt;br</li>
      <li>the only reason i gave this 4 stars is because it makes your skin very tight, somewhat uncomfortably, but it&#x27;s not drying it just closes your pores very effectively.</li>

<li> I was amazed by what a difference it made in my skin just from using it for a few days.</li>

<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on expensive face creams.</li>
<li> Helpful\\&quot; Sorry, folks.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My skin looks better since I have been using this face cream. What more do I real;ly need to say?!!</li>
    <li> Used product for about a month and no change in skin appearance.  Used product faithly and could tell no difference</li>
    <li> It has nice ingredients but I didn&#x27;t notice any changes, improvements or legit retinol side effects such as peeling.  Too heavy and greasy for oily skin.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase.  I can&#x27;t believe the price for 4 oz.  My skin looks smooth &amp; feel great.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is so much cheaper than the other brands and it really works good. Another product that I&#x27;ll keep reordering. Thanks Watts</li>
    <li> Cheap for the retinol and organic content. Skin smooth after application. I have found a retinol product for my arms and hands!</li>
    <li> Affective, it did more than expected. I saw a difference just after a couple times using it. Good good good good good good good good</li>
    <li> Works as well as my Retin-A was, but with no irritation. No heavy smell or consistency. I would definitely recommend this for aging and acne prone skin. Works for me :-)</li>
    <li> Wow. I look 20 years younger.  Not. It became watery over time.  Can anyone sell me some water from the fountain of youth.</li>
    <li> This cream has natura oila andl ingredients that promote healthy skin. Retinol in this preparation does not iritatate my skin.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try something so inexpensive, but my face soaks this up in all of about 2 seconds!  Pores are smaller, under eye bags and dark circles are starting to go away, as well as lines.  LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream at night for about 3 weeks.  I was hoping to notice a difference in sun damage (i.e. sun spots) but haven&#x27;t noticed any change.  Wrinkles seem about the same also.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a replacement for another retinol product that works amazingly well, but the price was going up so much I just couldn&#x27;t afford it. I looked for other products with the same active ingredient. The percentage of retinol in this lotion is lower than what I was using (Afirm 3x). The Watts Retinol Face Cream goes on smoothly and feels good, but it is not as effective as the Afirm 3x (which will cause your skin to peel, so you have to exfoliate daily). I have been mixing Watts Retinol Face Cream with Afirm 3x to get the benefits of the Afirm 3x with the comfort and ease of application of the Watts Retinol Face Cream.</li>
    <li> Fabulous. I was skeptical at first, but it started working in the first week. A must have!! I will continue buying it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not Retin-A, but it works. I haven&#x27;t experienced any drying or flaking skin, which I used to get if I used too much Retin-A. I use this liberally on my face and I feel it works, but I would have liked a stronger dose.</li>
    <li> A little greasy. I hope it&#x27;s helping. Time will tell I guess. This is definitely a night cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer based on the positive reviews I read and because it includes most of the key anti-aging ingredients I was looking for. It has a pleasant scent, absorbs quickly without feeling greasy, and makes my skin feel smooth. I also like that it comes in a pump dispenser. I will definitely be re-purchasing this product in the future :))</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product nightly for the past 3 weeks and have not noticed one single change in my skin. Not even the redness and flaking that some people describe and take to mean that the product is working. Nothing at all. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m putting nothing on my face at all. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month. I only use it at night &amp; wash my face and apply facial lotion with sunscreen for daytime. As retinol products make you photosensitive. I&#x27;m 33 years old with fair acne prone skin. I get painfull cysts bumps ect. This quiets my acne symptoms and smooths out bumps. It speeds up the healing of red marks/scars from old breakouts. Not to mention smoothing fine lines ect. It is a great value so I use it on the backs of my hands too! I wash my hands constantly and they get a \\&quot;Crypt Keeper\\&quot; look from the abuse. This cream has banished my \\&quot;Crypt keeper hands!\\&quot; LOL I&#x27;m impressed by all the wonderful extras in this formula. Grape seed oil, ect. LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m editing because I question if there is really THAT much Retinol in it... &amp; to say it worked well for a friend who has similar acne problems. A couple people found my review \\&quot;Not Helpful\\&quot; Sorry, folks. I can only say how it worked for me. I like it.</li>
    <li> This cream didn&#x27;t work for my combination skin (oily and normal). My face felt greasy and not hydrated after application even if I adjusted the quantity used so this is not a product for me and I would not recommend it to other people with same skin issues.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 years now. I am convinced that It has helped keep the wrinkles at bay (I am in my mid 50s). I also really like the fact that it is such a good moisturizer.  My skin feel smooth and healthy. In addition, I don&#x27;t get the oily breakouts that I used to get with some other skin creams. I have a lot of allergies and reactions to perfumes in products, and this one is a keeper!</li>
    <li> Fabulous smoothing product!  Makes your skin look years younger-my daughter noticed right away.  Remember your sunscreen! Really helps with discoloration too.</li>
    <li> I bought the 4 oz. pump, it arrived quickly. I was amazed by what a difference it made in my skin just from using it for a few days. After a few steady months of using it almost every night, I am seeing huge, permanent changes in my face. I never have any acne or discoloration anymore and no trace of dark circles or bags under my eyes, though I have a lot of work-filled, sleepless nights. My wrinkles are evaporating as if by magic. I am young, in my 20&#x27;s, but I&#x27;ve had a stressful life which was showing on my face, and now my skin is better than when I was 15 after just a few months of using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that there are no alcohols or parabens or any other nasty stuff in it, just mostly organic ingredients and natural oils. I researched retinol products for hours before finding this, the perfect harmony between non-toxic and inexpensive. I can feel that my skin loves this stuff and it doesn&#x27;t irritate at all. I will be using this product as long as they keep making it. :)</li>
    <li> I have problems with adult acne and hyper pigmentation and have tried EVERYTHING. I happened to stumble upon Watt&#x27;s Retinol Face Cream and decided to try it after all the great reviews. I have been using this cream for about a year now and it REALLY WORKS. My skin is smoother and more uniform, and the fine lines around my eyes are gone. Don&#x27;t waste your time on expensive face creams. This stuff is awesome. I use it on my hands and neck as well.</li>
    <li> I love Retinol and have used it many times so I do have experience with it. Well, you know what they say...  If it sounds too good to be true, then it likely is.  There is no way this is what they claim. PERIOD.  Retinol helps acne, this gave me acne. Do you know how hard a white head is to correct?  It clogs pores and I actually had my skin texture and fine lines WORSEN while using it daily.  I reordered my skinceuticals 1% retinol and when I put it on, my face was very velvety and happy.  I have thirsty skin and this stuff sat on top more like grease.  Just give up the extra $ for a decent heavy hitter is all I can say.  You don&#x27;t want this mess on your face.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t notice much different change on my face.... Haven&#x27;t use it that long. But I like it so far because it dos not make my face oily and not breaking out. I only been using it for a month...</li>
    <li> I would not want to be without this product, and used on a regular basis it does not take long to notice an improvement.  I definitely think they got this right.</li>
    <li> This is my second order for this product and this65222 time I ordered the 4 oz instead of the 2 oz.  I use it at night and it goes on light.  My skin feels great.</li>
    <li> I keep coming back for more.  I love the products from Watts Beauty.  This has become a part of my bedtime routine.</li>
    <li> makes skin soft and works on acne somehow.  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Good product. No complaints. Easy to apply; rubs in well!</li>
    <li> the only reason i gave this 4 stars is because it makes your skin very tight, somewhat uncomfortably, but it&#x27;s not drying it just closes your pores very effectively. This can also only be used at night or the sunlight will have an adverse effect on your skin</li>
    <li> Compared to ROC product there&#x27;s little benefit.  Noticed no changes with this product. Not irritating or problematic, just no result.</li>
    <li> Fabulous. I was skeptical at first, but it started working in the first week. A must have!!  I will continue buying it.</li>
    <li> This product is priced very well when you see the prices of all the similar products out there.  I don&#x27;t know if I believe it is 1.5% but it seems to do a good job.</li>
    <li> Other retinol preparations are too harsh. I can use this every night and at worst my nose peels a little, like from mild sunburn--this has happened a couple of times--but I don&#x27;t get a red rash or other adverse reactions.</li>
    <li> I bought 4 bottles of this stuff n it really works making my skin young n youthful and I love the smell of if. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for six weeks (purchased after a great deal of research) and this may sound like a late-night infomercial but I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE THE RESULTS. Looking at my face without wearing my glasses I thought my skin looked too &#x27;good&#x27; and i must not have completely removed my make up. I re-washed my face, put on my glasses and took a peek. My skin had definitelt improved: sun spots were much lighter or gone, smoother texture and less blotchy appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first two weeks I used this product I did go through a &#x27;rough patch&#x27; my skin was dry and flakey but within two weeks that side effect ceased and my skin was not dry at all. I used as directed - only at night and as always used suncreen every  morning. For the price and the quantity, this is a FABULOUS PRODUCT.</li>
