### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best tasting mint toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Also, every since I&#x27;ve used these products my dental visits have been wonderful!  </li>
      <li>Although I will say it&#x27;s not comparable to the $50 dollar trays you might get from your dentist, It is the best whitening toothpaste and whitening mouthwash combo.  </li>
      <li>EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!  </li>
      <li>Great toothpaste for attempting to whiten your teeth.</li>
      <li>This is a great toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Good thing</li>
      <li>This taste reminds me of cheaper toothpastes, though it is more flavorful.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m sure eventually Rembrandt will find a way to make it taste better too.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you do as the directions say and do not drink anything for 30 minutes after.</li>
      <li>Of course I LOVE the Rembrandt products and will faithfully continue to use them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Rembrandt products for many many years now after my dentist recommended them.</li>
      <li>What i like best was the unexpected brush to brush clean feeling.</li>
      <li>Gradual effective whitening, excellent taste, texture and lasting clean feeling make it well worth the price.</li>
      <li>I tried this but found the Rembrandt Intense Stain to be more effective.  </li>
      <li>I like the toothpaste, the minty taste is not too strong.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit like canada mints and cheap cat litter.</li>
      <li>Overall, a good product that does what it advertises.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Rembrandt toothpaste and have -only- used it ever since a tube was given to me about 8 years ago.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the Intense Stain.  </li>
      <li>Very minty taste which you&#x27;ll love.  </li>
      <li>The toothpaste is full of air, so you will probably finish it off in a couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>However, I think it shows some results and is worth it.</li>
      <li>Getting these as a three pack is usually the best way to go, especially with free amazon shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Even with my once a year cleaning, there&#x27;s not that much for the dentist to do!</li>
      <li>prefer the more solid one</li>
      <li>flavor is a bit more \\&quot;powerful\\&quot; than the regular mint.</li>
      <li>used to rely on amazon as a seller, but last purchase just pissed me off, Rembrandt Deeply White Whitening Fluoride Toothpaste is good itself</li>
      <li>If I had a preference, I&#x27;d say I like the original mint a bit more (green tube).</li>
      <li>It was an acceptable alternative to the Intense Stain formula.</li>
      <li>very dissapointed wont buy here again.</li>
      <li>Then when they came out with the Intense Stain formula, I switched.  </li>
      <li>And I noticed that it removes stains very well after two days.</li>
      <li>I really was hoping it would restore some enamel.</li>
      <li>and I do not see much change in my teeth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a rip-off.</li>
      <li>I know that paying $7.00 for a tube of toothpaste can be a bit much.  </li>
      <li>So far I haven&#x27;t seen outstanding results, but I believe it takes time to see big changes.</li>
      <li>do admit, there were times I had to use other toothpastes, but they made my teeth go a bit more yellow and not as smooth (from the plaque).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>like it better than any other paste I have ever used.</li>
      <li>so the tube appears to be only 1/3 full</li>
      <li>I know some complain that dentists only recommend regular flouride toothpaste over whitening pastes, but because of the flouride (not to mention amount of it) in this stuff, it&#x27;s totally okay to</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend;</li>
      <li>The regular mint is more unique, even a bit more neutral, and has that \\&quot;I just got back from the dentist\\&quot; taste--which I personally love, although I know some hate</li>
      <li>Sometimes in between but usually not.</li>
      <li>I first started with just their regular Rembrandt toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>So for all of you who don&#x27;t like the taste of the new D (deeply white) product, try the I (intense stain) product.  </li>
      <li>and Rembrandt is the only toothpaste that was actually able to lighten them up al little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I figure why not spend a little more and see if this actually works.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is difficult to find on shelves because it&#x27;s such a great product.  </li>
      <li>The taste may be strange to some at first, but just keep using it</li>
      <li>Ive never seen anything that removes stains and does not burn the mouth and make teeth sensitive.</li>
      <li>For the up to $4.00 difference in price from Amazon to my national based pharmacy near by, purchase this here if you must try.</li>
      <li>It really does work, has about three times the amount of flouride in it as regular toothpaste, and whitens teeth.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure how well this stuff works as I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks now</li>
      <li>fresh mint&#x27; repulsive flavor you get from other mints.</li>
      <li>I recently tried the new D product and I have to admit the taste reminds me of the denstist office.  </li>
      <li>(as there are only 3 reviews so far for this product)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although it does the same thing (you have the same tingly sensation) or at least I think it does, this one is much more liquid than the regular mint flavor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The net weight for this tube pretty low for the size of the tube compared to other toothpastes in similar tubes, but again you just have to read the box or tube and its quite clear.  </li>

<li> /&gt;Although it does the same thing (you have the same tingly sensation) or at least I think it does, this one is much more liquid than the regular mint flavor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> The net weight for this tube pretty low for the size of the tube compared to other toothpastes in similar tubes, but again you just have to read the box or tube and its quite clear.  </li>
<li> but i received half paste in tube, in fact it was less than half paste in tube.be aware!!!</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t needed anything major done at the dentist&#x27;s office other than regular cleaning.</li>
<li> I think I see some whitening, but I didn&#x27;t get to use the product long enough to tell.  </li>
<li> but I felt the need to clear up the previous reviewers complaints</li>
<li> I twisted off the lid, expecting there to be some kind of seal over the tube opening (usually there is a tiny piece of foil over the opening when the box isn&#x27;t sealed)</li>
<li> As I posted on one of the reviews before mine there is a very obvious statement on the back of the tube telling you that the active dental peroxide in the toothpaste releases oxygen and as a result will cause the tube to inflate and release air when opened.  </li>
<li> The reason I gave 4 stars is that I&#x27;m not sure it works as well as it was claimed and has a high price tag on it.</li>
<li> I think I got to use what was left about 10 times before the tube was empty.  </li>
<li> Just wanted to put an opinion out here from a long time user of the products!</li>
<li> It is a little more expensive than other brands</li>
<li> Previously used: Total whitening, Listerine whitening, crest whitening, crest whitening mouthwash.</li>
<li> It stinks like a icy hot type of gel, it burns mouth and makes teeth sensitive, but it works.  </li>
<li> that&#x27;s when I found out that this thing was nearly empty.</li>
<li> This is a total waste of my money, and I won&#x27;t buy it anymore.  </li>
<li> I could hardly squeeze them out and trust me, it was almost empty.</li>
<li> and you won&#x27;t even notice it after a few days.</li>
<li> While I like the flavor and whitening properties of this toothpaste, I am always frustrated that every time I open a brand new tube, over half the product comes exploding out and it can&#x27;t be stopped!!  </li>
<li> But if you visit the Rembrandt site, they usually have coupons you can print off.</li>
<li> Just recieved my tube of toothpaste today and there was hardly any tooth paste at all in it...</li>
<li> I have naturally thick teeth</li>
<li> Very hard to squeeze out.</li>
<li> What I am not happy with is the way it was packaged.  </li>
<li> The taste of the paste is minty, not God awful like previous comments stated but I have to agree that you can taste peroxide.</li>
<li> I am really unhappy about this product.</li>

    <li> This toothpaste is difficult to find on shelves because it&#x27;s such a great product.  Gradual effective whitening, excellent taste, texture and lasting clean feeling make it well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Just recieved my tube of toothpaste today and there was hardly any tooth paste at all in it... the tube is like 5 or 6 inches in length and maybe 1 inch of it has tooth paste in it.... very dissapointed wont buy here again.</li>
    <li> As I posted on one of the reviews before mine there is a very obvious statement on the back of the tube telling you that the active dental peroxide in the toothpaste releases oxygen and as a result will cause the tube to inflate and release air when opened.  The net weight for this tube pretty low for the size of the tube compared to other toothpastes in similar tubes, but again you just have to read the box or tube and its quite clear.  I can&#x27;t say for sure how well this stuff works as I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks now but I felt the need to clear up the previous reviewers complaints (as there are only 3 reviews so far for this product)</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste for attempting to whiten your teeth. I used this product in conjunction with a whitening mouthwash; both seemed to work well together. However, it did take about 3-4 weeks to notice a difference in the color of my teeth. Overall, a good product that does what it advertises.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!  Peroxide toothpaste so the tube appears to be only 1/3 full so it won&#x27;t explode. It&#x27;s not a rip-off. I have a plastic tube flattener so i can dispense effortlessly. You can buy them anywhere, even here on AMAZON.  Now, on w/ the review... Whitening is gradual but noticeable. A former smoker, this product is definitely working &amp; may work faster for those who don&#x27;t have tobacco stains. What i like best was the unexpected brush to brush clean feeling. I brush when i wake up and when i go to bed. Sometimes in between but usually not. Since using this paste, I NEVER have film on my teeth.  I highly recommend; like it better than any other paste I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I have naturally thick teeth and Rembrandt is the only toothpaste that was actually able to lighten them up al little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Rembrandt Deeply White for a couple of moths now and I decided to try the Winter Mint flavor too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it does the same thing (you have the same tingly sensation) or at least I think it does, this one is much more liquid than the regular mint flavor.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the more solid one so will stick with it for now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Rembrandt products for many many years now after my dentist recommended them. I first started with just their regular Rembrandt toothpaste.  Then when they came out with the Intense Stain formula, I switched.  I LOVE the Intense Stain.  So for all of you who don&#x27;t like the taste of the new D (deeply white) product, try the I (intense stain) product.  Very minty taste which you&#x27;ll love.  I recently tried the new D product and I have to admit the taste reminds me of the denstist office.  Its the peroxide that you taste, no mint at all!  After the 1st time of brushing with it, because of the taste, I thought I&#x27;d just go back to the I product once I was done with the tube.  However, I&#x27;m now about 1/3 way through the D tube and I can actually see the difference in my teeth.  Especially around the gums, they are definately whiter!  Also, every since I&#x27;ve used these products my dental visits have been wonderful!  Even with my once a year cleaning, there&#x27;s not that much for the dentist to do! I know that paying $7.00 for a tube of toothpaste can be a bit much.  But if you visit the Rembrandt site, they usually have coupons you can print off. Of course I LOVE the Rembrandt products and will faithfully continue to use them. I&#x27;ll probably even buy the D product next time, even though I don&#x27;t like the taste, because how can you not when you see a difference in your teeth!  And I&#x27;m sure eventually Rembrandt will find a way to make it taste better too.  Just wanted to put an opinion out here from a long time user of the products! I believe you can&#x27;t beat their products!  But whatever you decide, just keep on smiling!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if others have the same problem with me, and this is a personal review. When I open the package, I found that the box was open. I didn&#x27;t know why. Then I used it in the morning, that&#x27;s when I found out that this thing was nearly empty. I could hardly squeeze them out and trust me, it was almost empty. I believe somebody used it before it was shipped to me. I am really unhappy about this product.</li>
    <li> It stinks like a icy hot type of gel, it burns mouth and makes teeth sensitive, but it works.  Ive never seen anything that removes stains and does not burn the mouth and make teeth sensitive.</li>
    <li> used to rely on amazon as a seller, but last purchase just pissed me off, Rembrandt Deeply White Whitening Fluoride Toothpaste is good itself but i received half paste in tube, in fact it was less than half paste in tube.be aware!!!</li>
    <li> While I like the flavor and whitening properties of this toothpaste, I am always frustrated that every time I open a brand new tube, over half the product comes exploding out and it can&#x27;t be stopped!!  This is a total waste of my money, and I won&#x27;t buy it anymore.  Anyone else have that problem?  Is it the peroxide doing this?</li>
    <li> This is a great toothpaste. The reason I gave 4 stars is that I&#x27;m not sure it works as well as it was claimed and has a high price tag on it. However, I like it.</li>
    <li> Possibly overrated. I am on week 3 and I do not see much change in my teeth. I really was hoping it would restore some enamel. For the up to $4.00 difference in price from Amazon to my national based pharmacy near by, purchase this here if you must try. The taste of the paste is minty, not God awful like previous comments stated but I have to agree that you can taste peroxide.</li>
    <li> I tried this but found the Rembrandt Intense Stain to be more effective.  It was an acceptable alternative to the Intense Stain formula.</li>
    <li> This is the best tasting mint toothpaste. Highly recommend it. Does not have that cloying, &#x27;fresh mint&#x27; repulsive flavor you get from other mints. Does not cause gagging.</li>
    <li> I use the Rembrandt mouthwash and deep white toothpaste. I am used to using crest whitening. I got this combo at target for about six dollars each. It is a little more expensive than other brands but I figure why not spend a little more and see if this actually works. And I noticed that it removes stains very well after two days. Make sure you do as the directions say and do not drink anything for 30 minutes after. Although I will say it&#x27;s not comparable to the $50 dollar trays you might get from your dentist, It is the best whitening toothpaste and whitening mouthwash combo.  We&#x27;ll see how well it does in a week. Previously used: Total whitening, Listerine whitening, crest whitening, crest whitening mouthwash.</li>
    <li> The initial flavor took some getting used to. It&#x27;s a bit like canada mints and cheap cat litter. However, I think it shows some results and is worth it. I will use up this tube and see what happens.</li>
    <li> I think I see some whitening, but I didn&#x27;t get to use the product long enough to tell.  What I am not happy with is the way it was packaged.  Perhaps it had to be shipped via air because when I opened the box the tube looked like it was about to explode (air pressure).  I twisted off the lid, expecting there to be some kind of seal over the tube opening (usually there is a tiny piece of foil over the opening when the box isn&#x27;t sealed) so, as you can imagine, most of the toothpaste shot out of the tube like one of those spring toys in the fake peanut can.  I think I got to use what was left about 10 times before the tube was empty.  Good thing I got a discounted price!</li>
    <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seen outstanding results, but I believe it takes time to see big changes. I like the toothpaste, the minty taste is not too strong.  It&#x27;s also priced well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Rembrandt toothpaste and have -only- used it ever since a tube was given to me about 8 years ago. It really does work, has about three times the amount of flouride in it as regular toothpaste, and whitens teeth. I know some complain that dentists only recommend regular flouride toothpaste over whitening pastes, but because of the flouride (not to mention amount of it) in this stuff, it&#x27;s totally okay to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do admit, there were times I had to use other toothpastes, but they made my teeth go a bit more yellow and not as smooth (from the plaque).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flavor is a bit more \\&quot;powerful\\&quot; than the regular mint. If I had a preference, I&#x27;d say I like the original mint a bit more (green tube). This taste reminds me of cheaper toothpastes, though it is more flavorful. The regular mint is more unique, even a bit more neutral, and has that \\&quot;I just got back from the dentist\\&quot; taste--which I personally love, although I know some hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended. Getting these as a three pack is usually the best way to go, especially with free amazon shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should say: I religiously brush twice a day and floss with Reach floss that I get for a dollar at Walmart. I bleach every once in a while. Haven&#x27;t needed anything major done at the dentist&#x27;s office other than regular cleaning. NO cavities whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Works well, recommend using it twice a day but do not buy if your expecting it to freshen your breathe too.</li>
    <li> It is a bit gritty, but it keeps the stains away! The taste may be strange to some at first, but just keep using it and you won&#x27;t even notice it after a few days.</li>
    <li> I used this product for several months and did not get any results. I even bought the mouth rinse to go with it and it doesn&#x27;t work. The toothpaste is full of air, so you will probably finish it off in a couple of weeks. Very hard to squeeze out. Just use Crest White Strips and save your money.</li>
