      <li>I love their continuous collections and the quality of their polish.</li>
      <li>Love this color.</li>
      <li>The picture  on the website show exactly how the color in your nails... beautiful and clean...</li>
      <li>This one was definitely worth it and doesn&#x27;t chip easily!!</li>
      <li>gooooood gooooood gooooood good goood very very prety</li>
      <li>It is the perfect color, not to bright, not to dull.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re beautifully pigmented, and this rich, vibrant plum is no exception.</li>
      <li>Urban Night is the perfect vampy, fall, rich purple.</li>
      <li>Good color, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>first time use... applies very easy to nail.</li>
      <li>This nail polish makes this brown-skinned woman&#x27;s hand look fabulous.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I love China Glaze nail polish and it lived up to the china glaze name its pretty</li>
      <li>shipping, again, mega fast :)</li>
      <li>It has a great color and extremely durable.</li>
      <li>the other color I brought wasn&#x27;t too great (westside warrior).</li>
      <li>It was shipped quickly,</li>
      <li>Chiped quickly.</li>
      <li>it looks hot for this summer!</li>
      <li>and i think this dark rich purple color can look good with any clothing,and any skin tone.</li>
      <li>It also arrived in a very securely wrapped and neat package, which is always important, especially if there&#x27;s glass involved.</li>
      <li>I always like China Glaze, the colors are awsome and the price is right.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s dark, creamy, and makes the nails look just AWESOME, I almost didn&#x27;t need a second coat.</li>
      <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking for a nice dark purple to add to a more classic looking color collection, this will do well.</li>
      <li>Decent formula on this one and lovely fall color, it took a few topcoats to shine but it is still nice</li>
      <li>It is fast drying and smooth without much effort.</li>
      <li>and  works very very well</li>
      <li>The shippment was absolutely fast!</li>
      <li>Pretty color.</li>
      <li>The color is really pretty, but you have to use 3-4 coats to get it to match the bottle.</li>
      <li>The colors are deep and rich, and I get compliments all the time!</li>
      <li>Great color, you need 2 coats but it is the same with any other polish you have.</li>
      <li>With that many coats, it takes forever to dry.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>THANKS</li>
      <li>I have to put on 2 coats for it to completely cover my nail because it leaves a few light spots, but its okay.</li>
      <li>(very long)&lt;br /</li>
      <li>A lot of other polishes need many coats or they look translucent and then after many coats look black.</li>
      <li>It stays on and stays vibrant.</li>
      <li>High recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>&gt;  - Hard to get a nice all around consistency</li>
      <li>Honestly the color is gorgeous and before I left a bad review I gave the vendor an email</li>
      <li>This polish isn&#x27;t as thick as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>The color, on the other hand, is fantastic.</li>
      <li>The color it shows on your nails when dry is accurately shown in the picture above.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not super thin, but you may not get the best coverage at only 2 coats.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and will definitely buy again!</li>
      <li>I love this polish because its thick enough to go one with one coat or more and still look purple instead of black!</li>
      <li>It is definitely one of my new favorites.</li>
      <li>OPI let me down on my quest for a nice dark purple that wasn&#x27;t basically black.</li>
      <li>While this summer&#x27;s color seems to be orchid, this dark plum is really from last year.</li>

<li> While this summer&#x27;s color seems to be orchid, this dark plum is really from last year.</li>
<li> I used it after coating my nails with a recovery nail polish to make my nail bed more firm (lots of acrylics &#x3D; lifetime of weak and brittle nails).</li>
<li> Coming off of an Essie binge to only my second bottle of China Glaze, I was left a little unimpressed by the nail polish quality.</li>
<li> How long it lasts&lt;br /&gt;Dislike</li>
<li> I chose the Urban Night nail polish and the color resembled a gothic type of look without being too dark.</li>
<li> well , Its Really Dark Just not for me ( Dark hair yellow/olive skin ) and it easy to chip , chips like crazy</li>
<li> While this color is too dark for my taste, my friend loves it.</li>
<li> but my husband could care less.</li>
<li> Its very dark so hard to tell what color</li>
<li> It stands up well to chipping, which I appreciate, having a job that is tough on my nails.</li>
<li> Normally, I&#x27;ve been very disappointed with purple nail polishes, though I was reading about this brand and decided to give this polish a shot.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The color of this polish is beautiful. However, that is about it.  Each time I comb my hair, the polish rubs off!  I havent a clue where it goes, because its not on my hair or skin.  I have even tried more than one layer.  It doesnt last.  Each time Ive worn this polish, I never use remover to take off because literally, anything I do takes it off.  Honestly the color is gorgeous and before I left a bad review I gave the vendor an email but I cannot give this polish a good review.</li>
    <li> This polish isn&#x27;t as thick as I would have liked. Coming off of an Essie binge to only my second bottle of China Glaze, I was left a little unimpressed by the nail polish quality. It&#x27;s not super thin, but you may not get the best coverage at only 2 coats. The color, on the other hand, is fantastic. OPI let me down on my quest for a nice dark purple that wasn&#x27;t basically black. This shade is definitely a winner. In person, the purple in the bottle looks a bit lighter. The color it shows on your nails when dry is accurately shown in the picture above.</li>
    <li> LOVE, love, love this shade and China Glaze. The colors are deep and rich, and I get compliments all the time! Fast shipping and will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Let me just share that China Glaze is my number one nail polish brand. I love their continuous collections and the quality of their polish. Urban Night is the perfect vampy, fall, rich purple. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The picture  on the website show exactly how the color in your nails... beautiful and clean... please order this color! it looks hot for this summer!</li>
    <li> Normally, I&#x27;ve been very disappointed with purple nail polishes, though I was reading about this brand and decided to give this polish a shot.

It also arrived in a very securely wrapped and neat package, which is always important, especially if there&#x27;s glass involved.</li>
    <li> Like. It&#x27;s nail polish. Even tho I like this color and it worked out great the other color I brought wasn&#x27;t too great (westside warrior). So next time I&#x27;m buying in person.</li>
    <li> I love China Glaze colors, this is one of my favorites for the darker colors. I would definitely recommend this product 100%</li>
    <li> ITS THE BEST THANKS A LOT DEAR  I WILL DEAL WITH U GUYS LATER&lt;br /&gt;REGARDS THANKS A LOT AGAIN  .</li>
    <li> The shippment was absolutely fast! but what&#x27;s better is the quality and the color of the nail polish, i am in-love with this color, it is perfect for the fall and i think this dark rich purple color can look good with any clothing,and any skin tone. I def. recommend it! shipping, again, mega fast :)</li>
    <li> I chose the Urban Night nail polish and the color resembled a gothic type of look without being too dark. If you are looking for that perfect wine colored shade without being too &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; I definitely recommend this polish. I used it after coating my nails with a recovery nail polish to make my nail bed more firm (lots of acrylics &#x3D; lifetime of weak and brittle nails). The color lasted about a week without chipping.</li>
    <li> well , Its Really Dark Just not for me ( Dark hair yellow/olive skin ) and it easy to chip , chips like crazy</li>
    <li> While this summer&#x27;s color seems to be orchid, this dark plum is really from last year. However, if you&#x27;re looking for a nice dark purple to add to a more classic looking color collection, this will do well. It will still be a popular fall color and go well with most things this winter, too. China Glaze has wonderful polishes, and this is no different. While this color is too dark for my taste, my friend loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of China Glaze polishes. They&#x27;re beautifully pigmented, and this rich, vibrant plum is no exception. It coats well with 2 coats, no streaking, and no visible nail line. It stands up well to chipping, which I appreciate, having a job that is tough on my nails. All in all, I&#x27;d definitely recommend! I&#x27;ve passed this on as a gift many a time. :)</li>
    <li> Love this color. And all colors I&#x27;ve gotten from China Glaze. They make very good quality products. I&#x27;m Very happy.</li>
    <li> gooooood gooooood gooooood good goood very very prety and  works very very well one of my fav brands yayayayaya im happy</li>
    <li> Great color, you need 2 coats but it is the same with any other polish you have. It looks wonderful, just like the picture.</li>
    <li> Pretty color. China Glaze is a good, salon quality nail polish.</li>
    <li> This nail polish makes this brown-skinned woman&#x27;s hand look fabulous. It is the perfect color, not to bright, not to dull. Did I say perfect? Yes, indeed.</li>
    <li> Its very dark so hard to tell what color it realy is. Chiped quickly. Went on nice. Looks nice because no one can tell what color it realy is. Actually darker on then picture shows.</li>
    <li> I always like China Glaze, the colors are awsome and the price is right.  It stays on and stays vibrant.</li>
    <li> Decent formula on this one and lovely fall color, it took a few topcoats to shine but it is still nice</li>
    <li> I have a lot of re-writes for this product as my wife buys a lot of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has been studying different ways of doing her nails on youtube.  She has come up with ways of mixing the colors for strips, swierls, add beads etc.  She buys a lot of China Glaze, so she must like this brand.  Me?  Her nails are beautiful.</li>
    <li> the perfect color. ive used this color two weeks in a row now. i just love it. i switched it up this week with a nude on one finger, it looks so beautiful.</li>
    <li> I love this color and the brand of nail polish. It is fast drying and smooth without much effort. It was shipped quickly,</li>
    <li> the Polish came on time in the mail it is beautiful on your nails. I recommend this polish to everybody I love China Glaze product</li>
    <li> I love purple nail polishes but I&#x27;ve struggled to find one that has enough depth in the color. I love this polish because its thick enough to go one with one coat or more and still look purple instead of black! A lot of other polishes need many coats or they look translucent and then after many coats look black. This one was definitely worth it and doesn&#x27;t chip easily!!</li>
    <li> These are the best nail polish colors and polishes I have used.  Variety and quality are great. I can never get Dior or whatever but my husband could care less.</li>
    <li> The color is really pretty, but you have to use 3-4 coats to get it to match the bottle. With that many coats, it takes forever to dry.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife. It has a great color and extremely durable. No chips or wearing after two weeks.</li>
    <li> color perfect for my skin.  first time use... applies very easy to nail.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I love China Glaze nail polish and it lived up to the china glaze name its pretty and it was at a great price so I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I chose a 4 star ratting because&lt;br /&gt;Like&lt;br /&gt;  - Color pay off was great (after 2 coats)&lt;br /&gt;  - The gloss coating&lt;br /&gt;  - How long it lasts&lt;br /&gt;Dislike&lt;br /&gt;  - Drying time (very long)&lt;br /&gt;  - Hard to get a nice all around consistency</li>
    <li> Good color, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This color is soooo cute. It is definitely one of my new favorites. I have to put on 2 coats for it to completely cover my nail because it leaves a few light spots, but its okay. I really like it.</li>
