      <li>I know this shipment was of the genuine product.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and is about one third the cost of the salon prices.  </li>
      <li>But it filled out the space.</li>
      <li>Got this for my 15 yr old son who has alepetia and it works really good.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Been using this for about 4 months with no luck in hair growth.  I&#x27;m still hoping for a miracle and will continue to use this for a few more months before throwing in the towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This causes my top of my scalp to develop a slight red color.  I suppose that it&#x27;s working as I believe it is suppose to increase blood circulation of the scalp.</li>
    <li> Have used for 15 years.  Find it beneficial</li>
    <li> Excellent,  still using it</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t seen new hair growth yet</li>
    <li> Great product and for a great price.</li>
    <li> I did not dare use this after my skin broke out after trying the scalp activating treatment</li>
    <li> I saw some improvement, but as soon as I stopped using it, my new hair got thin again.</li>
    <li> Yes, it works.  Give it time and your hair will come back.  I lost a patch of hair due to stress...  I finally ordered this after  2 months without any treatment, and no change. Within 2 weeks new hairs were growing in, and everything is back to normal now.  I recommend this.</li>
    <li> My beautician suugested this nioxine in a shampoo/condioner.I ran out and thought I would try the booster ...as well as the scalp treatment.so far seems to be o.k.I think my hair seems fuller feeling.yet it does become dry..as if I were in a dessert stom.I will use it yet only every third day because of the build up look and feelling on the hair.   claudine bigelow</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin for years.  Probably 20 at least.  I can tell when I don&#x27;t use it.  I have thin hair.  It seems to keep it from getting thinner and gives it more volume.  When I don&#x27;t use it I see more hair in the comb.</li>
    <li> Tripled my hair loss and honestly freaked me out. Going to try to return.</li>
    <li> I had used the scalp treatment and thought i would try it. I only used it for 3 weeks or so and don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s too early to notice anything. I really can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s working as of yet. I&#x27;m not seeing any redness on my scalp as the instructions said you would. I guess time will tell.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give a full review as of now I just started using the product about a month ago..</li>
    <li> I started using this product at the recomendation of my hair stylist.  I had a thinning spot just above the crown of my head.  Within 30 days the spot had filled in so much that you could barely see it anymore.  After 60 days of use the SPOT IS GONE!! I&#x27;ve been using the whole system for 2 months now and the combination of the shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner and hair booster has my hair thicker, shinnier, and longer.  My hair is now growing like a weed.&lt;br /&gt;Note**  For the very best results use the hair booster daily as recommended.</li>
    <li> Good product and boosts the hair.</li>
    <li> i have used this product for ~5 months and find it works well for me. does not restore hair but has slowed hair loss.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Had a small thin area on the side of my head rubbed this in 2x a day for a month and saw a difference</li>
    <li> I only use Nioxin on my noggin. I use the System 2: shampoo, conditioner, mousse and now the hair booster. I don&#x27;t have as much hair as I did when I was a lad. Who does? What little I do have looks its best - always. I have always done the best with the little I was given and Nioxin lets me do that with my hair!</li>
    <li> I cant say to much cause i just starting using it a week ago,  but, it doesnt spread very well into your scalp, and it takes quite of bet of product to really cover my whole head. That being said, the bottle is really small and expensive in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Also, doesnt leave that much of a good smell in my head</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair with a thinning spot. This was not helpful at all. I used this until last month, but it did not work. I will try other products</li>
    <li> is the first time i&#x60;ve used this but seems good. it doesn&#x60;t damage hair and i&#x60;ll give it some time to see about any new hair growth.</li>
    <li> For me, the jury is still out regarding the Nioxin line of hair products. Somewhere, somehow, I got the impression that these products actually stimulated hair growth. But when you read the information on the products themselves, they merely state that the Nioxin line simply makes the hair shaft feel thicker and fuller, thereby giving the impression of more hair. I probably should have returned the products right then, but I decided to try them out. It&#x27;s been about three months and I honestly don&#x27;t see any decrease in the amount of hair in my hairbrush every morning, nor do I see any new growth of hair in the thin spots. I am using all of the products, not just the shampoo and conditioner, which was a serious chunk of change given that I&#x27;m not seeing any overall improvement.  I gave it three stars because I do feel that my hair is thicker (though this may just be a placebo effect), but overall, I am disappointed in this expensive line of products.</li>
    <li> I think it is working</li>
    <li> Gave me headaches, they stopped when i stopped using it</li>
    <li> Great I have used it for twenty years!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff!!!! Will buy again (from salon or beauty supply). May have to kick out a little extra dough, but what a woman won&#x27;t do for her crown of hair! Leaves my hair feeling soft. I purchased this in addition to the Nioxin System 6 starter kit. Not a fan of the scalp and hair treatment that came with the kit. But before I put that on, my hair feels really soft. The directions on the bottle says to apply the hair booster before the scalp and hair treatment. Once the treatment is on, my hair turns to straw. Not a good thing the African American hair. We need moisture. Anyway, very pleased with the hair booster.</li>
    <li> I am a long-time user of Nioxin Hair Booster and I am very happy with the results, especially when I combine it with the Anaphase shampoo by Ducray (French product readily available in drugstores in Canada).&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was prompt and efficent. As I am very familiar with Nioxin Hair Booster I know this shipment was of the genuine product.</li>
    <li> Good stuff and always very quickly delivered ....thanks why don&#x27;t you put some extra stuff in this product that will darken your hair a little.... I am starting to show signs of gray.  UGGGhhh.</li>
    <li> It works for hair loss</li>
    <li> Yes!! My Edges coming back nicely!!!  I used it 2x a day as instructed.  I think I used too much at first. Just needa to go on scalp not hair!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for thinning temples and hair line.  Takes a little while to see results but definitely worth the wait.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using Nioxin for years and he has managed to keep his hair unlike the rest of the men in his family.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hair Booster for a few years and have seen new hair growth.</li>
    <li> My beautician recommended this for my thinning and damaged hair. I bought a small bottle at the beauty store, loved it and decided to buy this bigger botle on amazon. It has really thickened my hair for the last four days that I&#x27;ve used it. Love, love it!</li>
    <li> Loved it and I will be purchasing again...AWESOME price!!! Works like it states and hair feels/looks great *SMILE*</li>
    <li> Been using this for years.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for last 6-7 months. I am impressed with it as it is giving really boost to hair growth to some area where I started getting bald.&lt;br /&gt;Let me start with cons first:&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. It gives little redness after applying which goes away after 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;2. Its not a miracle product so it may not work all over head equally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1. I can see that a lot bald patches started getting more hair density as well as hair thickness.&lt;br /&gt;2. I have not seen any side affects.&lt;br /&gt;3. Even though sometime I could not used it for weeks and I did not see any drastic changes after that.</li>
    <li> Using this along with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TXK40M/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Necessary for testosterone hormone therapy.  Really does grow hair over 1-3 months.  Highly recommended.  Use frequently (after every shower) on your receding hairline.  Rub in gently.</li>
    <li> Not sure about this one yet.  Seems to cause growth slowing when you don&#x27;t use it, but the product does seems to help.</li>
    <li> My son uses the Nioxin products as he has thinning hair and it has helped.  He has been using for over two years</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t seem to make much difference with my hair</li>
    <li> I heard great things about this brand of products and so far I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results however, it has a certain smell that makes it hard to keep using it. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything. I&#x27;m still using the 3 system, but I dropped this from the line up.  I started getting a lot of headaches while using this product. After ceasing use of it, they seemed to have gone away.</li>
    <li> Good product to add to using the scalp treatment.  I does work.</li>
    <li> great product overall price good and delivery with prime is a dream. wish it was a lil cheaper. However its still cheaper than salons.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW. I CAN&#x27;T SAY I HAVE GROWN ANY NEW HAIR BUT IT CERTAINLY HAS STOPPED THE HAIR LOSS!!!</li>
    <li> I have used the shampoo, conditioner, Therapy, Diamax and hairspray...everyday for 2 1/2 months.  My hair looks thicker and I do see new growth...although the new hair appears very fine and I do have fine hair but this looks even finer...but better than nothing</li>
    <li> I believe that this product helps but my hair line continues to recede.  I don&#x27;t know if I would I have less hair if I didn&#x27;t use this stuff.  I&#x27;m a little afraid to stop using it to find out the hard way.  No one has told me that I have more hair.  I&#x27;m 57.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and is about one third the cost of the salon prices.  Will definitely be purchasing again</li>
    <li> very good product, my hair def gets fatter when applied and that&#x27;s a good thing....very pleasant to use....recommend!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and I love it. It does what it is supposed to do. I would tell anyone who has thinning hair to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Way cheaper than I was paying at the beauty shop... Love this product and will continue using.</li>
    <li> So far really no hair growth maybe helped some I have been using it over 5 months. I would say.. Will keep using it...</li>
    <li> it is just a waste of money. I used the entire bottle no changes. I regret it</li>
    <li> Good stuff I think. Who knows.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product very long so&lt;br /&gt;am unable to rate this Nioxin  product.&lt;br /&gt;I do use and like the shampoo and the&lt;br /&gt;treatment spray.  I have used the for a&lt;br /&gt;long time.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> Helps give some extra body gives a boost but doesn&#x27;t help new hair emerge temporary partial cosmetic aide</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using the Nioxin products, I &#x27;ve been seeing a difference in my hair!!! My mom even mentioned how much thicker my hair felt. It seems my hair is growing a lot faster too!</li>
    <li> I feel that i can see actual results. I can also feel the effect on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and my  scalp is tight so the follicles don&#x27;t get the proper nourishment.  I have usd The Intensive therapy hair booster for many years and it has helped prevent excessive hair loss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the old formula which is rinsed out after 2 minutes. This product is left in your hair so I&#x27;m anxious to see what happens.</li>
    <li> This seems to add body, but I don&#x27;t notice other benefits.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! My hair was beginning to thin and this stuff along with other Nioxin products really help &amp;#34;save&amp;#34; my hair. Thank yoU!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too soon to say if it is working, but will keep trying. Only thing bad is I feel like I should shampoo my hair everyday!! Feels like I have a jar of mousse on my head.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT! I could feel/ see a difference within a week of use!</li>
    <li> I use this for 3 to 5 months I didn&#x27;t see any results!</li>
    <li> Heard about this product from my stylist. Started using it as soon as got it. The reviews here are positive so I look forward to positive results!</li>
    <li> If you are a female suffering from severe hair loss. This product is a most try before resorting to more extreme and expensive measures.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  I&#x27;ve used it for years; is the only reason hair has regrown.  Use as a spot remedy as a little goes along way. The only reason I  don&#x27;t give five stars is the price for amount in bottle.  If you can afford only one product for hair loss challenges, I recommend this as the one and only.</li>
    <li> It really does work. My mother and I used it and we have notice hair growth.</li>
    <li> Very good product and price</li>
    <li> My hair is thicker. It really does help thinning areas.</li>
    <li> I stumbles on Nioxon hair booster  a few years ago.  I thought it was good then last year more then haf my hair fell out.  The doctors told me it was from post-surgical stress.  I used Nioxon daily and after a few months my hair grew in fuller &amp; healthier then ever.  I&#x27;m a female in my sixties and always had nice hair (so I&#x27;m told).  After loosing it I felt so uncomfortable about my appearance.  I&#x27;m truly amazed at this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband also uses it and when we look at his older pictures we can see where his hair had been receding it&#x27;s grown back.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the deal is, but my hair was/is noticably thinner after a month of using these products.  I am not happy.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a reaction with a chemical in my well water or if I just respond badly to it - but I am CERTAIN this has caused my hairloss.&lt;br /&gt;Before using this, my head of hair was holding steady.  I asked my hair stylist about some products to help retain/regrow hair.  At first she even said that she hadn&#x27;t noticed any hair loss and thought I didn&#x27;t need to worry about.  I pressed her further and she said her husband uses the nioxin.  So I tried it.  And after about 6 weeks of using it, I felt I was actually LOSING hair.  Upon my next visit for a haircut, my stylist said she actually noticed my hair was THINNER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, at this point I stopped using the Nioxin and I&#x27;m  *HOPING* that the hair I lost from this comes back.</li>
    <li> I like it so far it&#x27;s been grate. I have scene hair noticeable growth with this treatment in my first few weeks of using it.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this on the front of his hair and his hair is becoming fuller there. He is African. And it&#x27;s been fine on his hair type.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product for long, and I&#x27;m not 100% sure what this is supposed to do exactly (I&#x27;ll update my review after a couple months), but in combination with the Nioxin Shamp/Conditioner, and the Nioxin Diamax (I&#x27;m about to start using the scalp therapy), my hair feels great. It really does make my hair feel a lot thicker, especially at the root.&lt;br /&gt;A few yrs ago, I noticed that my hair, which has always been on the &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; side, was starting to thin around my crown. I was shedding so much, and I was in a panic. I was always feeling my hair, hoping you couldn&#x27;t see my scalp. Stress, and stopping birth control pills was the cause of my hairloss. I had tests run to rule out other things&amp; got a clean bill of health.&lt;br /&gt;I started using the Nioxin prods and after about a month I realized that my hair had started to thicken up where it was looking really thin before. It worked SO well that I wasn&#x27;t worrying about my hair at all anymore! I purchased the largest bottles of Nioxin that you can get, so it lasted me for a long time, I only had to replace the Diamax a few x&#x27;s. Once I ran out of things, I switched to a different hair care prod, and went about my business. Recently stress took over again, and I started noticing that my hair had started thinning again, and I realized that I hadn&#x27;t been using the Nioxin. I won&#x27;t make that mistake again. I&#x27;ve added this Booster to my regimen, because I figured it won&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;I know I&#x27;m not talking about the Intensive Therapy Booster specifically, because I feel like the Nioxin prods work in unison with each other. I can&#x27;t say enough great things about Nioxin and what it does for my hair, and my confidence. Being a woman in my 30&#x27;s--thinning hair is NOT OK! I can totally sympathize with anyone else that is dealing with this issue. My dad is a dermatologist, and he deals with patients with thinning hair a lot, and besides a few drugs, there&#x27;s not much that can be done..yet. I hope that pretty soon there will be better treatments out there for us. Until then-I&#x27;m keeping stocked up on this!will be better treatments out there for us. Until then-I&#x27;m keeping stocked up on this!</li>
    <li> Got this for my 15 yr old son who has alepetia and it works really good. A lot better than the medicine prescribed by the dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I REALLY CAN NOT TELL &amp; IT DOES NOT LAST LONG</li>
    <li> I like Nioxin products a lot to give more body to my hair. I have been using this for a couple months now and I think it does a pretty good job of what it claims to do - boost your hair - without making it greasy! I put it on after showering around my hairline and throughout my scalp and never noticed any residue. I apply pretty generously too. I would recommend this to anyone who wants their hair to look a little fuller and is easy on styling.</li>
    <li> Seemed to lose more hair than I gained. Throwing out the rest of the product.</li>
    <li> So far so good, I have used these products for several years and hair does feel healthy and fresher not sure if it prevents male pattern baldness will let you know in 10 years.</li>
    <li> I have used Nioxin for years and it definitely works.  The booster is for encouraging new hair to grow.  For the best results you have to use the shampoo and conditioner. Nioxin keeps the scalp and hair healthy and you will see new hair growth, or at least I have and other ladies I have talked to that use this product.</li>
    <li> I am in early 40s and went thru this weird phase of hair loss - due to stress? hormones? chemicals/hair dyes?  Who knows, but around my temples was the worst. Really noticeable.  I purchased this with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised at its efficacy.  I must say that I also started using natural hair dyes (no ammonia) to give my hair/scalp a rest.  But the combination definitely produced thicker hair with new growth.  Very pleased. Will definitely continue!</li>
    <li> Works great and fast! Can&#x27;t believe all the hair growth.</li>
    <li> I have use this over months and I have not get any result, no more for me! Waste of your time and  money!</li>
    <li> Some things work for some, and sometimes,not for others. This one just did not work for me. Seemed like I had more hair coming off every time I used it. Oh well...it was an experiment that did not produce the desired results.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t match my hair</li>
    <li> Fantastic Product - been using for a long time - my hair stylist recommended it for my hair thinning and it&#x27;s absolutely AMAZING</li>
    <li> I have colored my hair for 40 years and just decided to go natural.  I grew weary of trying to grow it out from dark brown to the really gray natural color and asked my daughter to buzz me.  In order to do that, I was down to 7/8&amp;#34; hair with some brown tips.  So I needed to grow hair as fast as possible.  I got the hair booster and the step 6 and started using it twice a day.  My hair grew fast and it hasn&#x27;t fallen out like it was before. So happy to have Nioxin products.  Won&#x27;t change.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I&#x27;ve used Nioxin products for a number of years. I tried Kerinique products for a while and went back to Nioxin.</li>
    <li> Have very thin hair due to medications and age. This seems to give me the appearance of thicker hair. Get it.</li>
    <li> Hope it works as good as it smells!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m bummed to learn that Nioxin doesn&#x27;t have a DHT blocker, only has volumizer active ingredients. In other words, it doesn&#x27;t slow the rate of hairloss, it only makes any hair you have look thicker/more volume while your hair continues to rapidly fall.  really too bad.  however, i&#x27;ve used it for a long time and will probably continue to use it.  i shouldn&#x27;t take my aggression about hairloss on nioxin, but they&#x27;ve created the rumor mill by only allowing salons to carry the product to create a sense of exclusivity--like you&#x27;re getting some insider information from the experts.  Completely bogus marketing tactic.  Well maybe it&#x27;s worked, but it&#x27;s word of mouth, or shall we say misinformation of mouth.  why can&#x27;t you buy this in target or walmart or from your local retailer?  exactly, they can control the price and distribution.  not cool.  i appreciate companies that appreciate their customers.</li>
    <li> Have been using since Sept 2012. Buying my second bottle, don&#x27;t put on the scalp and don&#x27;t put too much.  Really helps and doesn&#x27;t make hair sticky and heavy.</li>
    <li> It seem to be helping, but I can&#x27;t truly tell because I am also using minoxidil. Since using this product, I have some hair growth on my edges. I takes awhile to see any effect. ie, don&#x27;t expect any marked effect by using this product. It is not the magic elixir.</li>
    <li> Still using, no noticeable results of hair growth</li>
    <li> My hair has began to thicken in areas in which thinning hair was appearent.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  After using for two weeks, I already see results.</li>
    <li> The following review covers all of their products.  I am over 50 and my hair has always been fine. I started to lose big sections about 2 years ago. My hairdresser recommended this company. I use the Shampoo, conditioner and the Deep Therapy and my hair all came back and it is thicker. I was skeptical because I didn;t think anything would work, but Nioxin really worked for me. Took a bit of time, but I was patient and continued to use it. I now only use the deep conditioner a couple times a week. I do Highlight my hair, so I do still need the deep conditioing. But not as much as I used it in the beginning.</li>
    <li> This product also leaves a cool feeling so far I am pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THE LARGE SIZE 2 MONTHS LATER NO CHANGE AT ALL.</li>
    <li> await results after 1 month</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a change and made hair look messy.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it grows new hair. After breast cancer some of my hair in he top didn&#x27;t come back.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much</li>
    <li> have not noticed that much difference yet but also have just start using. hope it  will work but has not yet.</li>
    <li> I will order this product again.  My hair is growing in nicely! Thanks Nioxin.  As a full radiation patient it left some hair missing but not now.</li>
    <li> Not sure how this will work.  I think it will take a while to see a difference.  I have not seen any yet, but will give it at least 3 months.</li>
    <li> This product seems to work better than anything else I have tried, but nothing is going to give me the full thick hair I wish I had.</li>
    <li> off to a good start!  THANKS!</li>
    <li> I am an avid user of this product and believe that, along with other Nioxon products in my daily regimen, have retarded the loss of hair.</li>
    <li> It works for me.  I used more on my sideburns and on side of forehead where the thinning is visible.  I see changes within a couple of weeks it fully thick with younger hair.</li>
    <li> I have one of those &amp;#34;old lady bald spots&amp;#34; on the back of my head where the hair grows thin, fine and slow.  I put a bit of the Nioxin Intensive Therapy on it each day and the hair is pretty much normal.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!!!</li>
    <li> I did see some growth of hair around the side of my hair line.  But the hairs do not grow long.  But it filled out the space.</li>
