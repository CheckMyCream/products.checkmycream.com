<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Its really nice. good piece to put on a dresser. nice color and works for what it says. nice organizer.</li>
    <li> I own alot of stuff.And this cosmetic carousel finds a place for everything. I love the color and how easily it moves. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> so amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Fits everything that i have :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great price - great shipping - the best thing that fits all my makeup-meds-creams etc&lt;br /&gt;its the perfect thing!&lt;br /&gt;love the color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Useful for my girlfriend, she liked it</li>
    <li> Great organization tool for all my make up items.</li>
    <li> It has helped keep me organized in the small bathroom that i have just wish there were more color choices.  May have to paint it.</li>
    <li> Cute, functional, practical, and easy to use with the rotating base. Pretty enough for open display and perfect size compartments for all my daughter&#x27;s hair accessories. Would buy again and again!</li>
    <li> holds lots with small footprint</li>
    <li> I have a lot of good attributes, but also a lot of bad ones too. My worst feature is how messy I am! My husband would probably prefer that I get my stuff together and stop leaving all my makeup spread out all over the counter, so he bought me this for my birthday. I really love it because of the color and also because of the size. It fits perfect in the corner of my bathroom counter, so it&#x27;s not in the way. You can also jam a lot of different stuff in here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con that I can think of is stuff doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;stand up&amp;#34; unless the sections are filled up. The way that the sections are shaped isn&#x27;t 100% flat, so things don&#x27;t stand up. (I wanted all of my lip glosses standing straight up in the sections that spin, but unless I make sure it&#x27;s completely full, they won&#x27;t stand up straight.) Not a big con at all and I&#x27;d still highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> My bathroom counter is way less cluttered. So very nifty.</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s great for organizing my makeup and making it easier to find what I need quickly. It&#x27;s also really cute decor for my bathroom, I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for minimal amount of products but most blushes don&#x27;t fit in this. Not all my brushes fit. There are no slots for lip liners or mascara. You just kind of have to stack. But this made my counter look much neater</li>
    <li> Awesome,  just what I needed,  great quality</li>
    <li> makes a great present and organizer! it is very cute and perfecctly sized. Im thinking about buying a couple more!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter&#x27;s vanity as a gift and love it. It is very well made and fits nicely with room to spare for other items on the top. It would be nice also for the top of a bathroom counter, if you have teenagers like myself and their makeup items are always laying around. This is a great organizer!</li>
    <li> I can now find that illusive eyebrow pencil or lipstick without having to go through my drawer.  I can see it and just reach for it.  Wish I&#x27;d gotten this sooner.</li>
    <li> Sitting in my bathroom right now. Cute and handy!</li>
    <li> Cute, but smaller than i though</li>
    <li> Best Makeup Organizer!!!!!! It&#x27;s Very Easy To Organize Yur Makeup &amp;&amp; Doesnt Take Up Space , This Is Worth The Money &amp;&amp; I Got One Day Shipping For $3.99 Extra &amp;&amp; It Arrived At 7:00 pm The Next Day!!!!</li>
    <li> This was just too small. The picture makes it look bigger than the real thing. This would be good in a little girls room.</li>
    <li> I love this carousel!!  I&#x27;m a very cluttered person by nature and this has really helped my bathroom and one other place I like to sit.  I like to have all my little tools handy and this didn&#x27;t even need assembly.  It&#x27;s ready right out of the box and swivels very nicely.  I would recommend this to any person that makes clutter like I do.</li>
    <li> My teenagers dresser is really under there!!  She loved this answer to her organizational problems!  And I love that it&#x27;s cleaned up!</li>
    <li> other reviews were right, it is really small.</li>
    <li> i used to keep my makeup on a tray which was a pain because i&#x27;d have to dig for products and it would just end up all over my bathroom counter. this holds all my makeup perfectly. my only complaint is where you place your brushes...the brushes in the provided image must have very long handles because my brushes disappear in between the first row of baskets because the space is so deep. no worries though, i&#x27;ll use a different organizer for my brushes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty small but I love it!! Perfect for storing lipsticks, lip glosses and hair clips! I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I really love this organizer. It&#x27;s tiny but useful, it can hold some small cosmetics. The quality is good, and the color is cute!</li>
    <li> Very pleased on how quick I received the item. I bought it for my grand daughter to put her play makeup in. She just love it &amp; all her makeup fix prefect,</li>
    <li> A little small, like some other people have already mentioned, but it works just fine for me. Definitely helps keep make-up neat and organized, and I love the color.</li>
    <li> Small but efficient....I put my makeup on it and my counter  agh room counter is not a clutter anymore. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The carousel itself is practical but this color is so untrue. The color on the picture is very mild and I love it, but the real color is way too sharp for me to accept the difference. I returned it and changed to a white one.</li>
    <li> Small but exactly what I was looking for. This is perfect for makeup and eyeshadow brushes. Don&#x27;t expect to put your large products or eyeshadow cases in here. Great for lipstick, eyeshadow pencils, eye liner, mascara and other small items (eyeshadow pots will fit). It spins easily and is holding up great in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold much makeup items as it is a lot more smaller than how the picture looks...</li>
    <li> My make up is very organized with it. I like it and it looks nice on my dressing table ðŸ˜„</li>
    <li> This Cosmetic Organizer looks terrific in my bathroom. It is the ideal color that fits in very well with the dÃ©cor.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little organizer. I use it for makeup but I&#x27;m thinking of buying another one for my spices.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE ITEM. KEEPS ALL MY THINGS IN ORDER. GOOD PRODUCT FOR A GREAT PRICE.</li>
    <li> Very handy. Holds my products.  Love my purchase.</li>
    <li> Fits the purpose but is not as nice looking as the picture.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s daughter for her to hold her barrettes/ponytail holders and makeup.  It&#x27;s very sturdy and well-made, and spins easily.  I think it will be good to help her keep her things organized and easy-to-find.  I wish it were larger though.  It really can only hold smaller items, such as lip gloss, eye shadow, hair ties, etc. The picture shows that it is holding brushes, but I think that&#x27;s a bit deceiving...or else those must be very tiny brushes!  It is expensive, but it&#x27;s the best thing I was able to find, and I think it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> The organizer came timely and best of all no assembly required. perfect for me. It has just enough room for my office equipment and accessories to fit in.</li>
    <li> love it, had make-up all over the place, thanks to this, i can find all the make-up and brushes in one place</li>
    <li> I just got my cosmetic organizer. It&#x27;s really cute but a lot smaller than I thought I would be. I still am going to use it!&lt;br /&gt;Holds a good amount of stuff.</li>
    <li> really take some time to set up, it looks so great and so nice, I likes it so much</li>
    <li> Thanks it appears to work just fine. Less expensive than other ways to order it. I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my pre-teen and it really managed the mess of cosmetics she had scattered around her bureau.  It&#x27;s a good price and because it&#x27;s metal seems like it will last.  It spins smoothly ... it&#x27;s like a lazy susan for cosmetics!</li>
    <li> I am in love with the design of this product since the moment I saw it.. very handy &amp; useful, and very easily rotating..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just have 2 small problems with this..  1. The soft pink color they are showing in the image (which is really cute one) is not what we are getting..The one we get is a darker pink.( I wish I could attach an image here but, I don&#x27;t see a option.) and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. its small for some of my stuff.. I would also prefer the same thing in bigger size..I hope the gets to manufacturer and it happens :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway..hats off to the  design.. I am still loving it.. :)</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS VERY CONVENIENT AND PRETTY.  IT DEFINETELY HELPS ORGANIZE&lt;br /&gt;YOUR MAKEUP.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO HELP CLEAR UP YOUR DRESSERS.</li>
    <li> I loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee it. This is a big hand for me to make my table tiny. I can put many stuff in it.</li>
    <li> Such a great and easy way to keep my make-up organized.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I ordered this! So much fits in it! And its so cute! It also came exactly when my confirmation email said it would!</li>
    <li> Ialways have too much on my make up table. My organizer has everything in its place. I just spin it around andfindwhatI need without any mess. I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Omg I love this!!!! I read the reviews and I knew it was going to be smaller than the picture and it is but I finally have a place to put half of my makeup!!! Thinking about buying a second one lol and of course don&#x27;t buy this if you want a huge organizer or a place to put your makeup brushes. I only bought this for my foundation, lipsticks. Etc. I LOVE IT. And it spins perfectly</li>
    <li> This Organizing Carousel is one of the best (and cutest!) purchases I&#x27;ve made!  I use mine for my make-up and make-up brushes -- however, the Carousel can be used to store many different items in it -- whether it be kitchen spices, crafts and scissors, or many other storing ideas!  The Carousel is metal, and made very well -- and the pink color that I purchased is so very cute! (My bathroom is pink, so it goes perfectly with it!)  I recommend this item, and give it 5 Stars *****!</li>
    <li> I love this item very useful and decorative</li>
    <li> this is soooo useful and beautiful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for quite some time now for some sort of organizer for all of my makeup that I consistently uses on a daily basis and when I found this I was excited to get it and see how it would work out. The little baskets are great, my brushes fit in the middle, the pink color of the organizer is cute; I love that a spins around very smoothly.. It&#x27;s a great buy overall.</li>
    <li> I got this to sit on top my dresser. Loved the new look it gave. This is so much better than the acrylic makeup organizers. I got the pink one which is just so cute. It held all my accessories, clips and daily makeup. A very good buy in a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this organizer, I&#x27;m a Pink-a-holic so everything must be pink, including my makeup stuff. This is sturdy, compact and holds a ton of stuff. Not sure how it will hold up long-term but for now I&#x27;m thrilled</li>
    <li> This is a great caddy! My only &#x27;complaint&#x27; is that I honestly thought it would be much larger.  Its great for &#x27;little things&#x27; but there is NOT enough space if you are planning to toss hair products or larger makeup tools.</li>
    <li> This organizer fits on my itty-bitty sink cabinet, and makes all my things available.  It is so nice to have everything at hands reach without having a mess.</li>
    <li> This organizer is perfect for my vanity.  I can see where other reviewers say it&#x27;s a little bit small, however if you don&#x27;t have much space to work with it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It holds a lot of makeup and because it rotates, everything is easy to access.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I made a easter basket out of it for my great grandaughter,she loved it.It looks pretty too sitting on her dressing table.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok--the compartments are smaller than what I expected and it is kind of hard to get stuff in and out of the bottom spots.  I&#x27;m not using it anymore and it is taking up space in my basement.</li>
    <li> Got here on time love the carousel just what I was looking for Got one for my daughter as well</li>
    <li> I received exactly what was shown in the photo. I wish i would have ordered the hot pink, as this color looks a little cheap in person. So maybe they all do? Regardless, I feel the hot pink would have gone with my room nicer. All in all, I am happy! You get what you see... A revolving makeup carousel! :)</li>
    <li> Very unique.  Bought as a gift to be used for nail polishes and such.  (There aren&#x27;t enough nail polish caddies out there for us divas.)  Some bottles were hard to fit, but I made it work.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to organize anything. It looks just like the picture and is sturdy. I used it to organize makeup and is a great tool to get it all organized. I recommend this to anyone who like pink, but it does come in other colors. Very cute, very sturdy, just a great product all around. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is smaller than pictured, but it holds a lot. I never thought that I could be this organized with my makeup, but this helped me do the trick! It came assembled, so all you have to do is take it out of the box and put your cosmetics in! I really recommend this product to anyone who wants to have easy access to lip liners, lipstick, hair clips, mascara, makeup brushes, eye-shadow compacts, face bronzers, make up primers etc.; these are some of the items that I store in my carousel!</li>
    <li> Love the PINK! Small organizer but holds my daily makeup items and keep them in reach on my bathroom vanity. Doesn&#x27;t take up much space which is good. Like the carousel function and sturdy construction. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so practical. The quality is great. And the colour is a little bit brighter than the pic(or this is only my own computer&#x27;s reason). I put all my daily used cosmetics in it. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Love this! Yes it takes up counter space but it holds all of my make up! I don&#x27;t use it to hold my brushes though. I keep them in a drawer. I put some card board down in the space for the brushes (I read that idea in a review) and I use that to hold my lip glosses. I also love that it spins so I have access to everything easily. This is definitely strong and sturdy and a good value. I would recommend this or buy this again. It&#x27;s a great organization tool!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday gift  &amp; it was a Great buy for my Aunt that always complained of her makeup and things being all over her dresser.....nice and perfect in size and don&#x27;t take up a lot of room on the dresser... I would recommend it to any one who want a decent sized organizer to hold a lot of their make up and facial products..... You will Enjoy</li>
    <li> The bathroom is so organized now.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great way to organize makeup!</li>
    <li> THIS WAS SO HARD FOR ME TO LOCATE. SURE HAPPY TO FIND WAL-MART HAS THIS CAROUSEL COSMETIC CADDY. DEFINATELY HELPS ORGANIZING A MAKE-UP AREA.</li>
    <li> When I first took the box out of the box, I was disappointed.  The box looked so small, how could it really hold anything?  But once I took it out of its box I could see how my things will fit in there.  It spins well and holds a lot of my stuff.  It looks fine on my counter too, and keeps my most used things together.  Even a can of hairspray fits if you want to put it in.  I&#x27;m glad i got it, and shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Love !! I organize my make up, its pretty small, but i work around it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Wish they sold a bigger one too. I got 2 of them and use them for so many things!</li>
    <li> I needed a carousel for my makeup and one that was compact but stylish. This product is cute and makes applying makeup a breeze.</li>
    <li> This is a handy item for organizing small containers of cosmetics and small toiletry tools. Its compartments are not big enough to hold large items such as hair brushes. It is a pretty shade of pink and does a great job of eliminating a lot of clutter on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Awesome- helps keep my daughter organized and every little bit helps!  Its also well made so functional and good quality.</li>
    <li> The product is a bit smaller than it seems in the photos, however I do like the product, and I am looking forward to using it. I am a college student that always needs ways for more organization in my dorm room.</li>
    <li> Nice little organizer plus I love the color . I use it to store my make up and make up applicators , nail polish , cotton balls</li>
    <li> Very handy tool for keeping track of everything needed to get ready in the morning.  Spins for easy access.  Thumbs up for this item</li>
    <li> I received this organizer as a Christmas present to help tame my rapidly growing collection of cosmetics.  I think it is a very good product.  It is attractive enough to be out on the counter and has helped organize my makeup clutter greatly.  One drawback is that the center area which is made for brushes and pencil shaped makeup is not a sealed area and if you don&#x27;t drop the products in perfectly straight they will fall out through the bottom and get stuck.  I stuck some card-stock in the bottom of these sections to help alleviate this to some extent.  It is especially great for smaller items like lip products.  Bigger items like eyeshadow pallets and foundation bottles take up a bit too much space so you may need additional storage for those items.  Overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am loving using this carousel for my smaller sewing notions.  The color is perfect for my sewing room, and it turns so easily!  Thanks for this product...makes my sewing room life sew much easier!</li>
    <li> Great organizer for your make up, hair ties, etc.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she absoutely loved it.  The color and it holds everything.  It better organized all her stuff.</li>
    <li> This carousel is fantastic! The price is amazing and shipping was pretty quick. It&#x27;s a bit smaller than I was anticipating but it still holds plenty of my beauty products. Very much worth it!</li>
