<li> They won&#x27;t do the same thing or last as long.</li>
<li> Highly recommend to save a few bucks.</li>
<li> rotate every three months as recommended, no loose strands in the brush head, not too rough on gums.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
<li> These completely lose their shape after just a few weeks of use.</li>
<li> The blue strip should turn white half-way down the bristle about three months after you begin using them - to indicate that it is time to change the brush.  </li>
<li> never really got to use them the toothbrush broke before I had a chance.</li>
<li> These were the actual heads, but they were rejects from the factory.&lt;br /&gt;1/2 of them would not stay on the handle and the other half the bristles wear down after three uses.</li>
<li> little overly expensive for what they actually are:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the top 30% of a toothbrush, and if used as recommended this will last you 9 months, but that&#x27;s an expensive toothbrush.</li>
<li> Have not had problems previously.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know why these cost so much less</li>
<li> a  waste of money.</li>
<li> The brushes are hard and stiff and they hurt my mouth.</li>
<li> Not sure why, but these particular brushs have had tendency to separate when removing from base.  </li>
<li> they won&#x27;t stay snapped onto the base after a few weeks, especially if you remove the heads for traveling.</li>
<li> Be wary of the ones that are fakes.</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
<li> So disappointed to buy</li>

    <li> Bought this about three months ago, and have gone through all 3 heads already b/c they won&#x27;t stay snapped onto the base after a few weeks, especially if you remove the heads for traveling. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> never really got to use them the toothbrush broke before I had a chance. a  waste of money.</li>
    <li> Our SonicCare toothbrush finally broke after more years than I can remember.  The shaft pulled out of the motor after being used thousands of times.  We got our money&#x27;s worth and more.  We were happy to buy the same product as a replacement.</li>
    <li> great price thank you.</li>
    <li> The three pack of toothbrush heads were exactly what I was looking for and at the perfect price as well!</li>
    <li> I bought them to replace the original brushes for our original sonicare. But these replacement heads are not as good as the original ones. The brushes are hard and stiff and they hurt my mouth. My husband also threw away his and went back to the original brush even it&#x27;s too old. So disappointed to buy and I need to find a place to get authentic ones. Will never trust cheap price again!</li>
    <li> These completely lose their shape after just a few weeks of use. Not convinced they are actually Philips, as I haven&#x27;t had this problem when I buy from Costco.</li>
    <li> These are authentic and awesome. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Be wary of the ones that are fakes. They won&#x27;t do the same thing or last as long.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that there would actually be three heads for the low, low price!  Surprise of surprises, there were!</li>
    <li> Finally got the count right.  When I ordered the brushes, they were posted as having four in a pack.  Brushes are amazing.</li>
    <li> Cheap and good stuff. It worked for when I needed it.</li>
    <li> Genuine OEM replacements, great price.</li>
    <li> Sonicare toothbrushes is #1</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why these cost so much less but they work just fine.</li>
    <li> Delivered in a timely manner. Product as advertised. Satisfied.</li>
    <li> These were the actual heads, but they were rejects from the factory.&lt;br /&gt;1/2 of them would not stay on the handle and the other half the bristles wear down after three uses.</li>
    <li> I started using Sonicare since 2001 after I had to have oral surgery. I didn&#x27;t like having injections every time I had to have cleaning. Well I don&#x27;t need that anymore since I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare. Best choice I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
    <li> Requested by granddaughter</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve purchased our Sonicare brushes through Amazon since we got the Sonicare.  Generally, they work great.  I&#x27;m guessing that there are different manufactures or suppliers.  This particular set seems to be &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34;.  The blue strip should turn white half-way down the bristle about three months after you begin using them - to indicate that it is time to change the brush.  These turned white within a month.  Also, there were some longer bristles that I had to trim off.  By the end of the 3 months, the bristles were frayed.  The quality on these were not the best.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised, but I wished the brush head was a little larger.</li>
    <li> Not sure why, but these particular brushs have had tendency to separate when removing from base.  Have not had problems previously.</li>
    <li> Bristles were way softer than my original brush head. Didn&#x27;t clean my teeth at all!!</li>
    <li> At first, I did not think that these toothbrushes would work, but they work great.</li>
    <li> We have now purchased several from Amazon and they work great.  No issues at all.  Highly recommend to save a few bucks.</li>
    <li> Good brand name brushes, these are much more durable than the off brand ones. All teeth are present and accounted for.&lt;br /&gt;I rotate every three months as recommended, no loose strands in the brush head, not too rough on gums.&lt;br /&gt;A little overly expensive for what they actually are:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the top 30% of a toothbrush, and if used as recommended this will last you 9 months, but that&#x27;s an expensive toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the originals</li>
