      <li>Anywhosits, I ordered the 2-pack of No. 3 with fairly reasonable expectations.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery</li>
      <li>One bottle if you are lucky enough to find it in stock at your local salon, is $28.</li>
      <li>If you have naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>My hair is so soft and shiny because of it.</li>
      <li>I use argan oil that was much cheaper for much larger bottles</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t any better than other conditioners that cost a lot less that you can find on your local supermarket store shelf.  </li>

<li> /&gt;Another thing about Olaplex is not only does it repair damage it mainly protects your hair from further damage and allows someone with very dark hair to go even a platinum blonde without a cotton candy feel to the touch as a result.</li>
<li> /&gt;This is take-home deep conditioner to use once a week on towel dried hair and you leave it in for 10, 20 even 30 minutes before shampooing and conditioning normally.</li>
<li> My hair still feels like cotton candy when wet and crunchy as soon as its dried, which should have gone away after the first week according to its reviews.</li>
<li> After reading countless reviews and watching endless videos raving about the effects of Olaplex I decided to give it a go.</li>
<li> I think this is the only review I&#x27;ve given on any product that&#x27;s received less than 4 stars.  </li>
<li> This product is not for moisture but for repair so you need to deep conditioner and use daily conditioner as usual.  </li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t make any noticeable difference and was extremely pricey.  </li>
<li> what do you expect other than awesomeness</li>
<li> I have really dark almost black hair and had highlights put in</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very unhappy with the results considering the money I spent on it.</li>
<li> No more frizzy hair!!!</li>
<li> My hair, fried from bad coloring, feels like hair again.</li>
<li> I have had some thinning in my hair d/t hormones and age but have been having a terrible problem with frizz this time of year with the humidity from the monsoons.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really love this product it really helps your hair to come back to its un-damage state</li>
    <li> This works, more shine and healthy looking hair for once!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Of course, best results are obtained by using step 1 &amp; 2 then 3 as once a week treatment. Never the less, best product ever! No exaggeration!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make any noticeable difference and was extremely pricey.  I use argan oil that was much cheaper for much larger bottles and it works as good or better than this.  I used this three times and one 3oz. bottle is almost gone.  I have really dark almost black hair and had highlights put in so I got this stuff thinking it would repair any damage.  I received and used within one week of getting my highlights and had even done oil treatments on my hair.  Couldn&#x27;t tell any difference.  Wasn&#x27;t any better than other conditioners that cost a lot less that you can find on your local supermarket store shelf.  Would NEVER recommend this to anyone unless you have money to throw out the window.  Was a huge rip off!  I think this is the only review I&#x27;ve given on any product that&#x27;s received less than 4 stars.  That should tell you something.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I love Olaplex.. My hair has never looked better- EVER! A++&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is take-home deep conditioner to use once a week on towel dried hair and you leave it in for 10, 20 even 30 minutes before shampooing and conditioning normally. It&#x27;s also an in between conditioning system paired with 1 &amp; 2 mixed in with your hair color. I suggest trying to use it again properly because I am a very critical person and I absolutely love Olaplex and feel like I can never go without it...&lt;br /&gt;Another thing about Olaplex is not only does it repair damage it mainly protects your hair from further damage and allows someone with very dark hair to go even a platinum blonde without a cotton candy feel to the touch as a result. My hair is so soft and shiny because of it. I cannot rave on enough about Olaplex.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this price is excellent. One bottle if you are lucky enough to find it in stock at your local salon, is $28. One bottle should last anyone using it 8 weeks.</li>
    <li> Great product for damaged - stressed hair</li>
    <li> Changed my hair from looking like a fried frizz to a healthy head of hair.</li>
    <li> bought as gift for friend who loves it.</li>
    <li> Having bleached and died my hair too many times to count in the past 5 years, and always brought it back to perfect condition afterwards, I&#x27;m an ameture professional at hair health. After reading countless reviews and watching endless videos raving about the effects of Olaplex I decided to give it a go. I realize the results are better when you use No.1 &amp; 2 first but since I like my hair how it is I was not about to alter it in any way. Anywhosits, I ordered the 2-pack of No. 3 with fairly reasonable expectations. My normal rebuilding regime (overnight coconut oil + heat 2x week and a protein filler once a week) brings my hair back to health in 3 weeks, but after using Olaplex for 3 weeks, I experienced no change. My hair still feels like cotton candy when wet and crunchy as soon as its dried, which should have gone away after the first week according to its reviews. I&#x27;m very unhappy with the results considering the money I spent on it. Should&#x27;ve figured though, these fads always promise premium quality and deliver clearance drug store.</li>
    <li> Good price and arrived on time!</li>
    <li> My hair, fried from bad coloring, feels like hair again.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing!! I leave it on for 15 minutes and it leaves my hair super soft for days. I use it about once a week.</li>
    <li> Great price. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> This product will change your hair!  It reverses color damage-- only use the 3. 1&amp;2 are meant to be used by your stylist in your color.</li>
    <li> i love this product!!! best thing ever for damaged hair, it brought my curls back from the dead....</li>
    <li> Great product ! Got here in 4 days !</li>
    <li> Great product to maintain the treatment.</li>
    <li> I just received this product and have found that it takes more than one time to get any results....which I would expect depending on the damage.  I have been highlighting my hair for over 30 yrs but buy good products to use on my hair and only use a blow dryer to partially dry and style my hair.  I have had some thinning in my hair d/t hormones and age but have been having a terrible problem with frizz this time of year with the humidity from the monsoons.  I&#x27;m hoping that this product will help prevent any breakage and hopefully I will get some growth back.  This product is not for moisture but for repair so you need to deep conditioner and use daily conditioner as usual.  I have used it several times the 1st week and am starting to see some results.  I will do this for a couple of weeks and then cut back to once a week and see how it does.  I will give a follow up in a couple of weeks when I see the results.  I hope it&#x27;s worth the money paid instead of just using coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Great for after hair treatments!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s olaplex :D what do you expect other than awesomeness</li>
    <li> If you have naturally curly hair this product is a must. No more frizzy hair!!!</li>
