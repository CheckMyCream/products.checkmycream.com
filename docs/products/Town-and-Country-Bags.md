      <li>So throughout the years i have used many.</li>
      <li>Going to place an order for two more.</li>
      <li>This is more like a cosmetic bag...</li>
      <li>Able to carry everything that I need and best part is that I do not have to go searching for items, since it is clear you can find what you need right away</li>
      <li>so its fine.</li>
      <li>so I can &#x27;see&#x27; them quickly!</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;You are welcome to send the product back, but we do have a return policy on returning items.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I can easily fit a lot of things</li>
      <li>Zipper is really cheap also.</li>
      <li>I bought this bag for work and chose it for the shoulder strap since I need to have my hands free.</li>

      <li>It is very useful and everyone that travels on planes should have one of these.</li>

      <li>It is just the right size for a suitcase or carry on.  </li>
      <li>The zipper pulls are cheap, so I replaced the main compartment zipper pull with something sturdy &amp; funky for $4.</li>
      <li>it was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
      <li>I Would love one larger if I could find one.</li>
      <li>Thanks to  BeautysBins!</li>
      <li>I was very grateful to receive it so soon and told others!</li>
      <li>I was hoping to use this for my first aid supplies, but it is wholly inappropriate for that purpose.  </li>
      <li>But if you just want to get in &amp; out of work without leaving something important behind, this is a good deal.</li>
      <li>It would be about the same as shoving everything into a large zip-lock bag--which certainly would have been cheaper and more productive at this point.</li>
      <li>I used this to put all my esthetics products in and it can hold heavy items but be caution of the side strap, I accidentally just broke the strap from the plastic part (not disconnected from the bag, bag is still in great condition) because I held only that part.</li>
      <li>The company DID put a credit on my Amazon account promptly, but I really wanted this bag.  </li>
      <li>it has lasted as much as it can.</li>
      <li>It takes a beating and is very sturdy.  </li>
      <li>Not only does this product have an incredibly offensive chemical odor, but it is so much smaller than I expected.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really know that I can use it for anything.</li>
      <li>I love this big clear bag it can be used for kids</li>
      <li>The strap broke upon first use however the customer service department was quick to respond and sent a label to send it back.</li>
      <li>By the looks of the picture, it looked like a decent bag, but the material used is very inferior in quality.</li>
      <li>The zippers themselves are decent.</li>
      <li>I love the roominess, the extra inner pouch and the over the shoulder strap.</li>
      <li>Actually, i have paid more for clear bags that were of the same quality.</li>
      <li>I can see everything clear and big enough to hold most of toys.</li>
      <li>The price was right and Amazon.com was the only place I could find it.  </li>
      <li>I had been looking for this item for a while around town where I live.</li>
      <li>It fits their new requirements.  </li>
      <li>This clear bag was everything it said it would be!</li>
      <li>I bought this when the NFL announced their new policy requiring clear bags at games.  </li>
      <li>I bought this to replace the clear bag I use for work, because my zipper broke.  </li>
      <li>I needed a clear carryall for work and this is just the ticket,also can be used for traveling because of the clarity</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a clear plastic bag, but it&#x27;s required where I work so that they can see what is being brought in.</li>
      <li>The clear carrying bag met my expectations.</li>
      <li>This is very convenient it helps you see everything you have inside and for woman it is a big help we always have problems with finding stuff.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s your deal put it in this big clear bag today</li>
      <li>Clear bags are required for personal use at my place of employment.</li>
      <li>It is, essentially, just a clear, smelly, plastic pouch.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not firm enough for me .</li>
      <li>&quot; bag easily accommodates the basic staples of employment: a long wallet, 6x9x1.5\\&quot; planner, cell phone, keys, book, sketchpad &amp; pens, with a little room to spare.</li>
      <li>not what I expected and cannot fit half the things i need to put in it for work.</li>
      <li>The black dye on the handles left very minor stains on the PVC plastic in the folding of this product, but these are not noticeable once the bag is filled.</li>

    <li> not what I expected and cannot fit half the things i need to put in it for work. I tried to return it but basically the me...&amp;#34;You are welcome to send the product back, but we do have a return policy on returning items.&lt;br /&gt;We cannot accept any products that are used or opened. It should be returned in the condition that we sent out.&lt;br /&gt;Please also bear in mind that there is a restocking fee of 15% to cover all the expenses that took to send out the package.&lt;br /&gt;We are unable to refund your shipping cost, because it is separate from the product, and all the money goes to the Courier Service Company.&lt;br /&gt;We regret that we cannot give you back all the money you paid to us.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;i will not use them again.</li>
    <li> I needed a bag to carry things for my job, this fill the bill perfectly.  I could see what I had, so could everyone else, keeping them out of it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for taking to althletic events.  It fits all the requirements they have.</li>
    <li> Its smaller than I thought but it makes a great lunch box!</li>
    <li> Small. Better display picture should be taken. Will use it for hygiene items or make up when packing for a trip.</li>
    <li> I bought this when the NFL announced their new policy requiring clear bags at games.  It meets the size requirements and I like the fact that it&#x27;s zippered.  I can get a lot of stuff into it and I&#x27;ve had no problems getting through security with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not firm enough for me . .A total waste of money.  Just not what I though it was, It didn&#x27;t look like it did online.</li>
    <li> I have like 4 of these its greaat. I used this to put all my esthetics products in and it can hold heavy items but be caution of the side strap, I accidentally just broke the strap from the plastic part (not disconnected from the bag, bag is still in great condition) because I held only that part.</li>
    <li> This bag arrived in good time, and was exacly as described.  The strap broke upon first use however the customer service department was quick to respond and sent a label to send it back.</li>
    <li> Product is Smaller than i expected but was as described.  I Would love one larger if I could find one.</li>
    <li> The post office lost it and they were out of stock and didn&#x27;t know when they&#x27;d have it, so they refunded my money.  I wanted it to use at an NFL game.  It fits their new requirements.  But now I&#x27;ll never know whether it&#x27;s any good or not.  The company DID put a credit on my Amazon account promptly, but I really wanted this bag.  Shoulder strap and everything.  Would have been perfect, I think.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected</li>
    <li> Able to carry everything that I need and best part is that I do not have to go searching for items, since it is clear you can find what you need right away</li>
    <li> I had been looking for this item for a while around town where I live. couldn&#x27;t find anything checked amazon the size was perfect it was exactly what i was looking for. The price was great and the delivery time was great. That&#x27;s the reason I rated it 5 stars</li>
    <li> very cute. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This bag would work great, if you don&#x27;t really need that much stuff to take to work.  otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> wish the strap was just a bit longer</li>
    <li> This is very convenient it helps you see everything you have inside and for woman it is a big help we always have problems with finding stuff. I use it for my make up it is on a smaller side but I can easily fit a lot of things</li>
    <li> Stores all my Nail polish and Jamberry nail wraps in the different pockets.  I can see what i need from the outside. It takes a beating and is very sturdy.  love it</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even use this case one day and it tore up. I will never buy another. I would not recommend anyone buy this if they have a lot to carry.</li>
    <li> This is not a good bag to purchase. The zipper and shoulder strap broke on the second day of use and I was not carrying anything particularly heavy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for traveling on the airplaces.  It is just the right size for a suitcase or carry on.  The price was right and Amazon.com was the only place I could find it.  It is very useful and everyone that travels on planes should have one of these.</li>
    <li> This is more like a cosmetic bag...definitely not what I needed.  Really small like a wallet.  There&#x27;s no point in the strap</li>
    <li> We have to have clear bags for work, this bag is perfect, fits in a standard locker, and it even fits &amp;#34;smart ones&amp;#34;frozen entree plus a reg water bottle, PLUS wallet, compact, lip balm!I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> It will do but much smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this for airline travel but it was a little big for my short trips. I love the fact that it has a handle and shoulder strap so I have used it for organizing other items around the house.</li>
    <li> Not quite as big as the bag that I was using.  But, at least things don&#x27;t fall over and I did manage to get everything into it.  I liked the fact that it has a carrying handle and a shoulder strap.</li>
    <li> Thank you! I asked for this for a specific date and got a speedy delivery, and awesome condition! Would buy from again. Great purchase, I loved how it turned out.</li>
    <li> Are you forced to carry your belongings in a see-through sandwich sack to your job? This 8x11x4\\&quot; bag easily accommodates the basic staples of employment: a long wallet, 6x9x1.5\\&quot; planner, cell phone, keys, book, sketchpad &amp; pens, with a little room to spare. Beauty&#x27;s Bin offered a FANTASTIC price and speedy shipping, with the bag arriving in 3 business days! Great vendor. As for this bag, it will serve its purpose for sure, but there are some disappointments: (1) The handy, zippered \\&quot;front pocket\\&quot; is INSIDE the bag unfortunately, which makes it useless as a \\&quot;quick reach\\&quot; for cell phones &amp; keys. (2) The zipper pulls are cheap, so I replaced the main compartment zipper pull with something sturdy &amp; funky for $4. The zippers themselves are decent. (3) I also replaced the flimsy shoulder strap with a better one I had laying around.&lt;br /&gt;(4) The black dye on the handles left very minor stains on the PVC plastic in the folding of this product, but these are not noticeable once the bag is filled. The PVC plastic itself is suitably protective. Bottom line: if you want to make a fashion statement, look elsewhere for a bag&lt;br /&gt;(and spend ALOT more money). But if you just want to get in &amp; out of work without leaving something important behind, this is a good deal. Besides, you creative types can have some fun customizing this baby, and a favorite wacky decal will take it to a whole new level! Happy Trails!</li>
    <li> Clear bags are required for personal use at my place of employment. So throughout the years i have used many. For $6.97 this bag is what i expected. Actually, i have paid more for clear bags that were of the same quality. True to size, the bag will fit my needs and the price was right. I would recommend to my coworkers. Going to place an order for two more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good bag for holding lunch in or snacks. I use it at work bc we can only have see through bags for our stuff. I would not recommend for long term use by itself bc it&#x27;s not sturdy enough. I sit mine in another see through bag so its fine. Zipper is really cheap also.</li>
    <li> I love this big clear bag it can be used for kids overnight stay, lunch, book bag, whatever.  What&#x27;s your deal put it in this big clear bag today</li>
    <li> Granted it was inexpensive and I&#x27;m glad because the bottom burst within a couple of days.  Might be ok for a lightweight makeup bad but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> Good bag. I like traveling with this bag. Recommended for travelers.  I travel a lot with this bag, love it.</li>
    <li> Smaller that I had anticipated. Good buy for the money. It would be nice if it came in different colors!</li>
    <li> This clear bag was everything it said it would be! I am very pleased with this purchase. It is roomy enough to put all my makeup products in so I can &#x27;see&#x27; them quickly! The bag seems to be sturdy. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I needed it for work. I love the roominess, the extra inner pouch and the over the shoulder strap. Amazon points made it a steal  also.</li>
    <li> Looks alot bigger online. About the  size of a cosmetic bag.I feel that the dimensions were not portrayed against something standard size.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the clear bag I use for work, because my zipper broke.  I&#x27;ve been using this bag for a few months now and it works great.  I have had no problems and it is big enough to store all of my things including my water bottle.  I love that the strap is detachable, because I prefer to just carry mine by the hand into work.  If you need a clear bag, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> The bag worked perfectly for what I needed, and it arrived ahead of time. I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, one the sides that holds the shoulder strap broke the very same day it was used.  I was not able to return it because I had thrown away the box.</li>
    <li> Not only does this product have an incredibly offensive chemical odor, but it is so much smaller than I expected.  It is, essentially, just a clear, smelly, plastic pouch.  I was hoping to use this for my first aid supplies, but it is wholly inappropriate for that purpose.  It would be about the same as shoving everything into a large zip-lock bag--which certainly would have been cheaper and more productive at this point. Very disappointed I&#x27;ve wasted ten dollars on this.  Don&#x27;t really know that I can use it for anything.</li>
    <li> I bought this bag for work and chose it for the shoulder strap since I need to have my hands free. It moored exactly like what I had been looking for,but after one week of use the shoulder strap broke! I only have my wallet, three pens, a Chapstick and my car keys!!! Well, I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> The clear carrying bag met my expectations. I use it as a lunch bag. It is required within the job position I’m currently working in.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a clear plastic bag, but it&#x27;s required where I work so that they can see what is being brought in. it has lasted as much as it can. in the winter the plastic, and it does not matter what plastic, but it always cracks NO MATTER WHAT. so that is the down side of it. other than that it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> it was too small for my things for work i needed a bigger bag..but my mom used it for makeup after the third use it rip in half so it was poorly made</li>
    <li> This was not a great purchase, poorly made, very flimsy, plastic started tearing 1 week after purchase, I would not buy this item again.</li>
    <li> am not real sure about this item, for the price not real happy with it.... and the pocket is on the inside of the bag it makes it kinda weird to put things in when you have to move everything out the way to get to the pocket. maybe it will grow on me  then again maybe not..</li>
    <li> I needed a clear carryall for work and this is just the ticket,also can be used for traveling because of the clarity</li>
    <li> I Love the bag...I was very grateful to receive it so soon and told others! Thanks to  BeautysBins! Very Satisfied!</li>
    <li> By the looks of the picture, it looked like a decent bag, but the material used is very inferior in quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for dog item to store. I can see everything clear and big enough to hold most of toys.</li>
