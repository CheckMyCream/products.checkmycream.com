      <li>It is exactly what I wanted&lt;br /&gt;and works great.</li>

      <li>I had a Vidal Sassoon that worked better, but all the teeth of that product broke off and fell out, so</li>
      <li>Most are 3/4 in.</li>
      <li>I love this curling iron.  </li>
      <li>I had looked at a lot of stores for this size and was so glad to find it</li>
      <li>Most curling brushes have a minimum of a 1-inch barrel--1/2 inch is perfect for my short hair.</li>
      <li>I am sure I will step on one and break it someday.  </li>
      <li>I have been using curling brushes for many years, but until I located this one on Amazon</li>
      <li>Granted, I have packed this in suitcases and gymbags many times.</li>
      <li>was expecting more from it than it was made for.</li>
      <li>I find that the low setting is the best for me.</li>
      <li>This works well and gives me  the ability to put  a bit more curl than my 3/4&amp;#34;  curling brush.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a 1/2 inch ceramic brush for sometime and was glad to find it.  </li>
      <li>opportunity your company is ignoring and is easily implemented.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Returned it, but easy to return.</li>
      <li>It was fine.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for about a week now and seems to work fine.  </li>
      <li>I have short fine hair, and this curling iron does a great job on my hair hair.  </li>
      <li>great just what i needed for my short hair could not find any were else</li>
      <li>This a great product, is actually what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Very useful hair accessory .  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a good product, but I was looking for a 1/2-inch brush iron with the rows of bristles slightly closer together, and more than 5 rows of bristles.  </li>
      <li>As usual excellent service thru Amazon.</li>
      <li>This brush iron is exactly what I have used for many years</li>
      <li>I think this would be good for short hair, or if you just want the ends of your hair waved a bit.  </li>
      <li>So far so good, thanks!</li>
      <li>perfect for thin, fine hair.</li>
      <li>, they are easily replaced, they are cheap and you would make more selling the replacements over time than you do from the actual iron.  </li>
      <li>Broke the first time I used it, on the very first curl!  </li>
      <li>It was exactly what i odered and it came right on time and was so easy to order.  </li>
      <li>Heats up quickly, stays hot, and that is all I need!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>I can get a nice tight curl in my bangs, and it comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>I would happily buy set of ten replacements for a reasonable price than toss the iron and buy someone else&#x27;s iron that I like less but is better constructed.  </li>
      <li>but when I plugged in my old brush it curled just fine.</li>
      <li>I have not found another that works this well, its a good little curling iron.</li>
      <li>I thought I was ordering a hot air brush</li>
      <li>I like my current brush alot better.  </li>
      <li>This ceramic brush is truly first class.  </li>
      <li>It is exactly what I was hoping it would be.  </li>
      <li>I have never owned a Belson product and think the next time I will spend more money when ordering a product.</li>
      <li>Does not get to hot and makes my hair wavy.</li>
      <li>Looked at many brushes and this was the only diameter brush my wife wanted.  </li>
      <li>so have to break my habit on this one because it is too hot there.  </li>
      <li>I had been looking for this item in my local stores but wasn&#x27;t able to find it.</li>
      <li>Wish I&#x27;d thought of them first.</li>
      <li>The flimsy plastic rows of teeth cannot stand up to the higher heat setting.</li>
      <li>but a couple of times, but i is exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>Though the brush iron&#x27;s barrel was exactly the size she was looking for, I would NEVER invest in a Belson product again.  </li>
      <li>but it is just a hot iron.</li>
      <li>It cannot be taken apart to clean the bristles, and now it doesn&#x27;t have enough bristles to clean anyway.</li>
      <li>It works very well and is right size for the length of my hair.</li>
      <li>She is so excited that she found the exact curling iron to her old one.</li>
      <li>I wish the bristles were a little longer, but I am still very satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>It does mostly what I want it to do but doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I expected.</li>
      <li>I got this for my wife but it turns out to be too large for what she wanted, so she gave it away.  </li>
      <li>If you choose to purchase this product, be prepared to treat it gently or build a padded carrying case for it to protect the combs.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>and this really works well.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I received this very promptly.  </li>
      <li>teeth are very brittle.</li>
      <li>Swivel on cord wouldn&#x27;t turn and the handle split open at the seam when I tried to free the swivel.  </li>
      <li>Very bad&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>I need this size for my baby fine hair, otherwise it goes flat.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Size is what I needed, but it does take a long time to heat up.  Not as good as the 3/4 in one purchased.</li>
    <li> I was looking for this size brush for a long time.  My hair is short so it is very hard to use the 1&amp;#34; size.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for this item in my local stores but wasn&#x27;t able to find it. It is just what I wanted and I ordered  a second one to have on hand.</li>
    <li> After owning and using this for almost 6 months, I have found a serious drawback: the teeth/tines are not unbreakable. I have lost so many tines on some of the combs that the hair-catching functionality of the combs has been compromised. Granted, I have packed this in suitcases and gymbags many times. If you choose to purchase this product, be prepared to treat it gently or build a padded carrying case for it to protect the combs.</li>
    <li> This is just what my wife was looking for.  Would recommend to any one that is in need of a one half inch curling brush.</li>
    <li> Given as a gift but well received.</li>
    <li> It was fine.  It was as I expected.</li>
    <li> this is one of my favorite products and I have ordered it before and will order again.</li>
    <li> best iron ever. I have very short hair and this really works well. I wash my hair every other day and with this iron I style once and it stays in until I wash it again. I would highly recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Not very powerful. I thought I was ordering a hot air brush but it is just a hot iron. Returned it, but easy to return.</li>
    <li> For the money I paid, it is okay.  I have only had it a short time, so I may be wrong, but it seems kind of flimsy.  I have never owned a Belson product and think the next time I will spend more money when ordering a product.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It&#x27;s small enough for short hair, works well and i am so pleased to have it.  It&#x27;s a wonderful size barrel and does an excellent job for me.</li>
    <li> Ceramic brush gets 2 thumbs up</li>
    <li> great just what i needed for my short hair could not find any were else</li>
    <li> I plugged it in, turned it on, it got hot enough to do what it was meant to do.</li>
    <li> This curling iron/brush works well with my short hair. I was having trouble finding a 1/2-inch diameter in the stores so was happy to find it here. It is easy to remove loose hair from the barrel. I would recommend it to anyone with short hair who also wants the brush feature.</li>
    <li> very pleased with this product. perfect for thin, fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have to click the on button several times before it will turn on</li>
    <li> Love this curling brush, does a perfect on very short hair.  Does not get to hot and makes my hair wavy.</li>
    <li> I am totally disgusted with this appliance.  And it appears I will just have to throw it away since I&#x27;ve just discovered that it is no longer returnable.  With all the weather related issues I&#x27;ve just now had a chance to pursue returning this thing that was delivered on January 4, 2014.  The return window expired on February 4, 2014.  Since there were several positive reivews I can only assume the company has lowered their standards.  I just counted the missing brush teeth.  None of the rows of teeth is intact.  One has 3 teeth missing, one has two teeth missing, and one has one missing.  AND, two of them have 10 (yes, TEN) teeth missing each.  That&#x27;s a total of 26 teeth missing.  My theory?  The flimsy plastic rows of teeth cannot stand up to the higher heat setting.</li>
    <li> I really like the smaller 1/2\\&quot; brush curling iron, but the brushes keep sliding out and I have to keep putting them back in, also it does not have an automatic shut off like my larger one</li>
    <li> I have been using curling brushes for many years, but until I located this one on Amazon I had not been able to find one that was 1/2&amp;#34; in diameter since mine wore out a few years back. Hooray, I said to myself. But this brush is a big disappointment--I turned it on high and after 10 minutes there was not enough heat to curl my permed hair. I don&#x27;t usually have 10 minutes or longer to spend waiting for a brush to heat, only to find it still is not really hot.</li>
    <li> My Mother loved it and it is perfect for short hair.</li>
    <li> The heating element works but the plastic combs break within 2 months of use. poor quality product. will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I think this would be good for short hair, or if you just want the ends of your hair waved a bit.  My hair is shoulder length and this is not the best hair tool for me.</li>
    <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t give it enough time but this brush doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to curl my hair. Thought it was my hair but when I plugged in my old brush it curled just fine. I can burn my fingers on the old one but this one I can hold in my hand without incident. So I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in the performance. I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Broke the first time I used it, on the very first curl!  Swivel on cord wouldn&#x27;t turn and the handle split open at the seam when I tried to free the swivel.  Wouldn&#x27;t go back together and it just quit working.</li>
    <li> This ceramic brush is truly first class.  It is made of materials which are high quality.  The workmanship is excellent.  Therefore, I would highly recommend the purchase of this brush.  Best regards,  DAME HILDA VAN WINKLE</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron.  It is just the right size for my short hair. It is designed so the cord does not twist up.</li>
    <li> Plastic has already broken, allowing toothed strip to slide out of brush.  Would consider replacement, but don&#x27;t want the hassle.</li>
    <li> Goods as expected, quick delivery. reasonable price.  Good Seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this for a long time, thank you so much for carrying it! My hair is short and I plan to keep it this way. I need this size for my baby fine hair, otherwise it goes flat. This does the job and I am quite please with it. Heats up quickly, stays hot, and that is all I need!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a good product, but I was looking for a 1/2-inch brush iron with the rows of bristles slightly closer together, and more than 5 rows of bristles.  (From the picture on Amazon, it looked as though this brush had 8 rows of bristles -- it doesn&#x27;t, it has 5.)  I currently have a 1/2-inch brush iron with the bristles spaced exactly like this one, and the problem is that the rows of bristles are just far enough apart so that you can accidently touch the actual iron with your fingers (or heaven forbid, your ear!), and burn them/it.  My 3/4-inch brush iron has the bristles spaced quite a bit closer together, and I almost never burn myself with that one.</li>
    <li> should have listened to another reviewer. this does not heat up quickly and even after a long time is not hot. the on/off switch doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> It does mostly what I want it to do but doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I expected.</li>
    <li> This works well and gives me  the ability to put  a bit more curl than my 3/4&amp;#34;  curling brush. Thanks.</li>
    <li> So far so good, thanks!</li>
    <li> You cannot find this size in the stores so I was happy&lt;br /&gt;to find them on line.  It is exactly what I wanted&lt;br /&gt;and works great.</li>
    <li> I have used this item for less than a month and the brushes keep coming out.  My previous curling brush was used for a couple of years and this never happened.  Needed to replace it due to cord wear. I could not find replacement of the same one so I purchased this one and am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush about six weeks and already about half of the bristles are broken off and the brush is useless.  I&#x27;m not sure what was used to make the bristles, but they seem to be very fragile.  I would not recommend this particular brush.</li>
    <li> Bum buy. Dont buy this hair brush curler as you will end up burning your fingertips when you try to get specific areas curled.</li>
    <li> I purchases this product in May of 2014, which I use about twice a week.  Almost all the bristles have fallen out of the curling brush.  There is not enough brush to grip and curl my short hair</li>
    <li> The ceramic brush iron didn&#x27;t meet my expectations or needs for my short hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting more from it than it was made for.</li>
    <li> It does the job well. Have to be careful not to burn my fingers,however.</li>
    <li> NOTHING LIKE THE PERFECTOR</li>
    <li> The teeth keep breaking off</li>
    <li> I like this, but the combs keep falling out.  I find them on the floor after using.  I am sure I will step on one and break it someday.  This works well, other than that.  I wish it had a shut-off feature.  I also would like one that keeps the tip cool, because it is difficult to style my hair without ever touching it.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find any with the good features in the 1/2 inch size.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I had looked at a lot of stores for this size and was so glad to find it&lt;br /&gt;the size is perfect it heats well and is easy to keep clean</li>
    <li> Broke apart after 2nd use.</li>
    <li> just perfect , thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this type of curling brush for many years, but they seem to be harder and harder to find locally at retail anymore.  I was a bit concerned with the short bristles of this particular one, as all the ones I&#x27;ve owned in the past have had longer bristles.  But my hair is short and this one works well for me; i.e. the bristle length doesn&#x27;t matter in my case.  I especially like that it gets hot - which sound stupid, but you have to check the wattage on these things...some don&#x27;t really get hot enough to curl your hair.  This one does.  I like it and would buy it again...in fact, I may buy an extra one as a spare.  A good value.</li>
    <li> Completely happy with this item easy to handle.  Great price, couldn&#x27;t afford the very expensive brands but this brush meets my needs.</li>
    <li> This Brush is not Ceramic. It has a little sticker attached which says it is but it isn&#x27;t. Also takes forever it get warm.</li>
    <li> The barrel slips after only 2 weeks use.  Had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> Very bad&lt;br /&gt;All the brushes become liquid due to the heat. I just throw it</li>
    <li> Nice quality  cord does not tangle and the cord is long enough to give you freedom to work on your hair</li>
    <li> have used these irons for years...good product</li>
    <li> Love it.use it all the time</li>
    <li> Melted after a few uses. Waste of money. Too flimsy</li>
    <li> Very useful hair accessory .  Its especially great to have on vacation.  I recommend this little curling iron to all the sisters who are not yet completely natural.</li>
    <li> These are not ceramic, the word ceramic dose not appear on the actual box. I was disappointed. Takes a long time to heat.</li>
    <li> does not get hot enough. flimsy workmanship. teeth are very brittle. it is hard to find a 1inch curling brush.</li>
    <li> The teeth are falling out after only 2 months use!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother whom wanted the curling brush that you can remove the bristles to clean the actual curling iron.  She had looked everywhere in stores and could not find any.  She is so excited that she found the exact curling iron to her old one.</li>
    <li> This brush iron is exactly what I have used for many years and I was so happy to find it was still available in 1/2 inch.  As usual excellent service thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> My email to Belson  (the manufacturer) requesting replacement bristles:I purchased the 1/2 inch pro brush iron from Amazon January 13, 2014. I have since used it fewer than 20 times on my 1-2 inch hair. Almost 1/2 the bristles have broken off which is very disappointing because I love the way this iron works.  More disappointing, you do not offer replacement bristles on your website, which is an obvious thing to do since they are easily (too easily) removed and replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am contacting you first  before contacting Amazon with a review to give you an opportunity to appropriately back your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect you to send me at least one full set of replacement bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their reply: Sorry to inform you but we do not sell or manufacture replacement parts for this product. So therefore we do not have any that we can sell or send to you as a courtesy. If your product is under the year warranty and you have your proof of purchase you can send it in with your receipt and we will gladly replace it for you with a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My response:why on earth do you not sell replacement bristles for this product.  They are not attached, they are easily replaced, they are cheap and you would make more selling the replacements over time than you do from the actual iron.  If you look at the reviews - to which I am going to add my own - you would see this is the major complaint from people who actually like the product but suggest others don&#x27;t because of the bristle issue.  I would happily buy set of ten replacements for a reasonable price than toss the iron and buy someone else&#x27;s iron that I like less but is better constructed.  This is a business problem/opportunity your company is ignoring and is easily implemented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Nuff said</li>
    <li> I have short fine hair, and this curling iron does a great job on my hair hair.  I find that the low setting is the best for me. I can get a nice tight curl in my bangs, and it comfortable to use. I wish the bristles were a little longer, but I am still very satisfied with it. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> It sort of works, but it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I&#x27;d like, so it seems to take longer to curl and the curls don&#x27;t seem to last. (?)  Perhaps this is due to the damp, humid weather we&#x27;re having now.  It has 2 heat settings,but I only use the hotter one; I can&#x27;t imagine what you&#x27;d want the less hot temperature for.  I had a Vidal Sassoon that worked better, but all the teeth of that product broke off and fell out, so I thought I&#x27;d try a different maker.</li>
    <li> I have very short hair and I do like this curling  iron, up till now I have not found another that works this well, its a good little curling iron.</li>
    <li> I bought this before I realized it was a Belson product. I have never been happy with the heat output of their products and this still has not changed. It seems to take forever to heat up, which is never as hot as your average curling iron and It doesn&#x27;t come with automatic shut off2 stars is being generous.</li>
    <li> Not that great but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used the curling brush but a couple of times, but i is exactly what I needed.  Most curling brushes have a minimum of a 1-inch barrel--1/2 inch is perfect for my short hair.</li>
    <li> This a great product, is actually what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a curling iron that does not burn you hair no matter how much products you have in your hair.</li>
    <li> I bought the Belson Pro 1/2&amp;#34; Professional Dual-Heat Brush Iron as a gift for my mom 4 months ago for Christmas.  She only used it a few times and noticed the barrel of the iron jiggling after the 4th use.  Then it started to move around and around, which it shouldn&#x27;t as the barrel should be solid, and finally fell apart in just 4 months!  I tried to return the item but it was flagged&amp;#34; non-returnable&amp;#34; as it exceeded the Jan. 31st deadline.  I guess the company figured it should last at least 3-4 months before falling apart protecting them from replacing or refunding the item as it would exceed the return deadline.  Though the brush iron&#x27;s barrel was exactly the size she was looking for, I would NEVER invest in a Belson product again.  What a waste of money and time ordering this cheaply made product.  Definitely NOT worth the money and I would NOT recommend this brush iron to anyone.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wax over a product that just does what it is supposed to do. Suffice it to say, that if you want a curling iron brush, this one is very good and met my expectations. I did like getting the 1/2 inch diameter. That is not always easy to find!</li>
    <li> Love it , just what I wanted , the brushes are shorter than on other curling irons , will order another in future !!</li>
    <li> It was probably a good curling brush, but it did not have the size barrel I ordered.  The only option I was given was a refund.  I then went to a local beauty supply house and bought the Belson I really wanted.  Wish I&#x27;d thought of them first.</li>
    <li> I received this very promptly.  It is exactly what I was hoping it would be.  I&#x27;ve used it for about a week now and seems to work fine.  Thank you</li>
    <li> It was exactly what i odered and it came right on time and was so easy to order.  The only thing i don&#x27;t like is that the very end is hot if i want to grab it to hold the iron on the curl a few seconds.  I do that with other irons so have to break my habit on this one because it is too hot there.  Also, I would like to have the brushes longer.  They don&#x27;t grab the hair as easily as the small one I used to have.  I like that you could replace the brushes if they broke.  On my old one the brushes broke in time and there was nothing I could do but order a new one.  Is there any way to order longer brushes to replace on this one? If I could do that i would be very satisfied---as it is now, I use my old one with broken brushes more because what brushes there is are longer and grab the hair so easily.</li>
    <li> MAKES A TIGHT CURL WITHOUT PULLING HAIR OUT.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife but it turns out to be too large for what she wanted, so she gave it away.  Her friends likes it though.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a 1/2 inch ceramic brush for sometime and was glad to find it.  It works very well and is right size for the length of my hair.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted, would recommend to anybody that wants small curls</li>
    <li> This little curling brush is just right for short hair.  It heats well and holds the heat.  Mine seems to last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Wife likes this model - but this is her third or fourth brush. The last one kept letting the brushes fall out due to a loose retainer. The new one does the same. I glued the retainer in a closed position and that seemed to work. If it was not for a continuing problem with the brushes, I would rate this a 4. But until Belson corrects a common and aggravating problem, I rate it a 2.</li>
    <li> Looked at many brushes and this was the only diameter brush my wife wanted.  Most are 3/4 in. and larger..</li>
    <li> I use several size curling brushes.  This one was for areas where I like small curls.  It did not do the job for doing this.</li>
    <li> The brush is not as hot as expected and what I read in reviews.  I like my current brush alot better.  I would like to return it, not sure if the company will accept returns.</li>
    <li> This product is not worth buying.  With only three uses, the bristles started falling off.  It cannot be taken apart to clean the bristles, and now it doesn&#x27;t have enough bristles to clean anyway.</li>
