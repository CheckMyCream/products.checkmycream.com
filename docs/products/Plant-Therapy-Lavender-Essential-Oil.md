<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I make Lavender water with this for my curly hair revival AND for freshening clothes and furniture!</li>
    <li> Pure lavender smell, great smell.  Very strong, but inexpensive.  One you have to have in your collection.</li>
    <li> Use it for adding to vinegar water to clean my bathrooms...works wonderfully and smells great.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  This is my second purchase.</li>
    <li> little strong and dry I may add the stuff to baby oil and see how well it works .</li>
    <li> Perfect for multiple functions. I&#x27;ve used many oils and this one have already used many times since it&#x27;s arrival a couple of weeks ago. I use it to keep bugs away from my Lhasa Apso as well as my husband and I. When we&#x27;ve forgotten and get nabbed by a mosquito the Lavender reduces the selling and takes away the itching immediately. I use it for neuropathy pain as well as at night and it seems to help me sleep better. It definitely has a calming effect.</li>
    <li> Love the product which came earlier than promised. Made a reed diffuser and the smell was very strong using just a few drops. Will definitely order again from this company which I rate as very reliable.</li>
    <li> Got this for my summer bug spray, cleaning spray, and bug bite mix. I use lavender for everything!  Arrived well packaged and promptly, and seems to do the trick. Like the larger size.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  I used it with my homemade liquid fabric softener that I made.  Without it the scent wasn&#x27;t strong enough.  Fast shipment.</li>
    <li> Disgusting Lavender.  Not only does this oil smell rancid, the bottle came with about 1/4 of the bottle gone already.  Pouring inside leaked out 20 drops in less than 30 seconds.  Dont waste your money.</li>
    <li> Love it! Use it every night to help my girls sleep.</li>
    <li> This item was delivered quickly and is a good quantity (30ml) of essential oil for the price.  The aroma is strong and pleasant and what I had hoped.  I use it to scent natural oils for use after bath and on a cotton pad laid on top of the humidifier in the bedroom.  There are so many uses for essential oils.  This oil does what I want, pure and true.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely a fantastic product.  I have mixed it to use as a clearing spray, as well as simply pouring a few drops in the bath.  Shipment was timely and packaged well.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> Not as strongly scented as I remember my KIS oils being. But overall pleased.</li>
    <li> I used some of this with wild orange and a carrier oil.  My niece was having anxiety and stress.  I put some on her and within minutes she said she could tell she felt more relaxed.  So I made her a bottle.  I will place some on my pillow and my son&#x27;s to help with sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I diluted it and rubbed some on my son&#x27;s shoulders and neck for a headache.  It helped him feel better.  But the next morning he said his neck itched and when I raised his shirt up I saw a reddened skin around his shoulders and neck where I rubbed the oil.  He said it did not hurt but itched a little.  It looked similar to a light sunburn.  So this oil is definitely CONCENTRATED!  So dilute it!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I use this with vinegar as a fabric softener.  I LOVE it.  It leaves a nice scent on my clothing without being too powerful, and there is no oily residue left from it either.</li>
    <li> Very odd smell. I may have received a bad batch considering all the other ratings. It honestly smells like when clothes have been put away wet. Very disappointed :(</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It has helped me a lot with my skin.  I truly cannot find a problem with it.  And as an aside, cats don&#x27;t like the way it smells, so if there is something important to me that I don&#x27;t want the cats to get into, I will put a couple of drops of Lavender oil or a couple of drops of peppermint oil, near the thing I am protecting.  Don&#x27;t use essential oils on your pets though.  It&#x27;s not good for them I&#x27;ve read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this oil helps me.  I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
    <li> I have always relied on Lavender oil and this brand lived up to my expectations.  I use it for everything from the love of the fragrance, to putting on insect bites.  Has healing properties.</li>
    <li> I order oils online all the time. Prices are good and they come in a timely manner. I like that its a bigger bottle because I use so much lavander.</li>
    <li> Good seller.  Product smelled more like mint, not lavender.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t familiar with Plant Therapy products, so I orderd the Lavender Essential Oil as a test.  I&#x27;ve been using it in my diffuser and am very pleased with overall quality and price.  Will definitely order again, as well as other scents in future.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewer wrote, this oils smells medicinal. I have used other Lavender EO&#x27;s, and this one isn&#x27;t my fav. I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> Good price, very satisfied</li>
    <li> As noted in the product label, this product is undiluted and therpeutic grade.  Be aware that 1 drop goes a long way.  I use it as a relaxation tool by applying 1 drop to the ball of each foot prior to an afternoon stretch.</li>
    <li> This was a great price for so much lavender oil!  I use it for burns and bites.  Also a few drops on a hanky will carry you through any troubles. Love it!</li>
    <li> Smells good and good for the soul</li>
    <li> I am not an expert on oils so I will not try to grade it&#x27;s authenticity. Smells great! Mixes well with other oils.&lt;br /&gt;Has the perfect little opening for a drop at a time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what my problem is.  I love lavender scented soaps and candles.  But for some reason this just didn&#x27;t smell good to me.  Maybe I just don&#x27;t like the pure lavender smell.  I wish I had bought a smaller bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the bottle itself is good.  Amber color, with a nice stopper at the top to be able to easily control how much comes out.</li>
    <li> This has the worst smell and it gives me a headache, I&#x27;ll never buy it again.  I&#x27;ve tried others and they were much better.</li>
    <li> perfect!  very fast shipping</li>
    <li> For the price it is a good strong liquid, so use it sparingly. It doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender when you put a drop on a piece of paper, but waite a few minutes and the nice odor will come out.</li>
    <li> Great product - really strong. My wife only needs to use a few drops in the bath, laundry for linens and on her potpourri.</li>
    <li> I use this to add to my lavender scented lotions as well as use it sometimes on my body before I go to bed.  The scent is soooo soothing to the senses!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. The aroma is nice and strong even in the bathtub. You can&#x27;t beat the price considering oils are pretty involved to make. In definitely purchasing from this brand again.</li>
    <li> Lavender has always been one of the more expensive oils I&#x27;ve used, but this Amazon pricing is just great. Lavender seems to work on relieving all types of internal issues, from digestive problems to kidney stones.</li>
    <li> Like what catnip is to a cat. It has a pleasing fragrance, &amp; can be added to your body &amp;face cream. Also great as a room deodorizer, without the chemicals.</li>
    <li> Product is as described.  Product was delivered in a timely way.</li>
    <li> love it works wonders. I will never go another day with out it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s such a lovely smell and has turned my vinegar fabric softening into a far more pleasant experience ;) Just what I wanted</li>
    <li> I was pleased to find a brand of 100% pure essential oils that are good.  I usually buy Young Living and have been disappointed in the past with other brands.  I have been putting this in my oil burning lamp and have been loving it.  I would purchase this brand of oil in the future.</li>
    <li> i tried a fan diffuser but the plastic parts of that machine did not interact well with the oil so i ended up throwing away the diffuser after one week (it was $50 so expensive mistake). instead i have been putting a few drops on a cotton ball and putting it on my nightstand. that seems to work well enough. lavender does make me feel more tranquil and it is so nice to go to sleep with such a lovely aroma in the bedroom</li>
    <li> I just put a drop on my hand waved them around my dog and he fell asleep.  I plan to use this tonight to help me sleep.</li>
    <li> It is lavender, but it is not pure, I can smell the harshness of it not being organic. I would not recommend this unless in organic form. I use Lavender in a steamer for aromatherapy and because it is not pure, I will not be using it.</li>
    <li> The plastic stopper used to keep the oil from dumping out gets stuck in the cap, so if you aren&#x27;t paying attention, or someone is using your steam room and they don&#x27;t know to look, you can dump an entire bottle out in about 0.5 seconds... A bit of a design flaw.</li>
    <li> Hello,  I have tried this product before and knew that using Amazon purchase I could get the fragrance kneeded.  Thank you,  Michael</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and in perfect condition with bubble wrap.  Built-in euro dropper is great - just tilt the bottle and drops come out.  I use about 10 drops daily mixed with water in a tealight candle burner, and one bottle has already lasted me a couple months!  Love the fragrance and find this essential lavender oil to be very calming and relaxing.  Will definitely continue to purchase this.</li>
    <li> I put a drop of this on my upper lip before bed.  Breathing the scent of lavender really helps me to relax and sleep well through the night.  The smell is very nice and the quality seems to be excellent.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product. So far I have used it in homemade salve. I&#x27;m looking forward to using it in other ways too.</li>
    <li> Service was as expected, and the items quickly arrived via Amazon prime. It was the products themselves that disappointed me. I have ordered from plant therapy in the past so I should have known the quality of the product I was purchasing, however up until this point I had nothing else to compare with. In the past my plant therapy rosemary, Lemon, and bergamot oils were a little underwhelming and lacked the depth and quality of aroma that I had come to expect from essential oils in the past having used the aura cacia brand. But the price was so reasonable and the oils were OK and already purchased/opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ran out of my aura cacia lavender I went to my local health food store to purchase another but the price was too high for my budget at this time and I knew that I could get the Same thing for a more reasonable price with plant therapy. When my order arrived however, I realized they were not the same product at all. The lavender essential oil in comparison was so dull and felt diluted and weak. The peppermint oil as well felt underwhelming for an essential oil prized for Its potent menthol properties. I should have already expected this given my past disappointing purchases so it was my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this product does not meet my expectations for essential oils and I guess it is true that you get what you pay for. While others my be fine with the lack of quality, these essential oils are not for me. I will be sure not to repeat my mistake in the future.</li>
    <li> I mix the Lavender Oil and their Peppermint Oil into my coconut oil. I use it in the shower after washing to keep my skin soft and hydrated. It also helps to relax my muscles,</li>
    <li> I like this lavender, but it&#x27;s not the best I&#x27;ve used.  It is potent, and it may just be the flowers used in this batch, but it has a secondary after-aroma that I can&#x27;t define.</li>
    <li> very good quality, have bought it many times, always satisfied</li>
    <li> There is a difference in essential oils when used properly, do not fall for the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; oils that don&#x27;t work as well or last as long.  This is undiluted, so don&#x27;t use like cologne, and is great for scenting crafts (pillows, candles, etc.).  A little goes a long way, and makes this a good bargain.</li>
    <li> The best lavender you will inhale and love. Recommend everyone to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy all my oils from plant therapy.</li>
    <li> I use this oil nightly and it seems to work.  I am sleeping soundly.  It is strong, so only a few drops are needed.</li>
    <li> I wash/process raw wool fleece and put a few drops of this into the rinse water.  This leaves a wonderful smell and provides a little bit of oil (i.e., moisture) in the fleece.  This is awesome!</li>
    <li> The bottle arrived leaking the lavender, and the bottle could not be opened. I am not sure if this was defective from the shipping or if it was defective already in the manufacturing process. I had to throw it away, and Amazon refunded me for this item. I am deciding whether or not to order it again to see if the next shipment is  better . . .</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was expecting and arrived in a timely manner.  I use it for homemade cleaning products and it works great and smells wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I do not like the consistency. Looks to me like it has been diluted and smell is not that strong.</li>
    <li> I received the oil in a timely manner. The oil has a strong scent that I love. Very pleased with the order.</li>
    <li> I have occasional panic attacks and this works well to calm me. The small size makes it easy to carry</li>
    <li> My husband loves lavender; I rub some on his back mixed with a little lotion every night. Moisturized skin and lovely, true lavender calming scent.</li>
    <li> didnt understand packaging. I was expecting an eye dropper, instead there was a little plastic tab that I just didnt understand the use</li>
    <li> Plant therapy oils are wonderful!  Their website has lots of information about what oils can and should be used for what and not... Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a repeat purchase.  I use it as a natural insect repellent and for insect bites after forgetting to put it on and start itching from their bites. I keep the Q-Tips in my bathroom after placing it on my wrist and arms to repel the insects and to keep the bathroom smelling great.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to use on homemade wool dryer balls and it works great. It leaves a nice light lavender scent on my clothes without leaving behind any kind of oil spotting. It&#x27;s also safe to use mixed with vinegar as a fabric softener for the washer. It leaves behind a scent that&#x27;s detectable, but not overpowering. The seller, Plant Therapy Essential Oils, also sent me a jar that had a bonus .5 fl oz in it!</li>
    <li> The oil arrived in perfect shape and was shipped quickly.  I am not using the oil for aromatherapy but in lieu of clove oil to keep my earth colors (oil paint) from drying out too soon in a way that doesn&#x27;t use harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I LOVE the smell compared to a room filled with cloves!!</li>
    <li> Came  promptly and sealed.</li>
    <li> Smells great. This is 100% purified lavender essential oil. I feel it&#x27;s a bit pricey especially with the shipping, but will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. You need very little and it comes in a large size for the price. I put two drops in the bath and it is so relaxing!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I was told that it would keep the bugs away (I was about to leave for a trip to Africa). I was not only not bothered by bugs, but it smells awesome! I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am a Lavender Essential oil snob....so this was a nice surprise.  Clean, not purfumy, &amp; has worked well in my melt &amp; pour candles.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I open the Oil the lavender is not a grade A but can be used for small burn.</li>
    <li> We really like this brand of oils.  You can put a couple drops in a spritzer of water and use it for supplemental underarm support if you follow my meaning.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several bottle of this Lavender Essential Oil.  My husband and I love it!  It certainly is therapeutic and we enjoy it in our bath water!!</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy to me is a good name in essential oils. I rank it right up there with some of the high priced companies. This is just one of many of theirs I use</li>
    <li> I use essential oils for many things, homemade flea sprays, bug repellents, etc....this is my fave. oil for headache relief and calming. This is the best brand IMO. I have tried all the major brands, they just don&#x27;t compare. Also the company itself has wonderful customer service!</li>
    <li> Love this oil. It has so many uses. I put it in my essential oil burner (with some water over a tealight candle), and straight on my skin when I have blemishes. It&#x27;s beautiful for traveling too. Dab it directly onto the bulb of a lamp in your hotel room for some easy aromatherapy!&lt;br /&gt;Follow me at:  tracestylecreatelive.com  for more tips and stories on food, fashion &amp; home.</li>
    <li> I have not opened the parcel at this point as the oil was intended to be used in a Cherokee death ritual.  The package was expected by 7th, but did not arrive until 10th.  My little girl passed away on 8th. I borrowed oil from a friend who is a massage therapist....</li>
    <li> This oil smells very nice. I used it in a bath with epsom salt. Also have put a few drops onto a cotton ball and onto my nightstand. Shipping was very fast and well packed.</li>
    <li> I used this to make a large batch of milk &amp; salts bath powder and I am quite pleased with the result. The fragrance is excellent and long-lasting, even months later. Thank you. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I was delighted with this purchase. Because I am sensitive to certain scents i am always apprehensive.  When I received the Lavender Essential Oil I was more than satisfied and would recommend.</li>
    <li> It seems to be fine, just not sure what quality oil i&#x27;m actually getting.  Wish i knew more about it.</li>
    <li> Great product, super prompt shipping.  I love Plant Therapy oils; they are always clean &amp; pure and highly effective at a far better price than a lot of the other brands.</li>
    <li> First time purchasing EOs from this company. The lavender was very potent and the scent does ease up and it&#x27;s quite sweet.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend diluting this product if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells - quite grassy in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been almost two hours and I&#x27;m enjoying the fragrance at my own comfort level after putting a \\&quot;drop\\&quot; on the bottom of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;Package came as expected and wrapped well.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I don&#x27;t like, is the dropper cap thing. It doesn&#x27;t drop, but splashes and runs.  Be careful when pouring this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, great oil for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2/21/14:&lt;br /&gt;After using this, I realized the scent of the oil changed. Even more grassy - reminds me of spoiled hempseed oil. It became almost unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;I had to toss this out. ]: Will not buy this EO again.</li>
    <li> I read that breathing lavender at night would help with sleep, so I thought it would be better than taking a drug.  I think it helped, but if not, it still has a relaxing aroma.  This is the real deal too.  I read another reviewer who put it in the laundry rinse water, so I did that for my sheets.  Very pleasant!&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Dreams!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful price for these essential oils!  I make soap and this is perfect for my craft.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the third bottle of essential oils I have bought from plant therapy (also have lemon and tea tree oil). I love them. The smells are great and a little goes a long way. I remember reading somewhere that people didn&#x27;t like the plastic insert inside. I have had no problems with it and find it very usefull when adding drops to my laundry detergent. Too much doesn&#x27;t come out all at once. I could see how it may be annoying if you needed larger quantities at once. Overall happy and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> It  was packaged nice and secure, it arrived in a timely matter. I really like the scent, and yes I would recommend this product. And I felt the price is great for this product.</li>
    <li> I have used several lavender oil brands in the past.  I would rate this as a 6-7 only because it is not as fragrant as the last one I used. I do like the value though.</li>
    <li> This smells very good and helps me sleep every night!  It smells like a spa, but in the comfort of my home.</li>
    <li> this oil by Plant Therapy is a great Lavender.  I use this on my face to keep from getting break outs.</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy is my go-to for essential oils! Always top quality and more affordable than the needlessly expensive 3-tier marketing companies! Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I got peppermint and lavender together. The packaging was secured with bubble wrap. I got extra 20% essential oil in each bottle. Great Value!  I will definitely consider buying again in the future.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of lavender. This was exactly what I expected and it was reasonably priced. I plan on ordering more.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with this product.  For me, it dried up more quickly that expected.  Shipping expensive.  I might revert to a warming oil instead.</li>
    <li> This is a very helpful and essential oil for bug bites, scratch, scrapes, minor strawberries on knees, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Good for our grand children and the adults, too. Helps to relax and calm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Not a great scent to this lavender. It has a sour note that is not pleasant to me. I have been able to find better scented lavender oils (a company named Natures Alchemy)</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve never purchased any other brand, so not sure if this one stands apart from the rest, but i was looking for a little something to add to my house.  i normally hate scents of all kinds.. this is a no perfume zone.  i put a few drops of this near one of my air returns and it adds a nice subtle scent to the house for a while that i can deal with and actually enjoy.</li>
    <li> I bought this Lavender oil to use in bath soak mixtures. It is just what I was looking for . Great price, pure and strong. A little goes a long way. If you need more information, you will have to wait till I&#x27;m done soaking.</li>
    <li> I am using this oil for my new, green approach to cleaning my house. The ingredients used include choosing essential oils for both their beneficial properties and their scent. Lavender is a must have and this is working for me!</li>
    <li> I use it on my pillow to help me sleep.  Works like a dream.</li>
    <li> My daughter has significant eczema that shows up on her arms every spring and usually stays until winter.  Last year, her arms were scabbed and bloody most of the year.  I didn&#x27;t want to use steroids on her arms all the time, but none of the lotions I was getting seemed to make any different.  A friend of mine told me that lavender oil can work for eczema, so I thought I would give it a try.  I mixed 25 drops of the this oil with about half a cup of extra virgin coconut oil.  After about a week of use, her arms were completely clear.  Now whenever I notice her scratching, I just apply it for a few days, and she clears right up.  The only problem I had was that the lavender oil is so strong that I got a headache mixing it in with the coconut oil.  But that&#x27;s a small price to pay for my daughter&#x27;s health.</li>
    <li> I just used this product in my soap making 3 days ago. I will not know how well I like it until the soap cures in 3-4 weeks, then I will know how the fragrance last. the customer service this far has been great. thank you</li>
    <li> For a lavender oil this is what I consider a medium grade oil.  It has some contaminates.  The first I noticed was that it has a smoky smell when it is first used.  The smell is not unpleasant but definitely not lavender.  That smell dissipates fairly quickly.  There is a second smell that is not so pleasant and overshadows the lavender scent for about half a day.  Once that is gone the lavender smell is excellent.  I think this would be a good tea light oil or to use as scent around the house but not for a scented oil mixture such as those used in massages.  I put some on a tissue and leave it out in a room for about half a day (overnight) before I use it as an aid to reduce stress by scent.  By that time all that is left is the lavender scent.</li>
    <li> Great Transaction.  Description matched item received.</li>
    <li> Shipped way fast, I love it so so so much! Especially in this size, it lasts a while. I use it on my face for acne it&#x27;s my miracle treatment. This brand is really good!</li>
    <li> Happy with delivery and product&lt;br /&gt;It suited my needs&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again In the future&lt;br /&gt;Next time&lt;br /&gt;I will increase the amount</li>
    <li> Loving your oils, have purchased several and find them to be of excellent quality.  Will be purchasing more and more as I learn the benefits of essential oils.</li>
    <li> Its not a 5 star because of leaking plastic dispenser tip. this is second or third time its happened.</li>
    <li> I got this to add to Tom&#x27;s of Maine body wash because they seem to have dropped their Lavender line and only have unscented. This product is a great value compared to other brands as you get 30ml for a great price.</li>
    <li> I have used many brands of lavender and this smells synthetic and bad... Absolutely vile. Do not get it cos its hardly therapeutic. I regret getting two cos I can&#x27;t even use one...</li>
    <li> I use this any time my sons and I take a bath. It helps to relax them and get them in a good mood to go to sleep. I just love the smell. I need to order more soon!</li>
    <li> Bought this oil to make my own anti-bacterial cleaning spray (water and vinegar and oils..it&#x27;s fantastic).  Very happy with the oil quality.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the larger bottle &amp;#34;drops&amp;#34; easier - the smaller bottles seem to take longer or need a few shakes to get the drops going.</li>
    <li> I just mixed some with water and put in a spray bottle. Sprayed it on a paper towel and put into a plastic bag with holes punched into it. Makes a great sachet to put into kitchen drawers.</li>
    <li> This does not smell like real quality lavender at all.  It as too much of a menthol or medicinal smell - maybe pesticides used on the plants?  I bought two bottles based on the reviews and am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great for bug bites, pinkeye, mood, and so much more. Essential if you have kids. I mix with fractionated coconut oil to apply to skin. This is for external use only.</li>
    <li> Love the sent of lavender- purchased this oil to use in my homemade detergent (Pinterest) and now my clothes smell marvelous!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe that this would really help me relax and sleep good at night but&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised.  I really have a hard time falling asleep at night.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I just spray a little lavender on my pillow and end of falling asleep so much&lt;br /&gt;easier than before.  I love this oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the Lavender Essential Oil.  It came as promised and I&#x27;ve used it and love the aroma, as it&#x27;s added to my baths.  It goes a long way and I look forward to my next.</li>
    <li> I love using this oil. It smells great and is wonderful to use in stressful moments. I add a drop to my wrists, it absorbs fast, does not leave an oily residue, and is fragrant. I would have given 5 stars, but I don&#x27;t love the way it smells after it has been on awhile. But, I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Great product! used in baths, spray, diffuser smells great and  great strength! will order more! Will be seeing if there are more oils from this company!</li>
    <li> I mix 10 drops with a handful of epsom salts and 1/2 c baking soda, for a rejuvenating bath.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Love the essence, just put a dab or two on a towel in the dryer and spreads the essence throughout my laundry!</li>
    <li> Smells great. Fades fast though.</li>
    <li> My husband and I use this almost daily.  I diffuse it or apply for a calming effect.  Great quality essential oils.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect in every way imaginable. Thank you, Plant Therapy, for a quality product with reasonable pricing.</li>
    <li> I have used this with olive oil to help with skin allergies, it is helping.  I also use it in a vaporizer, which is helping me sleep better.</li>
    <li> I love the plants. very good  i like it and everyone in the house took one plant put in their bedroom ,, thanks</li>
    <li> Great product!  The only thing that I was disappointed with was that it is for external use only.  Great price.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for this bottle of Lavender.  I have bought two of them already.  I will probably purchase it again.  I received it quickly and nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> No, because I did not receive the plant therapy brand! What I received was a plant Guru brand! I did not like the smell but as it is a hassle to return I kept it and will only be using it as a cleaning additive.</li>
    <li> I buy regular drugstore brand body lotion without fragrance.  I put a few drops of lavender oil in and I have a large bottle of lavender lotion that would cost many times over.  it&#x27;s really wonderful to use on the chest, inside the wrists, before you go to bed.  it&#x27;s a wonderful aid for a good night&#x27;s sleep.  another natural sleep aid is put a few drops on a  cotton ball, stick it inside the pillow case. I am  researching other herb essences as well.</li>
    <li> Used this item in my hair and it makes it soft and also smells great.  Great for natural or permed hair.</li>
    <li> This products smells wonderful!  Smells just like real lavender and not a knock-off.  Delivered on time, and bottle is big enough to last a long time.</li>
    <li> My Boxer has allergies that won&#x27;t stop, so we can either drug him up all day or put about 3 drops of this on his chest and he is good for the day.  Much cheaper and safer alternative to the drugs.</li>
    <li> This product was sweeter in lavender aroma and fresher  smelling that some others that I have purchased. I think its strength was stronger too.</li>
    <li> This has zero lavender.  It actually smells either rancid or synthetic.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product with a lovely scent that is very much potent.</li>
    <li> Think this is the second bottle i have ordered, its awesome, helps me have a restful night sleep as well as sweet dreams... a great smelling oil</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with my purchase. It smells wonderful and I am using every night at bedtime and is very relaxing. Looking forward to using it for other purposes later.</li>
    <li> We use this product on our towels at our salon. The clients LOVE this. What a great way to unwind and at such a great price!</li>
    <li> Great oil!  Great value and fast delivery, thank you!</li>
    <li> Smells like lavender.  What more is there to say?Great scent after a long day and especially nice right before bed.</li>
    <li> I dont think I could say enough wonderful things about this oil.  By far my favorite.  This brand provides a great full, full-bodied lavender scent, fantastic for oil warmers.</li>
    <li> This is an average lavender oil product.  I use it at night with hand cream to help with sleep.  I don&#x27;t know how long this product has been bottled (since there are no dates on the bottle) and I have to wonder how old the oil is since it seems to have lost some of it&#x27;s &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; then again, perhaps it was a weak batch in the first place.</li>
    <li> I like this brand.  Good product, but seems prices are going up.  I use it for the bath, nice smell!</li>
    <li> Lavender is one of the best essential oils, and this one is great! The bottle I received is even a little more than 1 oz. for the same price- score!</li>
    <li> Great lavender scent. I mix this with almost everything.  My 5year old son asks for it in his humidifier at night to help him sleep.</li>
    <li> Great essence for medicinal use and unbeatable fragrence!</li>
    <li> I am using more natural products in my life.  This is for bath time.  It is to help you relax.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
    <li> All 3 Essential Oils Lavender, Peppermint &amp; Lemon I purchased from you are awesome.  I needed to use them to rid my apartment organically of some summer bugs as I have a little Maltese doggie and cannot use anything else but something that cannot hurt her.  I actually will be ordering another one that I didn&#x27;t that last time.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I use it in water in a humidifier/essential oil diffuser to help me sleep better at night.  I have used it in a bath with epson salt to help relax my tired back and legs.  It has also been mixed with water in a spray bottle to disinfect or just give a nice smell to the air around me when I mist my area.</li>
    <li> I put 2 drops in my pillow each night and I have a great night sleep. I love the smell and quality of this oil!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you!  I am using the oil in potpourri and it smells divine!</li>
    <li> Soothing and calming.</li>
    <li> great quality oil at a great price. oil seem very potent! this company makes great quality oil. I buy all of my essential oil from them.</li>
    <li> The order arrived fast, it smells delicious. I am in no way an expert in essential oils so cannot give any clever pointers.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be very potent, you don&#x27;t need to add a lot of drops to whatever it is you are using it for.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. I love the lavender. I would say the quality is excellent. I use it on the bottom of my feet wnen I&#x27;m not feeling well, on the back of my neck when I&#x27;m stressed and I love the smell. It only takes a little to go a long way. I love this product and will order other oils from them soon</li>
    <li> Quite a strongly scented lavender. A little goes a long way. I am really surprised by how powerful it is. One drop is enough to fill my entire condo.</li>
    <li> The oil arrived promptly and is sensational!</li>
    <li> Beautiful aroma.  Paired it with a Meditation CD for a co-worker/friend who has a lot of serious challenges with her health and does not do well with added stress.  She said she uses the oil whenever she starts to feel stressed - as aromatherapy.  Unsure if she has used it for anything else, but know that it aids her well in just that one form.  Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> RECEIVED ABOVE WELL, GOOD PACKAGING, EXCELLENT ALL AROUND, FIRST TIME I HAVE USED THIS COMPANY&#x27;S ESSENTIAL OILS.  WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.&lt;br /&gt;PURCHASED THIS LAVENDER ESSENTIAL OIL VIA AMAZON.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Lavender fragrance. I am in a high stress job and like the calming nature of the oil. I use it mixed with my body lotion or put a few drops in my bath. It lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> After getting the replacement bottle, since the first one was broken in transit, I am happy to say that I love this product and would happily purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I use lavender as aromatherapy to help with sleep. This smells good and seems to be high quality, not the muted soapy smell of a low quality oil. Good delivery, too.</li>
    <li> lovely smell. Use it at night to help me sleep</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been making my own lavender spray and saving LOTS of money.&lt;br /&gt;I work in a physicians office and no one has ever been offended by the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;. Nice product.</li>
    <li> Love the oils~ Great quality</li>
    <li> I recently bought some lavender oil at a very exclusive shop that cost me four times more than this lavender oil.  I cannot tell the difference between the two.  a great bargain.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Lavender and the size is nice for the price but it would of been nice to get a  informational sheet along with it stating how to use it and what it is used for. I&#x27;m sure there are many uses for it but I don&#x27;t know what they are. Next time you can you send that along  with the product and that would be great.</li>
    <li> Used this in a formula with baking soda to clean mattresses and kill dust mites. Scent us great!</li>
    <li> Love it for the face and as a deodorant.</li>
    <li> Good quality essential oil; I used it in a natural mosquito repellent and it worked great!  I will be purchasing more as I need it...</li>
    <li> We have used Lavender oil for years. It has always been VERY EXPENSIVE. Plant Therapy was a delightful find. High quality, efficient delivery and relatively low cost. To get five stars they would need to improve their label. The product itself is wonderful.</li>
    <li> SUPER concentrated, strong and pure, high quality, will last forever! Couldn&#x27;t ask for more, I use it on everything, will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I place a trace amount around my nostrils before I go to bed and it gives me a solid nights sleep everytime.</li>
    <li> I order this product to add scent to my home made massage oil. A few drops added the scent that I was looking for. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Love Plant Therapy EO&#x27;s. Use this to help me sleep at night.</li>
    <li> I have been using aromatherapy for years.  With a 6 month old I do not have the opportunity to travel to the only health food store within 60 miles of me.  I am so pleasantly surprised to have found Plant Therapy Oils on amazon.  Great quality! Look forward to purchasing some of the companies other oil blends!</li>
    <li> Wonderful and soothing aroma. I use a few drops with my scent free laundry soap and it makes everything smell so fresh and clean. Not overwhelming. My husband even loves it and he dislikes anything &amp;#34;scented&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first but upon using this product, aromotherapy is trully a relaxing and amazing remedy for alternative measures besides prescriptions. It truly works.</li>
    <li> I have tried other esssential oils company (kis oils) this one was not bad ,good price for 30 ml and with an extra 6 ml but it was not a strong as others and the smell was a bit different I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s 100% undiluted</li>
    <li> I use this in EVERYTHING!! Laundry, baths, oil.... It is great!! I am usually not a fan of lavender, but this in not a overpowering scent. I cannot wait to make my friends and family some relaxation bath stuff!</li>
    <li> I ordered lavender essential oil and received it promptly. I am currently cleaning my house with it in a homemade surface cleaner and I love it. Sometimes you order an item and what you get isn&#x27;t what was portrayed but I got exactly what I ordered. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling and potent essential oil that I use for making my own home made laundry scent booster and bath salts. This product worked perfectly for my applications and I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> The lavender oil is very relaxing and many of my clients love it.  I also love the fact that it comes in a 36 ml size.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0069SQQ2I Lavender Essential Oil. 30 ml (1 oz). 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.]]&lt;br /&gt;This pure lavender oil has indeed been therapeutic for me.  I had surgery on my foot and after two weeks the stitches and bandages were completely removed by the doctor and I started to apply this oil to the area of surgery and where ever it was tender, I felt that this helped sped up the recovery time and I am very happy with this product.  It also helps to relieve mild discomfort with arthritis. I ordered two more bottles, one to give to my sister.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try to combat fleas in my dog who is 14 1/2. The product arrived on time and was exactly what I expected. So far, as a natural deterrent for fleas it seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Lavender Plant Therapy Essential Oils because I hoped that it would be a better product than a different brand that I had purchased. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I put some in one hand, rubbed my palms together and cupped my hands over my nose and breathed deeply a couple of times. I felt a relaxing of my shoulders. I&#x27;ll put some on my pillow tonight.</li>
    <li> such a great product and I was so pleased with the expediency of the shipping!</li>
    <li> Keeps my wife happy at bedtime, sleeps better. She has dementia.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! The lavender smell is spot on! I felt like I was in a sun drenched lavender field. I read some of the reviews saying the smell want that great but I don&#x27;t think they have ever smelled a lavender plant because that&#x27;s what this smells like! It does have a slightly grassy smell but not bad at all. I put 1 cup of water and 100 drops of lavender oil and use it to make certain rooms in my house smell better. Also I read it keeps away earwigs, which I get in my bathroom this time of year, after staying with the water and lavender oil 2 weeks ago I still haven&#x27;t seen any so so far so good. Great product for a good price. Thanks Plant Therapy will definitely buy more products from you guys. Only complaint it took awhile to get delivered after ordering.</li>
    <li> this is great oil, My wife mixes it with coconut and it is a great moisturizer. I love the smell and it not overpowering when you mix it.</li>
    <li> This lavender smelled different than a different brand name of Lavender oil. I did notice that the scientific name was slightly different, so I&#x27;m guessing that has something to do with it. Anyways, the other brand that I have smells clean, fresh, pure. This one smells a little... different. I can&#x27;t put my finger on it. It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s just not what I have grown accustomed to.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Has an earthy lavender smell.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time, for EVERYTHING.  Cuts, in my diffuser, mouth sores, to help my kids sleep, etc.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price.  I like this company and its a little cheaper than most brands. Does not gum up the dispenser so I like and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I receive this Lavender Essential Oil as a gift, I love the smell, not too strong, and works great. I use this as one of the ingredients in my Lavender Yogurt Mask ([...]) and also I use it as sun damaged skin for my daughter after she got sunburn.It relieves some pain after she got hurt from the sunburn. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love lavender.  This smells great and so many uses.  Apply directly to body/skin and gave used it for many household and personal care items.  Great temporal massage for relief of headaches too!</li>
    <li> This is a very strong oil, no fake here! smells wonderful. I added a few drops to my bath oil, and also as a room spray.</li>
    <li> Really good quality, much more potent than &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brands, and more affordable than the equally good Young Living brand.</li>
    <li> Great service and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essential oils are so beneficial for humans as well as animals. We have well over 50 different oils - all 100% therapeutic grade which is high quality, of course. As a great side benefit, they smell fantastic because they ARE fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have helped our family in so many ways. These are God&#x27;s gifts to mankind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more. Your prices are reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> I use this for crafts... it smells wonderful and it&#x27;s a decent amount .. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase, lavender is my favorite</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super sensitive to perfumes and chemicals and was a little reluctant to try any other oils besides the expensive name brands I had been using in fear they woould have perfumes and fillers despite labels. My friend let me smell hers and I thought I would give them a try. I bought the lavender and the peppermint and havn&#x27;t had a problem with either. In fact, they&#x27;ve worked at least just as well! I&#x27;ve used lavender on my daughters ant bites and it really soothes them. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I love the quality and versatility of this oil!  I put a drop in my mascara to lengthen my lashes, a few drops in my shampoo for strength and growth, a few drops in my homemade laundry detergent for a fresh scent, and I often dilute it and use it as a room spray/or diffuse it for relaxation!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, works well in any mix.  I use it for lotion, fragrance in my clothes soap, and sugar scrubs.</li>
    <li> Have been very pleased with the oils from Plant therapy.  they have nice aroma&lt;br /&gt;infuse well  packaged well and ship fast</li>
    <li> This oil smelled horrible. It was also very very strong. I threw it away cause I couldn&#x27;t stand to have it in my humidifier (only used 2 drops).  If you Are sensitive to smells I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it.  You may like it, but I didn&#x27;t. :(</li>
    <li> Top quality oil.  Plant Therapy has a good selection of oils and many positive reviews. Very reasonable price. Quick customer service.</li>
    <li> Good quality Essential Oil. Good service and item packaged well for protection of glass jar. Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
    <li> Smells and works great! So many are really mixed so you can just barely smell them. I put a couple drops in my warmer and it fills the room with a wonderful clean smell for hours.</li>
    <li> It smells just as wonderful as the other more expensive brands.  I have not seen any difference in using this oil and the other brands..Rocky Mountain, Doterra, and Young Living.  I will stick with this brand from now on.</li>
    <li> I always buy essential oils from Plant Therapy.  I buy it to use it in my business, which is a 6,000 sq feet gym.  We use the oil in all our cleaning solutions, and it makes the entire area smell so good (and I use it sparingly)! I also order lemongrass, eucalyptus, tea tree oil, lemon, orange.  I am completely satisfied with the quality of their products.  I&#x27;ve been ordering for 2 years now.</li>
    <li> When you put a drop of this on head lice, they kind of dissolve.  And it is soothing to a child&#x27;s scalp.  I prefer the Peppermint oil for killing lice and chasing them away, but kids say the peppermint &amp;#34;stings&amp;#34; (I think it tingles).  So, the lavender is a good choice - and it smells lovely!</li>
    <li> I  had heard that lavender oil was good to nutralize odor.  I don&#x27;t like to use harsh deodorant -  I use natural ones but in the hot summer you perspire.  Put the oil under your arms after your deodorant and dont worry about odor all day.  It also has medicinal properties.  Good for skin irritations, scrapes, burns, brown spots.....I use on my hands to lighten brown spots.  I just love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Lavender is my favorite essential oil.  I bought the 30 cc size because I know I wil go through it quickly.</li>
    <li> Bought different brands of Lavender over the years, this by far is the best, two drops only on my pillow and sleep soon folllows</li>
    <li> I am using this for fabric softener. I mix it with vinegar and it makes a great fabric softener that doesn&#x27;t clog up the machine. 40 drops per gallon of vinegar.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this except for the fact it&#x27;s not organic. I gave it 5 stars because I knew that before buying it. I do believe this is a fantastic essential oil. If it was organic I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if Amazon let me... I will and always will be doing more research for the perfect organic oils. Be happy, stay healthy!</li>
    <li> awesome product, received 2 days after I ordered. A few drops of this in a cup of baking soda, sprinkled over your bare mattress..wait an hour and vacuum. The scent is just right, not overpowering at all. I&#x27;ve done the same for a musty closet that had carpet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried this item before but wanted to make room air fresher. I was very happy with it. It arrived very quickly. I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This seems like a really great product. Will order more. The aroma is just like it should be and what a great price</li>
    <li> This is concentrated and exactly what I wanted. This lavender essential oil smells as expected, not much else to say, good size, ships fast.</li>
    <li> Love Plant Therapy oils! Amazing quality and great prices. I researched a ton of companies, including major mlm companies, and found PT to be the best all around.</li>
    <li> I have used Lavender Essintial Oil for years, and this is by far the best I have ever used. I would recomend this to everyone.  I will be buying all of my oils form Plant Therapy (Posergy). You can&#x27;t find a better oil on the market, and the Prices are low... THANKS.....</li>
    <li> I like to add this to Dr. Bonner&#x27;s lavendar castille soap- makes the house smell amazing!</li>
    <li> I use this in my diffuser and on bug bites. It is a wonderful product. Good quality and makes the house smell great!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Just a several drops to water will create good lavender solution to spray. Great price! A+++++++++++++</li>
    <li> The smell is full of my house and it is actually brant new!!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s awesome, I think I will buy more!!</li>
    <li> I like lavender although I recently heard lavender could cause you to have to much estrogen. I don&#x27;t know if I believe that.&lt;br /&gt;I rub it on my feet at night and it helps me sleep. I arrived when expected. Fair price.</li>
    <li> High quality, fast delivery, very reasonable prices. I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer as it is my go-to oil for sleeping well at night.</li>
    <li> I love this lavender essential oil. It&#x27;s wonderful in a bath or used during a massage. The scent is very relaxing and enjoyable.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product. It has a pure lavender scent and would be perfect for potporri or perfumes.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from migraines for over a decade. In the past year I was able to make dietary changes that have reduced my migraines to almost none. That said, I do still get them on occasion and with the price of medications so expensive I have been seeking out non-medication remedies. I came across something that suggested that lavender oil could be used to ease headaches, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it by inhaling from the bottle, putting a few drops into a hot bath, or dabbing some onto my hot-pad and then putting it on my head. It has worked better than expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lavender is very strong, so not much is needed a time, making it last a long time. It is also a great amount for the price. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> smells great, I use it in my bedroom in a humidifier to help me sleep or take a wiff if Im feeling stressed out.</li>
    <li> Very medicinal, not like anything I&#x27;d ever intentionally buy.  very disappointed in this product.  I was hoping to use it on my pillow at night, but it smells horrendous!!!</li>
    <li> Love this essential oil! Smells wonderful and you get a lot more for your money! The scent of lavender makes me feel calm and that&#x27;s great, especially when you have anxiety issues, as I do.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this product. This brand has my loyalty, and the lavender oil is exactly what one needs.</li>
    <li> I like the oil and it appears to be good quality.  Only complaint is the bottle it comes in.  Has a weird built in cap that is supposed to distribute the oil that does not do a good job.  Otherwise loved the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to use when I massage my dog (as recommended by Cesar), but my kids hate the smell.  I like the smell, but you can guess who wins.  Good product, fast delivery, exactly what I ordered.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I love it.  very strong but pure.  I rub it on my feet at night and sleep like a baby.</li>
    <li> This is a Great oil. Nice and hearty and not diluted. Aroma is long lasting and size is perfect. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This essential oil smells wonderful - just like good quality lavender should.  We use it before bed time in  a spritz bottle on the pillow case and a dab under our nose (tiny dab).  This results in calmness and deep sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it at the start of a headache, a tiny dab under the nose and the headache is immediately gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will buy this product again and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really good. One drop goes a long way. The smell is pretty nice too. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my order of Lavender Essential oils. I will order again from this company. I like their prices and their packaging for mailing. Good company.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great essential oil. The price is great compared to others with the same purity.</li>
    <li> It smelled like Lavender. I dilute and use as a body wash everyday and at night before bed. Great product</li>
    <li> Had purchased the 10 ml bottle last year along with some other brands. Have been using them to keep mosquito&#x27;s out of my bedroom (read on-line that it would work). Used all of the small bottle and wanted to re-stock. Product arrived within a day from order date. Have mixed 20 drops of oil with 10 drops of water in small spray bottle and spritzed my sheets, pillowcases and towels. (Don&#x27;t get this oil on furniture, wood floors or anything that has varnish or lacquer. Also, don&#x27;t put directly on skin without diluting.)  I re-spritz every few days. By the way, I have also purchased some lavender sachets ànd spritzed them and put with my underwear. Nice authentic lavender smell. Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Got my order, it was very well packaged with lots of bubble wrap. The bottle has a dropper on it which makes it really nice and easy to use. Great product, I will definitely order from this company again.</li>
    <li> I love the properties of this oil and it is the go to oil of essential oils. This smells great.</li>
    <li> Love how the scent works perfectly for my homemade linen spray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 oz. (1/4 C) Vodka&lt;br /&gt;4 oz. (1/2 C) Distilled water&lt;br /&gt;15 drops Lavender Essential oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix in spray bottle. Shake before each use!</li>
    <li> I love this!  I use this for my son to calm him before bed time and it works like a charm. I add a few drops to his bath water then just before bed I add a couple of drops to lotion and rub it on the bottom of his feet. This routine has helped him relax and fall asleep so much easier! I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Works to keep fleas off the dogs and cat and helps the house smell nice.</li>
    <li> This product has a wonderful scent.  I have ordered lavender oil from other companies and paid almost double.  This product is of the same quality and the price is amazing.</li>
    <li> This oil did not smell nice.  There really isa difference in the quality of oils available.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I use it in a diffuser when I go to bed. The lavender oil produces a calming fragrance which allows me to drift off to sleep in no time ; For sure I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love Plant Therapy&#x27;s Lavender essential oil.  I use it in conjunction with Cedarwood at night while settling down for the evening.  Love the smell.  I also use a drop of Lavender in my mascara - it extends the life of the mascara and keeps it from clumping in addition to providing my lashes with extra length and health.</li>
    <li> Love this and its a large bottle. Will buy again for sure when I run out of this. Thanks!! :)</li>
    <li> Lavender is known for calming your mood and also helping allergies. Mix with Tea Tree and diffuse to inhale. It also works for burns, cuts and wounds. Give this natural oil a try. It also can be used as perfume instead of all the chemical perfumes out there. Not only you smell good, but calms you down throughout the day. I truly love it. When my son is upset, I let him smell for a while and he calms down as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this lavender oil in an attempt to help me sleep better. I took a tiny (maybe half oz) spray bottle and filled it mostly with water. Then I put a drop of oil in it and shook it up. I use one spray on my pillow at night and it&#x27;s so relaxing, and I&#x27;ve been sleeping so much better since I got it! When I got it, I realized that it was perfect for calming me down while I&#x27;m having panic attacks (I have them often enough for it to be a problem). Even just opening the bottle and leaving it sitting on my desk is amazing, but I like to heat up a little bowl of olive oil and put a drop of lavender in it. I soak my nails in that for about 15 minutes and I&#x27;m usually pretty calm after that. I also just made my own cuticle oil using Olive Oil as a base, a little bit of Argan Oil, a couple drops of Tea Tree Oil and a drop of lavender to make it smell nice. So far it&#x27;s been very good on my cuticles and it smells amazing. This company is amazing! I received this the day after I placed the order and it was packaged so well. Not to mention that it was actually 1.21 oz, not 1 oz like I was led to believe. How awesome is that? If you have trouble sleeping, or with anxiety like me, this is exactly what you need. It&#x27;s well worth the money, I promise! I will be buying more products from this company soon!</li>
    <li> good scent but not my expectation of french lavender.  need to use more drops to have stronger smell.  but it really make me sleep deeper as recently i didn&#x27;t have good sleep at night. after make few drop in the electric essential oil diffuser.  much better.</li>
    <li> Not sure what to write product arrived on time I personally use it for a spider repellent. Also makes my house smell great</li>
    <li> I use this oil in my hot bath and it creates a very relaxing environment and leaves my bathroom smelling wonderful for hours.</li>
    <li> love the oil. beautiful scent and very pleasant. I use it on my feet before bed and helps me to have a better sleep. thank you</li>
    <li> High quality oils for great prices. Love Plant Therapy!</li>
    <li> Great oils -- really pack a punch... should dilute, but I use it straight... very effective.</li>
    <li> love these oils, dont even need a external dropper, scent wise these are nice potent oils</li>
    <li> Use this in our homemade deodorant and lotion.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this oil.  It smells fresh, &amp; strong (good quality) and the company sent a follow-up email checking on my satisfaction and offering to right any wrongs. Very pleased with this purchase all around!</li>
    <li> I usually only buy Doterra. But I just had a baby and we are going through oils really quickly so I had to find a cheaper option that would work just as well I use this last week for my 2 month old baby&#x27;s ear infection. it took away her ear pain immediately and got rid of the infection within 2 days I couldn&#x27;t be happier I will definitely be purchasing again</li>
    <li> I have received this product but to be honest I have not had a chance to use it.  It smells wonderful and I plan to dilute it and use it in a spray bottle to fresh up the guest bedroom mattress and linens.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s strength is a Good scent for the value.  I use Lavender in so many ways. I love the versatility of lavender</li>
    <li> This oil smells great; I use it as a home scent and it&#x27;s very refreshing.  The price was good too.</li>
    <li> High quality product at a great price. I use it for laundry, hair care, aromatherapy, and my 2 year old loves it on the stuffed animals she sleeps with at night. I will buy it again once this bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality French Lavender oil. Smells amazing and is very strong so a little goes a long way. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> We primarily use this in our baths.  We&#x27;ve had it for 6-7 months and, while we haven&#x27;t kept accurate records, we figured we probably got about 75 uses out of this bottle.  I think that&#x27;s pretty good..??</li>
    <li> As always, another great essential oil! I feel confidant when ordering from Plant Therapy that I will get high qulaity products!!</li>
    <li> Great product. I love Plant Therapy and I love that I can order it from Amazon smile.</li>
    <li> Seems fine, not a lot to say one way or the other on such a simple object, but I am sure it is fine</li>
    <li> My first scent for my lotion making project. Wow smells strong but I always liked this in my bath so we will see.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Plant Therapy Lavender Oil for a few weeks now and love it! It helped clear up my toddler&#x27;s hand, foot, and mouth disease breakout and has taken the sting out of some minor ouchies for my son. I put it on my daughter&#x27;s feet at bedtime and it helps her sleep better, and relaxes me after a long day, too. The scent is pleasant and natural, strong without being overwhelming. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Nothing bad to say here, typical lavender essential oil!  It smells like lavender and is oily!  Nothing astonishing about it I noticed, but then again what would be astonishing… it is as it should be.  Good product!</li>
    <li> Note: The cost of this item is $14.95- I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s appearing as $39.95 on this review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item via a very timely shipment, and I am very pleased with the quality of this product. It&#x27;s 100% pure and therapeutic grade, which prompted me to order it. I utilize this wonderfully scented Lavender Oil in my Humio (brand) humidifier in my bedroom at night; the scent relaxes me and lulls me to sleep, while the humidifier adds moisture into the room to combat the drying effects of my home heating system. Despite the superior grade of this oil, the price for the 30 ml bottle was very reasonable. The company followed up with an email to insure my satisfaction with the purchase of their product, which I appreciated. I will not hesitate to do future business with this vendor and plan on doing so again soon!</li>
    <li> I finished it quickly. The lavender is very pleasant. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> nice product with many uses</li>
    <li> wonderful for the bath! thank you.</li>
    <li> smells so good, I love this stuff! I mix it with water in a spray bottle and spray it on my hair to refresh it between washings. it smells so good, it is so refreshing!</li>
    <li> calming smell and great for the price!</li>
    <li> very high quality oil.</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love with Plant Therapy essential oils. I am not an expert when it comes to oils but I have been using them for a long time, and have tried a lot of different brands. The Plant Therapy essential oils are by far the best I&#x27;ve found, especially for the price. my favorites are lavender, orange, peppermint and tea tree.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> Has more of a pine smell to it, not truly lavender.  It isn&#x27;t offensive or bad but just isn&#x27;t a true lavender scent.</li>
    <li> Only a few drops provide a nice fragrance. I also mixed some in with my shea butter - nice!</li>
    <li> Very happy.  Good price and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I am not  all happy with the smell of this supposedly Lavender essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;Would try some other brand .&lt;br /&gt;Though it was a great bargain price (30 ml),it&#x27;s not the relaxing Lavender scent I expected .</li>
    <li> Fast ship and great oil!!!</li>
    <li> we are a huge plant therapy fan!</li>
    <li> This Lavender oil by Plant Therapy essential oils is great for bath time. I put just a few drops (around 3-5) in my bath and the whole tubs smells amazing. The lavender is very relaxing after a long day. The 1oz size might not seem like much, but it has lasted me a long time. I still have most of the bottle left after about 2 years of having it!</li>
    <li> This is pure and it smells amazing. The container is very high quality! I would recommend this brand to others.</li>
    <li> I use this for a muscle relaxant as well as a sleep aid.  I&#x27;ve been using essential oils for over 30 years, and recently created a mixture for biting insects . . kills them DEAD!</li>
    <li> The product lists all the various things it can be helpful for on the small bottle. I think an accompanying one page more detailed description of the value that can be obtained from Lavender should be included, instructions for use etc.it&#x27;s a good product, but sending it without any information, assumes that the person ordering it knows everything there is to know about it.</li>
    <li> The smell is very strong (not very pleasant) because it&#x27;s 100% pure oil. I hope someone suggest a medium to dilute this oil and provide purchasing link....I bought this to help me relax. I dropped a little under my pillow (to help sleep) but the strong smell kept me awake...</li>
    <li> Great oil for my mixture of mosquito repellent</li>
    <li> I use lavender oil to soothe a headache.  It works great.</li>
    <li> I use lavender for household burns... this is the same product you can pay way much for.. Its an essential oil that helps the pain and healing for burns.</li>
    <li> Love this oil!  Use it before bedtime and when I&#x27;m stressed.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have not used essential oils before this product, so I cannot speak from much experience. However, this product seems to do what is advertised. The bottle actually came with 20% more free which was an unexpected bonus! The lavender smells nice and it is definitely potent! I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Plant therapy are affordable and quality oils. They never disappoint. If you go through a lot of lavender oil, buying by the ounce is the best choice. In fact if there us one essential oil to own it is lavender oil. It is good for so many things. Recently I developed an allergy to come body powder, I had a red rash with black spots all over my legs. I mixed some lavender oil in hazelnut oil and it was healed overnight.</li>
    <li> This shipped quickly and is what is stated.  A very nice oil for the price.  It&#x27;s uses are so many to list, but if using in a skin ointment, \\&quot;less is more\\&quot;.  Quite nice, indeed!</li>
    <li> This oil is perfect!  I am using it to make linen spray, for myself and as gifts.  It is perfect.</li>
    <li> Just as good as Young Essentials at a much better price !!&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again and some of the other products</li>
    <li> This lavender essential oil is a great value for the amount of oil you receive, and the scent is top notch. I use it in home-made lotion, lotion bars, and will be trying soap soon.</li>
    <li> From helping with bee stings, to killing bacteria and viruses, to adding peace to a room.  Lavender is one of my daily go to oils.  Adding it to patchouli and distilled water will give you a scent that will fill your home or any space with peacer.  A top note, with a wonderful fragrance, it helps with sleep and relaxation.  Blessings.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect addition to my epsom salt bath. Just a few drops and the fragrance fills the room. Makes for a relaxing stress-free feeling and a good night&#x27;s sleep. I like that it come with a dropper so I don&#x27;t have to waste it pouring. The bottle is glass and the dropper is shakeable.</li>
    <li> I have tried other brands of lavender, and by far, Plant Therapy is the best and my favorite.</li>
    <li> A lovely product for when you want to relax.  I sprinkle some drops in my bath water (best) or on my shower mat.  Lavender helps me get to sleep quickly.  Give it a try and see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> Given as a gift. Beautifully fragrant aroma. Very well received. Used often. Ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> I received the lavender essential oil in the mail very quickly and it smells very nice. Just what I wanted. Yes, I would recommend it to others. Also, the delivery came with a free sample of Christmas oil, which is always a nice treat.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, exactly what I wanted. Concentrated strong smelling oil ideal for dilution in perfume/cologne/homemade Febreeze! I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> You just need a tiny drop on your pillow to make you slumber to sleep. Item arrived on date expected. Expensive but worth the price</li>
    <li> Ok I took my first lavender bath using this oil. And it was heavenly. I love the smell. By far my favorite.</li>
    <li> this is the highest quality of oils I&#x27;ve ever seen or smelled, great product. the price was great and it came as promised and ontime.</li>
    <li> I rub a dab or two behind my ear at night.  I plan on getting a water bottle and mixing with water to spray in the bedroom.</li>
    <li> The lavender essential oil is very nice. The aroma is great not too strong like some oils are. Enjoying using it in a variety of ways, lotions, soaps, cleaners.</li>
    <li> My oils came super fast and were exactly what I expected.  I like the 1 oz size much better than the smaller bottle as we were using the smaller size up very quickly!  Great product!</li>
    <li> Product was shipped quickly and was amazing. Very relaxing and soothing scent. I would strongly recommend to use if stress and need a relaxing bath.</li>
    <li> I am just getting started with essential oils.  After some research, I ordered Lavender and Peppermint essential oils to try.  This product appears to be very good, the transaction was very smooth, and the company&#x27;s communication has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most \\&quot;recipes\\&quot; using essential oils ask you to use a certain number of \\&quot;drops\\&quot; of the oil, but these bottles do not have a dropper that allows for accurate measurement...just a \\&quot;dropper-style\\&quot; top which only allows you to make an educated guess about how many drops you&#x27;ve added.  Aside from that, I would have given these five stars.</li>
    <li> I use this oil for the curly girl hair care method.  I use four or five drops per two quarts of water, then I put it in a small water bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use the spray to refresh my hair between wash and go hair styles.  Love the way the lavender keeps my scalp clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray my face to get through the work day, my pillow at night, and take my bottle to the garden with me and spray away the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will always repurchase this product, totally  exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I waited to leave a feedback because I wanted to use them first.&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing. I also bought the &#x27;GERM FIGHTING&#x27; essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THey are undiluted and I made homemade bath wash,, toothpaste, mouthwash, etc. and the formula calls for 20 drops and I only needed 10 or less.</li>
    <li> I have not been at all impressed with the the quality of Plant Therapy&#x27;s essential oils.  Take my advice, spend a little extra and get the better quality essential oils from a different company.  You will not regret it.</li>
