<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, first time using beard oil so cannot compare to others. Smells and works great, will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I use it on my hands.  Love the smell and the feel.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this amazing oil. It has a nice consistency, great scent and is made with ingredients that are all good for your hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing better than the product itself is the time and research that the man behind the label has put into it. I&#x27;ve have a few different conversations about the work he has put into his craft and it&#x27;s impressive. He takes pride in what he does and it shows!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my beard Besides that it looked and felt oily and I used less than recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ll try another brand...  for this price I expected more.  At least an eye dropper or even a plastic stop in the bottle but NOPE.</li>
    <li> This stuff is working wonders on my husband&#x27;s beard. It was totally out of control, scruffy, and rough. This oil has helped to tame and maintain all the strays. It has softened the hair tremendously. And it helps to actually keep it in place and has helped prevent beard head (bed head of the beard, lol). I am happy to recieve this oil to review. It&#x27;s really a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband. Afterwards my sister told me she bought some for her boyfriend at the barber for more money and the barber said it was his most popular item for sale in February. Yep, us ladies want our men&#x27;s beard soft and slinky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the dry oil since it first came out, and nothing else. After reading all the good reviews about the more traditional CYH oils, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. This stuff is amazing. It smells great and makes my beard soft with a nice shine to it. Thanks again for another quality product, CYH.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I can tell the difference in the way my beard feels and looks. It&#x27;s fuller and softer as well smelling good. Can&#x27;t beat a Texas made product for a Texas made beard. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more from y&#x27;all. Thanks for the product</li>
    <li> Smells great makes my boyfriends beard shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and it feels good. Does what it says</li>
    <li> Helps tame the hubby&#x27;s beard and gives it a nice sandalwood scent</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome and smells great! My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend who decided to grow out a Duck Dynasty beard.  He let me feel his beard the other day and it quite soft!</li>
    <li> Directions for use: Pour a little in your hand or Beard Oil Brush. Massage the oil into your whole beard, front and back. Comb your beard with a Beard Comb. Pet your dog to get oils off your hands.&lt;br /&gt;Simple, right! Without a doubt. We got a bottle of CanYouHandlebar Traditional Beard Oil in Wisdom. I was not the reviewer but I did give the bottle to my ex husband to try out. He has a decent beard and is very well known for it around here. He also likes it to be clean and taken care of. He used the products and put it on before work a few times. The scent was strong enough to last a good night out but not too strong to be too much. No one wants to be too close to someone and have the scent be too much to handle. Another aspect of the product is the texture of the oil. He said it was great! It did not leave his beard feeling oily and it did not leave a residue on him or anyone he came in contact with.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great product. I have already looked into purchasing the gift set for him from the kids for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are simple and formulated for nourishing hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very clean and manly smelling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Only 30mL&lt;br /&gt;Pricy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;essentially what you are paying for is the awesomeness of the brand and Amber bottle presentation making it suitable for a gift.</li>
    <li> It needs a dropper or something so it is easier to apply.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff. We had friends over for dinner last week -- every man had a beard -- and he brought his oil out to introduce them all to these awesome products. Everyone went home smelling great and with a shopping list! The scent is just right - not too much but not too light. And it really does control his beard...it&#x27;s kind of amazing actually. You won&#x27;t be sorry -- he loves it, I love it...you will too! Buy it now!</li>
    <li> There was nothing terribly wrong with this product. It seemed to provide beard softening benefits. But I found another that I like much better, so it suffers by comparison. The first suggestion: incorporate an eye-dropper to make it easier to use, and less likely to get too large an amount of oil (so preventing you from having to purchase refills more frequently). Secondly, I found the pine/cedar scent to be much less like a quality grooming product scent and more like a cleaning product scent: a bit harsh and unpleasant. There are other beard oils with a more pleasant musky smell. I realize this is somewhat subjective preference.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil. My boyfriend sports a long beard in the winter and it drives me insane. Since he has been using this it has helped quite a bit. It gives his beard a nice manly scent and it makes his beard look better. His beard isn&#x27;t as hard and prickly and it feels softer to the touch. He said he likes it because it makes it more manageable as well. A little bit goes a long ways so this bottle will last a long time. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
    <li> My husband started a new beard recently and really likes this Wisdom Beard Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a manly smell.  It&#x27;s smells like spruce, cedar and a little hint of lemon.  It smells good but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a thinner consistency which is easy to apply.  He uses just a dime size amount.  It absorbs right into his beard.  It is not greasy either.  Once applied he just combs it.  His skin feels so soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was funny the instructions tell you to rub your hands on your dog.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have a dog I guess just wash them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be a great gift idea for the bearded friend or family member.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I did receive this product complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman so I couldn&#x27;t personally test this product but I was happy to have the opportunity to be on the testing team. Thank You!  I can say that the scent is extremely woodsy and smexy. I&#x27;ve been bouncing this product around the office getting feedback from all they guys. They all love it! The fun thing is that now they are fighting over it. It&#x27;s become a game. There&#x27;s a list going around in a file folder of who gets it next. The seller provided excellent instructions via email which gets passed along with the product. I&#x27;m confident that some will buy it. This product is self promoting. Here&#x27;s some feedback I&#x27;ve received:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) My wife loves not only the scent but the how my goatee isn&#x27;t so rough on her anymore&lt;br /&gt;2) I&#x27;m growing my beard out&lt;br /&gt;3) Not shaving&lt;br /&gt;4) Who says a mustache is out of style?&lt;br /&gt;5) I&#x27;m going to start growing out my facial hair&lt;br /&gt;6) I&#x27;m putting it down there... lol&lt;br /&gt;7) How much does this cost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This manly man product makes them all want to be more manly... even the clean shaven ones :)</li>
    <li> Love the bottle and while I need to grow my beard out a bit more to fully test it, seems like it&#x27;d be a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**RECEIVED PRODUCT FOR A PROMOTIONAL DISCOUNT**</li>
    <li> Keeps my beard healthy and shiny, and I find the scent an invigorating part of my morning routine. Wakes up my senses! Love it. Quality products made with integrity and excellent customer relations.</li>
    <li> This was for my boyfriend he has used it a couple of times and I must say his stubbly little beard gets scratchy and irritates my skin which I cant stand! But after he used this it did make his beard feel softer and nice and HE is even pleased with the results it and only tried it out for me! Besides the fact I love the scent as does he.So were both happy with the end results and he has decided that yes he will be continuing to purchase this.  So ladies and gentlemen, its a win win ! you ant go wrong definitely try it out!</li>
    <li> Item is great.  Used it on my beard.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my brother in law. He has a serious beard, but always complains about how dry and itchy it is. This product has worked wonders for him. It has a very nice smell!</li>
    <li> Too oily for my taste</li>
    <li> Great scent works wonderfully</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as his beard can be very rough and scratchy on my face.  It was slightly oily at first but it absorbed well.  I really liked the smell of it and it made the hair softer.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it and so do I. Great list of ingredients and scent, makes his beard feel less scruffy!</li>
    <li> Shipped amazingly quick, product is of superb quality, even received an email from the company stating with tips on applying the product properly. 5 stars out of 5!</li>
    <li> This is my first beard oil product and I&#x27;m very happy with it. My beard was dry and rough and since I live in a dry heat state the beard druff was not attractive. I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 4 days now and I already notice immediate results. I use the droplet and put 4-5 drops in my palm and massage the product in my beard. I comb my beard to make sure the oil is distributed evenly. My beard is softer and looks healthy. No more beard druff. The oil isn&#x27;t greasy in my palms after massaging my beard and very little scent but not noticeable at all.</li>
    <li> I have never thought of using oil for a beard before but I&#x27;m glad this is the first one I tried! I love the cedar smell as you can tell its on well after you apply it but it&#x27;s not too strong. It&#x27;s a subtle reminder everytime I breath and I wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way!</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift, the recipient was very pleased with the quality!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband it&#x27;s gentle enough for even the most sensitive skin like his and it actually reduce his inflammation and improved the circulation of his skin. It gave his him a youthful healthy glow! By drawing moisture into the skin, it is in a category of it&#x27;s own, compared to lotions and creams this is by far the best! I give it 5 stars</li>
    <li> My husband is just getting into using beard oils. In just a week his beard is looking better than it ever did in the 10 years we have been together.  This oil has such a nice scent to it too.</li>
    <li> Great smell, great effect - just remains oily all throughout the day.  So oily that it leaves a residue on my phone, even many hours after applying it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son who has recently grown a beard...seems to be&lt;br /&gt;a trend....and he really likes the way it makes his beard feel and&lt;br /&gt;smell...he uses it everyday. (-:  He likes the oil over the balm.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!</li>
    <li> wish it came with a dropper but nice subtle fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is great beard oil.  I&#x27;ve tried many different oils, this one is easily my favorite.  Great scent, but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Husband says this worked well and left his beard feeling great. He highly recommends this for fellow beard guys looking for the perfect product! &amp;#34;received this item for testing and review purposes!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is one of my husband&#x27;s favorite beard oils. He uses it several times a day to help give moisture to his beard. He loves how it makes his beard smell great, feel conditioned and look shiny and soft. It contains several essential ingredients: Olive oil, Grape Seed oil, Apricot and Vitamin E and Argan oil. All of those oils are fantastic for smoothing and making hair soft and shiny. The scent is a lemon/cedar scent. Very manly and last but not least the packaging is really cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received at promotional pricing for review purpose*</li>
    <li> You can smell subtle hints of fruit ie. Lemon &amp; apricot.  The smell of pine is a bit strong for my liking.  It smells like Christmas,  not that Christmas smells bad,  it&#x27;s just not something I wish to smell year round.&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy,  the oil rubs in nicely leaving the hairs softer and more manageable.  Feels nice on the skin,  alleviates dryness and itchiness.  Not heavy,  won&#x27;t weigh you down.  Gives a healthy looking shine to the hairs,  not super shiny,  just enough so thru don&#x27;t look so dull and homely.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the smell, it&#x27;s good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;We were given a sample of this oil to test and review.</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband. he uses it every night and loves it. makes his beard softer. its an amazing product i highly recommend</li>
    <li> This beard oil is a great treat for any man in your life.  A lot of men I know don&#x27;t think about beard oil and I admit, I hadn&#x27;t either...so when I was given the opportunity to try some of this and give an honest opinion I jumped at it.  My father was pretty excited to give this particular beard oil a try.  His report was that it was a good oil...not greasy and it didn&#x27;t leave any residue behind (his wife was kind of worried about that).  It smells great and it&#x27;s good for his skin and beard too.  He no longer has to worry about getting any dry skin/flakes and he was pretty pumped about that.  I think he is sold on beard oil after using this.  I may have finally found a gift that I can safely buy for the man who has everything!</li>
    <li> My son has a wonderful beard for being the age of 25.  I got this for him CanYouHandlebar Orginal Wisdom Beard oil and he LOVES it!  Make his beard softer and more manageable.  It has a pleasant smell the Lemon, Spruce and Cedar are a perfect combination and not strong.  I believe the added Argan helps to keep his beard smooth.  I can definitively tell the difference since he has been using.  It just looks more groomed and softer. He has tried other brands but they have not left his beard feeling as soft.  I was provided with a sample of this product and in return I&#x27;m offering up my honest feedback after testing and inspection.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t condition as other oils i have used, also doesn&#x27;t have a dropper which makes it hard to get the right amount. won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Make sure not to use too much. My husband used too much the first time and he looked ultra greasy. The second time he found the right amount and it made his beard look lively.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product.  Period.&lt;br /&gt;Facts: CanYouHandlebar&#x27;s Wisdom Beard Oil softens, tames and conditions my beard with BETTER THAN EXPECTED results! It also conditioned the underlying skin, leaving my face feeling smooth and hydrated. I worked the oil in using CYH&#x27;s Beard Oil Brush on both a dry and wet beard.  The results were the same, although a wet application seemed to yield quicker coverage. 30ml is a generous amount of product, as a little goes a long way. Per the directions, my dog enjoyed the little bit that was left on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;More Facts: My beard is very course, so I was surprised at how quickly this oil SOFTENED and eliminated the wiry, wild hairs.  What&#x27;s more is the scent; it is subtle, but invigorating; sophisticated and masculine; woodsy without smelling like dirt.  And most importantly, it won&#x27;t make your beer taste like cologne!&lt;br /&gt;Brass Tacks: Guys with beards get free stuff all the time and this was one of those times.  YOU need to know that I didn&#x27;t hand out the stars like some Medal of Participation! CanYouHandlebar&#x27;s WISDOM Beard Oil EARNED those STARS! -ALL FIVE of them!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what it says it is. This is my first experience with beard oil this is the softest my beard has ever been. The smell is a little off putting it&#x27;s like I ran face first threw a pile of Christmas trees... But the wife thought it smells &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Received in the mail today.  Wash and dried the beard and applied a little oil.  Nice, nice, nice!</li>
    <li> What can you not like about CanYouHandlebar products? This is my third product of theirs and I am just as happy with this product as I am with the other 2. My husband has a very manly beard and mustache and I jumped with joy to get this complimentary bottle of Original Wisdom Beard Oil and share our honest and unbiased opinion with it here with you! I love the look of this bottle so much! It has such a vintage look to it that I love! The smell of this oil is amazing and it feels great when you rub it on your fingers! My husbands beard looks amazing as well! So shiny and tamed. He said that the oil feels really good on his skin as well. I highly recommend this product. This would make a great fathers day or birthday present as well!</li>
    <li> This oil is especially good for old man beards(50+) , nice scent ,  better than amish !</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my brother in law. He enjoys it!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells DIVINE. It&#x27;s a gorgeous light scent that I love and my husband, who hates wearing &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;, actually enjoys. My husband has a thick coarse beard, and it&#x27;s not so fun to dance cheek to cheek to that roughness; giving me a cheek rash! I saw this discounted during a promotion and recognized the brand, which I had heard really good things about. I bought it, and let me tell you what, people; his beard has never been softer. His beard looks great, smells fantastic, doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue, and does in fact no longer scratch my cheeks when I lean in for a smooch! He really likes the oil too, and said it is great at helping him find unevenness when he&#x27;s trimming his beard. I am SO purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Not our favorite smell, we prefer intuition in terms of smell. But this makes for a soft and shiny beard or moustache. I&#x27;m sure he doesn&#x27;t care which he is using in terms of smell and for all I know he is just following me by saying he doesn&#x27;t like the smell. I received this at a small discount price to try out and give my review. It works so well that I think it is definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> Smells funny.  Not gross but not pleasant either.</li>
    <li> I decided to try the wisdom woodsy scent after using a different brand&#x27;s beard balm. The first thing I noticed smelling the bottle is a really strong lemon scent. I wish I&#x27;d seen that before I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as oils go, it works as well as any other oil I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Its good but kinda lemony.  I prefer brylcream, the old school hair cream. Really softens the beard and gives it form</li>
    <li> This is a must have. I&#x27;ve read that many people most likely used this when their beards were not that long, I will completely disagree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is liquid oil that I found really pleasant on my beard after having a shower and before having the dry oil applied. It&#x27;s scent is just awesome, but more is the way it softens out your skin and beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the baby oil for the bearded ones. That is it! If My buddies at CanYouHandleBar let me decide, I would definitely sell bigger version of this baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either you get it in a very nice Metal Flask or in the glass container, you could not possibly go wrong with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not mold beards in any way but puts them in shape&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect beard molder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need to explain it in more depth.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. It was his first time ever trying a beard oil. We were both very surprised at how soft it made his beard. You would think it be greasy but it was quite the opposite. It was so soft and silky. He really likes the outdoor like smell too. He said it reminds him of camping and sitting around a campfire. The bottle is small enough that he can carry it with him if he needs too.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this item. hes still getting use to the oil. he says the easiest way for him so far is to apply a little to a comb the run it through. it smells almost like a sandalwood.</li>
    <li> I can definitely smell the spruce and cedar. When I first applied the oil, I was worried it might be a little too strong but after about 20 minutes, the smell had dissipated to the desired intensity and stayed that was for the remainder of the day. With some &amp;#34;tree scented&amp;#34; beard oils, they smell more like a pine-sol or some kind of bathroom cleaner but with this oil, it was a very pleasant cedar+spruce.</li>
    <li> I gave the Wisdom Beard Oil to my husband and he loves it. It made his beard softer and more manageable. I love the scent of it!</li>
    <li> Love it. The scent is right on the money. Tried a variety pack of beard oil from another brand before, liked 2 of the 5 scents but the grease feel / look that it left in my beard was irritating. Was hesitant to try this one because of previous experiences, glad I did though.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my husband who has been growing his beard for a few months now and was interested in using beard oil.  I really like the fragrance of this oil, it&#x27;s not too strong and very masculine!!  He loves using it right after he showers and I purchased the horse hair brush with it.  He just puts a little oil on the brush and works it into his hair and then massages it into his skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and well worth the money because a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I think if your really into growing your beard and keeping it healthy then this is the right product. I started using it and right away my beard looked better it smelled fantastic and my wife absolutely loves it. I have an 8 inch full beard and a bottle usually last me a month of everyday use . Can&#x27;t say how much I like it!!</li>
    <li> A solid beard oil. I had been searching around and I now love this brand! Great products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m testing two beard products on different sides of my face.  This beard oil is very nicely scented and works very well for me. This product is made with olive oil, grapeseed oil, apricot oil, jojoba, argan, vitamin E and essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woodsy scent is manly and my beard is softer.  I used just a small amount so as not to transfer my beard oil to everything I touched with it during the day.  Too much will make your collars oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply.  Just get some on your fingertips and rub into your beard and face. It seems to keep my skin from being dry as well as my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the awesome scent, ease of application and results, this is a very good beard oil with quality ingredients.</li>
    <li> i purchased this for my boyfriend and it smells AMAZING...he loves it and wants me to be sure to order more.</li>
    <li> My husband is so happy with this wisdom oil. And so am I! It smells great and the wild beard is now under control.</li>
    <li> great for the man in your life...</li>
    <li> Nice, subtle, manly scent. Makes the beard much softer and smoother looking.</li>
    <li> I got this for free or almost free for my son. He loves it! Smells good!</li>
    <li> The CanYouHandlebar Beard Oil is a great addition to anyone&#x27;s beard.  My husband has had a beard for years but never bothered to get any beard oil.....let&#x27;s just say &#x27;OUCH&#x27;!  So when I saw this I had to get it for him.  He likes the scent and I love how soft his beard is getting.  He is using it about 4 times per week - all I know is that it makes me really glad that we found it!  The oil is filled with some wonderful essential oils so it is very nourishing for the hair and the skin.  We are both very happy campers!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I got the chance to try this product for free for the exchange of my honest opinion and I&#x27;m glad I did. My husband has had a goatee since I&#x27;ve met him and it&#x27;s so dry and scratchy I call him Brillo. I quickly jumped on the opportunity to get this for him. It moisturizers his facial hair without feeling like he fell in a grease bucket. If I had to describe it I would say like facial conditioner.  The smell is pretty good also. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this for any man with dry course facial hair.... The ladies will thank you!</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this, The smell is awesome and he loves the way it makes his mustache and beard feel. He would recommend this to every man. I love that now his mustache don&#x27;t itch when I kiss him</li>
    <li> This oil reminds me of &amp;#34;old timey&amp;#34; scents, like going to Silver Dollar City in the Ozarks. Of course, nostalgia aside it&#x27;s a high quality oil. I love the scent and it&#x27;s nice on the beard and not gummy.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it, smells great.</li>
    <li> Husband loves every &amp;#34;can you handle bar&amp;#34; product he has tried! This is the third product he has tried of theirs and he no longer uses any other brands. He likes that they are easy to travel with. When he is running late, he is able to just slide it into his pocket and be on his way. If you like this product I would recommend getting some of their accessories and box sets. I got my husband a box set for Christmas last year and he absolutely loved it!</li>
    <li> LOVE the smell of this beard oil on my husband.  He was in need of some beard oil because his beard is not soft at all.  In just a few uses, it&#x27;s already started to soften it up rather nicely.  The smell is very nice and not too overwhelming.  A little goes a long way with this bottle.</li>
    <li> This oil is great for so many things other than JUST the beard! I got this item on a review to have my husband try out. His beard never really grows very long or even very thick, but when it does grow out it&#x27;s course as all get out. Seriously, his mustache and beard both hurt when I even kiss him, so I figured it was time to try something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USE:&lt;br /&gt;Very simple to use. Simply pour a small amount into your hand, rub throughout beard down into the roots and wipe hands clean.&lt;br /&gt;The ad description on Amazon states to \\&quot;pet the dog to wipe oils off your hands\\&quot;. I did try this on my Pomeranian and my long haired chihuahua. The Chihuahua, her coat is usually a bit coarser since she&#x27;s an older dog and has some greys. It smoothed her coat very nicely and I didn&#x27;t see any adverse affects on her skin from this. My hands, on the other hand, were extremely smooth after I rubbed the rest into my hands. VERY nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*SCENT ADVISORY*&lt;br /&gt; If you have strong aversions to smells, this may not be the oil for you. It does have a rather strong scent to it. For me, it&#x27;s calming and rather nice of a smell. It smells stronger inside the bottle/on hands than it does in beard BUT since your beard is just below your nose, you&#x27;ll get a good whiff of it throughout the day. Hubby said the scent did dissipate a bit after awhile. The scent reminds me of those cedar chips you use in a hamster or guinea pig cage with a slight hint of pine, possibly? Reminds me of those incense sticks for \\&quot;aroma therapy\\&quot; as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*FEEL*&lt;br /&gt;The feel is not greasy. It&#x27;s more of a satiny touch. Would even double as an amazing back or foot rub oil (in my personal opinion). As for my husbands&#x27; beard, I did notice a pretty big difference in how his \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; felt. It didn&#x27;t hurt my upper lip or poke my chin nearly as bad. He did enjoy that his face felt more \\&quot;Fluffy\\&quot; than \\&quot;scruffy\\&quot; after using the oil. He would apply the oil just before bed, so the oils had time to really soak in and work it&#x27;s magic. The following morning, big difference in the feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*PACKAGING*&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is nice and would make a great Fathers Day or Christmas basket item for your loved one, for sure. The company also makes a mustache wax (make sure to read my reviews on those and check out their other products!). Last photo shows all three products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely going to be an oil that we&#x27;ll use regularly.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find anything \\&quot;off putting\\&quot; about this product, however the scent for some may be too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]g difference in the feel.    *PACKAGING*  The packaging is nice and would make a great Fathers Day or Christmas basket item for your loved one, for sure.

    <li> My husband is in love with this stuff! He was finally able to achieve the perfect moustache! He has tried many products and this is the best by far!! He said he would recommend this to all his friends who have a moustache :)</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product! It really helps you keep a healthy great looking beard and instead of using your ladies products you get a strong manly scent of spruce! Carry on sirs!!</li>
    <li> ** received for review and inspection purposes **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a beard guy, but my grandfather is. I sent him the whole set and he likes it (he&#x27;s very hard to please). Out of everything, this was his favorite product. Unlike the wax, which is a bit harder to find the perfect amount (for him at least), this oil was perfect. He had no complaints.</li>
    <li> Nice scent and worked great!</li>
    <li> My husband says it works very well.</li>
    <li> Smells so good on my husband&#x27;s beard</li>
    <li> For a while now I have been searching for a beard softener and I have tried numerous products such as moisturizers  and oils. I had read online that coconut oil was a good way to soften your beard but I just found it to be too greasy and wasn’t really that effective. When I received CanYouHandlebar  beard oil I was surprised at how sleek and cool the bottle and label looked, it looks nice sitting on my bathroom shelf. The first time I applied the oil was after taking a hot shower so that my beard was moist enough. After drying my beard I applied a couple of drops of the oil to my hands and massaged into by beard. The first thing I noticed was the fantastic zesty scent from the oil which was very pleasant. Throughout the day my beard was no longer rough to the touch and had a silky smooth feel to it. This is hands down the best product I have tried for softening my beard. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Was a gift to a friend. The friend was happy.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of beard conditioners in both oil and beaded wax form. This is hands down the best I have used. It left my beard softer than it has ever been without feeling greasy or oily. The scent is light and pleasant with tones of citrus with a woodsy finish.. It fades quickly as expected due to olfactory fatigue. It is light enough that is compliments lighter citrus/fruity colognes. Worth every penny. I wish they sold it in a larger bottle and a dropper attached to the lid would be a nice option.</li>
    <li> I was offered this product to review and I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what I was going to do with it given my serious lack of facial hair, but I have a coworker who loves his beard so I gave it to him to try out. He really enjoyed this beard oil. He said it had a nice smell to it that was not too overpowering or girly and it left his beard soft and moisturized. I also could notice a difference on the days that he used it and the days that he didn&#x27;t. This oil definitely did a good job of smoothing out his scruffy beard.</li>
    <li> Great product, item as described, very useful.</li>
    <li> Having used CanYouHandlebar&#x27;s Wisdom-scented Beard Dry Oil, I was curious to see if their traditional beard oil held up in terms of quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say that I&#x27;m every bit as pleased with the Beard Oil as I was with the Dry Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve used other beard oils before, the first thing you will notice is that this has a slightly thinner consistency than most.  Spreading it into my beard, I noticed that it absorbed well and did not leave a heavy greasy residue as I have noticed with other oils.  This tells me two things: my beard is soaking in the nourishment it needs and I&#x27;m not dumping excess oil on to my beard and skin.  It&#x27;s all about balance, and CanYouHandlebar has hit the right measure of maintenance and protection without overdoing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is spectacular- the sharpness of the cedar and lemon provide a clean top-note, with the spruce lending a harmonious grounded woody element.  The scent is not heavy-handed or overpowering.  It diffuses well over 20-30 minutes, leaving a light pleasantly masculine after-scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of sheen, the oil delivered a nice medium gloss and brightness.  I have a red-brown beard of varying coloration, and the oil brought out strong color highlights.  The lightness of the oil meant that my beard was not weighed down, leaving it soft with an easy heft.  The overall result is a look that is healthy, vibrant and full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the explosion of beard products available these days, I&#x27;m happy to have found CanYouHandlebar a reliable and solid provider of bearding goods.</li>
    <li> This is the first beard oil that my husband has tried. In the past, he used different beard balms or beard butters so he&#x27;s more used to the solid form. This beard oil is a little bit harder to handle since it&#x27;s in liquid form, but it still works great. It makes his beard nice and soft and leaves it smelling great. It doesn&#x27;t make it greasy at all. It makes kissing him a lot more enjoyable because his beard is nowhere near as coarse against my face as it usually is. The scent is very pleasant without being overbearing. It really does work great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> This prouduct  is wonderful got my before my due date it&#x27;s a big plus for me...I recomandeed to pepole</li>
    <li> This smells so fresh and clean!  My husband loves it because it&#x27;s not greasy at all; it absorbs easily and leaves his beard soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have several beard oils, so I though I&#x27;d give the Wisdom oil a shot. It smells just like you&#x27;re sitting around a campfire. Woodsy, a bit smokey, and all around great. It really did remind me of some fun camping trips. It is a fairly strong smell, at least initially, but mellows nicely after a few minutes. The oil absorbs nicely and makes my beard shiny and healthy looking. All in all I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> Good product!! Will buy it again!!</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift and he loves it. Smells great</li>
    <li> My husband had never used beard oil before but this was a game changer in that aspect! It smells so good and he wasn&#x27;t displeased by the smell either. It only takes a little, so this small bottle will last a long time. His beard looked healthy and vibrant. It also really brought out all of the beautiful colors I never really get to see when he hasn&#x27;t taken the time to groom it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10, love this product and will get more.</li>
    <li> It makes my husbands beard so much softer and smells so good, which, I appreciate! So, thank you!!</li>
    <li> Got it for my boyfriend isn&#x27;t has a lemon smell... But good for the hair on his face n he lets me put it in he only needs like a pea drop for it nothing bigger...</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiance, since he has just started growing a beard in the last year and it was always so rough feeling and out of control... Even after a few uses He loves it and  I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in the texture and feel and his beard is starting to look great. It also smells so wonderful. It is definitely worth the price, We will definitely be purchasing more and trying out other products and aromas!</li>
    <li> Works great and feels good. Will be buying again</li>
    <li> My husband loves this beard oil and it smells so good!</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughters father since he&#x27;s a newbie in the beard group and he said that he loves it! Its easy to just run through and the smell is relaxing. He&#x27;s very excited to venture out more into this brand. He recieved this Wisdom beard oil for his honest opinion and he gave it 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> gave to a friend and he loves it</li>
    <li> Great product, my husband really likes how it makes his beard feel, and so do I..</li>
    <li> This oil smells very masculine but not too much.  Helps keep your beard in place and it comes in a cute little bottle. Perfect for gift giving!</li>
    <li> This smells great. My husband and I both LOVE it. His beard is softer and smells wonderful. We will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it has definitely helped condition my husband&#x27;s beard and the smell is great.  It is fun to purchase an oil that my husband is happy.  Definitely get this product for the bearded man in your life.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Leaves the beard nice and soft with a great smell.</li>
    <li> Soft, supple, shiny, smooth. These are not words I would normally use for my beard, as scraggily and wild as it has become over time, but after thoroughly applying some of this beard oil, my beard is in the best shape it has ever been in. The oil also keeps the skin underneath moisturized, greatly reducing itching, etc. I received my bottle as part of a special offer, but its regular price is well worth it for what it does for you and your beard!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that I&#x27;m(and my hubby) every bit as pleased with the Beard Oil as I was with the Dry Oil.  If you&#x27;ve used other beard oils before, you may have notice this isn&#x27;t as thick as the others may be. My hubby said that he noticed that is absorbed well and did not leave him feeling greasy.  It did soften his hair, which is great when he kisses me(lol) He says it makes his stache and beard feel healthier.  The oil also made his hair look less dull.  He was surprised on how well it worked and how much he likes it.  He says it is completely better than any other oils that he has tried.  It does have a very strong smell to it, but the best way I can describe it, it smelled like a very masculinity.  Like if you were to think how a rugged cowboy smelled that what i think it would be.  I like it.  If you have facial hair I recommend you getting this oil!! I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.</li>
    <li> I got this oil for my boyfriend and he loves it! It smells soo good like lemon and cedar. He loves that it&#x27;s all natural oils. It moisturizes his beard and mustache perfectly and he definitely recommends it!!</li>
    <li> This product is made with the following oils:  olive, grape seed, apricot, jojoba, argan, essential oils and vitamin E.  It is blended and bottled by hand which is a nice touch!  I like that it is made in the USA and the scent is like lemon with a hint of spruce to it.  A cute stocking stuffer or gift for the guy who already has every gadget out there.  Depending on the size of your beard, you will need a dime or quarter sized amount applied into your hand and massaged into your beard.  It seems too pricey to me but it is a quality product.  I would think that you would apply it at least twice a day and am guessing it would last at least 1 maybe 2 months.  The folks at CanYouHandlebar were nice enough to provide me with this complimentary product so that I could evaluate it.  Therefore, I agreed to provide honest feedback when posting my review.  Hopefully the personal thoughts I shared here will help you prepare for your own experience with this product.</li>
    <li> Good product. I wish it was a little more wood smelling but very good.</li>
    <li> Amazing oil!!! The scent is great and it makes my beard so much softer and manageable!</li>
    <li> Great product for your handle bar bearded man.  Bought this as a gift and he loved it!</li>
    <li> By far my favorite beard oil.  And I have what you might call an obsession...  It has a great smell to it but unlike many other beard oils the scent isn&#x27;t too heavy and you don&#x27;t smell like you showered in earth cologne every time you touch your beard through out the day.  Damn near as close to perfect in my book as you can get.</li>
