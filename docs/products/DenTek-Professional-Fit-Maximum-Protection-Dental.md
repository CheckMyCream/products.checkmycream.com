      <li>But it does a good job</li>
      <li>I have been using a dash of good ol&#x27; hydrogen peroxide in water, and soaking my invisaligns in that solution while I drink my morning coffee, eating breakfast, etc.  </li>

      <li>These are the greatest for easy, quick cleaning of these guards...</li>
      <li>Very strong bleach smell</li>
      <li>have just purchased many more boxes!</li>
      <li>I use these for my clear correct trays and the are AWESOME.</li>

      <li>Comes in handy individually sealed packets, so they&#x27;re also perfect for travel.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, and cleans retainers nicely.</li>
      <li>love these.  </li>
      <li>but make sure you brush trays and rinse to remove chemical taste</li>
      <li>I thought it would do a better job.</li>
      <li>Love these for mouth pieces.  </li>
      <li>The smell is okay for</li>
      <li>I will buy more.  </li>
      <li>and it says not to keep them in the cleaner for more than 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>This cleaning powder is probably more thorough though.  </li>
      <li>Works better then just brushing.</li>
      <li>And no matter how many times you rinse it off, it doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
      <li>More like bleach.</li>
      <li>Maybe that&#x27;s just the yucky bits being pulled out of your appliance rising to the top.  </li>
      <li>Efferdent Power Crystals works better.</li>
      <li>I even bought two boxes since I was so confident it would work well.  </li>
      <li>I had to resort to scrubbing with my trays before putting them in with my toothbrusdoesn&#x27;t seem safe  toothpaste which defeats the purpose.</li>
      <li>it just doesn&#x27;t seem safe putting my trays in my mouth knowing the cleaner is still on them because it won&#x27;t wash off.</li>
      <li>retainers arent cheap!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love how this product smells, reminds me of chlorine and bleach</li>
      <li>/&gt;Results: both husband and I agree that the hydrogen peroxide soak did a better job of lightening the stains.</li>
      <li>Retainer Brite tablets worked better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with how clean this soak worked on my clear retainer.  </li>
      <li>I was just looking for a product to clean and fresher the trays more than warm water alone.  </li>
      <li>You put your guard/retainer in a clean cup with warm water to cover, and then add the packet.</li>
      <li>It cleans my mouth guard pretty good.  </li>
      <li>The cleaner works great on eliminating smells and making them brand new looking.</li>
      <li>This is quick and effective but I thought Fresh Guard Soak might be able to shave a minute or two off my morning routine while doing a better job.  </li>
      <li>Better than not using it to clean my night guard.</li>
      <li>Works well and easy to take on trips.</li>
      <li>Leaves an interesting after taste, but I used my toothbrush to brush it clean after I used this.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a more minty clean.  </li>
      <li>It has a strong chemically smell and taste.</li>
      <li>I do not like that the product smells strongly of bleach.</li>
      <li>but I have to question the safety of a product with this strong of chemical scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is strong, and I wouldn&#x27;t lean in while pouring the powder into the water and while it&#x27;s dissolving.</li>
      <li>Strong smell will make you cough but that what doc said to get.</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell and did exactly what it says it was going to do.</li>
      <li>I asked my dental tech about using this product and she said if it was ADA approved (it is) it should be fine.</li>
      <li>I cannot fine it in any of the &amp;#34;big box&amp;#34; pharmacies or sores must order from Amazon</li>
      <li>and you should be fine.</li>
      <li>It works fine, but it smells like chlorine</li>
      <li>Great product...glad something finally came on the market for mouthpieces</li>
      <li>easy to use and clean well</li>
      <li>the changing colors is nice to figure out if my Invisalign is ready</li>
      <li>Fortunately when he took them out and rinsed them, there was no after taste on the retainers.  </li>
      <li>Keep it available because I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else.  </li>
      <li>odor free.</li>
      <li>powder comes in a foil pouch tube, like a single-serving of Crystal Light.  </li>
      <li>, my favorite is this product, the Fresh Guard Soak.</li>
      <li>While this does work, over time the guard will stain and it is not as easy to clean.</li>
      <li>He gives it out in free samples.</li>
      <li>Available in stores.</li>
      <li>My orthodontist said it was fine to clean my retainers with anti-bacterial hand soap in the mornings when I take them out.  </li>
      <li>It seems to help keep them clean and fresh, better, in my opinion, than soaking in mouthwash.</li>
      <li>Worked great and left them clean.</li>
      <li>This is a great find for items that don&#x27;t normally receive as much attention.</li>
      <li>While this is easy to use, I found my invisible braces still yellowed quickly during the 2 weeks of wearing each stage.  </li>
      <li>Gets my retainer fresh in clean with ease!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Completely rejuvenated my ancient and disgusting nightguard. I actually want to put it in my mouth now. I used to use efferdent but it never really got them clean and took forever. I like how the solution becomes clear once the cleaning has finished.</li>
    <li> They get your retainer clean</li>
    <li> It really works to deodorize and clean my night guard.  Keep it available because I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with how clean this soak worked on my clear retainer.  Wish I had found this sooner.  I also like that it only takes 5 minutes.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Strong smell will make you cough but that what doc said to get.</li>
    <li> Fresh guard is just efferdent. Don&#x27;t bye. I work where it&#x27;s made. We also make generics denture cleanser. Bye your local store brand. It&#x27;s JUST as good.</li>
    <li> This is the worse product I have ever bought on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it not clean properly but the taste was still on my mouth piece after washing it a few time.&lt;br /&gt;What a big WASTE of MONEY!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it!!!</li>
    <li> Trays seem clean but yellow after about a week. I use the product twice a day to disinfect my Invisaligns.  Disappointed in the discolorization but the product does seem to adequately clean.</li>
    <li> This product turned my Invis-align trays dark yellow in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I began seeing ads for this product, I was excited to try it, and bought into the fact that it appeared to be specifically formulated for &amp;#34;clear braces&amp;#34; (e.g., Invis-align).  I was just looking for a product to clean and fresher the trays more than warm water alone.  I figured this was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the product arrived, I immediately began using it as recommended.  Within a few days, my trays started to discolor.  Figuring that it had to be something other than this product -- which, again, markets itself as specifically made for &amp;#34;clear braces&amp;#34; -- I continued the soaking regimen.  By the end of my two week cycle, the trays were nearly gold in color.  I quit using the product when I graduated to my next set of trays, and sure enough, the new trays remained clear as all of my others had before, other than the ones which were soaked in Fresh Guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot fathom this product will be on the market much longer.  It is garbage.  Unless you&#x27;re looking for that &amp;#34;gold teeth&amp;#34; look, I would avoid this product at all costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Helpful hint: I have found that the best way to truly clear Invis-align aligners is to soak them in a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and water, and to brush them with a toothbrush).</li>
    <li> Worked exactly as I thought it would</li>
    <li> While this is easy to use, I found my invisible braces still yellowed quickly during the 2 weeks of wearing each stage.  Retainer Brite tablets worked better.  Perhaps is varies based on each person&#x27;s &amp;#34;mouth chemistry.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Does a great job on my mouth-guard.</li>
    <li> Did not meet my expectations. I thought it would do a better job.</li>
    <li> Love these for mouth pieces.  Cant find them in stores</li>
    <li> works well with appliance. love the fact that I can get it here as we live rural and nearest store is fifty miles out</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product turned my mouth guard night time appliance brownish &amp; also roughened its surface. My dentist told me to quit using it.</li>
    <li> I perhaps miss-read the description...expected TABLETS not loose power.  Would not purchase again or recommend to others.</li>
    <li> It might get your guard clean but it will make it REEK of an awful bleach/chemical smell that is nearly impossible to rinse or brush off. Just opening the package makes me cough and I do not have asthma or a sensitivity to smell. I&#x27;ll go back to using denture cleaners - cleans just as well without the gag worthy smell.</li>
    <li> When you open the package it feels like you are inhaling chemicals which then burn your lungs for the next couple hours.  If you can remember to cover your face first so you don&#x27;t breathe the harsh chemicals it&#x27;s nice to not have to brush out your retainer.</li>
    <li> Did not do what I thought it would. Disappointed in product.</li>
    <li> Left a chemical taste on my retainers</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. It works great!</li>
    <li> Works great. Cuts odors and keeps aligners clean</li>
    <li> thanks--but my daughter says they leave a film on her invisaline braces</li>
    <li> Can not find this product in store. I use this to clean my retainers. It has a nice smell and did exactly what it says it was going to do.</li>
    <li> Great product, good results!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what my dentist uses. He gives it out in free samples.</li>
    <li> Gets my retainer fresh in clean with ease!</li>
    <li> Turned my mouth guard yellow and brittle.  Fumes when using are chocking.  Will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> Loves theses have used them on my son&#x27;s  retainers since last May and really like the product. Just recently I was looking everywhere  for them and couldn&#x27;t  seem to find  them anywhere except on one of my favorite places to shop Amazon. I was thrilled . Hope they will be carrying this product for a long time  and at a good price.</li>
    <li> This works really well but does leave a metallic taste and smell on the mouth guard. I use it infrequently (1 time per month) and brush my mouth guard with a denture brush in between uses, which minimizes the use of this stuff.</li>
    <li> As I was mixing this with H20, I began gasping for air and coughing spasmodically.  My sister, came to help me, and she started coughing and gasping also.  Kind of scary that they&#x27;d let something that triggers this response onto the market.  I hate to think what it might do to someone with a delicate respiratory system.  Also, it didn&#x27;t seem to clean my nightguard all that well.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this product at all. I&#x27;ve been wearing my retainer on and off since I had braces about 8 years ago. I now have to wear it every night due to TMJ and teeth grinding. It&#x27;s gotten pretty gross, and I&#x27;ve started tasting it too (ick, gross, I know). I&#x27;ve been looking for a product, and read I shouldn&#x27;t use denture cleaners. I bought this, hoping it&#x27;d be the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the retainer in warm water and added the crystals, then left it alone for 5 minutes. When the water was cleared and time had passed, I took it out. No change at all. It said that you might need to do it twice if the gunk is really caked on. I did it again. No luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever, no big deal, right? Wrong. My retainer now tastes horrible, way worse than before. It&#x27;s like I rinsed it in dish detergent or bleach. It tastes awful. This is after rising it very thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ll keep trying, since I have packets left, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I really dislike this product.  There is something in the compound that burns the nose and eyes when you open a package to pour it into water.  i will go back to my regular denture/mouth guard cleanser.</li>
    <li> Reordered it.  Better than not using it to clean my night guard.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love how this product smells, reminds me of chlorine and bleach but it works so good that I just deal with the smell and have it go to work on my night guard.  I&#x27;ve been using denture cleaners for 20 years and I&#x27;ve only been using this product a month and a half and I&#x27;ll never go back to the tabs.  This product works so well and it&#x27;s not gross in the morning.  I really like it just wish it wouldn&#x27;t smell so bad.</li>
    <li> THis is the only product they make for the kind of splint I wear at night.  You can&#x27;t use efferdent on my splint so this is great.</li>
    <li> I sleep with a sleep apnea mouthpiece.  I have tried both Retainer Brite and Efferdent Power Clean Crystals at different to keep this mouthpiece clean.  While I trust that both of these products eliminated bacteria, I always noticed the mouthpiece was slimy after cleaning.  I don;t like the slimy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh Guard is the first product I have tried that did not leave a slimy feeling.  Using this just made my mouthpiece feel cleaner.  The only thing I do not like is the strong bleach smell and slight taste after using this product.  To combat this, I would soak my mouthpiece in fresh water (bottled or tap) after soaking with Fresh Guard.  I would follow that up, as I always do with any of these cleaners, with a thorough rinse under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to switch permanently to Fresh Guard from now on.  It works that well.</li>
    <li> Used for my retainers and trays. Worked great and left them clean. Not messy at all! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> love these.  dentist gave me a sample when he gave me an appliance to prevent tooth-grinding at night.  easy to use and clean well</li>
    <li> Basically efferdent in a pouch  and not a tablet. Works well and easy to take on trips.</li>
    <li> My son uses this for his retainer and loves it. It really works well.</li>
    <li> My whole family uses these tabs.  We soak out grind guards and retainers in them during the day.  It seems to help keep them clean and fresh, better, in my opinion, than soaking in mouthwash.</li>
    <li> no problems here. Will buy from seller again</li>
    <li> great product for mouth guards</li>
    <li> I like this product, and it appears to work; however, it always makes me cough when I open the package due I suspect to the small particulates becoming airborne.  Would not recommend if you have asthma or similar.</li>
    <li> Have been wearing Invisaline for the last 31 weeks and I am so very glad to orthodontist told me about this cleaning product...it is great and beats the heck out of toothpaste for braces. I cannot fine it in any of the &amp;#34;big box&amp;#34; pharmacies or sores must order from Amazon</li>
    <li> only if you want to spend 30¢ a day on mouthguard cleaning instead of using a soft toothbrush and some liquid hand soap to accomplish the same result.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to have some bleach. Seems to clean very well. Once I&#x27;ve used up my 24, I&#x27;ll decide whether or not to continue use.</li>
    <li> Works great on my mouth guard. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Specially formulated for mouth guards and similar dental applicances, but I prefer another brand. The Fresh Guard has a strong odor and I swear that it yellows the plastic... which it should not, if properly formulated.</li>
    <li> This stuff DID stain my retainers with a slightly yellowish tinge, despite my retainer being part darkblue, part lime green. I thought it had something to do with the residue not washing off at first, but no matter how much I rinsed, the color stayed. Plus, the chemical smell from the powder makes me back away and cover my nose with my arm, it&#x27;s THAT harsh. It may clean like it&#x27;s supposed to, but it&#x27;s just too overbearing. I had to stop using it after about 6 times.</li>
    <li> Great product...glad something finally came on the market for mouthpieces</li>
    <li> I use these for my clear correct trays and the are AWESOME. I drop them in when I get in the shower and they are ready once I&#x27;m out. I do use a toothbrush to make sure everything is off of them (nothing beats a little frictions) but my trays are cleaner than they have ever been!</li>
    <li> This really keeps my mouth guard clean.  Works better then just brushing.</li>
    <li> I hate wearing a night guard, and one of the things I hate about it was that it never seemed really clean with just brushing. I asked my dental tech about using this product and she said if it was ADA approved (it is) it should be fine. This works in just a few minutes (water turns clear when done) and the guard seems fresh and clean as new after. I still hate wearing the guard but at least it feels like I&#x27;m putting something truly clean in my mouth now.</li>
    <li> My dentist recently made me a mouth guard for bruxism, so I tried out these packets on the clear plastic bite guard. It looked perfectly clean when the powder fizzed into a blue fresh smelling brew; when the process was complete about 10 minutes later, it was clear that the disgusting debris came right from my dental appliance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for denture wearers, especially if you think your/their current regimen isn&#x27;t quite doing the trick.</li>
    <li> This product definitely leaves an aftertaste of bleach and I also get a whiff of it when I open the individual packages. I have also noticed that my invisalign  trays are yellow--didn&#x27;t realize that this product was causing it until I read other reviews.  I am going back to retainer brite.</li>
    <li> I used these to keep my Invisalign bright but they turned them a dingy yellow.</li>
    <li> Great cleaning product but make sure you brush trays and rinse to remove chemical taste</li>
    <li> not impressed with these. Seems to deteriorate braces</li>
    <li> I purchased these to assist with cleaning my Invisalign braces. This cleaner left a terrible chemical taste and odor on them. I had high hopes for this product as it is marketed directly towards removable braces.</li>
    <li> It cleans my mouth guard pretty good.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is when I open the packet it has a very strong scent which makes me gag a little.  But since it works well with cleaning I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> WORST product ever. I have invisalign. First off it smells like bleach bathroom cleaner. Secondly it doesn&#x27;t do as promised. Doesn&#x27;t clean at all and when it dries it leaves this nasty white film on my trays and then they smell &amp; taste like dirty pool water. And no matter how many times you rinse it off, it doesn&#x27;t go away. I had to resort to scrubbing with my trays before putting them in with my toothbrusdoesn&#x27;t seem safe  toothpaste which defeats the purpose. it just doesn&#x27;t seem safe putting my trays in my mouth knowing the cleaner is still on them because it won&#x27;t wash off.</li>
    <li> works great on my night guard.  fast!</li>
    <li> Terrible taste on mouth guard after soaking, other brands are better.</li>
    <li> Works great to clean polycarb based retainers! Just soak and rinse. Kind of smells like cascade bathroom bleach but it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> I got these for my 13 year old who has clear retainers. She uses the soaks often and says they work great. Would recommend them for anyone who has to use clear retainers or mouth guards which become really nasty.</li>
    <li> Since this is supposedly formulated for clear retainers, I expected them to get sparkly clear as implied on the box.  After few uses, the retainers got cloudy and opaque looking. I even noticed some yellowing on the plastic. The retainers felt clean in my mouth and there was not any bad taste. They just didnt look very nice.  I brushed them like I used to and they seem to have gotten clear again.  Not sure why I didn&#x27;t have good luck with this product. I even bought two boxes since I was so confident it would work well.  Opening the packets is no big deal. Use a little bathroom scissor and snip the end. People complain about the damndest things. Anyway, I wont be buying these again. They may work well for some types of retainers but not on my clear invisaligns.</li>
    <li> I agree with a lot of these comments! It has a strong chemically smell and taste. Also leaves sores in my mouth I assume from the chemicals. I have never so much as had a cold sore prior to this product. Not safe!</li>
    <li> I generally use Retainer Brite for my Invisalign trays and have no complaints. However, when I ran out, Fresh Guard was available at the store around the corner--Retainer Brite was not. So I decided to try out Fresh Guard. I will be going back to Retainer Brite as soon as I finish this box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros of Fresh Guard:&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans just as well as Retainer Brite. (I use Fresh Guard/Retainer Brite once a day, and it makes a huge difference versus just using soap/water.)&lt;br /&gt;- Available in stores. Retainer Brite is not, as far as I&#x27;m aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Smell. I do not like that the product smells strongly of bleach. And it lingers such that I have to scrub the trays down with soap afterwards just so that it doesn&#x27;t taste like I&#x27;m putting cleaning products in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;- Price. Fresh Guard provides 24 cleans for ~$7; Retainer Brite has 96 for ~$13.&lt;br /&gt;- Timing. This could be a pro for some people, but I don&#x27;t like that it takes 5 minutes and it says not to keep them in the cleaner for more than 10 minutes. Part of my morning routine is keeping my trays in the solution while I eat breakfast/gulp down coffee. 10 minutes is not enough time for that.&lt;br /&gt;- Packaging. I&#x27;ve found the packets very difficult to tear open. I end up needing scissors every time. Just a minor complaint.</li>
    <li> If I could I would not give any stars.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I own four mouth guards due to severe TMJ.&lt;br /&gt;The Fresh Guard was something I thought would help in maintaining the mouth guards.&lt;br /&gt;It ate away at one of my mouth guards. These are not a cheap appliance and I need them.&lt;br /&gt;I can not afford this item to eat away at what I have left. It actually states it will not erode the mouth guard or appliance. It did mine.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I will just continue to clean the way I have been as long as I have had mouth guards.</li>
    <li> The packaging is a little hard to open but it seems to do the job.</li>
    <li> I think they work as described but leave a definite chemical taste that it hard to remove.  I need to rebrush my clear braces and sometimes soak in mouthwash.</li>
    <li> A must needed product.</li>
    <li> Does the job easily and very well</li>
    <li> Super for cleaning mouth guards.  Another item not readily available in drug stores.</li>
    <li> Work really good on my night guard !</li>
    <li> needed a cleaner and bought this after using hydrogen peroxide and water mix.  opening the packaging is not easy. I tend to use my teeth and end up inhaling what tastes like bleach.  the changing colors is nice to figure out if my Invisalign is ready but I absolutely cannot stand putting it back on my teeth after.  it tastes like bleach or something and I can&#x27;t get the tastes away even with brushing out with toothpaste and water.</li>
    <li> I ran out of Retainer Brite for my Invisalign so I picked this up on a quick trip to Walmart. First the packaging is really hard to open with wet hands. Second, this stuff turned my Invisalign trays dingy and yellow! I have never had a tray turn yellow until I used this stuff and needless to say I was not very happy to wear yellow trays for two weeks... Third, the taste is really hard to rinse out. It let a weird taste in my mouth even after brushing them again after soaking. I&#x27;m sure it would be fine on a mouth guard or what ever but keep it as far away from Invisalign or clear braces as possible!</li>
    <li> Really pleased with this product; couldn&#x27;t find the soak locally only the wipes. It did take a couple of cleanings the first time but now once a week is sufficient. Definitely would order again.</li>
    <li> I rather the bacteria smell than its smell on my teeth guard!! Even I washed it nanny times and brushed it with a toothpaste the smell won&#x27;t go! It&#x27;s like u washed ur teeth guard with a hypex detergent!</li>
    <li> They freshen my retainer, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s significantly cleaner. Also, you need to really rinse well or the powder residue is still on your mouth piece and can make you sick.</li>
    <li> Turned my night guard yellow and now it tastes and smells like Clorox.  I am so sad I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> For someone that uses retainer every night this works very well for soaking them weekly.</li>
    <li> Perfect for cleaning night guards!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and cleans retainers nicely. Just pour into some water and allow the retainers to soak, then rinse. Comes in handy individually sealed packets, so they&#x27;re also perfect for travel. I find that if I don&#x27;t use a cleaning product like this, that my retainers become unsightly, as brushing them just isn&#x27;t enough. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works great on my night-time appliance!</li>
    <li> I have been using invisalign positioners and got my bumps ground off today.  Yeah!!!  Since the invisalign retainer will be used for a long time, not changed out every few weeks, I want to make sure the retainers stay as clear as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked the orthodontist what he recommended for cleaning. He told me the retainers are the same material as the positioners, only thicker.  I have been using a dash of good ol&#x27; hydrogen peroxide in water, and soaking my invisaligns in that solution while I drink my morning coffee, eating breakfast, etc.  While brushing my teeth, I&#x27;d rinse them and let them soak in plain water until I was done brushing, flossing etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That worked great.  Never any smell, never any deposits.  Never had to brush them and they never had any taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem was that after a few weeks they&#x27;d be a little yellow.  (Not an issue when they&#x27;re being replaced by new positioners every few weeks.)  I tried other methods of cleaning them but they didn&#x27;t work as well.  Oh, and if you buy a big bottle of hydrogen peroxide, it lasts for weeks and is very inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today the orthodontist gave me samples of Fresh Guard.  I tested my last stained positioners, soaking the uppers in the Fresh Guard, and bottoms in full strength hydrogen peroxide.  Gave them both 10 minutes, rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: both husband and I agree that the hydrogen peroxide soak did a better job of lightening the stains. Bonuses: 1) lower cost, 2) no unpleasant taste or odor to the positioners, 3) no need to pay attention to time minimums/maximums with the hydrogen peroxide, unlike the fresh guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving the Fresh Guard 3 stars however for a couple of reasons: 1) it works, 2) it&#x27;s a good idea for traveling since packing a big plastic bottle of hydrogen peroxide doesn&#x27;t work with TSA or my style of suitcase packing.</li>
    <li> This product smells SO bad. It works faster than competing brands but I have to question the safety of a product with this strong of chemical scent.</li>
    <li> As several others said in other reviews, the aftertaste to god-awful. It smells like a mixture of clorox and chlorine from a swimming pool. After washing it with straight mouth wash, it smells a bit better but still, the smell is still somewhat existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using one, the remaining pack were dropped into the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend. Just clean and/or soak your mouth guard with only water before and after uses each day and you should be fine. It may turn a bit yellow over time but that is much better than the taste of clorox for a night.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Yellows the plastic of my aligner and doesnt clean. I wouyld recommend the Oap cleaner cleaning solution instead.</li>
    <li> Product does make my trays feel fresh, however the stains from drinking coffee are not removed.</li>
    <li> Thanks!  Fast shipping and great product!</li>
    <li> This cleaning powder works well, but I prefer the [[ASIN:B00HNKXT3A Fresh Guard Wipes Specially Formulated for Retainers Mouthguards and Removable Braces, 20 Count]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a retainer with one fake tooth on it.  I have to wear this for 90 days until my titanium implant has fully grafted onto my jaw and I can get a permanent crown.  I&#x27;m kind of torn, because I despise this retainer, but I&#x27;m also incredibly grateful to have it.  Hygiene is an issue though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Fresh Guard cleaning products are really fantastic.  Like I said, I prefer the wipes, because they are so simple to use and the minty flavor is nice.  This cleaning powder is probably more thorough though.  I switch off between the two.  I&#x27;ll use the wipes throughout the day at work and then soak it in the powder overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powder comes in a foil pouch tube, like a single-serving of Crystal Light.  You pour it into the water and the bubbles cleanse your appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the blue dye dots are necessary or just for looks.  They make a little bit of a mess if you&#x27;re not careful though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one small complaint about this powder is that your container of water will make kind of a disgusting frothy head on it.  Maybe that&#x27;s just the yucky bits being pulled out of your appliance rising to the top.  It&#x27;s pretty nasty though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using this powder and the wipes for the past few weeks and it&#x27;s way easier to keep my stupid retainer cleaner than it was when I was just using a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My orthodontist said it was fine to clean my retainers with anti-bacterial hand soap in the mornings when I take them out.  This is quick and effective but I thought Fresh Guard Soak might be able to shave a minute or two off my morning routine while doing a better job.  I quickly discovered there was no time savings as there is a minimum/maximum amount of soak time recommended which is not short but also not long enough for me to shower (or do anything else significant) and then come back to them to remove them from the soak.  The &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t seem notably better, and the Fresh Guard Soak seemed to have a slightly funky reaction to the aluminum bathroom cup I used to soak my retainers in.  I&#x27;m sticking with the hand soap method...it is cheaper and less time consuming while still being effective at killing germs.</li>
    <li> We have two retainers in the house... mine which is metal and the hard &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; and my son&#x27;s which is the softer invisalign type.  The cleaner works great on eliminating smells and making them brand new looking. Even my son&#x27;s, who had been slacking on cleaning his, got clean instead of smelling horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I am not a fan of the smell of the cleaner.  I was hoping for a more minty clean.  But it does a good job so I won&#x27;t complain too much. :)</li>
    <li> very dissapointed in this product. used as directed and only for a few minutes a few times a week. after several weeks of usage noticed thick cloudy film and dark discoloration in the grooves where my teeth snap into this clear retainer. I had this retainer for months before discovering this product and it had never gotten discolored. now i resort to gently scrubbing with a toothbrush and some mild toothpaste because I am scared to try any other type of cleaner. retainers arent cheap!</li>
    <li> does exactly as it says. good product!!</li>
    <li> Efferdent Power Crystals works better. I just bought these really because the packaging says it&#x27;s for &amp;#34;removable braces&amp;#34;. But oh my god, I coughed so hard when I opened the pack due to the smell! Then my invisilign didn&#x27;t particularly taste refreshing. More like bleach. Anyway, the Power Crystals don&#x27;t make you cough, leave a minty taste, and only takes 3 minutes. Perfect timing for soaking while I&#x27;m brushing my teeth. My braces stay nice, clear, and odor free. I like the fresh guard wipes to use throughout the day, but as far as cleaners, skip the efferdent fresh guard soak and stick with the efferdent 3 minute power crystals.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this review by stating I use it for my mouth guard. It seems that these do not work well for invisalign based on some of the bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;One a week, in the morning, I will drop my guard in a glass cup with a packet of this soak. I rinse it and let it dry. Some of the reviews are complaining about the chemical smell and taste, but after rinsing and drying I don&#x27;t notice any difference in the way it normally tastes.</li>
    <li> If you ever thought you&#x27;d like to rinse your mouth with bleach, now&#x27;s your chance. This stuff was horrible. I tossed it after one use.</li>
    <li> It works fine, but it smells like chlorine and you have to rinse it off very thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Back when I had braces and a retainer, the advice of my orthodontist was to clean it every week or so using a denture cleaning tablet.  Seeing that these are made by Efferdent, I&#x27;m assuming that they are capitalizing on that.  I wear a bite guard for teeth grinding.  (I actually bought my latest one from Amazon by SportingSmiles instead of buying a $400 replacement from my dentist.)  Everyday, I brush it with toothpaste--but that&#x27;s about it.  I clean the case, but I haven&#x27;t used a denture cleaner tablet or anything similar.  So, I was curious as to how much of a difference this would make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in little thin packets, kind of like the kind you open to add flavor to a water bottle.  You put your guard/retainer in a clean cup with warm water to cover, and then add the packet. The water automatically turns blue, and after 5 or so minutes, the water will be clear and you can remove and rinse your appliance.  It really did a  good job in that my bite guard felt so clean when I put it on, but the water mixture smelled horrific.  So take that as a warning.  It did not, however, make my appliance taste bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this about once/week.  I will buy more.  I can&#x27;t comment as to whether it does a different/better job though to regular denture cleaning tablets.</li>
    <li> These are the greatest for easy, quick cleaning of these guards...no damage to the guard and 3-5 minutes of soaking.&lt;br /&gt;I have just purchased many more boxes!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing a bite guard at night for almost 12 years.  My dentist told me to clean them with a denture cleaner tablet like Efferdent. So every other day, I dutifully slip in a tablet with water and my appliance. On the non days, I gently scrub it with a toothbrush and water.  This was and still is a good process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this, I can skip the toothbrush days.  I never knew how cloudy the appliance had gotten.  It was supposed to be clear. The smell is okay for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for the price, I can&#x27;t justify buying this.  You can buy store brand denture cleansers for a lot less money and more product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the packaging is horrible.  It reminds me of those add a flavor juice crystals you pour into a bottle water.  Trying to tear it open is virtually impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will go back to good old Efferdent and look for coupons for this product.</li>
    <li> Leaves an interesting after taste, but I used my toothbrush to brush it clean after I used this. I like the item though, it does a great job cleaning my night guard.</li>
    <li> I suppose it cleans, but I can&#x27;t tell. Maybe it&#x27;s because my device is too stained?&lt;br /&gt;The smell is strong, and I wouldn&#x27;t lean in while pouring the powder into the water and while it&#x27;s dissolving.</li>
    <li> Save me soooooo much time</li>
    <li> Not expensive at all compared to other brands and does the job very well!!</li>
    <li> I have a mouth guard that I normally use toothpaste to keep clean per the directions. While this does work, over time the guard will stain and it is not as easy to clean. The new Fresh Guards line is a great new way to clean these often overlooked products. I have tried the Fresh Guard Wipes as well and they work wonderfully. While I do like them (they are also anti-bacterial), my favorite is this product, the Fresh Guard Soak. The box contains 24 mini packets of crystals. Fill a clean empty container (the dollar stores often have snap clean denture containers that will work well) with warm water that will fully cover the device. If you are cleaning a mouth guard, don&#x27;t make the water too hot, as this may cause your guard to lose it&#x27;s custom shape. Empty one packet into the water. It dissolves immediately and turns blue. Place your guard, retainer or braces in the solution for at least 5 minutes, but no later than 10 minutes. You may have to do this several times if your item is deeply stained. I saw significant results in the first use, a large amount of yellowing was gone. The crystals not only clean and remove stains, the also kill 99.9% of odor bacteria. The guard tastes fresh after a cleaning. I do a soak at least once a week. Do keep in mind that if you have older guards the stains may not come out fully, but they will be much cleaner. I love this product and will be using it regularly as it will help to improve oral health. This is a great find for items that don&#x27;t normally receive as much attention. Do note that this product is not for cleaning dentures, but specifically mouth guards, retainers and removable braces. The bacteria level drops significantly on the first use. I highly recommend this. The packets are small and work very fast. An excellent product!</li>
    <li> My son has retainers he has to wear 24/7 for the six months since he had his braces off, and at night forevermore.  He would diligently clean his retainers with Efferdent like his orthodontist told him to, and still within a couple of months it started looking awful.  The clear retainers started looking cloudy, opaque, and stained (no he doesn&#x27;t eat with them in).  When we tried the first pack, the smell was extremely off putting, and my son was hesitant to even leave his retainers in.  Fortunately when he took them out and rinsed them, there was no after taste on the retainers.  Although neither of us saw a huge difference in the appearance of the retainers after the first use, by the time we finished the box (he soaks them 3-4 times per week) we could both notice that almost all of the opaque &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; and staining was gone from his retainers.  This will definitely be a repeat purchase.</li>
    <li> I can only echo the comments made by other reviewers in terms of the distinctly &amp;#34;unfresh&amp;#34; smell to the soaking solution.  There is no residual taste though.  The directions say to soak no longer than 10 minutes to avoid damage to the appliance.  We have always used a  10 minute soak in a 50% vinegar solution which is less expensive, equally effective and less noxious.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product but I hate the smell and the taste is tough to rinse out. Simply opening the packet causes respiratory irritation, even in an open space. Initially it did remove some old calcification, but over time it&#x27;s beginning to stain my mouthguard yellow. It does seem fresher than it was with denture soak though.</li>
    <li> Just simply DOESN&#x27;T WORK! I followed the instructions exactly and no results! My retainers stay the same- it doesn&#x27;t kill any bacteria. I just wanted a solution for the annoying work of cleaning my retainers via q-tips. All this does is make it have a weird minty smell and taste. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Works well to keep retainer clean and palatable...</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive to chemical type smells and tastes you should use Retainer Brite. This Fresh Guard is very powerful stuff, and if you accidentally inhale it it&#x27;ll take your breath away. It&#x27;s hard to describe, buts it&#x27;s like an oxidizing burnt chemical smell. I&#x27;m only using it because Retainer Brite isn&#x27;t available in local stores.</li>
    <li> I would not use these for Invisalign. I&#x27;ve used RetainerBrite since I started and had no issues. One use of this and my trays turned a nasty yellow color.</li>
    <li> tHX FOR QUICK TURNAROUND THEY DO A GREAT JOB CLEANING MY MOUTHGUARD.</li>
    <li> Wife recommends big time.</li>
    <li> I bought this since I have a retainer and have been buying tablets for dentures the past couple years. Not sure if it makes a huge difference but mine is made from hard plastic and metal wire so I&#x27;ve always had areas that were hard to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gives off a chemical, dishwasher detergent type smell and it puffs up into the air when pouring into a glass of water, then leaves an awful taste on the retainer even after rinsing many times. I have used tablets before with no issue, no weird detergent smell, and no lingering bad taste. I will be returning to those, especially since they are easier to find.</li>
    <li> I have tried other retainer solutions and this one is by far the best!</li>
    <li> This product is great.  Finally a way to clean my nightguard besides just brushing it with my toothbrush.  This gets my nightguard squeeky clean with no bad aftertaste.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try different cleaning products for my Invisalign trays. So when I saw this  in the drug store. I decided to try it out. The first 2 uses it cleaned my retainers OK not spotless like my previous brand of cleaner but acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I noticed I would cough violently around the time I would soak my aligners. I realized the caustic powders in the packets were making me cough. Now everytime I open it up I have to hold my breath and after 5 uses my aligners are yellow. Not good.</li>
    <li> This product is simply the best I have found, and I have worn retainers for at least five years. Much better than basic denture cleaner. No comparison</li>
    <li> Very strong bleach smell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for years!  I&#x27;ve been using normal denture/retainer wash, and that stuff builds up on my Invisalign retainer over time, which is really hard to fully clean by hand.  Between this and the Fresh Guard on the go wipes, I went from trying to scrub away build up everynight, to no hastle clean.</li>
    <li> I have a dreaded night guard which after almost 2 years still hate to put in my mouth. I can never wear every night, and sometimes I just spit it out middle of the night. At least this product cleans it well. I do it about once a week, sometimes 1x every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i dont like it smells like a floor cleaner or something. But I just rinse after I soak and that goes away. Decent price, useful item. You leave 10 minutes in a cup with water and the soluction, its turns from blue to clear, then its ready. Cool.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product at this time.</li>
</ol>
