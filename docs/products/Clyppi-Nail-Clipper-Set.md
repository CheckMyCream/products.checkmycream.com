<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not as sharp as I expected. They&#x27;re too dull compared to others in the price range.</li>
    <li> I love this little travel set that is perfect for both home and away.  I go from Ohio to Florida multiple times a year and hate purchasing cheap clippers while I am away.  That is one of the items I always tend to forget.  This set has the perfect size that is separate use for nails and toes.  As my toenails tend to run a lot thicker than my fingernails, this Clyppi set is a breath of fresh air for each outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the durable case, I can keep both clippers inside and never lose them.  When packing, all I have to do is throw this set in my makeup bag and have it ready for travel. The best element is that they are made of stainless steal and will not rust or change color when exposed to wet feet or nails.  I recommend these to everyone.  Thick or thinner nails, Clyppi set is perfect for each&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I have received this product at a discounted price for my honest review.</li>
    <li> My new Clyppi set arrived yesterday &amp; I immediately cut my fingernails with the small clipper. This morning, I used the large clipper on my toenails. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with both clippers. They cut cleanly &amp; leave no sharp edges. The wider handle is easier to hold. A year or so ago, my best fingernail clipper was lost/confiscated/stolen from my baggage when leaving Peru. I figured it wasn&#x27;t a big deal, until I tried using the other poor quality clippers I had at home. I finally decided to search Amazon for better nail clippers &amp; the Clyppi came up first. They were a tad expensive, but the quality &amp; workmanship is incredible &amp; well worth the money.</li>
    <li> The clipper set is great.  Used it once so far and it cuts like no other clipper I&#x27;ve used.  Looks to be durable, size is nice, easy to hold while clipping.  Only draw back would be a nail file, maybe a stand alone file in the set.  Way better than anything I can buy at the drug store!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;ALL Good... Love the Stainless Steel &amp; lifetime guarantee... &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Flat out THE best.  I always thought it was just that my nails were brittle and I&#x27;d just have to deal with it but after using these I can see it was just the cheap clippers I was using before.  Don&#x27;t hesitate, just buy them, worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Very nice set of nail clippers - love that it has both sizes AND a case with it :)  I found the clippers to be very easy to use and keep a grip on which is great because most clippers just don&#x27;t work well and want to slide or snap out of your hands.  This is a great set, would be an awesome stocking stuffer and can be for men and women both.  The clippers are stainless steel so they will last forever and they are not slippery.  I really like how they have the indentation for your finger to hold onto the clippers.  I must say it was a LOT easier clipping my toenails with this set than any I have ever used before.  I received a complimentary product to test :)</li>
    <li> Update 9/2/16: These quickly became my favorite nail clippers and since they were staying sharp I got rid of all my old pairs making this my favorite pair. They are still sharp and working very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this item for free to try and review, regardless this is my 100% honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured these were going to be just another set of nail clippers, but both hubby and I were impressed with how well they cut both of our nails without any ripping. I have a couple pairs that I was starting to get really annoyed with because they seem to rip more than they clip. I have a huge problem with ingrown toenails and often leave my nail on that toe too long because I am afraid of cutting them and the nail either ripping or chipping off in the area prone to the ingrowns. This is a huge pain and makes me have to spend extra time on my toes weekly to make sure when it grows back after tearing or chipping that it does so properly. Hence not liking to cut them, so what if it&#x27;s long sharp and might accidently cut hubby in our sleep! Well I think these will be good for cutting that toenail without ripping. When I cut through my finger nails it did it just the way you would hope that your nail clippers would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are also easy to grip since they are not the shiny metal and have a slightly larger size flippy bar thing (I honestly don&#x27;t know what it is called). I found when holding these they were not slipping and falling out of my hands or worse slipping and clipping the wrong places like skin, or the nail too far. Both sizes felt good in my hand and easy to hold on to. They also have a small filing area on them. It&#x27;s not big enough to be too rough while using them but just big enough if you want to use it to swipe at a quick sharp corner or such. The file part would not be big enough or comfy enough to do heavy duty filing though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a heavy duty pouch that you can put them into as well. Inside the pouch it has two loops to hold them in place so they don&#x27;t clink around against each other, it then velcros shut. I&#x27;m happy to add these to my arsenal of mani/pedi supplies that I use at home!to hold them in place so they don&#x27;t clink around against each other, it then velcros shut. I&#x27;m happy to add these to my arsenal of mani/pedi supplies that I use at home!</li>
    <li> ordered these for myself ans loved them so much i ordered a second set as a present. simply stated they are the best $ can buy. I only wish they were made in the U.S.A.</li>
    <li> Bought as gift for my husband, who has trouble with his finger and toe nails doing heavy construction for years.  He loves them. Sturdy, and clips clean and sharp.</li>
    <li> Super nice clipper&#x27;s, cannot be compared to pharmacy brands, would definitely buy another set.</li>
    <li> It cames sooner than I expected. I like that bag come with clipper, and it is perfectly fit. ALso, the nail clipper is really sharp which it is good.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s a copy of a note I sent to Clyppi which says it all:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing to tell someone &#x27;thank you&#x27; for selling me a $35 set of nail clippers! I could not possibly be happier, and I&#x27;ve only used the toenail clippers! My toenails have been a huge problem since I had ingrown toenail surgery on both big toes in 7th grade. I&#x27;m now 58 so I&#x27;ve been struggling a long time and the problem has continued to worsen as I&#x27;ve gotten older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My smaller toenails have curled very badly in the last few years and no other clipper has a wide enough opening, is non-slip(amazing), strong and sharp enough to cut through in one press.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again for your wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have now used the fingernail clippers and they are just as wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is the best one(s) I&#x27;ve used but there are some from China that are suppose to be good too.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the nail and toe clipper separate since there was not a dual travel pack with a carrying pouch at the time.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company asking for a free pouch which they later made available at no charge... but they wouldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;send me one.  I thought that was rather cheesy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper(s) cut clean.  I still round off the edges with an Emory board.</li>
    <li> Great nail clippers that do what you expect them to do</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son. He seems to like them. Seems to be a very good quality.</li>
    <li> Great clippers but a little pricey.  If they last a long time it will be worth it.  I like that they come with a travel case!</li>
    <li> Nice enough, but holy cow are these pricey!</li>
    <li> Wide back to hold. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Clyppi Best Nail Clipper Set - what a great set!  Comes with a pouch to store them in so you don&#x27;t have to hunt around to find the right one (how handy!)  The clippers themselves are heavy and feel like they will work great for those tough toe nails (which they do work well).  Nice clean clippings, without having to really jam down on the clippers themselves - and tough enough that they don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re going to break when you use them either.  Great set!</li>
    <li> I like the sturdiness of these clippers, but note that the toenail clipper is rounded, not square cut.</li>
    <li> excellent high quality product</li>
    <li> These clippers are not worth the price. They are not sharp, the cutting edges are rough and not polished, and the &amp;#34;nail file&amp;#34; built into the lever is unusable for guys who keep their nails short. I cannot in good conscience recommend this product at any price.</li>
    <li> Some clippers I have bought were poorly made, so I was very happy to find out they work great. These are the best nail clippers I have ever owned. They cut evenly and you don&#x27;t have to apply a ton of pressure.The packaging is sleek and stylish.  My favorite part of these clippers is how quickly they get the job done. Instead of attempting to get a nail off 3 or 4 times these cut right through.</li>
    <li> This set of nail clipper is the best! It&#x27;s sharp and it gives your nail a clean cut. You don&#x27;t even need to use a nail file afterwards. It is a little pricy compare to some other brands, but hey you pay for what you get. And for this price, it is totally worth it! Strongly recommend it for any one who&#x27;s out there and looking for a great set of nail clippers.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s toenails have been...difficult...to maintain.  At one point I was actually using a pair of diagonals from his tool box to trim his toenails.  I&#x27;m pleased to say those are back in the garage again because these clippers do the job.  Sturdy, Strong, attractive, and the case is so handy!  Plus, each pair has a small file built into the underside of one piece, so you can trim, file, and store very conveniently.</li>
    <li> High quality, stainless steel, a work of art, that actually works as good as it looks.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:601d778b6bdfc3c1450271dd9bd56117]] How many clippers have you bought and threw-out due to poor quality? If you&#x27;re like me, I never had luck with good quality clippers until I got this set of fingernails and toenails clippers.  This particular Clippy set came with a pouch with 2 slots for the clippers and other items. By the time I&#x27;m writing this review,  wife and I already tested the clippers - she did the fingernails clippers for herself and the kids and I tried the toenails. We observed the following:&lt;br /&gt;1) Sharp blades for ease of cutting&lt;br /&gt;2) Smooth clips with no real effort to squeeze&lt;br /&gt;3) High elevation but yet ergonomic design that allowed for control&lt;br /&gt;4) Non-slip handles&lt;br /&gt;5) Solid quality materials&lt;br /&gt;Very please with this set and definitely will keep away from sight because they are attractive and can easily be swiped away. I bought this set at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased review.  I&#x27;m glad that I had the opportunity to so do.</li>
    <li> Very Good quality clippers. They cut smoothly and one the first try. I like the little case they come with. No more seaching around trying to find the clippers in the drawer!</li>
    <li> Great set of clippers!  Nice case that comes with it too.  The Clippers are made of a sturdy material.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> Well worth the money. You get what u pay for and this is quality right off the bat. Clipping my grandsons nails now is super easy and fast.</li>
    <li> I was a little iffy about paying so much for a set of nail clippers, but that &amp;#34;iffy-ness&amp;#34; went away as soon as I tried them out for the first time. They feel lighter in weight than any other nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used and yet they feel stronger and sharper. Cutting my toenails has never been so easy. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the design of the clippers that makes it have better leverage or the sharpness of the blade that makes it cut so easily, but I am impressed with it and would definitely recommend it to anybody. The carrying case also makes it easy to keep the set together and makes them easy to find if you have messy drawers.</li>
    <li> The name says it all!  I never thought that there was a difference in nail clippers.  I have always just bought the generic brand at whatever store I was in when I needed a new set.  After purchasing these I realized I was wrong.  Even my wife, the first time she just picked them up said &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34;  These are the best made clippers I have ever used.  You may think &amp;#34;ah, they are just nail clippers&amp;#34; but they are very solid.  They have a good weight to them and they are very sharp.  They take very little effort to clip my very thick nails and feel like they will last a very long time.  I would definitely recommend this set.</li>
    <li> Purchased as gift and they loved this set!</li>
    <li> I ordered this hoping it would be a nice stocking stuffers for one of the guys in my life and I definitely am not disappointed! The clippers are nice, heavy duty clippers and it comes with a nice pouch to store them in. I opened the package up to test out the quality and I can tell that they will not have any issue doing their job either! These are by far the nicest nail trimmers I have owned. I love how sharp these are, which really helps when you have thick toenails. The wide handle makes it easy to grip and keep a hold of too. The handle also features am area on it that kind of feels like a nail file. I use it to smooth out rough patches on my fingers and it also provides an extra area to make it easier to grip the clippers.</li>
    <li> Best nail clipper I have ever had.</li>
    <li> Great quality!! Perfect size...nice easy clipping...handles easily without fingers slipping. This is my second set I&#x27;ve bought cuz my kids are always losing them...LOL. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> These are excellent clippers. They do what clippers are supposed to do and do it well. It isn&#x27;t hard on my fingers and toes at all and some clippers can be. The carrying case is very convenient and makes it easy to store the clippers pretty much anywhere.</li>
    <li> These clippers work great if you are looking for a pair that are very sturdy and will give you a really clean cut. There is not much need to file after cutting my nails, which I&#x27;ve never experienced with other nail clippers, so that really sets this pair apart in a very good way! It is such a smooth cut that the nails feel smooth immediately after cutting. One thing to note is that the lever (to push down to cut the nail) sits higher than other types of nail clippers, so it feels a little bit different and awkward at first, but it&#x27;s part of what makes the design work so well so that it gives a clean and precise cut. I&#x27;m glad I made the investment in these nail clippers and expect them to last a very long time!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I was not the only one who liked these nail clippers.  When my hubby got his hands on them, that&#x27;s it.  Luckily I found another discounted deal, so I had to order another set for myself.  It comes in 2 sizes – 1 for your fingers &amp; 1 for your toes.  The clippers are very sturdy and well made.  The base of the clipper is wide &amp; has 2 horizontal notched cutouts that give you a good grip.  When the lever is pressed down, the blades don’t overlap giving you a precise, clean cut every time without applying too much pressure. On the rare occasion that you need a file, there is a small one built into the lever for easy access.</li>
    <li> This set comes with a large and small nail clippers with a small carrying case. The clippers are very high quality stainless steel. They clip nails very nicely with just one clip. I didn&#x27;t have to re clip sharp edges on my nails because these are very sharp. My son who usually hates his nails cut noticed how easy these were to use and fast process. I also like that they come with a lifetime guarantee. No more having to buy cheap useless nail clippers. Love these!!!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new set! He likes that it has a pouch so he won&#x27;t lose them and he loves the Clippers themselves. They are easy to use and high quality! They don&#x27;t split your nails and they leave a clean cut! These don&#x27;t rip your nails like other clipper brands have done before. Which I love because when clipping before it use to pill some of the nail off and leave it exposed and oh my gosh it would hurt! But not anymore! These are so amazing! I highly recommend them and I am looking at getting these for my brothers for Christmas this year! I know they will appreciate them as much as my husband and I do!!! They are definitely worth the money!!!!</li>
    <li> Really liked the quality of these stainless steel nail clippers.  Easy to hold because more ergonomically correct for fingers to hold.</li>
    <li> Wish I had found these years ago.  Great clippers.</li>
    <li> I used the toenail clipper set today for the first time. I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;I had an ingrown toenail on the big toe which was cut out some time ago and still is not completely grown out but is uneven. The normal clippers I had were not strong enough, sharp enough, or shapped to clip what I needed. The Clippi worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;I have probably been buying a drug store set of clippers every year and am always quickly disappointed in their performance. I think I will be very happy with these.</li>
    <li> Awesome... just the quality i was hoping for. I let my husband try them and he wants a pair/set for himself and for our two boys!</li>
    <li> You can never have too many high-quality nail clippers - or at least I feel that way!  I purchased this set to carry in my car, but have since decided I want it as my main set in my bathroom.  The sizes in this package are appropriate for nails or toenails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clyppi makes a fantastic product.  Not all nail clippers are created equal - and the quality of Clyppi is AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this for everyone, students going off to college, first aid kits, and much more.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and packaged well. The clippers worked well. Nice feel, very sharp and they come in very nice case.  Highly recommend them. These are actually better than other higher priced brands.</li>
    <li> I loved them. Every other nail clipper that I used broke after a couple of uses, or I lost them. The case makes it very easy to keep up with. These clippers are very durable and sharp. I did&#x27;t have to use a nail file after.</li>
    <li> Excellent.Very sturdy and sharp.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:8fab452363d852fefff8e82a444ed5ea]] I never thought I would be happy to see a nail clipping set much less reviewing one until I bought and tried this Clyppi set.  I previously owned a cheaper quality set given to me as a part of a grooming gift package years ago and although I wasn&#x27;t particularly fond of the nail clippers, I held onto them and used them for a long time until recently when the thing fell apart every time I used them.  So once these arrived, off to the trash bin the old set went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included in this set are a smaller fingernail clipper, a larger toenail clipper and nylon carry case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every item in this set is high quality and well made, even the carrying case.  The clippers are a heavy duty stainless steel that has sharp clipping edges that cut cleanly and evenly.  The handles have raised indentations that make it easy to hang onto and use and clip with ease.  In addition both clippers have a small nail file built into each handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good quality clipping set that work great and look nice too.  How many clipper sets come with a lifetime guarantee?  These do, so I can&#x27;t argue with my 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> A great travel set.  Solid all metal construction feels very sturdy in your hands.  The blades are sufficiently sharp to cut through thick finger and toe nails with ease.  The case is perfect for keeping them together and handy while traveling.  Both clippers also have a file built into the handle which also comes in handy.  Nice set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to buying cheap flimsy clippers that can barely get the job done, but these Clyppi clippers are incredibly strong and cut very nice.  It&#x27;s amazing how much faster it goes when you have a nice set of clippers.  They are very easy to grip and use to get around some of the tighter edges, and they even have a small file to clean up any rough spots.  Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> These things work great.  They cut without tearing and feel like they&#x27;re high quality construction.  They cost more than most competitors, but with the lifetime guarantee, I expect them to be well worth the few extra bucks up front.</li>
    <li> Purchased as gift and they loved this set! These are also easy to grip since they are not the shiny metal and have a slightly larger size flippy bar thing (I honestly don&#x27;t know what it is called). I found when holding these they were not slipping and falling out of my hands or worse slipping and clipping the wrong places like skin, or the nail too far. Both sizes felt good in my hand and easy to hold on to. They also have a small filing area on them. It&#x27;s not big enough to be too rough while using them but just big enough if you want to use it to swipe at a quick sharp corner or such. The file part would not be big enough or comfy enough to do heavy duty filing though.</li>
    <li> Top quality product. Beats the made in china brands sold at the local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> Brilliant. Easy to use. Does not slip out of position when clipping tough toe nails. sharp precise cut.</li>
    <li> Received them yesterday. Very well made. They cut through nails like butter. I&#x27;m very impressed with these clippers.</li>
    <li> We rec&#x27;d three sets of Clyppis.  I presented one set to my son who will be traveling to NZ and his partner tried them.  She raved about them and stated &amp;#34;So sharp I don&#x27;t need to file!&amp;#34; I will gift one set and keep the third for myself.</li>
    <li> Works well and sharp blades as described.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:3f594c5295e1bddd034f83596cba7ae8]]I like the Clyppi nail clipper set with the case. It looks nice. It is compact. It comes with both fingernail clippers and #ToeNailClippers. The nail clippers are sharp enough that they cut your nails  on the first try even if your nails are thick. Theses nail clippers save so much time - and a potential headache because there is no fear of tearing, snagging or ripping your nails - and believe me this can happen when you use nail clipper sets that are dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clyppi fingernail clippers are thick, but lightweight. They have a nice indentation for your thumb to rest on and there is also a ridge on the bottom of the clipper so picking them up and keeping a grip on them is easy. I like that these clippers are 100% brushed stainless steel. I love how quickly and easily they cut my fingernails - and the toenail clippers are just as sharp. The top and bottom of these cutters match up perfectly when they close around your nails. This is why this brand gives such a perfect cut every time. The nail file integrated into the lever of the nail cutter is really nice too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact my husband was so curious that he decided to try them out on his fingernails and toenails - which needed cut but he was sick of our old, dull clippers. He liked the nail clipper set so much he kept one for himself to replace the one that he carries in his car now. I like the classy look of the nail clippers. The brushed stainless steel is dull not shiny like some nail clippers and this means less of a glare when you are using them in bright light or sunshine. This is especially important if you are at the beach or another public area where the sun shining off a shiny metal pair of fingernail clippers could irritate someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clyppi nail clipper set has everything you need to keep your toenails - and fingernails - looking their best when you are traveling so pick up a set - or two - today. They make a great gift item too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more items mentioned in this review for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.ved one or more items mentioned in this review for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> These are by far the best clippers I have owned.  They are very sharp and create a very clean cut with little pressure applied.  I play guitar, so I have to cut my fingernails a lot as well as very close.  I wish I had these a long time ago!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I find fingernail clippers either really cheaply made, or really heavy and clunky.  These are made of a light material but it doesn&#x27;t bend and feels really sturdy.  I like having both sizes and while I wouldn&#x27;t think of the carrying case, I think it makes it easier to keep track of them.  By far my favorites, and will reorder again.</li>
    <li> big clipper is strong as well as sharp.  Great handle, doesn&#x27;t slip&lt;br /&gt;small clipper flexes handle when cutting my thick farmer fingernails, women like it fine.&lt;br /&gt;I use the big one for my hands, too.</li>
    <li> I was finally able to use the Clyppi Fingernail &amp; Toenail Clipper Set today.  I really liked both of them a lot.  They were both sharp and cut with ease.  I especially liked the size of the toenail clipper as it cut across all my digit toes in just one clip.  I really like the little black carrying case to hold them in -- that&#x27;s why I picked the Clyppi set over other brands -- I wanted something to store them in as well as a good set of clippers ☺</li>
    <li> I like the heavyness feel and the wide handle, but the angle of them makes it a bit difficult to cut my nails.  I love the carrying case it comes with.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these clippers. I&#x27;ve used/owned all kinds of nail clippers throughout my life and these are BY FAR the best! Very sharp and really easy to make a good contoured line with.</li>
    <li> Nice set of clippers.  Not sure they&#x27;re any better than others I had.  The cas helps me keep them together without being too large.</li>
    <li> Very nice nail grooming set.  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> From the moment I opened the package, these clippers screamed quality!! I can&#x27;t believe how it makes cutting nails and toe nails effortless. It gives a nice clean cut without any jagged edges! They even work great for the kiddos&#x27; nails!</li>
    <li> very very fast deliver great price. cut really good no splitting or chipping very sharp they feel very good in your hands best ones i have used.</li>
    <li> The Clyppis are amazing so far! I cut my nails as soon as I got them, and the reviews are not kidding. I didn&#x27;t have to file any sharp edges on my nails after I was done, and I&#x27;m really excited for the next time I cut my nails again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is nice and simple, and is it a supposed nail file near the fulcrum (hinging point) of the clipper? Either way, I thought it was a nice touch because I tend to hold the clipper closer to the base, and the rough textured part allows me to do so with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was just a little concerned that the first time I got it, getting it in and out of the &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; position was a little rough in terms of where the two parts of the clipper contact, but I can&#x27;t really ask for too much when it&#x27;s metal to metal contact.</li>
    <li> Best set of clippers I have ever used.  I am a precise clipper because I don&#x27;t like to file.  This one is extremely precise and comfortable to use.  The only thing I would suggest is a fold out implement that can be used for cleaning under the nails before they are cut.  But I still rate it a 5 because it is so darn great!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Tried these clippers several times.  So far they are sharp and work good.  They feel good in your hand,</li>
    <li> The clippers are well made and attractive, but they don&#x27;t open as wide as my drug store clippers - making it difficult to clip thicker nails.  It appears to be a function of the jaw design.  Too bad, as the clippers met my expectations in other aspects.</li>
    <li> Today my new Clyppi products arrived in my office. I purchased 2 items.....fingernail clipper for my office and the fingernail &amp; toenail clipper set for my home. Already tested the fingernail clipper and I am very impressed with the product. Sharp, stylish look, very clean cut.....and lifetime guarantee. I had been using very small inexpensive ones for years and it was time for a change / replacement. I did some online research and the Clippy name kept coming up as highly recommended. Just registered to activate my Lifetime Guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new satisfied customer,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob Harlow&lt;br /&gt;Louisville, KY</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, heavy duty clipper set.  I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality, and the performance.  The brushed steel inset on the handle of each clipper also serves as a nice nail file.  The cut is clean and smooth.  I&#x27;m ordering two more sets as gifts for my kids, so they don&#x27;t steal mine!</li>
    <li> These clippers certainly cut cleanly, unlike so many other &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; clippers that seem to think having misaligned blades is a selling point. And these clippers certainly are well crafted from real stainless steel, unlike so many other &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; clippers that are cheap, plated junk. But I&#x27;m taking away a star for two reasons.  First, it appears that the manufacturer is skipping a step or two with regards to the cutouts in the tails of the clippers. After the top and bottom pieces are sandwiched together, the manufacturer mills two cutouts in the tail, supposedly to decrease the weight and increase the grip. Well, the cutouts — at least in the clippers that I received — were still full of metallic dust from the milling, and the milled edges were not finished in any way. I had to clean out the dust myself (after I got it all over my fingers and bathroom sink), and now I&#x27;m concerned that the unfinished edges will rust over time.  Second, the included carrying case is worse than useless. It&#x27;s about three times larger than the clippers themselves, implying that you should be able to carry other items in it, but it&#x27;s still too small to carry anything other than more clippers or maybe tweezers. So, for most people, it will just take up space in your drawer, cabinet, or travel kit.</li>
