      <li>One more good thing about it: there are 20 heat settings and not 10 as the description says.</li>
      <li>I just got this straightener about 2 months ago and before this one I had a salon one that my sister gave me and it took an hour to  warm up</li>
      <li>but now that i got my own</li>
      <li>they really didn&#x27;t notice this striaghtener works great!</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a great product for women with curly hair to be able to get smooth, elegant-looking hair without having to go to the salon.</li>
      <li>I am on my sixth purchase of the Revlon RV059C Perfect Heat Professional Straightener!</li>

      <li>I truley love this.  </li>

      <li>I have never had a problem with it and it has been dropped many many times.</li>
      <li>my best friend has the same problem.</li>
      <li>You want to get the Helen of Troy straightener of her gold series and also make sure it has a dial to control the heat.(ranges 1-10)</li>
      <li>You should totally invest in this wonderful staightener.</li>
      <li>Ok I had this straightener a couple of years ago</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using straightening irons for nearly two decades, and this model is one of the finest.  It is the one I prefer of all the types I own and produces sleek, bone-straight locks on the frizziest hair.  Previously, I purchased a  competitor&#x27;s &#x27;professional&#x27; straightener that was three times the price of the Revlon and is now stuffed in the back of the bathroom cabinet -- the Revlon beats it hands down!  My No #1 choice to combat the fizzies!</li>
    <li> I have read the other reviews on how this product quits working after only a couple months and I completely agree. &lt;br /&gt;My daughter bought this straightener so she could have super straight hair.  She bought it with money she made from babysitting.  She was so excited to get it home and use it.  It worked great, we couldn&#x27;t believe how straight it made her hair (and her hair is very curly).  Then after about a month the red light wouldn&#x27;t stay lit on it.  If you open and closed the handle the red light would come on for a few seconds then go off.  It appeared that something in the area where the two sections of the straightener connect, there was a short of some kind. I had kept the warranty information that came with it, and it does have a 90 day warranty, so I returned it to the manufacturer.  I did not have the original receipt, which they want, but I included the warranty information with it as proof that I did have something.  After about 4-5 weeks we received a new straightener which renewed my faith in this product.  That was about 2 months ago.  Then just this morning my daughter is trying to do her hair for school and is upset because this straightener has quit working again.  It seems to be the same problem as last time, the red light will not stay on and will flash off and on when you squeeze the handle.  It seems to me that this product has some kind of design flaw and the manufacturer needs to address this issue if they want to keep selling this product and not getting returns.  It cost me money to return the first one and if I keep having to spend money for returns to the manufacturer I might as well go out and spend money on a more reliable product.</li>
    <li> I am lucky enough to have the thickest and coarsest and waviest/curliest hair in North Carolina. Then I found this straightner.  I have had my straightener for about 8 months and it still works so well. I also had a salon brand straightner by Hot Tools that I bought for 100 dollars and this 20 dollar straightner works just as well as that one did. I love it. There is no way taht you can expect it to be perfect since it is only 20 bucks but I believe that if you had it for 3 months then you got your monies worth. Or maybe I just have better luck then everyone. God Bless</li>
    <li> This is the best hair srtaightener i ever bought. I had wickied thick... i mean really thick.... hair and it works so great !! My hair is done within 30 min ... but with other styling products it took forever and they didnt even stand up to prove that they are better then the revlon perfet heat straightener ! I love this thing and use it everyday...you should too !! I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT !!</li>
    <li> Last summer, I bought this straigtener because one of my friends let me borrow it, and I couldn&#x27;t get enough! I used it everyday for about a year, until one day i turned it on and one side was burning hot, and the other wouldn&#x27;t even heat up. Ive noticed that happened to a lot of people, its really cheap so i just bought another one. This one also broke, so i decided to see if another brand works better.</li>
    <li> This straightener only works for about three months before not heating up anymore and breaking. It REALLY damages your hair and is not worth your money since your&#x27;e going to end up buying at least three every year. I have bought this straightener four times already and never will again. Yeah, it may straigten your hair..but it will make it look dry and frizzy. It doesn&#x27;t make it look shiny, and there are certainly better ones on the market that are healthier for your hair.</li>
    <li> Unlike all the other posters, I had this straightener for years. Loved it! I have very thick, wavey hair and it straightened it in no time. Didn&#x27;t rip out my hair, I loved it. So, when it finally did break (the outside cracked) I decided to look it up online to see if I could find it. Ordered another one off of Amazon. The first one I got started smoking as soon as I turned it on and gave off a horrible smell. It also ripped my hair out because the plates stuck out from the housing. I emailed the company and they were great, sent me out a new one and told me to throw that one away. I now have another one and it also gives off a terrible smell. A real shame because I loved my original one..maybe I got lucky the first time around.</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener for about 8 years now and used it every single day for 4 of those years. I have wavy-curly hair but it always made my hair shiny, silky, and stick straight.  If I wanted to have a little more volume, all I did was hold the straightener at a slight angle (45 degrees or so?) and instead of being stick straight my hair would be just a bit more full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 8 years, however, the plates have finally worn out and it no longer has a quick heat-up time of 1 minute... I usually turn it on, feed the cats, and then come back to straighten my bangs.  After about 3 minutes the plates get really hot, so you do need to be careful when using it. Because the plates have worn out, I no longer get the silky and shiny stick straight hair that I used to, but it&#x27;s only because my straightener is extremely well loved.  I also do not have an automatic turn-off, so if you&#x27;re using it, remember to turn it off or you could burn down your house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few people say that their hair has gotten caught in it, but if you&#x27;re careful, you won&#x27;t have that problem... at least, I never did.</li>
    <li> My daughter was given one of these as a gift recently.  She used it last night to get ready for Prom - part of the plastic warped/melted, the straightener doesn&#x27;t close right anymore, there appears to be soot on one side and when it started sparking and she threw it down onto her bed - it melted her sheets into the mattress - so there&#x27;s fabric melded into the plastic on the other side.    VERY unhappy - it&#x27;s no longer usable, after a single use - and blue sparks when it&#x27;s plugged in and turned on &#x3D; fire hazard in my opinion.    Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x60;t own a revlon perfect heat straightner, But I was just about to purchase one. But after reading these reviews it seems that the company NEEDS! to make the same straightner STRONGER and BETTER BUILT!    It seems to be the perfect straightner for me, but I don&#x60;t want to waste my hard earned money on a striaghtner thats just going to break on me! I mean c&#x60;mon that is horrble that the one girl has purchased 6 and they STILL keep breaking on her, and her friend!    They should be able to make a product that can last for years!    the reason I like the sounds of the straightner was because of what my friend said about it    Because my friend purchased the same straightner and loves it!    BUT it seems to be that every 10 straightners the company makes ONLY 1 works right. I think that is very poor.    Well I guess I am just going to find a salon striaghtner, unless the company figures out a way to improve! there VERY! poor product.    I have a conair striaght and shiny hair straightner but I would NOT recommend it to anyone, because after maybe a dozen uses it won&#x60;t get as hot and it won&#x60;t straightner my hair! It wasn&#x60;t a good straightner to begin with!    I am VERY disapointed in there product!</li>
    <li> It works great when you first get it.  That doesn&#x27;t last long though because it will break on you.  After just one month I was using it and blue sparks started flashing near the red light.  It stopped and then the next day I used it again and white sparks started coming out of it.  The room smelt like burnt plastic.  This hair straightener is a piece of junk and I would not recommend wasting your money on it. You would probably be better off buying one from a salon.</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely dry,coarse,and it is very brittle. I am in junior high and for me getting ready and being on time is crusial but also wanting to look good is a bonus! My cousin first told me about this product and I didn&#x27;t believe what she said but when she came over she did my hair with the Revlon Perfect Heat Professional and in just 15-20 minutes it straightened my hair and made it soft and managable. Before it took me almost an hour to two hours just to straighten it, even after it got messy again! I ordered myself, I wouln&#x27;t go back to anything else!!!</li>
    <li> I am 13 years old, and I am pretty fussy when it comes to hair stuff.  My hair is very curly and wavy, and this straightener makes my hair look so perfectly straight.  It heats up SO quickly too! I got this for christmas in 2002 and i have had no problems w/ it.  I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve lived with 5-6 girls in the last two years and with that many people, you&#x27;re bound to see tons of hair stylers! I can say in all honesty that this straightener was the best on any type hair. Curly, wavy, mostly straight, fine, course, thick, thin - you name it, the straightener worked wonderfully! I can&#x27;t even get it this nice when I have it done professionally. The only reservation I have in my reccommendation is that once in a while, it does pull hair.</li>
    <li> This is the first straightening iron that I have ever had. One day, it just stopped working. I tried and tried to get it too start working again...but I couldnt. I was so happy with it and it just broke down on me. What it does is the light flickers and it stops heating up. My advice is to buy a slightly more expensive one, and it will be worth it because you can count on it. I mean, it worked great, but after a while it stopped and its a waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> Wow... this straightener works really well and is very affordable! All the other okay straighteners I bought lasted about 3 to 6 months, but I&#x27;ve had this one for almot a year and it still works just as good as the day I bought it. I don&#x27;t use it much anymore since I bought one of those professional HAI ones... which beats this one out I&#x27;d  have to say, but this is a great product here!</li>
    <li> This product stinks! Mine worked for a couple months until it completely burnt out a couple days ago! Now the red light is on, but the burners dont heat up! &lt;BR&gt;DONT BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> This straightener seemed to be working great at first .. but then it will just stop working one day. i&#x27;ve only have it for 2 months. PURE garbage. and that gold metal plate also catches your hair if you&#x27;re not too careful. DON&#x27;T buy this thing. I don&#x27;t even know why they have this out on the market when they know it&#x27;s gonna break down. I give it one star for the fact that it worked at all.</li>
    <li> I have tried many straighteners and this one is definitly the best out there. The only problem is you have to buy a new one every few months. What happends is the red light that indicates its on starts turning off when u close the unit with your hair in it to straighten. However, you can still use the machine because it gets very hot, it just turns off everytime you close it. But after doing this for awhile it stops working all together. This has happend to everyone I know that has it. It&#x27;s pretty much a junky piece of equipment that works very well.</li>
    <li> I read through the first 20 or so reviews, and I have to say I was surprised at the bad press this straightener is getting.  I have used this straightener for approximately 2 years and have never had a problem with it.  I have fairly  straight, fine hair to begin with, so maybe my hair just works better with this model.  It does take a few minutes to heat up, but once it&#x27;s cookin&#x27;, you&#x27;re ready to roll.  It&#x27;s yet to burnout on me or rip my hair out and the plates have never caused my hair to look damaged.  Overall, I give this product two enthusiastic thumbs skyward.</li>
    <li> I have owned MANY flat irons and nothing compares to this one. I have thick curly hair and after I am done using this iron you would never know it. My hair is sleek, shiny and pin straight. I highly recommend this flat iron!!</li>
    <li> The Revlon RV059C Perfect Heat Professional Hair Straightener is loved by thousands born with curly hair that thinks the other side has greener grass. This hair straightening tool works so good! It has turned my untameable hair into beautiful hair. I completely depend on this one tool to keep my hair looking good because it is too short to wear curly because it fluffs too much. Sounds like the perfect tool huh? Well it is... if you don&#x27;t mind having to buy six of them. I am on my sixth purchase of the Revlon RV059C Perfect Heat Professional Straightener! Each one I bought have ended up breaking before I even had it for a month! Suddenly, in the middle of getting ready to go out, it will just stop working completely. Sometime&#x27;s a plate just stops working, leaving you with another half an hour of straightening your hair. I have been using the Revlon Straightener since Christmas, and I have just gone through my sixth one because they break so easily. I know it has nothing to do with my house because it has broken at two of my friends houses before and now at my dad&#x27;s house. I just bought this straightener to replace the one that the plate just stopped working, and it hasn&#x27;t even been two weeks, and it has already broke. I was in the middle of straightening my hair and it just cut off and won&#x27;t turn back on. Now I don&#x27;t know what kind of straightener I should buy that will work as good as this one. I am very hesitant on buying my seventh straightener from the same company. By the way, my friend is going on her fourth one. So you decide.. perfect.. or not?</li>
    <li> My friends have used this straightener and they say it works good, until it breaks, also this straightener snags the hair to much,plus say hi to damage, split ends, and fried hair.</li>
    <li> I do love this straightener - the plates are big and it heats up quickly, yet I use it everyday and after about 2 months, the light stops going on, which means the plates will not go on. Not to mention the cord continually curls up so bad you have to yank it to get it to your head (or spend 5 minutes trying to uncurl the cord). I have bought it twice, and today it broke again. I have a feeling that Revlon will tell me that it&#x27;s gone through &amp;quot;extreme wear&amp;quot; -- it should at least be able to handle everyday usage! I&#x27;m going to have to buy a different brand, and I recommend you find a different one also, one without all of these hassles.</li>
    <li> This straightener is a lot better than the thin conair one i previously bought. It does heat up in 60 secs and is able tyo smoothe out my thick wavy hair. It&#x27;s a good straightener for the price so i would recommended it. It&#x27;s gold plated but not ceramic.</li>
    <li> I had this flat iron for about 6 months and mine too burned out. It also damanged my hair so much! I bought a ceremic one after this on broke, and noticed a big difference in my hair. My hair was so damanaged from this iron that i had trouble putting highlights (bleach) in my hair cause my hairstylist was afraid my hair would break. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! If you dont want to spend a lot of money, get the Vidal Sasoon Gold 2.25&amp;quot; Ceremic high heat straightner VS182C. That one made my hair look and feel healthy again, but my just burned out after 6 months, so now im going to upgrade to an expensive on at my salon.</li>
    <li> Tired of fighting with your curly hair?  Do you want a different look?  Say good-bye to your frizzy, uncontrollable, pain in the neck curls with the Revlon RV059c hair straightener.      Many people with natural curls wish that they were born with straight hair.  Sometimes the curls are very difficult to deal with, which causes frustration upon many people.  Do not panic.  It is possible to make those curls disappear.  Not only does this straightener work on curls but perhaps wavy hair as well.  The Revlon RV059c is just the tool for releasing frustration, and also promoting a different style. It heats up within sixty seconds, and there are ten different heat settings for any type of hair being fine, thick, or coarse.  I&#x27;ve used this straightener for two years and have never had a problem with it.          A suggestion when using this flat iron is to first blow dry little sections of the hair at a time, then use the iron on those sections.  Start straightening from the top by the roots to the bottom of the hair. Continue doing so until your hair is completely straight.  Do not take large sections of the hair at once when using; this will cause some hair strands to get caught and pulled out.  The outcome is amazingly smooth, soft, and straight.      One great advantage about having natural curls is that some days the hair can be curly and others it can be straight.  Remember, using a flat iron every single day may result in damaged hair.  Use this iron wisely.  Also, keeping hair healthy is partly due to trimming it every few months which will get rid of all the dry, dead ends.        Give the Revlon RV059c hair straightener a try and it will work wonders!</li>
    <li> I bought this straitener this past summer and I had it for about 2 weeks. Then one day I turned it on and it would not heat up. But since it worked so well I took it back for another one. well I have had it for about 7 months and just the other day it stopped working. One of the plates heats up way hotter then the other one so it doesnt even straiten my hair. But it does work really well on my way thick hair so I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly and thick hair, down to about my shoulders. My friend gave me this straightener last year because she had 2. At first, it worked pretty well, but soon my hair started getting caught in the corners of the plates and ripping out. Also, it makes the ends of my hair look REALLY damaged, like I have all split ends, and it makes them feel like hay. The top my hair looks pretty good, but I would not replace this straightener if it broke.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Revlon RV059 straightener for years!!! my two sisters and I used it everyday for at least two years. Now i keep on using it for myself, and it is still working perfectly, i just love it!!! i have thick curly hair and i can get it done very fast.</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener for over 6 years. It gets extremely hot which is prefect for my insanely thick long hair. It only takes me about 15 minutes to straighten all my hair. I have never had a problem with it and it has been dropped many many times. I have owned 2 of these, the first one got replaced after it got dropped in the toilet and my most recent one of 6 years still worked great up until today when my toddler got into the bathroom and managed to  break it into a few pieces.   I personally think this flat iron is better than the Chi irons. However, if you have shorter and thinner hair, you might not need this size of one. But for my hair, it was perfect.</li>
    <li> I truley love this.  I used to have the conair one with the teeth but that one did not work because my hair is really thick and down to my mid back so it used to take me about and hour and a half to straighten my hair.  With this one It has 20 different heat settings so I can adjust it for my thick curley hair, which I put it on 17 then for my cousins wavy hair I have it on 10 but it only takes a minute to heat up no matter what heat you set it on.  I have had my for almost 2 years now and the plates still look at good as the day that I bought them and I use it about once a week.</li>
    <li> I went over to my best friends place to do my hair and she had this straightner iron.  My hair is already straight but it added a smoothness and sleekness to my hair.  My best friend has very thick curly hair and it amazingly straightened her hair!  I immediately went out a bought my own and have not experienced any problems whatsoever.  A Definite Good Buy!</li>
    <li> Do not get this product. It worked really great for awhile and then it just stopped working the red light would not stay on! I thought at first that I did something to make it break you know overusing it or something but now I read the reviews and realize I was not the only one whose straightener broke! Do not get this prouduct!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener, and was happy that I could finally not have blow dry my hair straight every day...  BUT the first few days I used it, the black parts around the metal bars (that straighten your hair) got one strand at a time of my hair cought in it.  And THERE IS NO WAY of getting it back, so you have to pull it off and you have an AUTOMATIC FLYAWAY.  After a few weeks, YOU WILL NOT HAVE ANY HAIR LEFT.  BEWARE.  YOU WILL BE DOOMED BY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener, hands down.  You know how most straighteners pull you&#x27;re hair?  Well, not this one.  I can do my hair, which is halfway down my back and very thick in about five minutes.  This straightener works wonderfully!!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful piece of equipment for people with curly hair. It has a good heat controller and the heat is even throughout the plating. The only problem with it is that your hair can get snagged in the corners, but if you are careful, you will be fine!</li>
    <li> Wow, everyone says that cheap isnt good. But obviously that is a lie! I have extreamly thick hair, but thats no problem for this straightener. Usually, I will go to bed with wet hair, then wake up having it look like a disaster. With my conair straightener it would make my hair look frizzy, plus it would take 30 minutes to do my hair! Not so good when I have to catch a bus for school at 7 am. Waking up late wasnt an option. This straightener got my hair done in 6 minutes...including the heat up time. My hair was perfectly straight, not frizzy, and I got tons of compliments about how shiny it looked. This straightner is the best out there!!! They say that 1 inch straighteners work the best, but for people with thick hair like me, go with this straightener! This is a great christmas gift for you teenage daughter. She&#x27;ll love it!! Enjoy, look great, have fun.</li>
    <li> I have had this straightner for a while...My friend reccomended it to me. I loved it and even read reviews about it before thinking nothing of them and thought I just got lucky with mine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Christmas and I was just in the process of doing my hair when it just turned off...It was working fine the entire time and it just stopped. It did come back on for a second...sort of like it was shorting but now it wont come back on. I have half frizzy hair and half straight hair now and nothing I can do about it...So now I get to figure out a way to fix this since I can&#x27;t just run out and get a new straightner... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*runs off to continue looking for her old crappy conair one (another crappy brand)*</li>
    <li> I was looking through amazon to try to find a straightner SIMILAR to this one because i couldnt find this exact one but once i found it i bought it immediately ....my cousin had this one n i would go to her house to use it every once in a while but now that i got my own i remember why i wanted one so bad.... so...straight to the point &lt;br /&gt;-heats up FAST &lt;br /&gt;-straightens hair like...\\&quot;woah\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt;-its plates are big so it does more in less time &lt;br /&gt;-has HIGH heat settings &lt;br /&gt;-the only thing that bugs me is the smell...it smells like metal..but im guessing its because its new cuz my cousins doesnt smell like it...anywho GREAT PRODUCT work every cent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried for literally the last 6 years to find a way to straighten my hair (and have it stay straight)! I am happy to say that I&#x27;ve finally found something that works! I&#x27;ve had many different straighteners, and this one is by far the best. I have long curly hair, and this straightener gets it done in about 20 minutes. Much better than the hour I&#x27;m used to. Plus, the straightening lasts. My hair stays completely flat all day, instead of curling up on the ends like it did with my other straightener. You simply can&#x27;t get better than this!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener in May and one of the plates just stopped working last week. Not very efficient if you want straight hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this straightener, although it did work well when it worked, it ws hard to get your hair straight into it. I would recommend slurging for a salon one. Definietely get one with a comb too if your hair isn&#x27;t straight already.  THanks, Sarah</li>
    <li> alright, i think i&#x27;m cursed or something.  the day after i wrote my review, guess what happened?!  the straightener started sparking at me and now the plates don&#x27;t heat up.  it usually takes about 30-45 minutes to straighten my hair, and i was almost done when this happened.  it took another 30 mintues to finish.  i have since bought a vidal sassoon vs190c professional straightener.  it has 20 heat settings, 170 watts (all the same as this one), and the plates wrap around the edges so the roots can get straightened.  i recommend that straightener above this one.</li>
    <li> I have had the straightener about 5 months now, and use it about twice per week.  I have not had any major problems with it, and am pleased the the results.  To prevent snagging your hair, don&#x27;t try to do too much hair at one time and go slowly.  Even with these precautions, there are occasional hair catches.  But in my opinion, this is very minor compared to the great benefits the product provides - smooth, straight hair.  (Better results than I&#x27;ve ever been able to achieve with the hair dryer.)  It&#x27;s a great product for women with curly hair to be able to get smooth, elegant-looking hair without having to go to the salon.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I have ever used.  Whenever I don&#x27;t have much time in the morning, I just wash and dry my hair really quick, and use the straightener.  It only takes about 5 or 10 minutes to use on my long hair.  It does get really hot, so be careful with it.</li>
    <li> This product does have some kind of defect.  I bought my first one and it quit almost exactly six months from purchase.  Luckily I kept the warranty info and receipt, and was able to trade it in for a new one at the store of purchase.  I wasn&#x27;t so lucky the second time!  This time it quit on me (flickering light, until dead!), after one year.  You would think I would get a different straightener, but it does a great job until it goes kaput!  So, I bought another one!!  We will see how this one fares...third time is the charm, right?  Just wanted to warn those that are considering this purchase! $15-20 per year might not be worth it!</li>
    <li> ok well this was the first straightener thati ever bought and it workerd well.. for the first 3 months then it broke so i bought the same on again but then that one broke almost immdeiatly... i would recommend the conair sissors sorta one.... i forget what its called but also the wet 2 dry one it works wonders and doesn&#x27;t even damage my hair&amp;#60;br /&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Beware!!! When buying this product.  We have went through 4 of these in the last year.  If left on for a period of time like an hour, it starts to slowly(over a period of a few months) melt the outer plastic until its burnt and black becoming a fire hazard before you know it. The outer side becomes as hot as the inner straightener heating up the desk or carpet that it is sat on.  I find myself making sure it is off before I leave the house.  We even thought that buying two at a time would solve this problem but it just delayed it.  Why would I have bought four you ask...well we thought the first was defective so we bought the second one that fell apart after about three months so I bought the third and forth.  My daughters love this product for straightening their hair.It is an inexpensive way of getting a professional look.  It is not worth the safty of my home and family to get this, trying another product this time.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! I have never used something that has made my hair so straight! It heats up very quickly and straightens my thick, curly hair in about 15-20 minutes, record time in comparison to other hair straighteners. Buy this product, it is not a waste of money!</li>
    <li> my hair has been untamable for years. my best friend has the same problem. she always straightens her hair with this model and it works way better than her old $200 one. i used hers once and was amazed! my hair used to take 2 hours to get pin straight but with this straightener, it takes about 10-20 minutes! i just had to get one for myself! I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year and I absolutely LOVE it! It still works like the day i got it! And it was inexpensive. I reccomend this to anyone with a desire for straight hair in a short period of time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had curly hair for 40 years. I tried smelly relaxers, blow drying and other curling irons, but the Revlon straightener beats them all. It gives me perfectly straight hair -- and fast -- and I have very long hair. I am done in 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I unwillingly own the thickest most wavy hair in NC. And my hair is long too, which does not help much at all. I have tried Conair&#x27;s hair straightner. Worked for five minutes, then my hair became moderately frizzy. Another hair straightner by some pathetic company did not heat up enough to do anything useful. During my trip to Beale afb, my cousin begged me to let her straighten my \\&quot;horse hair\\&quot; with her straightner. Not hard to guess what it was... 30 min later my hair was straight and smooth and easier to manage. (Too bad she had to take it on her trip to Utah...)&lt;BR&gt;Downfall...I was missing a 10 strands of hair.</li>
    <li> This is the first hair straightener I have ever bought and it works really well.  It has such a large range of temperature settings that it straightens without giving that fried look.  But, recently mine has been tearing out strands of hair.  Hair gets caught between the metal and the plastic, especially at the top corners...and ouch!  I think using it a lot created a gap between the metal and the plastic.  It helps to pull your hair taut and then running the straightener down, avoiding corners.</li>
    <li> The first flat iron I had was awesome - I had it for over a year and it worked great.  I left it with my roommate who had grown to love it as well.  The second one I purchased was terrible - it lasted less than three months and the plates were defective such that several hairs would get caught and ripped out every time I used it (I am embarrassed to say that I continued using it for nearly three months despite the fact that it ripped hairs out every time).  There are many other products out there at a comparable price.  I recommend trying one of those.</li>
    <li> I had this straightener for about three monthes before one day, when i see inside the straightener, there are little sparks going off and it smells different, like fire perhaps? Now I&#x27;m not an expert, but i knew something was wrong when that started happening so i quickly turned it off.  The next day, i wanted to try it but the same thing happened and then suddenly the light went off and it just wouldn&#x27;t work anymore.  It completely burned out.  This is a horrible straightener.  It also pulls your hair out.  If you want a good straightener, I&#x27;m afraid you might have to pay a bit more, but it&#x27;s worth it.  The best kinds are Ceramic Tools or Hot Tools and i recommend a ceramic one because its a lot better for your hair.  Whatever you do, don&#x27;t get Conair or Revlon.  A good straightener is probably going to cost you over 30 dollars, but you&#x27;ll be a lot happier, trust me.</li>
    <li> I liked the straightener a lot. it heated up fast and straightened my hair very effectively. my roommate had the same straightener but hers stopped working after about 6 months. in another review they said the light flickered. the same happened with my roommate&#x27;s. then a month later, mine did the same thing, so I knew there was a flaw in the product.</li>
    <li> This straightner works very good. I have had it for about two months and it works good the only problem is it only stays straight for a while.But if you blow dry your hair at night with the revlon blow dryer and then in the morning straighten it it will look good. But DONT ever buy the conair straightners they are REALLY bad!</li>
    <li> This product catches strands of hair and rips them out as you straighten.  I also experienced the problem with one side of the iron not heating up.  It does get really hot though, and if I do small sections of hair it works okay.</li>
    <li> I have pretty wavy hair and pretty thick hair i straightened my hair and people noticed it with my old striaghtener they really didn&#x27;t notice this striaghtener works great!</li>
    <li> I got this for my birthday over six months ago and have been using it everyday with no problems. I&#x27;ve dropped it multiple times, and it still works just fine (I bought mine in a store, not online). I like that the plates are large so I&#x27;m able to straighten more hair at one time. The multiple heat settings are a nice feature. It heats up quickly and works better than any other hair straightener I&#x27;ve used (Andis, Conair, other Revlon straighteners). My hair never gets caught in the plates like it did with the other straighteners. It also doesn&#x27;t make my hair look dry and fried, which some straighteners do. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little bit bulky, but I guess that makes sense because of the large plates.</li>
    <li> i use this flat iron almost everyday and it works great for me.  i have thick, wavy hair and i can&#x27;t stand it.  i always like my hair straight and thin, and this product does just that.  it thins and straightens my hair.  i have been using it for about a year and i have no regrets so far.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this straightener. It works okay and has different heat settings, but thats about all it can offer. I&#x27;ve used many of my friends straighteners that cost only $10 more and were at least twice as effective. Also, this straightener rips out your hair! Where the plates and the plastic meets, hair gets caught and rips out. Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> When I first used this straightener I was so excited because it turned my wavy hair into beautful straight hair and didnt seem to damage it.  I used it everyday and by the 3rd week it broke.  I almost bought another one but after reading that others had the same  problem then I won&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
    <li> After I wrote my previous review I decided to take another look at this straightener.  I noticed there are screws running up the sides so I decided to take a look to see what was going on inside.  I figured what the heck, we&#x27;re tossing it anyway, what could it hurt.  When I opened it I found two thin wires that had snapped off from where they were soldered.  It seems that the repeated opening and closing from the use of the straightener puts stress on these wires causing them to snap off over time.  Obviously, it doesn&#x27;t take much time to cause this judging from past reviews, a month or two.  Like I said before, this is a design flaw and the manufacturer needs to evaluate this product and correct this problem. All I can say is buyer beware.  We are looking for a different straightener.</li>
    <li> Heats up really fast and gets my hair really straight.  One drawback:  it can snag on hair so go slowly or have a few hairs tugged off.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m only 14, and i&#x27;ve had this straightener since christmas. i&#x27;ve had other straighteners that just dont work on my hair. but this one does, for only $20 it works soo good! it still works perfect, and i use it 5-7 times a week. i&#x27;ve used friends straighteners that they bought for $80 that work just like mine does.    i dont know what people are saying by that it stops working after a few months. i&#x27;ve had mine for almost 6 months, and it works just as good as it did the first day. i&#x27;ve taken this on trips with me and to friends houses, and it still works just fine.    i totally recommend this to people :)</li>
    <li> I just got this straightener about 2 months ago and before this one I had a salon one that my sister gave me and it took an hour to  warm up then it did nothing with my hair all it did was make it a bigger friz ball. Then i got this one and then i could do my hair in the morning for school, then it made it super straight and no friz!!!...so I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Ok I had this straightener a couple of years ago andit was ok, but I had the usual light-stopped-going-on and didn&#x27;t-heat-up problems! I HIGHLY recommend you cough up 10 extra bucks and get a Helen of Troy. It works wonderfully. I&#x27;ve had it for 3 years and it&#x27;s still kickin&#x27;! You want to get the Helen of Troy straightener of her gold series and also make sure it has a dial to control the heat.(ranges 1-10) This straighter get super hot so if you hair is super dry and fragile like mine you wanna put something on the ends to protect it from the heat!</li>
    <li> I have had mine for almost 2 years.  My sister has one too and we LOVE it.  The temp dial is wonderful, because I use it on low (2) and it doesn&#x27;t fry my fine hair.  All of my friends who have borrowed it love it too.</li>
    <li> I have had my straightner for about 6 months or so now, and it still works great.  I have been extremely happy with it.  I don&#x27;t use it every day, about 3 times a week or so.  I have not had any trouble with it.  I did buy mine at Walmart, and it was only $16-17, slightly cheaper.  I also have extremely frizzy hair, and it still works GREAT!</li>
    <li> This was the first flat iron I ever owned. It worked ok, but it pulled my hair. That hurt! I have thick hair and it takes a while to straighten it. Friends were telling me Chi was the best. Well, I finally bought one. What a difference! Yes, the Chi is over $100, but it&#x27;s the best! I got my hair done in half the time the Revlon one took. Plus, the Chi heated up in one minute and did not pull my hair. The Chi gets my hair straighter, faster. And my hair feels so silky after using the Chi.</li>
    <li> this is the best hair straightner i have ever used. i really hope they come back out with this straightner cause i need a new one and im waiting to see if it comes back out. it lasts for years. its the best.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how anyone could have a negative review for this product. I have had my flat iron for 8 months and its absolutely incredible! It heats up almost instantly, and works just like the comparable hot tools product, which costs about twice as much! My hair feels silky smooth after using it and it doesn&#x27;t frizz up after a couple hours as has been my experience with other flat irons. If you want stick straight hair, buy this product!!!</li>
    <li> I really loved this straightener at first, but after about one year of use, the product would not work.  I kept it plugged into my outlet everyday, which I guess you are not supposed to do.  Also, my hair would get caught in the iron and I would have to rip it out causing flyaways.  It got my hair really straight, but I would recommend using it slowly so hairs don&#x27;t get caught and unplugging it when it is not in use.</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener since Christmas and it is still going strong!  Your Hair will be pin straight if you want it to be, or you can have some fun and flip out the ends or curl them in.  My only problem with this product is that your hair gets caught in the edges of the metal plates, and breaks off.  If your considering buying this product, do it, it&#x27;s a great deal and who cares if a couple of hairs are lost.</li>
    <li> As so many others have said already, this straightener is TRASH! I had been on the lookout for a straightener that gets hot enough to straighten my very thick, wavy hair. I&#x27;ve tried them all.  &lt;br /&gt;And then I found the Revlon RV059C. It heats up extremely quickly and is super hot. Sure, it caught a few hairs between the plates and ripped them out, but once I learned how to use it, this didn&#x27;t happen as often. It straightened my hair fast (only took about 10 minutes) and got it silky smooth. I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Then it broke. The red light wouldn&#x27;t work, and the plates wouldn&#x27;t heat up. I kept it going for a while by banging it on the counter to jar the red light, but soon it died for good.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I thought, it was just this particular one. So I went out and bought a new one which worked beautifully - for about 3 months. Then presto, one plate stopped working. Simply wouldn&#x27;t heat up.&lt;br /&gt;OK, I thought. This is not the same problem as the last one. Maybe it&#x27;s a fluke. Maybe I have just had bad luck. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t buy another one from the same company. But it&#x27;s the only straightener I&#x27;ve found that really works! So what do I do? ::STUPID, STUPID:: I buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Well, today, about a month later, the red light turned off. I&#x27;ve banged it on the counter, shaken it, switched electrical sockets, pleaded with it. But that infuriating red light refuses to turn on.&lt;br /&gt;So here I sit, fuzzy haired and furious, desperately looking for a new brand. One that is reliable, one that works, one that gets blisteringly hot,one that doesn&#x27;t break down. &lt;br /&gt;One that is not Revlon.&lt;br /&gt;Any suggestions? Please?</li>
    <li> Oh my God! this is the best straigtening iron i had ever used!It heats up in just under 60 seconds! and the results are amazing... after your done straightening, you&#x27;ll feel like u had &amp;amp;quot;just-got-out-of-the-salon&amp;amp;quot; finish!</li>
    <li> about all of my friends use this exact straightener! Trust me it works...even with my extrememly thick and curly hair!</li>
    <li> I have curly/frizzy hair and this thing does mirracles for me. Very good straightener. I tried few and this one really stands out. The plates heat up very fast, and it straightens hair really well (and fast). One more good thing about it: there are 20 heat settings and not 10 as the description says. Guess someone made a mistake. So u have even more freedom to pick the setting that is right for u.</li>
    <li> This straightening iron works great on my wavy hair.  I knew there are hundreds of straightening irons out there and most of them don&#x27;t really work. But this one is so much better than the other kinds of straigheners. It heats up really fast, and you can adjust the level of heat as you needed. My hair is always so hard to fix or straigten but it does such a wonderful job on straightening. I would suggest anyone who want a hair straightener with a reasonable price should try this. It&#x27;s a very good price with an excellent quality. I&#x27;m not exaggerating and this is absolutely one of the best straightener which I would choose. You would have beautiful, smooth, straight hair in just a few minutes!!</li>
    <li> This straightener is the best, i have super curly hair, like Graces on will and grace, only frizzier, and this device worked like a magic trick on my hair.  I was so happy with the results and feeled like a thousand bucks whenever everyone complemented me on how straight and pretty my hair was the next day! You should totally invest in this wonderful staightener.</li>
    <li> I thought that this product was very helpful. I am an African American woman and we have always been known to have very coarse hair. This product works like a miracle. It gets very hot when you want it to and it keeps my hair nice and straight for days long. The good thing about it also is that you can turn it down a notch if it gets too hot because trust me, this baby can get scorching hot.         Wonderful product!!!</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness, i just got this yesterday and it works! I have very course hair for my age, and textureizing it only worked for 2 days. I used the conair brand, were you change the plates on it, but it doesnt work! Last night i turned it on and i did one straight out and oh my it was straight out STRAIGHT!I especially reccomend this for people who have course hair like me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener Christmas time last year and it has been GREAT!  My hair is very curly and this straighter would get my hair pin straight and would keep it that way even in a club environment where it can get very hot.  However, almost a year later and the one side of the straightener does not heat up like the other side does.  I&#x27;m disappointed because i really liked this straightener until it decided to break on me.  The thing is I would have thought that it might have just been mine but my best friend bought the same straightner and just the other day the same thing happened to hers.  Like I said it is a great straightener but it might decided not heat up on the one side.</li>
    <li> I have used this straightner for a few years and have really enjoyed using it. I tried using one by Vidal Sassoon and you can really tell the difference in them.  Revlon&#x27;s Heat Straigtener is easy to use and does a good job!</li>
    <li> Wow, everyone says that cheap isnt good. But obviously that is a lie! I have extreamly thick hair, but thats no problem for this straightener. Usually, I will go to bed with wet hair, then wake up having it look like a disaster. With my conair straightener it would make my hair look frizzy, plus it would take 30 minutes to do my hair! Not so good when I have to catch a bus for school at 7 am. Waking up late wasnt an option. This straightener got my hair done in 6 minutes...including the heat up time. My hair was perfectly straight, not frizzy, and I got tons of compliments about how shiny it looked. This straightner is the best out there!!! They say that 1 inch straighteners work the best, but for people with thick hair like me, go with this straightener! This is a great christmas gift for you teenage daughter. She&#x27;ll love it!! Enjoy, look great, have fun.</li>
    <li> i love this straightener so much, but i&#x27;ve had to replace it twice in three years.  It seems like all ones that are professional cant be used for longer than  ayear w/o breaking...it was very very disappointing, because one day it just stops working..and you&#x27;re like...hmm...i wanted to straighten my hair today, and anyway, now i have a vidal sassoon ceramic one....it works ok, i dont like how it straightens my hair as much as this one did, but they dont sell this one where i live anymore....sad</li>
    <li> i love this straightener... it dosen&#x27;t look high tech so i wasted my money and bought a cool looking one.... which sucked so bad and wasted my time... I went by many friends who have this one and always love it... so I bought in the summer and it&#x27;s so great and fast and always looks super straight.. Must have. .</li>
    <li> Cheap product in all means. It riped off my hair while straightening and did a very lousy job</li>
    <li> This is my third (3rd) unit over the years.  Good ole&#x27; reliable Revlon RV059  and at the right price !</li>
    <li> This straightener has lasted me 6 years and counting, it was my first and only straightener when I was 12. I will probably be buying a new one soon just because the plates are starting to wear down due to everyday use but this product is great. I have normal, wavy, color treated hair and this product does the job, I recommend it to anyone with pretty manageable hair that would like to take about 10 minutes to get shiny perfectly straight hair.</li>
