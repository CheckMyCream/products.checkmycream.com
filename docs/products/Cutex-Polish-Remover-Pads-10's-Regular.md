    <li> works perfectly.  good price, shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Just one pad cleans all 10 of my finger nails. This is a perfect way to clean the nail polish off my nails without a huge mess.</li>
    <li> These polish remover pads work beautifully and do not require multiple pads for cleaning.  They also don&#x27;t dry out.</li>
    <li> I keep these in my bag. Use them whenever my mani starts to look horrid! One pad does take off all polish.</li>
    <li> Have used these for years.  They usually take off all polish with first swipe.  One pad definitely covers all 10 nails, and that is with multiple coats of polish.  Local stores don&#x27;t carry them often, so I need to get them over the net.</li>
    <li> These polish remover pads R quite effective. The pad is large &amp; liberally saturated with remover really does the job N a hurry. Nice smelling 2. Wonderful value &amp; super 2 tuck 1 N your wallet R makeup bag. I used 1 pad 2 clean off gunk from label removal from 4 items perfect a multitasking product.</li>
    <li> These pads deserve the rave reviews they&#x27;ve gotten online. One pad - 10 fingers or 10 toes - done! Let them sit awhile on the nail to partially dissolve the old polish, then wipe away! I&#x27;d originally bought them for a long trip, (imagine the horror of polish remover loose in your luggage!) but now use them at home. The best!</li>
    <li> First found product in California and loved the ease of removing polish.  Pads are great for anyone in a hurry, children and older women.  Excited, when I found this product on Amazon.  Arrived on promised date.</li>
    <li> I bought three of these for my young cousins who love doing there nails.  No damage to furniture from spilled nail polisher remover bottles!</li>
    <li> Works great, fast acting, and convenient!</li>
    <li> I love the product and it got here asap.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> These work great. They are convenient to take with you. I can take the polish off of all ten fingers if it is not glitter or very dark. You will need two pads if that is the case.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this hard-to-find 3 pack of acetone-containing polish remover pads. They do a wonderful job, and I will be reordering as needed!</li>

    <li> Cannot find this item in stores near me and it is the best for taking off layers of toe nail polish.  One pad cleans all ten toes.</li>
    <li> I have used these before.  Not only are they are perfect to travel with, I always keep them in my purse for everyday use.  I now give them away as party gifts.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter so I didn&#x27;t have to supervise her use of the nail polish remover bottle and risk spills. I wasn&#x27;t expecting they actually worked, but they do! I was in a rush and needed to remove my chipped polish and she gave me one pad claiming that was all I needed for all 10 of my nails. She was right. One pad quickly removed the polish from all my nails and probably would have 10 more. I will definitely buy these again and again.</li>
    <li> Removes polish like no other.  Prompt service.  This was my second order.  Buy three and save money.  Try it and I think you will like it.</li>
    <li> Very useful for travel. Really well saturated.</li>
    <li> These pads were wonderful! They are easy to use and not messy at all  One pad removed the polish on all 10 nails quickly.  I will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Work Well Great for Travel</li>
