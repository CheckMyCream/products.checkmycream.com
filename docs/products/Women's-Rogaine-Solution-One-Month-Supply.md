      <li>my lovely wife start using rogine for men for about an year now.</li>

      <li>I am experiencing what many had comment</li>
      <li>Also, would be better in foam or spray.</li>
      <li>Love your product.  </li>
      <li>If anything this product made me lose more hair.</li>
      <li>I am on many medications that are causing me to lose my hair prematurely.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t balding, just thinning a bit on top.</li>
      <li>My beautician said that she see some fuzz :)</li>
      <li>I have been using Rogaine for Women for more than a year now, it does help me and I am pleased.</li>
      <li>Wash your hands afterwards and make sure not to get it in your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They claim using it more often than that in a day doesn&#x27;t have any affect.</li>
      <li>and it works much better.</li>
      <li>Will have to order more.</li>
      <li>Its ok.  </li>
      <li>OKAY, I&#x27;m posting another review, on Mar. 28.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been able to maintain my hair growth.</li>
      <li>I was also noticing much more hair in my brushes and on the bathroom floor.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I read that</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;m thrilled that hair is coming in, I&#x27;m concerned that the Rogaine, or else its suspension, is causing my hair color to fade more quickly.  </li>
      <li>Very happy so far and well worth the time, effort and cost.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also made my diet more focused on lean proteins and dark leafy greens to give myself the best chance.</li>
      <li>It breaks easily</li>
      <li>Now truely, I have more hair, looking like a wig with the thickness.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>It has also caused the fine hair that comes in my hair line to stay in instead of falling out.  </li>
      <li>and now i have fine hair</li>
      <li>and it was a bottle filled with alcohol</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy that the hair loss has stopped and that is enough to keep me using the Rogaine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and am happy with the results.</li>
      <li>The area where I part my hair has filled in somewhat.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m satisfied with its success.</li>
      <li>it may fit some peoples lifestyle or grooming habits</li>
      <li>it really works, I have seen results in only one month using it :D</li>
      <li>So far so good though.</li>
      <li>Will buy a new one for sure!</li>
      <li>I continue to use this as it has made a significant improvement in the quality and quantity of my hair.  </li>
      <li>I was getting so excited after reading all those reviews.</li>
      <li>Some new hair growth for which I am thrilled.  </li>
      <li>after 2 weeks you can see new hair growth, I have always liked this product.  </li>
      <li>it is the viscosity of water making it run, that is why I put in minute amounts at a time and make sure to massage it to as large of an area as I can with each application.</li>
      <li>This is the most reasonable price for the brand.</li>
      <li>I know the 6-months-from-now version of me will thank (present-day) me abundantly for giving it the old college try.</li>
      <li>Great product with a great price tag, will definitely purchase again in the near future.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t see any new growth yet, but very happy to at least keep what I have :)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Stops hair from falling out but does NOT regrow hair!</li>
    <li> bought it for a friend. She loves it!</li>
    <li> I use this product since a year and It is working</li>
    <li> if you color your hair dont use this.  it was a warm brown but the spot i used this on turned black within 2 weeks</li>
    <li> Great product with a great price tag, will definitely purchase again in the near future. I had serious problems with hair loss after having my child and this product was the only thing that helped.</li>
    <li> It has been since Rogaine came on the market that have been using this product.  Tried the other generic (cheaper) ones, but they kept dripping more than Rogaine does.  Dangerous for it around eyes, so have stayed with name brand for all these years.</li>
    <li> At 54 years of age, I saw my hair starting to look like my mother&#x27;s (thin and more thin). I&#x27;ve always been blessed with very thick, good hair. Suddenly, I started seeing my scalp and was relegated to thinking I would need wigs as I continued to age. No way, was this scalp going to see more sunlight if I could help it! I have been using Rogaine for a little over a month and already notice a difference. Even my hairdresser, who was skeptical when I told her about it, didn&#x27;t think it would work. I am seeing less scalp and more hair! I will continue to use this product!! Tip - if you have some darker roots and yet can still see your scalp, try brushing some brown shadow onto the scalp...works for me as it covers up the white of my scalp and just looks like, well, roots :)</li>
    <li> Its ok.  Stopped using and went to a vitamin suppliant instead and it works much better.</li>
    <li> Works well for my step mom. Her hair is thickened up tremedously.</li>
    <li> Leaves horrible residue on hair.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I have been using it for a month and I can say  my hair has stopped falling out , which was a problem for me , I think if you&#x27;re willing to give continuous use, is perfect,because it works</li>
    <li> It actually works after using for a long time.</li>
    <li> am suddenly and dramatically losing my hair.  the dermatologist recommended trying rogaine ---- explaining that it is a solid commitment to using it to see any results.  i had delusions of grandeur.  for me and my lifestyle it was impossible to use.  the directions for successful use ----- use on dry hair only--cant get hair wet for at least four hours after, must use twice a day-----FOR ME---it was impossible.  the big reason being -- it is GREASY!!  so lets say you shower at night --- then dry your hair ---- then put the rogaine in ---its greasy -- you need to wash your hair again in the morning - there is no salvaging it for work----- so you wash, dry, style ----- put the rogaine in ----it is GREASY--again-- you cant go out in public like that!  it may fit some peoples lifestyle or grooming habits --not mine.  a big waste of $40.  although i am glad it was only $40!</li>
    <li> Love your product.  Its the best</li>
    <li> It is good for hair loss I will never stop using this product</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like how my hair feels after a couple of  applications.</li>
    <li> Works excellent with the Derma Roller 1.5 - better than the foam.  I don&#x27;t even use it as consistently as you&#x27;re supposed to and it still works very well.</li>
    <li> my mom has been complaining about hairloss. i bought this as a gift for her and she is now very very happy. it takes a while.... but it works!</li>
    <li> Broke my face out a bit</li>
    <li> After using this product twice a day for a month, I noticed new hair growth.  Six months later, I have more hair than I have had in years.</li>
    <li> I started using the 2% liquid twice a day a couple of months and got really itchy almost broken skin, painful scalp. Read the the foam won&#x27;t cause this so i switched to the 5% foam once a day. The shedding never stopped for me after using rogaine for a total of 6 months. What was worse was extreme dry skin on my face and my eyes were super dry and very painful. My scalp was still itchy and scaly but not as bad as the liquid. I researched and read that rogaine can cause dry skin, but nothing about eye dryness was mentioned. However a lot of people online report the same issues with their eyes. Anyhow i stopped using it after 6 months and it has been the worst experience with all the side effects and no regrowth or shedding reduction. I got some facial hair though! Yippie,,,,! Update: I started again out of desperation but this time my hairdresser suggested using a spray bottle (from a scalp treatment- I use invati sample empty bottle) and spray 2 sprays on each side of the head on random areas on the scalp once a day as she does. This has really worked decreasing the scalp itchiness since I try to rotate the application sites.  This time around, my shedding has decreased tremendously. I also started taking the hair,nail, skin multivitamins, but I think it&#x27;s the rogaine that is helping. I think one needs to stick it out and try different approaches.  My dry eyes have gotten better, but never went away:(( Maybe twice a day was too much for my body. Hope this info is helpful</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t seen much of a change.</li>
    <li> after 2 weeks you can see new hair growth, I have always liked this product.  The only down side is that you must use daily or the process stops.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. Individuals purchasing this product need to be aware that it takes several months before you see results.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> It works, but you have to keep using it or your hair will fall out again</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it is growing my hair, but it is keeping it from falling out so quickly!  I only use it once per day.</li>
    <li> It works great! I can see my hair is growing.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the products and continue using it.</li>
    <li> I think it is helping.</li>
    <li> Penelope D.&lt;br /&gt;I really Love the product, I&#x27;d buy again. Thanks..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother and she said it worked really well for her and there was a notable difference. She started buying it and used it regularly.</li>
    <li> So far so good, Very pleased with the product, using as prescribed!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just try for a few days, friends say seems to have a little effect, looking forward to...</li>
    <li> It helps if you follow the instructions and continue to use after four months, even you are satisfied with your result!</li>
    <li> It seems to be working</li>
    <li> Just perfect for my mom</li>
    <li> This stuff really works ! I bought this for my mother ... she saw my results &amp; asked me to get her some .</li>
    <li> It REEKS of alcohol. I used this and finished the box, what I did not notice was that this was the reason for my hair loss in the first place. I have giant bald spots so I contacted Rogaine and sent one of the remaining bottles and was told that it was fake and it was a bottle filled with alcohol</li>
    <li> Runs all over, can&#x27;t keep it on the area I want it. I am disappointed as I have heard that for many it works but I was just not able to apply it effectively for myself.</li>
    <li> As a woman in her early 20s, I was horrified to figure out a couple years ago that I was showing the first signs of hereditary hair loss. I used this without sticking to a strict &amp;#34;twice daily&amp;#34; schedule for almost a year, but didn&#x27;t notice any dramatic results so I stopped using it. It was only after stopping that I realized what a huge difference it had made, and once my hair started falling again I had to start over. I&#x27;ve re-started using this for 4 months now and can say with confidence that if you use this twice daily as directed, you&#x27;re likely to see results (if cause of hair loss is hereditary). I&#x27;m seeing baby hairs for the first time in the front parts of my hair, and my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out nearly as much as it used to. I&#x27;ll never stop using this again in the near future! Give it a try for a few months.</li>
    <li> Package came in with bottle broken seal.  I think I paid for new and received used.  The bottles were loose in the box.  I am not sure I want to use it!  And btw the statement was not included in the box either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for three months and I believe that I have hair growth but not as much as I would like to have.</li>
    <li> Great item - works!. I mix it with CostCo mens to bring the price dow.</li>
    <li> Had to throw it out. Read package instructions and it stated that you could loose more hair by  using this product. That is just what happened.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 36 years old and lose quite a bit of hair after my pregnancy 4 years ago. I keep using this for 5 months already, only apply to my hair once a day after shower, it does help to dil up the patch I have, I will keep using this.</li>
    <li> I finally grew hair after using this product for 2 monthes，but the hair growed is short and they can&#x27;t grow longer.&lt;br /&gt;It really takes much time to see effect, there is nothing different for the first couple of weeks&lt;br /&gt;this is why i turned to 5% minoxidil, 2% can&#x27;t help me much</li>
    <li> I am finding this product to be very helpful with old age thinning of hair.  My hair has thickend somewhat and there seems to be some new growth after three months of use.  This is not a miracle cure for thinning hair but does help.  Must follow directions or not effective.</li>
    <li> Product as described. Delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> Rogaine works somewhat.  I noticed my hair thinning near the part as I reached mid 60&#x27;s, so following doctor suggestion I started using Rogaine.  The area where I part my hair has filled in somewhat.  As my doctor told me, there are several causes of baldness so the affliction can&#x27;t always be reversed.  I&#x27;ve been using Rogaine for 3-4 yrs. and will continue using as long as I see that it still works for me.  The 3 pack (3 month supply) is the best value.</li>
    <li> Because it does not grow hair fast enough. You might see a little peach fuss. it not worth the price you charge for this product. in the future I will try something else.  noting personal.</li>
    <li> Not sure it&#x27;s really helping....</li>
    <li> This product was confusing and the application difficult.. If you read the instructions, it informs you the product will cause you to lose hair before it will allow your scalp to grow hair.. And it takes 4 months to a year before you see results.. It is difficult to apply and drips all over from the dropper..You are told to be very carfeful and not allow the product to drip on other parts of your body... It was just disappointing to say the least... Contacted Amazon and requested a label to return this prodict for a refund.. The credited my account instead, because the product is considered toxic and cannot be returned..Well, why would I put this on my scalp!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years. It works great.  You just have to keep using it or your hair will continue to fall out.</li>
    <li> I works but you need to apply diligently every day.</li>
    <li> I have not seen much new hair yet, but this product gives my hair body and my hair feels fuller. I have tried lots of different products, but for a full feel and easier styling I would give it 5 stars</li>
    <li> It has been good for my hair for the past 10 year. This is the most reasonable price for the brand.</li>
    <li> I had a reaction to this product. Within an hour of applying I was having dizzy spells. I had difficulty walking at first and my husband had to assist me.&lt;br /&gt;It is one of the things that are posted on the front of the box as a warning. Please be sure to read the info carefully and do some research on the product before buying. They also tell you there are reasons you should not use it. I did all this and still got the reaction.</li>
    <li> I have used Rogaine for 5 months and seen a great improvement in my hair.  It has made my fine thin hair become stronger and thicker.  It has also caused the fine hair that comes in my hair line to stay in instead of falling out.  I am very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I cant tell that its doing anything, the dropper is horrible.  You need a spray bottle for this product to use it correctly.  If you use the dropper it runs down the back of your head and the front!  I mean why put it in the place that your hair is thinning if when you do it runs everywhere else?  Just buy Biotin and start taking that.  This was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love the auto delivery with the extra discount.  It seems to work.  My hair seems to be growing back.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that they recommend you put it on dry hair which is a bit time consuming for me since I wash my hair at night.  Otherwise, the product works.  My tip for putting it on is using qtips.  I dip it and then rub it on my scalp.  Less drip and mess.  I tried the spray bottle and it drips.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair but I have a decent amount and I started using this to try and make it thick. Instead I couldn&#x27;t stand using it longer then two weeks it made me lose half of my hair in that time. So it may work but the initial  shed was NOT worth it!!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I had lost a lot of hair because of my illness and this product has really helped my hair to grow back. I will continue to use it forever.</li>
    <li> I was getting so excited after reading all those reviews. I have bald spot and I always try to cover it by adding some of my black eye shadow so it wouldn&#x27;t look like am really bald. I used this and didn&#x27;t see any change. Am very upset. But that don&#x27;t mean it wouldn&#x27;t work for anyone else it just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t stand the itchy scalp.  dixie</li>
    <li> Been using it for about 5 months. The only difference I&#x27;ve noticed is itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t balding, just thinning a bit on top. This really seems to be working! My hair appears to be thickening and I notice tiny downy like hair growing in.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t continue using it. My scalp developed severe dandruff from the rogaine. I wash my hair frequently but it was still creating dandruff. I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see the results.</li>
    <li> I have grown new &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; hair in the front of my scalp where I was starting to get thin. I am on many medications that are causing me to lose my hair prematurely. I had numerous (26) surgeries that also caused my hair to get thinner and actually its amazing I even have any hair left! I am only 45 years old.</li>
    <li> I love it, started to see the difference after about 2 months my hair is growing back, very happy with the result, however be careful because it used to drip little bit near my ears and now I got hair there that I need to remove</li>
    <li> This product has too much alcohol in it. I follow the instruction, everyday put few drops, my hair color was bleached and hair were so sticky kind like glue together ,then the hair turned like white powder on surface.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with purchase.</li>
    <li> this helps my hair on top of my scalp get stronger and actually grow. i was skeptical at first but now i always more</li>
    <li> This product made my hair considerably thicker in about six months without any side effects. I am a 60 year old.</li>
    <li> There is hereditary female pattern baldness in my family so when I saw more hair in my brush than normal  I freaked out.  I started using Rogaine for women after a girlfriend told me she had good results. That was two years and I have not looked back.  I use this product twice a day every day and my hair loss has stopped and new hair has grown in.  I will use this product until I am too old to care!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m right at the four month mark with this and I think it&#x27;s working. My hair fallout has slowed to what I consider normal for me. I think I see some baby fuzz growing in the thin spot but at this point I&#x27;m not very hopeful that I&#x27;ll get my full growth back. I think I waited too long to start this. I have no medical issues and I do have a family history of hair loss so I would tell a friend that if the doctor says nothing is wrong then start this program sooner rather than later. I&#x27;m happy that the hair loss has stopped and that is enough to keep me using the Rogaine. It&#x27;s cheaper at Walmart but Amazon is quick, and private. There&#x27;s an odd side note I should mention I have noticed that my thinning eyebrows are noticably thicker and fuller. I have only applied the Rogaine to my scalp as directed. Twice a day forever is a big commitment but for me it&#x27;s worth it to keep my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and just ordered another box to keep as backup. I had no magical expectations of this product. I knew going in, that anything I used to try and regrow my thinning hair would take time and a commitment to use as directed. I already knew that I would need AT LEAST 2 boxes (3 bottles in each/6 months of treatment), before I could reasonably expect to see results. I can&#x27;t really say if it does or doesn&#x27;t work before that. So I will update at that time, I just had to address those who are stating that it doesn&#x27;t work in contradiction to statements that are clearly stated on the box/in the leaflet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it is the viscosity of water making it run, that is why I put in minute amounts at a time and make sure to massage it to as large of an area as I can with each application. I focus on a different area each time. It does seem like it&#x27;s not even an amount that could make a difference. I read the entire leaflet and saw that during the testing trials, the same results were had whether you used 1ml twice a day (recommended) or tried to speed up the process by using more than that. I&#x27;m glad I read that, otherwise I would have finished the whole thing in the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a few reviews saying it didn&#x27;t work after only using it a month or so. It does say that the hair growth will come at the same rate of your current hair growth. It also says there will be a \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; period of sorts several weeks into treatment that will cause more hair loss right before the product really begins to start working. With all of this in mind, I have reasonable expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I can honestly attest to the fact that I have a tingling, almost crawling sensation on different parts of my head after 1 month&#x27;s use. My head does itch at times, but it&#x27;s nothing unbearable, and I feel like it&#x27;s due to the new hair growth/stimulated follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been times when I&#x27;ve forgotten an application. I keep reminding myself that it&#x27;s only my results that will be hurt which gives me the drive to keep with it twice a day. I know the 6-months-from-now version of me will thank (present-day) me abundantly for giving it the old college try. I will give it at least 6 months, possibly 9 before officially saying whether it&#x27;s not worth it (for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also to give myself the best chance, I am taking a multivitamin specifically for hair, skin, and nails with B complex and biotin. I&#x27;ve also made my diet more focused on lean proteins and dark leafy greens to give myself the best chance. I can&#x27;t be a balding woman at my age, it&#x27;s not fair and I will fight for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m at the 6-month mark and I can definitely say that I have new hair growth. It&#x27;s most noticeable at the hairline where there is visible short hair growing out. It is the same color and texture as my own natural hair. While I do still have the general thinning all over, I&#x27;ve had close friends let me know that they can see short hairs growing out of the top of my head while my hair is pulled back in a ponytail. I believe that if I continue with my \\&quot;regimen\\&quot; of increased protein, iron, vitamin C (to help with iron absorption), biotin, B12 and other minerals specifically for hair growth I should continue to see positive changes. Also, to be honest, while I was using Rogaine twice daily for the first few months, more recently I&#x27;ve slacked off a lot and have even gone several days in-between treatments. I usually try to remember to at least either take the vitamin, eat a a high-nutrient meal or use Rogaine every day.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and whether it is truly helping my hair loss that much or not I&#x27;m not certain.  But I am afraid to stop using it.</li>
    <li> The sticky greasy residue this product leaves on your hair makes it more unsightly than any bald spots you may have. My hair looks and feels (and is) dirty when I used this according to directions. I don&#x27;t know how someone could apply this and go out in public afterward. If its effectiveness depends on constant usage so then the option is to endure a sticky hairdo or bare patches, I plan on going bald.&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was a money back guarantee for this. It was a very expensive disappointment.</li>
    <li> It works!!!  Within two weeks had a lot of new growth.  I don&#x27;t like how my hair feels the morning of day two. It really feels like I need to wash it, but so what - it works!</li>
    <li> I just finished the first bottle and has not seen the full effect of the product. I am experiencing what many had comment and that is the initial hair loss but am hopeful that those will be replaced with even more hair. The only reason why this product is not getting five star is the inconvenience of twice a day application. At least once a week, I will forget one of the two applications required.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  You have to use it every day forever, but the results, for me, have been remarkable!</li>
    <li> Excellent product I recomend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since it was introduced (twenty years ago?) and have been a steady user. My hair has stayed normal, no thinning anywhere. It hasn&#x27;t become thick but I&#x27;m satisfied with its success.</li>
    <li> really worked, must keep using it</li>
    <li> This is the only product worked for my hair fall.</li>
    <li> This product has to have a 5 star rating.  The thinning hair problems for women is largely ignored and yet women are supposed to have a thick full head of hair. Well thinning and balding is a problem for women too. I certainly cannot afford the hair transplants so I&#x27;ve had to find other options. This does not in anyway cure the problem but at least it helps.  Use it twice a day everyday or what it does grow back WILL fall out and you&#x27;ll be as bad or worse off than when you started using it.  I prefer the liquid to the foam, to me it&#x27;s cleaner, easier to use and not sticky like the foam. Also something else I&#x27;ve found, other products that are much more expensive and believe me I&#x27;ve searched through many of them, almost spend a heck of a lot more money until I read the ingredients, they&#x27;re the same as Rogaine.  So this is a good value for your money.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rogaine for Women for more than a year now, it does help me and I am pleased. Instead using it twice a day I only use it once. It is rather expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended to me by my physician.</li>
    <li> This does seem to be working. On 3rd bottle and am getting new growth. It is a nuisance doing 2x daily. Be careful not to get too close to hairline, just had to wax near ears,and neckline! Started to grow sideburns!!</li>
    <li> Runny and extremely drying.  The alcohol content made what hair I have left very dry and breakable.</li>
    <li> Using it last two months. Hair definitely stopped falling out. Don&#x27;t see any new growth yet, but very happy to at least keep what I have :)</li>
    <li> After I ordered it I heard this product was not good for me.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it untouched. Got the refund. Thank you.</li>
    <li> When I initially began to use at my doctor&#x27;s advice along with prescribed medication.  Much to my surprise it did work.  However, my hair once again came out and although the hair grows back in one area, it will come out in another.  I say at least give it a try since it is possible that your experience may be different.  I continue to use because when a woman loses her hair she becomes a little desperate.</li>
    <li> I have been using the generic, and it is totally different. The real Rogaine works wonders and does not affect your hair as far as styling as the generic does.</li>
    <li> Great product, I saw results within 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I continue to use this as it has made a significant improvement in the quality and quantity of my hair.  Would give up coffee before I give up Rogaine</li>
    <li> This Really works! Read all directions, and don&#x27;t be in a New York hurray.  I have thin hair to begin with, so when I noticed my hair getting thiner, I tired Rogaine.  Now truely, I have more hair, looking like a wig with the thickness.  Soon to go on vationtion, I&#x27;m taking it with me. Happy senior.</li>
    <li> o.k. nothing to brag about. take forever.  better results when using male dosage</li>
    <li> I did not experience regrowth after three months.. Twice a day. Very unhappy with purchasr</li>
    <li> It takes time to work, but not for everyone. My friend and i bought it together at the store. After 2-3 months i saw some improvement, but she did not. It&#x27;s not a magic treatment, but there is improvement.</li>
    <li> It appears to be performing as promised. I have been using it for about 6 weeks and see some new hair growth, albeit slow. I believe it will do what it said it would, but wonder if it will be permanent or temporary?</li>
    <li> I WAS TOLD THAT WOMEN&#x27;S ROGAIN WOULD GIVE ME HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE SO I CANCELED THIS ORDER &amp; ALL THE OTHER ORDERS THAT HAD ROGAIN IN IT....</li>
    <li> Takes at least 8 hours a day (two times a day with 4 hours between each application).  I don&#x27;t have the luxury of that much time a day...my job is 12-hour shifts.  And now I discover I can&#x27;t return it because it is a HAZARDOUS material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll thanks for letting me know about the amount of time daily needed to us, and the NO RETURN for this product before I purchased!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advertisement for this product is not clear.  I would not have purchased if I had known the amount of time needed to use it and the no return.</li>
    <li> I do have some improvement</li>
    <li> I keep using this and it seems to help but not sure it actually is giving me more hair growth.....we shall see I will remain faithful in trying</li>
    <li> To decided to give this a go. I developed hair lose due to undo stress on my hair from too tight hair styles. Not sure if I would see hair growth again, but I felt I needed to do something. After 4 weeks I developed nagging headaches. I read and re-read the side effects of Rogaine but did&#x27;t see anything, so I continued using it. Then I got terrible neck aches and attributed it to using my iPad too much.....lol. I forgot one night to apply the Rogaine and the next morning my headaches eased up. I thought, lets not use it that day. Then my neck got better. So, needless to say, Rogaine didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 53 year old female with thinning hair likely due to menopause.  I purchased this product about a month ago and can see evidence of regrowth in the thinning areas.  I&#x27;m using the product generously and as directed twice a day, but I am using a spray bottle rather than their applicator.  Their information indicates the product takes about 8 months for maximum regrowth and I feel relatively confident I&#x27;ll get a nice result.</li>
    <li> It works. My front part looked kind of hair empty, not too much, but enough for me to sometimes cover it up with eyeshadow (with a big brush) not anymore, I&#x27;ve been using it for a year and going strong. I started noticing the difference after 6-8 months of use. You do need to use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> ihave been using it for 3 months and have seen no results.</li>
    <li> it really works, I have seen results in only one month using it :D</li>
    <li> It works! It works! It works! It Works! I am not sure how many more times I can tell you that it works! It costs a pretty penny online and in the shops but it is one of the few products that really works. Give it a little bit of time and you will see that it works! it works!</li>
    <li> I have been going through an immense amount of stress over the past two years and I have been suffering from mild depression for the past 7 months.  All of this and a few other things have taken a huge toll on my hair.  It breaks easily and I have noticed some thinning (I am 38, female, and no hereditary balding on either side that  I am aware of).  Needless to say,  I decided to try Rogaine for women.  I received the package on the 13th of August and within three weeks I have LOST, yes LOST about 20% of my hair.  I understood there would be some extra shedding, I was prepared for that, but you can see my scalp on the sides, and top - everywhere that I applied it.  I cannot afford to wait to see if it will work in six months!  I am so mortified and scared that most if not all of my hair will fall out!  I cannot express how much I regret using this product and I am frightened that my hair will not grow back!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered it for my mom 2 months ago, and she loves it. She notified me that it grew her hair. I guess this Rogaine is a hit.</li>
    <li> i stopped using this product for 5 months and my hair would not stop falling out. Once I started using it again, I could already tell the difference in just a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Yes it works!!  Stay with it for a few months and you&#x27;ll be glad you did! Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Women&#x27;s Rogaine for at least 3 years and am very pleased with the results I&#x27;ve achieved. I have baby-fine hair (but a lot of it) which seemed to be thinning along the part and front hairline. I was also noticing much more hair in my brushes and on the bathroom floor. When I first started using it, it took about a month to see any new growth (I applied it to the entire crown of my head). And yes - I did see regrowth and continue to see it (but alas, my hair still ends up on the bathroom floor, but not as much as before)! Actually, a co-worker noticed the new hair growth before I did! After about a year, Because of the cost, I reduced using the product twice a day (in the morning after showering/washing my hair and before bedtime) to just once a day (in the morning). I&#x27;ve been able to maintain my hair growth. My hair loss is attributed to menopause and not so much so as to genetics or a skin condition. Try it, it might work for you as it did for me.</li>
    <li> Not happy about this purchase at all. No where does it say that returns are not allowed.&lt;br /&gt;After I purchase I found out I couldn&#x27;t use it what I bought it for and now I am not allowed to return it.</li>
    <li> After a week of treatment, my scalp really started to itch! It drove me so crazy I had to stop using it and then come to find out I can&#x27;t return the product because of it being a &amp;#34;Hazardous&amp;#34; material. If your not familiar with this product I suggest you try the single bottle first and not waste your money like I did.</li>
    <li> used it for 6 months and I see no results other than a lighter check book</li>
    <li> After reading reviews from others who&#x27;ve used this product, I decided to purchase it myself. After noticing my hair has been getting thin in the front, I really started to lose my confidence. I know my situation is definitely not as drastic as what others I&#x27;ve seen are going through with their hair loss/thinning, but it&#x27;s bad enough for me to lose confidence in myself. Everytime my hair is wet, I&#x27;ve really noticed it the thinness. I was so bothered by it, it ate away at me. Thin hair and hair loss runs in my family, so it&#x27;s probably inevitable for me, but I figure I could maybe slow it down a bit while I&#x27;m still young by using this product. I purchased the Equate brand of Rogaine from Walmart a while back and gave up after a while. It didn&#x27;t appear to be doing anything. You definitely get what you pay for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Rogaine for Women for a little over a month now, it comes with 3 good sized bottles of the treatment. I use it twice a day, in the morning and before I go to bed. They claim using it more often than that in a day doesn&#x27;t have any affect. I squirt it on the area where the hair is thinning and rub it into my scalp. Wash your hands afterwards and make sure not to get it in your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s hair grows differently, and so this product will react differently to everyone. I&#x27;m on my second bottle of treatment and just recently noticed a change in the thickness of my hair in the area of which I&#x27;ve been treating. For the first time in a long time, I&#x27;m feeling more confident in myself. I&#x27;m going to keep using this product and see what happens! Unfortunately, when you stop using it, your hair will start getting thin again. But it&#x27;s definitely working to make me feel better about myself and my hair. Thanks Rogaine!</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money!! If anything this product made me lose more hair. I used for 8 months because i read that sometimes it takes up to 8 months to see results. My hair still falling rogaine just made it worst :(</li>
    <li> Works o.k. not great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 months and I am finally starting to see results. I have a lot of new growth. I am very excited to see the result of this product more long term!</li>
    <li> great product. My mom lost her hair after 50th, but she has so much hair as long as started use this. I really recommend this product to women who are older than 40 and their lost their age because of some genetic and neurological problem.</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair due to hair color and other chemicals and needed something to help with hair growth and strength. This products really works. My hair is much stronger and is growing.</li>
    <li> Very good product ....I use it regularly because of thinning hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day as instructed for a little over a month, and it seems to be working, at least, my scalp gets a little itchy like it&#x27;s working.  I suppose it will take continuous use to really see the result.  So far so good though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 1.5 years and it has caused hair to grow where it was going thin! It didn&#x27;t start to look like it was really working until 6-8 mos of use. I started thinning at 25 yo. I&#x27;m 34 now and my hair line looks like it did when I was 24!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have an obvious bald spot like what you would see with men losing hair but I definitely noticed a thinning spot on the top back of my head. I could also see it in pictures. It was scary and I was very selfconscious about it. I&#x27;m so thankful that I tried rogain.</li>
    <li> my lovely wife start using rogine for men for about an year now.Her hair now is full and the visible scalp area has shrunk to a narrow line.&lt;br /&gt;the only problem she had with Rogine for men is the growth of facial hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;she than decided using Rogine for women hopefully facial and body hair stops growing</li>
    <li> Worked for me. It&#x27;s easier to use if its in a spray bottle so just pour it in a spray bottle then make parts in your hair then spay. I use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> This product really worked in helping grow back hair in one spot where I needed it - I was very skeptical but now am a believer</li>
    <li> this is the best, most economical product of it&#x27;s kind for sale.  although i&#x27;m sad to have to use this regularly for this year,  i&#x27;m glad to be able to order this from amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been usng this for about 6 months now. When I first started it gave me headaches right where I applied it. I also noticed a little itching and burning. I toughed it out and after a couple of weeks they went away. I have noticed some hair regrowth and hope it continues. The new hair came in blonde and I have very dark hair, so I used some dye. Just a gentle level 2 dye to blend in the new hair. After a few months I notice I have new blonde hair, so I can tell I am growing new. It is very slow, and I&#x27;m hoping to still grow in some more. My hair loss is at the temples. Also, I noted that if I cut down to once a day, it didn&#x27;t work as well, so I try very hard to always use it twice. I started taking natures plus ultra hair vitamins and it helped a great deal as well. Also using Biosilk treatment, just one drop on my long hair, helps to strengthen the hair I already have. If the rogaine solution is too runny, try measuring it into the black cap (instead of throwing the cap away) and applying with a cotton swab.</li>
    <li> Not difficult to use... just tedious.  The daily applications over wide areas of your head, takes time and lots of effort.  This is a good product, but not a miracle.  You usually use this for many months before you get good results.</li>
    <li> It helps a little bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already ordered the second pack. I see obvious results and I&#x27;m happy. I feel happier, more confident and loved.</li>
    <li> Sorry I bought it.  Couldn&#x27;t use it after I found out that you have to keep using it forever.  Plus there are case limitations usage which you find out about only after getting and opening the box.  Does not even deserve a star.  Waste of good money.</li>
    <li> Used product three months.  After about 2 months, combed fingers through hair and a bunch came out in fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Stupid me, I thought perhaps the hair was weak and new hair would grow in.  I am totally dismayed.  The front of my hair, where I focused this application on, can be seen through to the scalp.  By the time I realized this, I had ordered another 3 month supply.  The seller refused to take back an unopened box.  Don&#x27;t buy this.  Look into other more honest options.  A total disreputable scam.</li>
    <li> After receiving the Rogaine and reading all the material I realized I wouldn&#x27;t use it. However I did not send it back. I just consider it a bad buy.</li>
    <li> Month two already have &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; hair, it worked! Much faster than expected too! Much easier and less expensive than weaves, I&#x27;m actually re-growing my own hair!!!!</li>
    <li> Have used for 1 month now. No obvious result yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m terrible at sticking to regimented treatments, so it would probably work a whole lot better if I used it as directed. I did notice a little difference though.</li>
    <li> I received as I expected. So far, I didn&#x27;t know if it works for me. I have seen my hair gowning.  I still keep lost my hair. It may show results a couple of month later.</li>
    <li> I got this hoping it would help my thin hair. I just naturally have baby fine hair and was hoping this would help. It&#x27;s terrible and all it did was make my scalp dry.</li>
    <li> I did not notice a difference when I first started using it.  I have had some hair growth but very slowly.</li>
    <li> Instructions state it takes 4 months to see results, this box has a 3 month supply! Will have to order more.</li>
    <li> Just into my fourth month of use.  I have far less hair loss and my hair appears thicker.  No longer have to comb it over the bald looking spots.  Very happy so far and well worth the time, effort and cost.  It has been a relief to me.</li>
    <li> MADE ME ITCH-NO NEW HAIR YET</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the items I received. Shipping was very fast</li>
    <li> It does not work even after 4-month usage.</li>
    <li> Worked to regrow hair, but left hair feeling dirty. Also, would be better in foam or spray.</li>
    <li> I recommend Rogain to all my friends.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Rogaine seems to be the big name in hair loss products.  I&#x27;ve used it for approximately 5 months and have not seen a difference.  It&#x27;s easy to put on, the odor is fair, I can still brush and style after it dries, it&#x27;s just not doing the job for which I bought it.  My hair is still thinning.  Very disappointed because there is such hype about it.</li>
    <li> When used as directed, I did see new hair growth. You do need to be patient. In my case it started to notice hair loss in the from of my head return after two months. I think you need about 3 months to really see results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure it is working for me but am not comfortable stopping it.  They say if you stop you can lose what Rogaine helped to grow.</li>
    <li> It really works. My hair doubled in volume. After 3 month my hair looks different. They have become stronger and shinier.  The only problem is that the other areas on my body now have more hair too.</li>
    <li> With all the meds I&#x27;ve used over the years, my hair is thinning a lot.  I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and the price through Amazon is very good.  Plus I don&#x27;t have to run to the drugstore to buy it.</li>
    <li> I think it works but I decided to change my diet totally to whole foods plant based diet so ever since I&#x27;ve been feeding my body with non processed, non toxic, mostly fresh plant based whole foods I don&#x27;t suffer from hair and skin problems anymore. I used this product at the same time but didn&#x27;t care much about it because diet works better than any medicine. Body has great capacity to heal itself. Try to eat more nutritious diet you will feel better and fix your own problems without any medication folks. Good luck with that.</li>
    <li> OKAY, I&#x27;m posting another review, on Mar. 28.  It&#x27;s been over 6 weeks.  I too noticed some hair loss after it started, but now I&#x27;m starting to see hair come back.  Where I have the greatest loss is around the hairline just north of my temples, and going back about an inch along the scalp.  It drives me insane when I part my hair, or when I&#x27;m late in touching up my roots.  But now, I am definitely seeing some difference.  A tip for those having problems with applying it:  I use the dropper to deposit the 1 ml of product into a tiny pyrex bowl; then I apply the liquid to the problem areas with my fingertips.  If you have a cut on your finger(s), use gloves; the Rogaine can sting you.  While I&#x27;m thrilled that hair is coming in, I&#x27;m concerned that the Rogaine, or else its suspension, is causing my hair color to fade more quickly.  Auburn oxidizes faster than other hair colors anyway, but this seems to be oxidizing faster than before.  So, I&#x27;m now getting my roots touched up every 4 weeks instead of 6, as I used to, but I&#x27;m willing to spend the extra money to see whether the Rogaine will really do the trick for my precious locks.  Eyebrows:  I never, ever thought about using it to re-grow some of the eyebrow hair I lost through years of over-zealous plucking and shaping, but you can bet I&#x27;m going to give that a shot, starting tonight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING:  THIS LIQUID ETCHES MARBLE!!  I certainly had no idea that this would happen when I began using the product last week, nor was there any warning at all on the packaging or in the literature inside.  I always put a hand towel down on the marble countertop in my bathroom anyway, but some of this stuff leaked through as I was applying to my scalp, and tore into that marble worse than any solvent.  So far as the efficacy of the Rogaine is concerned, I&#x27;ve been using it for only a week, so it&#x27;s a bit too early to tell.  But I can tell you that one of the biggest problems with it, apart from eating marble finish, is how stiff it makes your hair along your part of whichever part of the scalp or hairline on which you&#x27;re using it.  About the only way you can work around it is to wet a washcloth and wipe it along the locks of that are above the scalp, and not the scalp itself.  In other words, don&#x27;t get your scalp wet in order to remove excess product from the hair.  I&#x27;ll report back in 4 months (or sooner, I hope!) to post another review:  does it work or not!your hair along your part of whichever part of the scalp or hairline on which you&#x27;re using it.

    <li> Good Package.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle and nothing happening yet.  I&#x27;ll keep at it, though.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Thanks to Amazon.</li>
    <li> My friend said Rogaine really helps her hair growth.</li>
    <li> Some new hair growth for which I am thrilled.  At age 63 I did not really expect any results.  I am continuing to use this product for at least 8 months and will update my results then.  My estimate (after 4 months usage) is that the top front of my scalp has seen at least a 15% improvement.  I have had some problems with excess facial hair.  I am also taking high dosages of biotin but am unable to determine what benefit the biotin supplement might be providing.  My hair loss is most likely genetic but also brought on by stress due to recent loss of my husband and a new medication for treatment of psoriatic arthritis.  This product is worth a 4-month trial to see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> Very reasonable price .delivered on time</li>
    <li> Good product, meets expectations for reducing hair loss</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my wife.</li>
    <li> unsure, it will take 6-12 months to see results</li>
    <li> Rogaine works pretty well.  Just remember you have to continue to use it, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay to slow the rate of hair loss.  If your hair is starting to thin, or you notice more hair in your brush than usual over a period of time... (unless you have a health issue - which you should check with your doctor), I found that it&#x27;s better to start using it at the earlier stages  as I began to loose my hair.</li>
    <li> Becarefull!!!!!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and a half. My hair feel sticky dry, and its growing me facial hair. I&#x27;m scared . I have to stop using it. I&#x27;m so disappointed. Waiste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and have not seen any results. I still have a thinning hair. I bought a 3 month supply so hopefully will start seeing results next month.</li>
    <li> What can I say, this works.</li>
    <li> Only used for month and a half, nothing happening yet, but will continue and hope for the best.</li>
    <li> Good product. It has worked for me in a shot time. As a matter of fact, I repeated my order</li>
    <li> I´m using Rogaine for 4 months and It really worked on me... I´m with a lot of &amp;#34;new hair&amp;#34;, incresead by this product. I recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Works well as advertised. Will buy a new one for sure!</li>
    <li> I am still waiting for results that I can see.  My beautician said that she see some fuzz :)</li>
    <li> If you stop using rogaine ,the nomal hair loss porcess will start again..you wil probably lose you newly regrown hair in three to four monthes.If i know this word in advance .i will not buy it .And i want to ask the rogaine factory can i use it or not .But the rogaine&#x27;s web chinese information is qiangsheng which is a baby problem .It cheat customers</li>
    <li> Had allergic reaction</li>
    <li> I tried this for 3 months and my hair looked dull and if anything looked even thinner. It was definitely not good for me!</li>
    <li> Stopped hair loss, some new growth...been 6 months. Pretty satisfied so far.</li>
    <li> see fine hair so far seeing some results have not been a full 2 weeks but there was no hair where putting this application on and you just have to patient with any product i really did not have 1 strand of here and now i have fine hair</li>
    <li> It works for what it&#x27;s supposed to work for. I have been using it for almost three months. Unfortunately, I have small chemical burns near my edges. My hair hasn&#x27;t grown much there, but that is not what Rogain is meant to treat anyways. It was worth a try. I do have lots of new baby hairs around the perimeter of my hairline, around the bald spots, and on my eyebrows (I know you&#x27;re not supposed to use it there but I do it anyway). Just be patient and you will see!</li>
    <li> For the past year and a half I have been purchasing this product through Amazon-apparently Amazon no longer sells this product directly so I had to buy through a third party- While I thought it was the same product, apparently this has been watered down.  It&#x27;s not working as well as it had previously.  Don&#x27;t bother it&#x27;s fake.</li>
