      <li>they are fun to use and make any nail design pop...</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to those who like to have fun with their nails.</li>
      <li>and it was a pain in the butt other than that I loved them</li>
      <li>The wheel I received wasn&#x27;t quite as full as the picture portrays, but I definitely received more than my money&#x27;s worth, which was my biggest concern.</li>
      <li>Other than that, the product was a good buy.</li>
      <li>very pleased even though the wheel doesn&#x27;t hold the pearls much they tend to fall occasionally</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was disappointed in the colors....</li>
    <li> Not the colors I received and so difficult to pick up. The plastic case is very static-y so the pearls were all sticking to one another and to the case.</li>
    <li> These are nice. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> The colors are so pretty! Easy to use! Shipping was very fast and the price was Great! I would recommend these to anyone who wants pearls on their nails!</li>
    <li> Not what is depicted in the photo, most of mine aren&#x27;t even cut to be usable, the colors are much darker and they look like toy beads, almost like barbies earrings, they just look cheap and like I said a lot of mine have this &amp;#34;excess plastic&amp;#34; around them so I can&#x27;t even use them, I&#x27;m regretting this purchase</li>
    <li> The packaging was great! None of the beads mixed or poured out. For this price it was perfect! I will buy again!</li>
    <li> The colors in the picture is not what I received, I wanted the pastel colors but thats not what I received.</li>
    <li> Shipping took like 3 weeks but they where well packaged and nothing was leaking or broken.  These are very pretty tiny little half pearls.  Easy to apply with a strong top coat these will not budge.  Overall very happy with the purchase just wish shipping did not take that long.</li>
    <li> I USE THESE ON CRAFT PROJECT&#x27;S AND NAILS  AND ON CLOTHES FOR ADDING TRIM AND FANCY  MOTIFS THEY ARE EASY AND QUICK EVEN ON PAPER</li>
    <li> very pleased even though the wheel doesn&#x27;t hold the pearls much they tend to fall occasionally but it works great shipping was fast very happy with the product</li>
    <li> Weren&#x27;t  the colors id thought they&#x27;d be!!!that&#x27;s the only reason i gave it 3 stars but other than that it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> When I got the item it wasn&#x27;t pastel colors like the pictures.  I had bought these because of the colors on the photos.</li>
    <li> Great pkg and looks great on nails. Only order it if you have about a month or two to wait for it because it took about that long to get to CA.</li>
    <li> Love these. So cute for nail art designs or a phone case. I will be purchasing again when these run out!</li>
    <li> Pretty but not as full as picture</li>
    <li> Item did take over a month for me to finally receive it. I thought the pearls would be a little bigger and the colors brighter .. just like it shows in the picture.</li>
    <li> cute. not all perls the same size. as pictured and they sit on my nails well so they do their job.</li>
    <li> I love the pearls they look great but when I received the package in the mail all the colors were mixed up together and it was a pain in the butt other than that I loved them</li>
    <li> Adorable little pearls. Arrived sooner than expected!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed all the different color of the nail art half round pearls beads rhine stone and the wheel</li>
    <li> The product is so good and the price to. Deliver the product was on time and good to. I will keep buying items with you guys. I will recommend this product to my friends and family. Thanks.</li>
    <li> the colors in the pic are not the same as what I got in the mail I did not like this</li>
    <li> These rhinestones are beautiful.  These are so easy to apply.  Fine for any age. These are so many colors to chose from.</li>
    <li> As the Subject states &amp;#34; False Advertising.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wheel looks a lot fuller than what you actually get and the colors are a lot cuter than what you actually get in the picture.  Also I got some random red beads (only two).  I did not expect to get any yellow, because from what I saw on the thumbnail there were no yellows and only cute pastel colors.  This sicks big time.</li>
    <li> I received a 1.5mm pearl wheel that was the same as another pearl wheel that I ordered with completely different colors in it. I had read in the description before I bought them they were supposed to be 2mm. Now the description has changed. The colors I got were fuchsia, blue, orange/yellow, gray, lt. blue, hot pink, white, red, lt. yellow, lt. purple, black, and pale pink. This is the same exact wheel I ordered on another post, both sold by Sodio. Please beware and take note from this review. Both wheels with the same exact items and them came in the same shipping envelope, but I ordered &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; things. How can you not realize what you are doing, or you know, and are looking to scam. A complaint will be filed. Remember and beware of the name Sodio.</li>
    <li> They could be bigger and more vibrant, but you get what you pay for. I use them in my nail art on clients</li>
    <li> These round pearl are very pretty and vibrant in color, but if you don&#x27;t protect the pearls with a clear coat of paint the color will easily erase after washing your hands a few times. I like the product and i will still continue to buy more nonetheless. Happy shopping ;)</li>
    <li> The pearls are very cute and have a wonderful color. They are big enough to get noticed but not so big that they will bother somebody while they are at work. They also arrived ten days before the expected delivery date I will definitely be ordering these again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This Picture is way nicer and fuller then what you get. I was very disappointed when I opened my package.</li>
    <li> These are great just like the picture.  But Ebay has them cheeper for a lot more pieces. Will purchase from Ebay in the future</li>
    <li> Love this you have Rhinestones for those little extras for nails.  Nice and easy to use makes it fun when going out.</li>
    <li> There pearl rhinestone are great size for decorating nails, &amp; even better a great price. On the down side I didn&#x27;t get the colors shown on the image. I ordered them for the different shades of pink, &amp; actually just got one slot of pink pearls. Also they do take 5 weeks to arrive.</li>
    <li> Cheap and cute. Arrived fairly quick, coming from overseas.</li>
    <li> These are soooo cute! And they&#x27;re tiny, which I love because I dont like anything big and bulky on my nails. They work great and were cheap, good deal</li>
    <li> These are great for added bling for my cards and scrapbook pages. The heavy tweezers I ordered making picking them up really easy.</li>
    <li> They are a lot smaller than I expected them to be. I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s gonna take me a few try&#x27;s to get use to them cause they are so small. But very cute cute. Gave only 4 stars cause of the size.</li>
    <li> I would give them 5 stars if what I got was pictured. I would have bought them the colors that I got sent but it&#x27;s not what I was expecting and not what I payed for. There pretty and very tiny. There&#x27;s probably about 500. I would say 2mm which is perfect for nails or phone cases.</li>
    <li> the beads are fantastic. my girlfriend loves them and now she has beautiful nails and beads all over the house.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t expect quite this tiny but all is good.  Haven&#x27;t used them yet and I&#x27;ll find out how happy I am when I try to pick them up and place on the nail.</li>
    <li> The pearls aren&#x27;t perfectly round and have blobs of the side&lt;br /&gt;They r microscopic&lt;br /&gt;The whole container is a half-dollar size&lt;br /&gt;There are less than 30 pearls per section</li>
    <li> Colors are brighter than shown but its also hard to see colors with the pics online.  I have lots of ideas on how to use them.</li>
    <li> This product Came 90% empty. It only had a few beads stuck to the top of the container. Not happy!</li>
    <li> So cute! The pastel colors are great. They give a little extra to your nail art, and the price can&#x27;t be beat! I get lots of compliments on my nails when I use these.</li>
    <li> They are pretty pastel colors, smaller than what the picture shows, but they are perfect for nails &amp; other things.</li>
    <li> Nice color variety and look super cute on my nails.</li>
    <li> i8 wear these all the time they are seriously my new favorite nail decals !!!! they go with everything and are the perfect colors</li>
    <li> Great product for nail decorating. So fun to use and nails look beautiful! I recommend this product to those who like to have fun with their nails.</li>
    <li> they are what I was expecting, however, there weren&#x27;t very many of some of the colors, while some colors were packed full. They are uniform in size and true to the colors shown.</li>
    <li> Not the same colors. I got a light pink, blue, purple and white. They&#x27;re also a lot smaller than I expected</li>
    <li> the colors were all mix ..not really cute</li>
    <li> There seems to be several in the picture but there&#x27;s about half or a bit less when you receive them.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this item especially the colors. There&#x27;s a big variety and you can color coordinate with your nail polish!</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re nice... but when i out them on individually i couldnt tell they had a color....</li>
    <li> These look full, you would think they would be full, but they were almost empty, they are beautiful, exactly what i wanted, but not many of them</li>
    <li> The color of the pearls are closer to the ones shown outside of the wheel. However, they are very nice about the size of smaller rhinestones. I am wearing these right now and the only think I noticed is after about a week the color wears off. I don&#x27;t know if is the gel coat that caused the fading or the natural wearing. They still look nice and for the price it is hard to beat this unique look.</li>
    <li> i love these...they are fun to use and make any nail design pop...love love love these! i recommend this to all nail enthuseast!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because it came a very long way, and yet the packaging was still very intact and in excellent shape!  I received it within a logical amount of time...actually faster then I thought I would.  The quality of the merchandise looks to be good, ( I haven&#x27;t used it yet) and I would recommend this to anyone that asked!  The little seeds/pearls are very tiny..you would have to be careful around children.  But great for any kind of art project besides using them for nails!</li>
    <li> These are also a great value to use on your nail work</li>
    <li> Best thing i bought well worth the money! i would recommend this  any one that loves to decorate with anything!</li>
    <li> Loved Loved Loved this product</li>
    <li> The package is smaller than I thought, but then again they are nail designs so I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting. I like them and they are great for decorating. The complaint that I have is that they are nowhere near the color in the picture. They definitely are not pastel colors. I got  dark pink, red, pearl white, light peach, ivory and a dark blue.</li>
    <li> the reason i bought these was because i fell in love with the colors in the picture. These are the colors i received: DARK blue, MAGENTA, RED, white, off white, and peach. No orange, no aqua blue, not light pink. WTF not ordeding from them again</li>
    <li> I do like the colors of the beads but I am very disappointed with the scarce amount of them. Also when I tried to open them to use, there was so much static that the beads went flying out of the container. I had to throw them away and now have to wait for another shipment of different beads :(</li>
    <li> Different colours and very few of them.</li>
    <li> love them! super cute</li>
    <li> The beads were beautiful but the container had a HUGE CRACK on it. I would have given 5/5 if it did not come in such a way.</li>
    <li> Am building my nail art supplies and crazy cart has a lot of inexpensive products the are of good quality. They came before delivery date and are as pictured and described by seller</li>
    <li> Too small... Will not buy again</li>
    <li> They are very cute but as they packed them some colors got in other compartments. thats all that was wrong with this item for me.</li>
    <li> I love that it comes with a lot of little pearls! They&#x27;re cute and the right size for nail art. The only thing I didn&#x27;t expect was how much static there is (which makes sense, as it&#x27;s plastic pearls in a plastic container).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice? Cover the wheel as you turn it, least the pearls go flying. Other than that, the product was a good buy.</li>
    <li> Really small, look nice</li>
    <li> I love pearls and rhinestones and stuff for nail art and for the super cheap price I couldn&#x27;t pass these up. They came sooner than expected. It still took about 3 weeks but as they came from China that is not surprising. I had no issue with packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are 2mm half sphere pearls. There are not nearly as many in my package as there are in the photo. That is where they lost 1 star. For the price I still fell like I got a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have photos up on my blog soon. Check that out at&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannahsnails11.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> The pearls were not pastel colors as the picture shows, but rather bright, bold colors.  I will still use them, but am disappointed that what was ordered is not what arrived.</li>
    <li> Thank you for sending on time and I am so very glad that it was what I needed it made it easy for me</li>
    <li> They was not what i expected they look so small and not like pearls. They looked like beads. This was a waste of my money. GOODLUCK IF YOU ORDER THEM THEY ARE NOT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE AT ALL!!</li>
    <li> The container itself is as small as my palm &amp; very few pearls are in the container i&#x27;m certain there isn&#x27;t 1200!&lt;br /&gt;This picture doesn&#x27;t look like the product i recived</li>
    <li> this item is great it has all the beads and stones. It was the smallest package and they look great</li>
    <li> thanks to every one who left a comment i was about to order them cause i love the color but since i read all this I&#x27;m out of d idea ..</li>
    <li> Beautiful, organized, and exactly what I expected! I will buy again!</li>
    <li> i really like them good size. i still havent use them but cant wait to try them on they are too cute.</li>
    <li> I enjoy nail art and bought these beads on a whim. Although they took a while to arrive from Asia (I believe they came from Hong Kong), the product is as described and easy to use.  I recommend applying them with gel super glue to your gel nail polish BEFORE curing then applying the top coat for added strength.</li>
    <li> I used these for my nails. Within three days the pearlescent coloring on top totally wore off and now the pearls look like plastic dots. These are also very very tiny and many are stuck together. The container they come in is nice, but that&#x27;s the only positive thing I can say about these.</li>
    <li> The wheel I received wasn&#x27;t quite as full as the picture portrays, but I definitely received more than my money&#x27;s worth, which was my biggest concern.</li>
    <li> I love them, perfect size for nails and toe art....</li>
    <li> i was very disapponted when i recived the package it look as if i only had 25 pearls of each color and the beads are very very small like little tiny ants! not enough to cover a case or your nail u would run out just by ONE use</li>
    <li> the price is great and the size was perfect for me. if your putting them on natural nails they will look great.</li>
    <li> The took a bit to get here, but once they did, I was in heaven. They are so pretty!</li>
    <li> So happy to get them they look great</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these and it came a lot faster than I had expected.  The shipping estimated about a month to process but it came in about a week.  They were packaged nicely and they look almost exactly like they do in the picture.  It seems that there might be less in the actual container than shown in the picture, but you get what you pay for.  A good product for the price and just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> These are really nothing special.  they don&#x27;t look that good on ur nails, I like the reg rhinestones better.  still cute.</li>
    <li> Soft colors, but nice</li>
