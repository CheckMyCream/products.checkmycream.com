<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever used. It completely dissolves into your skin leaving them very soft as if you just washed your hands with moisturizing hand soap. My hands have always gotten extremely dry and cracked in the winter but I would never use lotion because they always leave your hands all greasy, even the ones that claim they don&#x27;t. I just tried the O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Working Hands and it leaves your hands waxy for hours. Corn Huskers dissolves completely in maybe a minute. Only slight downside is that it smells kinda strongly of a lotion/cleaner type smell, but no big deal based on how well it works.</li>
    <li> So glad to have found this product on Amazon.  I could not find it in any of the stores in our area and my husband loves this stuff!! He&#x27;s a happy hubby now!</li>
    <li> this is one of the best products for those with dry skin issues. it&#x27;s not oily and coats your skin and makes the skin feel softer. I get dry skin around the cuticles and nails and this helps alleviate the problem. I&#x27;ve been using this for years, when I was wrenching in the auto trades this helped prevent calluses for me. I like the smell of the product too.</li>
    <li> I have not used or seen this product since I was a kid, my father did construction work and my mom used to buy it for his rough hands. It still smells the same and it is great on your feet once out of the bath</li>
    <li> Great product, no oil. Dries quick. Results!</li>
    <li> I work in healthcare and wash my hands a lot. A LOT a lot. My hands turning dry and crackly between soap and hand sanitizer. Winter making it worse. I bought this based on the other reviews. It is a bit viscous, taking a few seconds to dry. A little goes a really long way. While I really prefer things that are odorless, the faint smell (which goes away when dry) is worth it because it saves my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came in a smaller bottle to fit in my pocket but this fits fine on my desk. Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> This is a great product - I have eczema on my hands and feet - this products seems to help - the lotion is not greasy - it&#x27;s more of a gel formulation - it absorbs quickly and completely right into the skin - and it doesn&#x27;t burn either like some other lotions do which have so much alcohol in them - I used to buy this at Walgreens, but they quit carrying it, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any stores locally anymore, so Thank God I found it here on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dry hands for awhile now. Not just a little dry and uncomfortable, but burning and cracking dry. I&#x27;ve tried so many creams and lotions and not one did what I needed: ease the pain and not leave so much oil on the surface of the skin. Often, the creams I have tried actually were painful and exacerbated the discomfort when I applied them. Cornhuskers works! At times when I do want to apply another lotion that has a bit of oil in it but can&#x27;t because it would be too painful, I&#x27;ll apply Cornhuskers first to allow my hands to heal a bit, and THEN put on the other lotion. It&#x27;s a wonderful first step in the healing process. As an aside, it seems lately that more and more hand creams are using glycerin as well as some oils as a sort of dual moisturizer. Before these hand creams came on the market, I&#x27;d frequently mix a little bit of oil based moisturizer into the cornhuskers to get the benefits of both. Quick absorbtion of the cornhuskers and the longer lasting effectiveness of the oil.</li>
    <li> yes this DOES work great for hands, legs and anywhere else i&#x27;ve tried it.  but seriously, DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR, and SHOP AROUND.  checking just a minute ago, i saw that the prices on amazon (including delivery within the continental USA) range from around $26 to $43.50.  i bought the same sized bottle of this product from the world&#x27;s largest retailer TODAY for $2.97 plus tax!!!!  so, unless you LIKE to pay almost 1500% too much, shop around!</li>
    <li> I have consistently dry hands, with painful patches of extremely dry skin that never heal. Until now the only product that made any difference whatsoever was Bag Balm, which provided temporarily relief but was extremely greasy and inconvenient.     After reading reviews for Corn Huskers Lotion I decided to try it. It absorbs into the skin completely in under a minute. It truly disappears, there is no greasy feel or film or absolutely any residue left on the skin. When I saw how quickly it absorbed I was incredibly skeptical that it could possibly cure my dry skin. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, applying it a few times a day. After 3-4 days my skin was truly transformed. It is so much different than any results I have ever seen before. Other creams and lotions soothe the dryness and irritation, but Corn Huskers did so much more, it actually changed the way my skin behaves. I can skip lotion for a day without waking up to ugly and painful dry hands the next morning. CORN HUSKERS DOES NOT WORK IMMEDIATELY.  If you apply it once and don&#x27;t see a difference, do not stop using the product. Give it a few days and you will see a huge difference in your skin.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever. My hands were dry and cracked and bleeding from sorting mail and winter wind so I bought this since I couldn&#x27;t at the moment find udder balm. I instead will stick with this forever. Why? 1.) It&#x27;s cheap. I got my bottle for like $3 and you don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot. 2.) Absorbs FAST. Most lotions I&#x27;ve used sit on the skin and doesn&#x27;t absorb well so you sit around forever waiting for it to dry. And then it dries gummy anyway. 3.) My hands cleared up in 3 days. Dead serious. To be fair I was applying it pretty obsessively but still... I would like to point out that I tried layering. As it I applied one layer and after it dried applied another. I don&#x27;t know about other people, but it did dry gummy when I put a second layer on. And I noticed it says it has a fragrance, I didn&#x27;t notice it especially after it absorbed. If I had to describe it, I would say very very lightly lemon scented. And that&#x27;s only if you put it up to your face. Try to find it around your house though since shipping will be not worth it. But definitely try this. I&#x27;ve never found better.</li>
    <li> My dry hands are the worst.  Every winter it&#x27;s the same thing.  My hands would get so dry that the skin would constantly crack and my hands would be bleeding every day.  It&#x27;s awful, but there was nothing that I could do to stop it.  Every lotion I tried never helped, even some of the really good brands that supposedly worked wonders.  They provided temporary relief from the pain, but they never did anything to actually fix the problem, no matter how many times I applied it.  I even used aloe for a while, still no help.    A few days ago I was in the store looking for yet another lotion to help me with the problem, when I spotted Corn Huskers Lotion.  It said it was heavy duty hand treatment and I thought to myself \\&quot;yeah, well, you haven&#x27;t met my hands yet.\\&quot;  I decided to try it out because it was cheap, so I picked it up and bought it.     That was one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve ever made.  After just one day, ONE DAY of applying it, my hands felt good!  For the first time in months they didn&#x27;t hurt and they weren&#x27;t bleeding. I&#x27;ve been using it for five days now, and my hands are almost completely healed.  I&#x27;m shocked and amazed by this product.  It&#x27;s wonderful!  I definitely think that anyone with severely dry skin should give it a try.  You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Wow!! Although this product is FANTASTIC, $19.99? Really? I&#x27;ve paid $3 to $4 in the store. Why such a price hike? C&#x27;mon... Not cool...</li>
    <li> Corn Huskers lotion is one of the finest skin lotions on the market, or at least it was until it was recently discontinued.  Since it is no longer commercially available promoting it seems like a waste of time and energy.    I am disappointed that it has been discontinued and haven&#x27;t found a reasonable substitute.</li>
    <li> Te ability to get this product via Amazon is why I like Amazon. None of the nearby pharmacies had it. Have used this stuff and only this for decades because it just plain works and contains no micro this or nano that. Plus a tiny amount is all you need. This bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have a had a problem of having severely dry hands, for as long as I can remember, and I am 42 years old. I have tried over the counter and prescription creams and lotions.  These usually leave my hands oily for a long time after.  I have even tried the creams that recommend using cotton gloves at night.  My dad has the same problems and he gave me of some of the Corn Huskers Lotion and I was hooked on it, ever since.     This lotion does not leave a oily film on my hands and has a pleasant fragrance, and brings relief almost immediately and is the best lotion that can keep my hands soft.    Working in the medical field and washing my hands almost constantly, really can dry them out fast. A quick application of this and within a few moments, the only thing that remains on my hand is the nice fragrance.    Hope this help you... because it helps me!</li>
    <li> Great, old-time hand moisturizer.  Does a good job with no sticky or slimy mess on your hands after use.  Will heal up cracked knuckles in a few uses.  Unscented, though it does have a slight smell that is just the ingredients smelling like they do.</li>
    <li> I use this on  my dry and cracking hands.  It has helped repair my hands.  It can be hard to find.</li>
    <li> been usin this stuff for years. works great if ya know what i mean lol. local groc doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore &amp; being so rural, had to resort to amazon so even tho it&#x27;s $2 shipping for a $3 item, worth it in the Long run!</li>
    <li> i bought this at WM based on reviews here. paid a little over $3 at WM so it wasnt a big waste. the lotion is remarkably non greasy and makes rough hands soft. i wish i had read about how strong its odor is! it smells like a really clean soap which wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt so pungent. i had to wash it off. i wish they made a fragrance free version.  its first two ingredients are water and glycerine so maybe a home remedy is just as good. if you like the smell i think youll be amazed at how well it works without making your hands slippery like other lotions do.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews here on Amazon, I actually went ahead and purchased a bottle....on eBay. (sorry Amazon...but when it&#x27;s not offered for Prime...I go elsewhere!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is seriously amazing. I&#x27;m a stay-at-home-mom and wash my hands constantly. Throw in dishes, scrubbing bathrooms, doing laundry and well...my hands become dry and cracked quickly. After 3 days of using this my hands are 100% better. What I like best is that it lasts through a couple of hand washings. Almost like the lotion leaves a protective coating. I also really like that it&#x27;s not greasy, soaks in really fast and smells pretty darn good. I&#x27;ve also started putting it on my horribly calloused feet, and wow! Total difference! I&#x27;m sold on Corn Huskers Lotion. Now, if Amazon would just start selling it via Prime or Subscribe &amp; Save!!!</li>
    <li> I got a bad sun and wind burn on my face &amp; neck  a couple years ago. Tried SEVERAL expensive lotions ( none worked) I remembered my Mom used Corn Huskers Lotion, So I gave it a try . To my pleasant surprise it worked!! This is the ONLY lotion I use on my face and neck . It works so well on the eye area to.It does not leave an oily residue, it soaks into the skin, leaving a velvet feeling . I am 54 and people ask me all the time what&#x27;s my secret, saying I look late 30&#x27;s.I tell them I use Corn Huskers Lotion.I have had a hard time finding it in stores lately. I went into (3) stores last week, none to be found.So I guess the secret lives on.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff since 1995. It&#x27;s nice to have an oil free lotion to use on my face. Great for wind burn too.</li>
    <li> gross baby powder smell</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. Smells like a diaper but great finish.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Been around since I was a kid. My parents always had it in the house</li>
    <li> I am not one to use hand creams as I fear for the many chemicals in an average cream, but I use this every winter to prevent sores on my hands and it is doing the job.</li>
    <li> I work in the medical field...lots of hand washing and dry cracked hands.  This is the best stuff that I&#x27;ve found---it keeps your hands dry with literally no oiliness...awesome.  Don&#x27;t waste your time with anything else, this stuff is the best!</li>
    <li> I cannot in all honesty say that this product is very effective, the results were disappointing and I shall not be purchasing anymore,</li>
    <li> Good for pre-shaving and general moisturizer.  Doesn&#x27;t leave oily mess.</li>
    <li> Feels great on your hands, but smells like Grandma.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is a excellent non greasy lotion. Excellent on rough elbows, feet and hands with daily use.</li>
    <li> Since moving to New Mexico I have been fighting the battle of cracked heels and dry hands.  In fact my heels got so bad that they shredded a hole through the sheets on our bed.  I was horrified and disbelieving.  Even worse the pain at some of the places my feet had cracked was almost unbearable.  I had tried many different things to fix this... Burt&#x27;s Bees Coconut foot Cream, Johnson&#x27;s Baby Lotion,  Eucerin, etc... Nothing seemed to really help.  I had even used a Pedi egg to try to smooth off the jagged edges.  Then my husband went to the local mom and pop pharmacist and asked what he would recommend.  When he came home with a bottle of Corn Huskers lotion, I laughed at him.  My dad had used this for years and I thought of it as geezer grease.  Well this geezer grease worked like nothing else.  With in one day my heels had visually improved.  After three days of using the pedi egg and putting Corn Huskers Lotion on three times a day my heels are better than they have been in years.  I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it if I hadn&#x27;t experienced it myself.  Now I am racking my brain to remember all the other stuff my dad trusted to use, should have remembered what a wise man he was.</li>
    <li> have been using this product for 66 years. Keep it handy for dry feet in the winter/ hope it stays on the market for another 66 years</li>
    <li> My hands need it. I liked the value and the quality was good. If you try it you will like it. I did and will order again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this product keeps getting 5 star ratings. It&#x27;s one of the worst products out there right now.    Pros:  -absorbs quickly/non-greasy  This is the only pro I could find in this product. One thing this does much better than other moisturizers is absorb into your skin incredibly fast leaving them moisturized for the time being. However....    Cons:    -Bad scent  One of the worst scents I&#x27;ve found in a hand lotion. It smells a lot like baby powder.    -Short lasting  The moisturizing effect doesn&#x27;t last long at all. Within 30-40 minutes, your hands will already be dried out again.    -Worsening Effect  This is my biggest compliant. When your hands do dry out, they&#x27;ll actually dry out WORSE than they were when you put it on. It was common for hand lotions to do this.....back in the 1970s. Today, this is unacceptable.    All in all, this is one of the WORST hand lotions of all time. What I can recommend instead is \\&quot;Eucerin Intensive Repair Extra-Enriched Hand Crème\\&quot;. It&#x27;s long lasting, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel on your hands. It is, in fact, the BEST hand lotion I&#x27;ve used yet.

    <li> I have two children in diapers so I&#x27;m constantly having to wash my hands and this stuff keeps my hands from cracking. Will order again</li>
    <li> I was recommended to get this for my dry skin.  The ingredients were not listed and only after it arrived was I able to see the ingredients - which includes methylparaben.  Another lotion I will not use because of the paraben content.  Wish they would make it without parabens as I&#x27;d love to see if it would help my skin.</li>
    <li> Not much else to say here.  Goes on quickly, not much rubbing in, leaves no greasy residue, and you can feel and see the difference in your skin immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winter weather, or spending much time in air conditioned environments really messes up my skin.  This is the best solution I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
    <li> Good bye chapped Lips. I happen to be perusing the shelves at Rite Aid looking for something else and came across this generic looking product called &amp;#34;Corn Huskers Lotion&amp;#34;. It said oil free, I read the ingredients and thought to myself another lotion with glycerin it sounds good but it won&#x27;t work. Well I bought it anyway just to see not expecting much.  I made sure to use it a couple day and see what happens. Day one I noticed a difference. For those with chapped lips issues this product will coat and protect your lips unlike the chap stick like products that one has to continually reapply. First gently wash and exfoliate your lips, pat dry and apply Corn Huskers Lotion to your lips and let dry. You may if you like then apply chap stick after the corn huskers lotion has dried. Finished. I recommend apply before bed time and in the morning. Besides being wonderful for chapped lips and hand its also good for feet and as part of your personal beauty regimen.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the label and the affordable price this stuff works.</li>
    <li> I was glad to be able to order Corn Huskers online, since it is not sold in stores in my area. I was told they quit making it.</li>
    <li> What a great product!  So much better than the high dollar lotions I&#x27;ve wasted money on all these years.  I love that it&#x27;s not greasy and I don&#x27;t have to stain my sheets after using it.  Likes others have said, give it a few days and you&#x27;ll be happy with the results.  I know the buzz on the internet is that it has been discontinued.  I contacted Johnson and Johnson and they said that as of March 11, 2011, it is available at CVS, Kroger, and Walmart, but will be available elsewhere and online soon.  Good news!</li>
    <li> Love this had cream especially because it is not greasy and kept my hands soft all winter.</li>
    <li> Used this for years. Works best for dry skin. No longer can get it locally, so was afraid it had been discontinued. Hope this never happens.</li>
    <li> the only lotion my hubby says works on his injured feet.</li>
    <li> This lotion is useless. I have very dry skin. My hands crack and bleed in the winter dry and cold weather. My father used to use this when I was a kid, so I bought it. Within 15 minutes of applying, it seems as though I have not used any lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is basically junk.</li>
    <li> I was not too impressed. does not seem to work any better then hand lotion in the store. In fact it seemed worse to me.</li>
    <li> I Love Corn Huskers Lotion!!! My hands were very dry due to the cold weather and having my hands in water. My thumbs had cracking skin that was very painful. My hands absorbed the lotion without feeling greasy. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This lotion is not oily at all and it does soften and smooth, the reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t last all that long, you have to resue it often.</li>
    <li> During this awful winter my feet got so dry that they started to crack under the toes (ouch!). I tried several different foot lotions, but none of them really seemed to work. Then I remembered something my Dad used to have me use when I was a kid and went in search of it online. I was so excited to find Corn Huskers Lotion was still available. It seems expensive, but it works so well!  I have been putting about a nickel sized amount on each foot after my shower and my feet are all better. I can wear sandals again!  ...when the snow melts.</li>
    <li> If you have dry or rough skin, this is the product for you. Simply apply to the problem area, and before you know it, no more dry or rough skin. This is an old product, tried and true. Forget the new expensive creams and go with this. It works.</li>
    <li> Used on a regular basis, this will heal and prevent bar-rot on the hands.  Once fully cured, you can even go several weeks without using the stuff.  Amazing.</li>
    <li> Amazing moisturizer.  Takes a little while to get used to the smell, but best hand moisturizer for the money. Plus, not greasy at all.  You can use it and go straight into a workout and have no problem holding on to the weights.</li>
    <li> Good Stuff and good price compared to buying it locally.</li>
    <li> Each kind of lotion has it&#x27;s specific uses, and this one works well when you need that extra moisture in your hands but you must not get the items you are handling greasy.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for those who work outdoors.  No perfumes or scents.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I love and work in a dry climate and, add a seamstress, my hands are always getting chapped and this turned my skin back to moisturized! Not painful, crackled or red anymore!</li>
    <li> Helps a lot with my dry, flaky skin on my legs and feet ... feels a little sticky/gummy at first - this passes quickly ... will update if it improves from use over time ...</li>
    <li> My hands are very sensitive to certain soaps and sanitizers, so much so that a few hand washings will dry my hands out to the point the skin cracks and my hands bleed.  Combine that with the dry winter months and I need some heavy duty skin care.  I hate oily hand lotions and I never really found the relief I needed through their use.  My grandmother had suggested Corn Huskers to my father, his hands dry out coming in contact with certain chemicals in his line of work.  I&#x27;d seen the Corn Huskers in the medicine cabinet for quite some time but didn&#x27;t really think of using it.  Well, a small confession, I always thought it looked like snot in a bottle.  Gross, maybe, but wait until you see it if you don&#x27;t believe me.  Anyway, once I got over that, my review can be summed up with wow!!  My hands look and feel better within about an hour of using this stuff.  When my hands get really bad I apply it three times over a period of half an hour and let it soak into my hands.  Two days of that and my hands are like new.  Both my father and I only wish we&#x27;d known about this sooner.  The smell is about the only &#x27;meh&#x27; to this product.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t dislike the smell, its fine, just don&#x27;t expect pomegranate passionfruit.  Sometimes I can get it locally for cheaper than online, sometimes not.  I can only hope Johnson &amp; Johnson never decide to discontinue it.</li>
    <li> This product is the greatist thing for relieving very chaped dry hands. For thoe that have dry cracked skin on your hands, this is for you!!!</li>
    <li> I wash my hands a lot and this works great and dries fast!</li>
    <li> Good lotion, non greasy</li>
    <li> Great product and service. Product arrived as advertised.</li>
    <li> I tried this out assuming it wouldn&#x27;t work too well because so many &#x27;best product ever&#x27; things have been disappointing. But it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d been dealing with some troublesome dry patches that weren&#x27;t responding to any of the lotions I have. And I didn&#x27;t feel like using some kind of greasy ointment or hard-to-apply balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fixed my problem in about 5 days with only an evening application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells kind of clinical and the texture is very weird as you apply it and it is sticky as it dries. But once it&#x27;s dry, your hands feel normal and the smell is diminished, though not gone. The quality of my skin has improved tremendously. I&#x27;m a convert.</li>
    <li> Very protective for people who work with their hands.  My husband and my friend&#x27;s husband use it every day before they go to construction jobs.  Great on hands &amp; feel in cold weather to protect, even if you are just going out of the house.  Light, pleasant, almost powdery scent.</li>
    <li> Great for cracked skin on hands. But definitely go buy at Walmart $2.98. Much cheaper, same brand and size product.</li>
    <li> On of the best products I have ever used!</li>
    <li> OK, so there are a ton of positive reviews for this lotion, so there&#x27;s probably nothing new I can say.  But, although the scent is a little strong (jokingly &amp;#34;smells like grandmas&amp;#34;) and the label isn&#x27;t eye catching unless you&#x27;re a Green Bay Packer&#x27;s fan, this stuff rubs in, heals dry skin, and doesn&#x27;t take 15 minutes to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During application, you can tell it&#x27;s different.  It feels more like a fine grained watery clay than oily, tacky lotion.  It only takes about 15-20 seconds of rubbing in for your hands to fee normal again too.  Yes, it has a noticeable odor, but you quickly get used to it after 3 or 4 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 5 stars, even though it doesn&#x27;t remain on you hands after washing with soap/water, so you&#x27;ll have to re-apply if you have cracked and bleeding knuckles like I get every winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend buying a bottle or two and spreading the word.</li>
    <li> I work at a movie theater and I wash my hands often throughout the day. One evening, I told my grandmother that my hands felt dry from work and she told me I could take this hand lotion with me. Corn Husker&#x27;s Hand Lotion is spectacular; It leaves my hands feeling soft and moisturized. If you have dry hands, there is nothing better out there.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Quickly Absorbs&lt;br /&gt;-Keeps you moisturized way longer than regular lotion&lt;br /&gt;-Gets deep into cracks and bring instant relief -- no joke, this stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Smells like a baby product&lt;br /&gt;Sticky and greasy for the first minute or so.</li>
    <li> I had split fingertips from working in a chemical plant, where I wore rubber gloves for 10 hours a day. My hands were very dried out as well. This product, along with liquid band-aid, worked very well to relieve these problems.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a great moisturizer.  It works well with sunburn and mat burn.  I also like to rub it in before working on the car to protect from gas and grease.</li>
    <li> very good for my extremly dry skin</li>
    <li> I purchased this after seeing recommendations for it in different forums on the internet. I&#x27;ve never heard of it before! We recently moved and my husband and I did most of the physical work ourselves. I should have worn work gloves the whole time because it really beat up my hands to the point that they were throbbing and aching at night from the splits and cracks. It&#x27;s primarily glycerin so it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; like you would typically think of a hand lotion, but it sure did help my hands to heal up quickly. I&#x27;m ordering another bottle just so I have it on hand during the gardening season because I tend to forget my gloves then too!!</li>
    <li> Helped my dry feet with first application and wearing socks to bed.  Not greasy or oily feeling .Will purchase again</li>
    <li> My hands get pretty beat up from golf and the gym. Every lotion I&#x27;ve tried seems to wash right off the first time I wash my hands after applying. This seems to really penetrate, even if I wash my hands.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not this product is made by Johnson and Johnson.  It does state it on the side of the bottle, when you receive it, I was surprised myself.  It has a semi present odor when opening the bottle, but upon rubbing it on it does smell a lot better, and now that you know it made by Johnson and Johnson you will get a very small hint of a baby lotion smell, I think.  It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;hand sanitizer gel&amp;#34; consistency, with a odd milky color.  It rubs on watery but absorbs in quickly.  It does leave your hands leaving silky and feeling better and would recommend this product for routine care for chronic dry hard working hands.</li>
    <li> I work as a dog groomer so my hands are wet all the time for about 10 or 15 minute increments. It&#x27;s really taken a toll on my hands, I have cracked dry flakey skin that is very painful and uncomfortable. Recently it started to hinder my work abilities so I had to find a cure. I found Corn Huskers at a major retailer for about $2. It&#x27;s is great because it completely hydrates my skin after one use but it keeps my skin oil free so my tools aren&#x27;t slipping out of my hands. I use it before, during, and after work.</li>
    <li> It works very well to hydrate hands.  I just did not like the smell very much.  Other than that it does a good job!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I find that it absorbs well and leaves my skin feeling silky.  I&#x27;m rating this product 4 stars because I believe the scent will really bother some folks.  If scent isn&#x27;t an issue for you... I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is simply the best hand lotion for dry chapped hands.  Not much more to say than that.  Just buy it.</li>
    <li> Ordered this based on other reviews, wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  Due to the type of work he does, my poor husband&#x27;s hands are usually so dried out that his skin feel like sandpaper and often cracks open.  We have tried multiple moisturizing products and I have to say...so far, nothing has worked as well as this has!  We will be keeping this on hand from now on!</li>
    <li> Corn Huskers worth a try it  is a very good product for dry hands. It helps too keep skin soft and protected.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s non-oily, so ther is no ichy residue left over after I apply it. Had I discovered this 20 years ago, I may not have the stretchmarks from weight lifting. Too bad it&#x27;s not available in local stored anymore. The price I paid on amzon.com was a real value!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff purely because it is non-greasy and yet still works. Usually the greasier and oilier a lotion feels, the more I feel like it &amp;#34;works&amp;#34;. But this lotion is fantastic for dry hands and feet.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an oil-free hand lotion and a colleague recommended this.  I had never heard of it before but with my dry and cracked hands becoming a problem, I tried this an really liked it.  It absorbs very quickly and does the trick for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion on my hands every night before I go to bed and it seems to have made a difference in the overall moisture of my hands. I have a job that dries my hands out pretty badly and in the winter it is extra bad, so I use a little of this lotion every night and it seems to keep the dryness level to a minimum through the whole winter.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat Corn Huskers Lotion. Go to Walmart and get it at half the price.</li>
    <li> We ordered it because of loss of fingerprints, and it seems to be working nicely.</li>
    <li> If you are having a problem with dry hands, I would recommend trying this hand lotion.  Only a few drops bring relief,  wonderful for dry elbows and heels.</li>
    <li> Like most oil free lotions of this type, this does not absorb quickly, but it does a good job and has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Old formula, this product is average at best these days, there is better stuff on the market for less money!</li>
    <li> This lotion was around decades ago and my relatives used it on their hands as they were rough and chapped from working on the farm. Bought this lotion for my grandson who was an outside electrician his hands and knees were constantly calloused rough and hard. After a few days of using this, his skin is much better. this lotion was around decades ago and my relatives used it on your hand as they were resting chat from working on the farm. What&#x27;s the question for my grandson he wasn&#x27;t out 5 electrician is anthony&#x27;s were constantly cala stress and hard. After a few days of using this, his skin is much better.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! its not it works better than any aloe product I have ever tried! and easily rubs into my skin quickly there are no strong and lingering smells that some other products have.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great as it&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs into your skin, &amp; has a pleasant scent that&#x27;s not overbearing or medicinal smelling. It&#x27;s good with helping to restore rough hands or prevent hands from cracking as badly. My father and grandfather used this when I was a kid. Cold winters, chopping wood, and construction work can tear up your hands! I use it today though not out working in the cold...</li>
    <li> I grew up with Corn Huskers always in the house. My dad was a residential painter. His hands would become dry and cracked from the paint and cleaning materials. The skin on his palms are still dry from decades of painting. He still uses Corn Huskers. His family used it back when they had a working farm. Now I use it with my family. When a product works, people use it for generations. I just wish I could find it in the stores. This order is for my dad. He is loosing his vision and cant get to the store often. Since he cant find it in the stores, I get it for him.</li>
    <li> I love the subtle scent and it works very well, not oily at all. It leaves my skin is soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this today at Walmart for $2, he saw it and remembered how he used it when he was younger. I have a toddler and am constantly washing my hands. I have the worst dry skin/cracking knuckles so I decided to give it a try and IT WORKS!! The cream goes on easy, dries fast and it&#x27;s not oily one bit. This is better than all creams I have tried and I&#x27;ve tried them all. Seriously, give it a try for $2 what do you have to lose?</li>
    <li> I remember my father using this product on his overworked hands. The winter here has been rough and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I am very pleased with the ease of the transaction and the product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Corn Huskers Lotion is some good stuff.  Didn&#x27;t get it from Amazon but from a national chain drugstore.  This is by far the best lotion that I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It does feel tacky when put on but it goes away fast, especially if you rub it in well.  Theres also a slight smell to it but does not smell that bad.  I wash my hands frequently in a day and this stuff really lasts and lasts.</li>
    <li> This lotion works 100%, My hands looked and felt completely different after using it for a couple of days only! It is not oily at all and smells very good...Finally a product that works!</li>
    <li> When I first heard about this, I thought it&#x27;s a traditional remedy.  The bottle looks like it and it&#x27;s hard to find.  But as you see from the ingredients, it doesn&#x27;t look that traditional, and it is distributed by Johnson and Johnson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to put moisturizer all over my body after shower.  Heavy moisturizing body wash only will do but that will lead to outbreaks sooner or later. Hands are worse, as everybody have to wash hands at least a couple of times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other problems are allergic type outbreaks that can spread over the hands or even the legs.  Doctors usually prescribe the strongest steroid combined with antibiotics, the usuals, to heal everything first, and tell me to see specialists to find out the cause.  But I had seen a dermatologist before and he tried to convinced me that may be it&#x27;s the new shampoo.  I&#x27;m not convinced as I change shampoo and body wash from time to time, depending on the bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But your skin will pay dearly for steroid in the long run, and I&#x27;m a bit allergic to oil based antibiotics.  So I have been trying something else before I go to see the doctor again, or get the prescribed steroid from Mexican pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Epson salt to soak the fingers to treat or prevent infections. Then covers with medicated moisturizer like Intensive Healing to protect the skin.  There are ingredients that claim to protect even after hand washing.  It works to some extend but the soaking doesn&#x27;t heal fast enough and doesn&#x27;t treat wounds that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problems are like small wounds starting from the root of nails.  Insect bites and small cuts that doesn&#x27;t want to heal. Small bubbles formed on hand, burst to become small wounds, some healed to form very tough patch of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this lotion yesterday a few times on the outbreaks and it is amazing so far. It soothes the wounds and doesn&#x27;t make it worse.  It soothes the touch skin patches.  It is being absorbed amazingly fast, faster than some intensive repairing moisturizers.  Say when I apply Intensive Healing, which is not supposed to be absorbed very fast, the time it takes to absorb is like hand washing to my fingers, and the pain doesn&#x27;t stop until some time after absorbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has alcohol in it so it helps to feed cool but the alcohol will at least help to prevent inflection.  Now my hands seem to be healing properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also developed dry tough skin at the soles that have to be filed off using rough floating stones.  This is a good thing to apply to the feet as it absorbs instantly and not slippery.</li>
    <li> A great hand lotion. It gets heavy use at my house. I even use it on my feet! It is not too greasy &amp; works wonders on those dry spots. It keeps everything nicely moisturized. I wash my hands alot on my job. So it gets a workout from that &amp; our winters. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Like most people I bought this lotion for my dry hands, and it works great for that. It&#x27;s extremely effective without leaving an annoying residue behind. But I also discovered a great secondary use for it that no one else seems to be mentioning; it&#x27;s a great pre-shave! Slather this on before a shave and your whiskers will be so soft the razor will just glide through them.</li>
    <li> I hate fingerprints on my iPhone almost as much as I hate dry hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corn Huskers is the best lotion I have found if I&#x27;m going to be using a touch screen. It does have a slight exfoliating effect so if you notice your skin seems to \\&quot;rub off\\&quot; a bit after using it, exfoliating your hands before use will fix that. Corn Huskers has been very well reviewed, so I will not add much more except to say the fragrance isn&#x27;t girly -- which is fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, why can&#x27;t we add keywords to aid us in our searches anymore?</li>
    <li> The first time I ever saw a bottle of &amp;#34;Corn Huskers,&amp;#34; I was a little girl, and watched my uncle, a coal miner and farmer, use this on his aging, cracking hands. This has been MANY years ago, but I always associated it as a working man&#x27;s hand lotion. There are so many great body lotions, but being an avid hand washer causes most hand lotions to come up short, so I reluctantly tried the Corn Huskers.&lt;br /&gt;I have just learned that is not just for men! I love that it takes just a drop, will stay on through a few hand-washings, and the price is certainly right! I also received the product extremely fast, and while I will use the rest of my expensive hand lotions (or give them away) I will buy the Corn Huskers next time.  Many Thanks!</li>
    <li> I only used this twice because I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.  Liked how it felt but I was just too picky for this fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It smells amazing and is not greasy at all.  Definitely a must have in the winter months.</li>
    <li> It arrived very quickly, and in perfect shape.  I&#x27;ve used it since my Grandmother&#x27;s days.  An excellent product. Many thanks!</li>
    <li> I have used Corn Huskers for several tears and it does the job that it is supposed to. I could find it locally so had to depend on Amazon</li>
    <li> As advertised, and very effective.</li>
    <li> I have ruff heels especially in the winter so my dad gave this to me years ago to use.  It is great stuff for ruff skin.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Corn Huskers is still the best on the market.</li>
    <li> I chose this because of the fantastic reviews that it has for people who wash their hands often/do labor for their profession and for those with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hands often and take hot showers which lead to really dry and uncomfortable hands. This makes them not hurt.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years, I&#x27;ve tried other products, but always come back to it. Nothing I&#x27;ve tried measures up, great for a working man&#x27;s hands.</li>
    <li> My husband was suffering from such dry skin that his hands were cracking and bleeding. I was at my wit&#x27;s end-we tried everything from expensive creams to plain vaseline and nothing was working. Then I remembered this lotion that I used thirty years ago. I didn&#x27;t know if it was still available (and it wasn&#x27;t in any of the local stores) but a quick search on the Internet showed me where to find it. It took about a week, but his skin healed up and he has no more problems with his hands. He especially likes that it soaks in and is not greasy-he was really reluctant to use any hand cream because he doesn&#x27;t like the greasy feeling. He still complains about how it feels tacky when you first put it on, but I remind him that the tacky feeling goes away in under a minute. I now keep several bottles in stock in the pantry-I never want to take a chance on running out. It may be an old product, and have an uncool name, and look really weird, but it works. And you only need a few drops. And it&#x27;s cheap, so it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Corn Huskers Lotion has been around since I can remember. One would think that they would have made a fragrance-free version by now. I have dry hands because I broke my wrists years ago and suffered some nerve damage. Every winter, I have problems with dry skin and cracking. I don&#x27;t like my hands to feel oily, but I don&#x27;t like them smelly, either. I use this lotion, but it smells lousy to me.</li>
    <li> happy with item and seller</li>
    <li> I use Corn Huskers every winter. My hands dry out to the point where I suffer skin cracking and soreness and this lotion prevents that.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Bought to help with dry skin during winter but hate oily products. This works great at moisturizing without being oily. Soaks into skin quickly.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and it really works for extra, extra dry skin.</li>
    <li> Outstanding!  Soaks into the skin without any greasy or sticky residue.  Leaves skin silky smooth.  Lives up to its five star reviews.</li>
    <li> This is old school! It works perfectly. Not greasy or oily. One little drop is all you need. Best product of its kind on the market for rough/dry hands, feet, elbows etc. No per-fumy smell or odor. I have used it for decades. It is getting hard to find in local stores.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even know if this stuff works. I couldn&#x27;t get passed the smell. It&#x27;s thick and gooey. I would not recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> First off; I can&#x27;t stand the feel of almost all hand lotion after applying it to my hands.  This lotion dries fast and leaves no residue.  It is the best for people like me who can&#x27;t tolerate greasy hands.</li>
    <li> i love the smell but didnt help with my dry skin due to winter weather.</li>
    <li> Corn Huskers has always been a good product. It works. It is impossible to find in the stores for some reason now..maybe because it is not made in china.</li>
    <li> This is over rated. I been trying everything for my dry cracked hands and this is not what I was hoping for. Sorry!</li>
    <li> The good news is that this really works- and FAST! You have the added bonus that it&#x27;s really inexpensive. I bought mine for $2 at Walmart for 7 oz. If you want soft, smooth skin in a hurry, this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t look or feel like your typical lotion. That may bother some people, but I don&#x27;t care. It&#x27;s also got a scent that is a bit plastic smelling. It&#x27;s sort of like baby lotion, but not. That may also be off-putting for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst news is that it&#x27;s loaded with chemicals. Preservatives: Methylparaben and TEA. Yuck. No thanks. The active ingredient is glycerine. If you want the same effect, get some glycerine and water and use that. These are commonly found in bath and body products, so if you don&#x27;t care, go for it. (If you want to see if these are things you want in your body (if it&#x27;s on your skin, it will be in your body as the skin is highly permeable, google MSDS methylparaben).</li>
    <li> My husband uses this mainly during the winter months for his dry and horribly cracked finger tips. The lotion doesn&#x27;t smell great but it does what it suppose to do. Usually within a few days his fingers start to heal. We&#x27;ve tried several products and this works to best!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.I  had extremely dry skin on my legs.I used baby oil and other lotions and my skin remained dried.My legs are finally becming smooth since I&#x27;ve been using corn huskers  lotion..</li>
    <li> I have extremely bad eczema and have tried numerous products over the years to help my hands, including a prescription steroid cream. My husband discovered Corn Huskers and uses this routine: cover hands with JR Watkins lotion (this stuff is miraculous, any scent. Works better than rx), then cover hands with Corn Huskers, then petroleum jelly. Yes, you are going to feel really greasy for a few minutes. Don&#x27;t touch anything. Once the petroleum jelly has a chance to absorb some, you&#x27;re good to go. This has brought our hands from cracking and bleeding, to where we can actually wear our wedding rings and bathe our kids without cringing. A total life saver.</li>
    <li> works as well as it did in years past</li>
    <li> Best there is as far as I can tell.  I don&#x27;t like regular lotions, as they always feel greasy, I can&#x27;t stand having greasy feeling hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s working hands, and that stuff works, but leaves your hands feeling like you slathered them in vaeline - terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soaks in quickly, and leave my hands soft, but not sticky / greasy.  This really works well for hands doing woodworking and construction / demo work.  I would highly recommend you give this a try.</li>
    <li> This lotion works well for making your skin feel smooth and soft. The problem that I have with it is the smell. It has a fragrance that I can not deal with. The smell stays with you for hours.</li>
    <li> I first discovered this product several years ago. I live in Alberta, Canada which during the winter months has a very cold dry climate and each year during the winter months my skin would become very dry and the tips of my fingers would crack and become very sore. I work outside a great deal and my bare hands are constantly exposed to the cold dry air. My freind&#x27;s father gave me a bottle of Corn Huskers Lotion that he brought back from the US to try and it worked great for me. I&#x27;ve been using this product every winter for the last 35 years and have suffered no ill effects from it. I put it on in the morning and in the evening during the cold dry season and it works very well for me. It is a very inexpensive and effective moisturizer. To me this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; To the best of my knowledge this product is not available in Canada, at least I&#x27;ve never been able to find it in any retail store or pharmacy here. I always pick a few bottles up when I&#x27;m in the US. It is readily available at Walmart, Walgreens, CVS etc all over the US for less than $3.00 per bottle or it can be ordered online from Amazon.com</li>
    <li> This is good stuff for dry, chapped hands and goes a long way.  It&#x27;s old fashioned but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff.  Price per ounce is totally wrong.  Get a calculator Amazon!  And it is very unfortunate that you no longer have any link to report errors.</li>
    <li> The lotion works better than any other lotion that I have tried in the past.  It also has a very pleasant odor!</li>
    <li> A bit fussy, I can be, with stuff I apply to my hands and feet. This cold weather drys my skin and cracks as always. Corn Huskers is non greasy and easily absorbed. Great to apply to my feet prior to putting on my sock&#x27;s. Thank You Corn Huskers with &#x27;keeping&#x27; the quality of your product...</li>
    <li> Works fine but no better than other hand lotions I&#x27;ve tried. I need more words to satisfy the rating site.</li>
    <li> If you have rough hands and have tried everything try this it works. It will make the roughest hands begin to heal and get soft again.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t moisturize and I found it at walmart for $3.00</li>
    <li> As a disclaimer I should say that I have no problems using all sorts of hand moisturizers, so specialty lotions like this don&#x27;t often strike a chord with me. With that said I shall begin my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- \\&quot;Oil free\\&quot; so it doesn&#x27;t leave the greasy feel that some other lotions can.&lt;br /&gt;- Evaporates quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Thick Jello-like consistency makes it so I almost always get too much into my hand.&lt;br /&gt;- The smell lingers on your hands for hours. It&#x27;s not a terrible smell, but it isn&#x27;t pleasant either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if oily residue from typical lotions is a big problem for you then you probably want to check this out. The smell, however, can be a bit of a turn off.</li>
    <li> This is a product my mother used when I was a child. It is very soothing and effective , even use on legs. It has been a very cold this winter so skin drier than usual . Absorbs quickly</li>
    <li> It happens every winter. My skin dries up and the ends of my finger tips split and become painful. This is definitely one of the better products that I have used on my hands.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this at work.  I was told it would be easy to use and would not leave the office machines oily.  After using it, I was sold.  This is the best for softer hands, but no oil or grease feeling after.  I ordered this to have at my home and will stick with this brand from now on.</li>
    <li> I have used CHL since I was a kid, I have yet to find anything better, problem is, it is getting harder to find.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect product for hands with dry skin that can actually help without being  oily .&lt;br /&gt;It is the first product I have found that works.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for hands and feet. I use it on my feet at night and it really makes a difference. The smell is comforting and not overpowering. My hands also notice a difference. It gets the job done, specially during the winter months. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it does not absorb as quickly as I would like but that is not a major issue.</li>
    <li> Corn Huskers is alcohol based, so it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on your hands. However, if you have any small cuts, this will burn for a few moments. It dries fairly quickly, which is helpful (when at work or trying to use a door knob). It does have a faint feminine smell that will eventually go away. I keep a bottle in my desk drawer.</li>
    <li> Great therapy at night for your hands! Guys, no woman wants to be caressed by a guy with rough hands. Use this during the day, O&#x27;keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream by night!</li>
    <li> Just smells a bit perfume-like for a bit longer.</li>
    <li> Nothing I have found works better on hands cracked from a harsh dry winter. My only gripe is that the bottle doesn&#x27;t make it easy to dispense just the correct amount. All this means is you spend a longer amount of time rubbing it in...which probably heals your hands much quicker...which mean that the bottle is great...wait what just happened there.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband who has very dry hands. I remembered it from back when my father used it; he had callus all over his hands. It was the only lotion that would sooth the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a heavy lotion but it dries softly; no residual and your hands do not feel oily.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for dry flaking skin. It is gooey when first applied , but once worked in feels and works great.</li>
    <li> I had dryness on my hands and this lotion does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hands stay busy a lot like mine, you may want to wash this after a while and apply another natural, less-greasy lotion on your hands or feet. My humble recommendation is Aveeno or Burt Bee&#x27;s hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What our senses like is personal and I love the smell of this lotion.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion ever!!</li>
    <li> As a contractor, my hands get terribly dry during the winter months, usually to the point of painful cracks before I think to do something about it. Bag Balm has always worked wonders for me, but it is very greasy, so I&#x27;d apply it at night. Found the Corn Huskers this season, and it&#x27;s worked great for me. It&#x27;s not oily, works right into your skin and has a very pleasant scent. Using it a couple of times a day, keeps my hands really nice. My wife is quite thankful.</li>
    <li> Love this dry lotion.</li>
    <li> I work outside a lot, and my hands take a beating! Based on other reviews, I thought that I would give this a try. It works. Instant gratification! I used the product often over the course of a few days, and my hands feel and look much better. I&#x27;m also a classical guitarist, with callused fingers on both hands, and this smooths my hands with no adverse effects on my playing. I don&#x27;t find the scent offensive, though it took a little getting used to. It&#x27;s not greasy and drys fast leaving the hands smooth and soft. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because it was mentionec in a review of another product. It is ok, but not as long lasting as i thought. I will still it because its a good product.</li>
    <li> gift for me, but everyone wants to use it, great for dry and winter beaten hands.</li>
    <li> Overpriced her on Amazon, but I still had to buy it because we were out locally and its the BEST hand lotion there is!  I mean, this stuff is phenomenal!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great for really dry skin.  My husband does concrete testing and other tests that make his skin so dry it is uncomfortable.  This is the only product that we have found that relieves his dry skin.</li>
    <li> Smells a bit odd but it really works to soften up those dried out winter hands that seem to get worse with every year. I first came across this formulation when I worked for Warner Lambert back in the 1980s where they had this in the company store...along with the Listerine and many other consumer products. Unhappy with many of the other creams on the market I remembered it and put it into Amazon and voila, there it was! My hands are happy!</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever for dry hands</li>
    <li> To sooth the itching inside my husbands ears. Corn Huskers was recommended by his Primary Care Physician to be the best.</li>
