      <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>Garnier is what I use most often unless a another more costly brand I love goes on sale.</li>
      <li>This is the only conditioner I use because it does the best job at detangling.  </li>
      <li>i always bring it even on just overnight travels :)</li>
      <li>this is my problem, I always wash my body after conditioning to make sure there is no conditioner sitting on my skin&amp;#34;, but decided to stop using it anyway just in case.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>Good price and shipped right to my door.</li>
      <li>It is light, great smell and really does leave hair sleekand shiney!</li>
      <li>love all their products, buy them all from the hair color on down this is one of the best products on the market today.</li>
      <li>I have been using the original and new formula for 4 years now and both are great.</li>
      <li>so this isn&#x27;t an easy task.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just fine for what my wife wanted it for.</li>
      <li>for the large size bottle I&#x27;m very happy with the price and would definitely buy this from Amazon again.</li>
      <li>which is great for me, especially during the summer months.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And for sure the whole set of Garnier sleek and shine.</li>
      <li>and they worked tremendously</li>
      <li>Love the way this smells and makes my hair feel so smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>All 4 of my kids (especially my girls) love the shine and feel of their hair now!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that this is THE product that makes my hair perfectly controlled (the others help too), but it&#x27;s the only conditioner that seems to keep me from having dry looking hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although I love this conditioner, I did a little experimenting on my own.</li>
      <li>hair became smooth straight and glossy sinceI use this conditioner.</li>
      <li>The only nice thing of it is the smell</li>
      <li>My hair always feels bouncy and soft afterwards. :)</li>
      <li>wish I had some kind of smellovision because this product has a very pleasing scent to it that lasts throughout the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I kind of forgot about it as I started exploring products for natural hair, but I&#x27;ve rediscovered it and found that it still doesn&#x27;t let me down. :-)</li>
      <li>I went shopping, found this in a 25 ounce bottle at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I have relaxed hair and to this day no other product have been able to detangle and give my hair so much slip.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly like what I buy at Target.</li>
      <li>Will buy more again later.</li>
      <li>I had so many pimples on my back that people would sometimes think I was covered in freckles from a distance.</li>
      <li>I have tried many conditioner products and always go back to this one.</li>
      <li>It is the only conditioner that lets me brush my hair without breaking most of it.</li>
      <li>used to wear my hair straight with a relaxer, and this was my favorite shampoo and conditioner back then.</li>
      <li>It does the job of keeping your hair straight and flat, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>Well this conditioner keeps it under control (with the use of some other products in this same line) and the curls are very nice.  </li>
      <li>Even if I have knotty and uncontrollable hair, if I put this product in after shampooing it quickly makes it soft, shiny and untangles everything.</li>
      <li>Super thick like MUCH more expensive brands and smells amazing -- love it!</li>
      <li>It is the only conditioner that detangles my and my daughter&#x27;s baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it also really soothes your hair.</li>
      <li>I love this product-(shampoo too)-my hair is very long and always looks fantstic because of this conditioner-I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this type of conditioner for at least a year or more now and there isn&#x27;t anything that works quite as well as this that I have found, I have even used higher end conditioners that I felt like didn&#x27;t do as good of a job as this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thicker and slightly course hair, coming from an Asian/Native ethnicity.</li>
      <li>After about 3 months of using the Sleek and Shine line of products, my normally frizzy hair is sleek and shiny!</li>
      <li>I am usually an Herbal Essence kind of chick, but decided to switch it up and try this product.</li>
      <li>I live in florida and my hair takes a real beating between the sun, swimming, etc...</li>
      <li>noticed my hair getting less frizzy and more manageable</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend using this product.</li>
      <li>so I got it myself and it is not good enough to repurchase but right now, it does a good job for its price.</li>
      <li>far as quality goes, hair products are very individual.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I went from having dozens of pimples to maybe getting one or two on occasion (normal for me).</li>
      <li>This conditioner is so smooth and it really makes my hair feel ridiculously soft, but not like &amp;#34;flat soft&amp;#34; just the right amount of moisture to make my hair do what it naturally does, with a little added shine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent some money on some higher end conditioners and none compare that I have found !!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this conditioner. It is comparable to other very expensive conditioners. I am a black woman with very thick, curly (3c/4a-ish) hair. I have used another conditioner that I love (let&#x27;s call it \\&quot;Interracial Women\\&quot;), but it is too expensive for me to buy on a regular basis. I think that Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine is the most comparable to that other expensive brand that I like. I like a conditioner that is heavy, because my hair is thick and needs something to hold it down. This conditioner is very, very thick. It keeps my dry hair moisturized very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to wear my hair straight with a relaxer, and this was my favorite shampoo and conditioner back then. I kind of forgot about it as I started exploring products for natural hair, but I&#x27;ve rediscovered it and found that it still doesn&#x27;t let me down. :-)</li>
    <li> This is such a convenience of having my conditioner shipped without having to go to the store.  I like how this conditioner makes my hair feel and it smells good!</li>
    <li> Super thick like MUCH more expensive brands and smells amazing -- love it!</li>
    <li> I am usually an Herbal Essence kind of chick, but decided to switch it up and try this product. I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had some kind of smellovision because this product has a very pleasing scent to it that lasts throughout the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed my hair getting less frizzy and more manageable which is great for me, especially during the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I love this conditioner, I did a little experimenting on my own. I put some of this conditioner in my palm and some of my HE Hello Hydration in my palm and applied them simultaneously to my tresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW. I fell in love all over again. I had the best of both worlds and they worked tremendously together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product in local stores but with a credit to my amazon.com account I went shopping, found this in a 25 ounce bottle at a very reasonable price. The product is a quality conditioner and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> i love this product! i don&#x27;t use any other conditioner. i always bring it even on just overnight travels :)</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  I have really crazy curly hair, and live in a very humid area.  Bad combination, right?  Well this conditioner keeps it under control (with the use of some other products in this same line) and the curls are very nice.  I think it is a bargain for the price, too.  I did attempt to get this from Amazon, but it came twice spilled in the package and so I am just buying it at the store now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this off and on for a few years. Sometimes when the store is out, or I want to give my hair a break for a month I&#x27;ll try something else.  I always come back to it.  Some conditioners leave my hair feeling greasy.  This doesn&#x27;t do that.  Yet, it does really help to tame my curly,  frizzy hair and keep my dry hair smooth and soft.  I do use it with Sleek and shine shampoo and the John Frieda frizz serum, so I can&#x27;t say that this is THE product that makes my hair perfectly controlled (the others help too), but it&#x27;s the only conditioner that seems to keep me from having dry looking hair. I just put it on my subscribe and save so I won&#x27;t ever run out.</li>
    <li> My FAVORITE conditioner!!  I have longer hair and it tangles in a second no matter what I do to it.  This is the only conditioner that after I use it I can brush through my hair with ease!  I love this stuff.  I want to cry when I go to get it at the store and they are out or they don&#x27;t carry it!  The price is great too!  I&#x27;ve spent some money on some higher end conditioners and none compare that I have found !!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner and it got to my place perfect and fast. It is the only conditioner that lets me brush my hair without breaking most of it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the Garnier&#x27;s Sleek and Shine line. I have relaxed hair and to this day no other product have been able to detangle and give my hair so much slip. It&#x27;s amazing. Whether it has something to do with micro-oils or chemicals these products work. I have been using the original and new formula for 4 years now and both are great. I wouldn&#x27;t substitute a deep conditioner with this product but I would definitely co-wash or add it to my regular regimen.</li>
    <li> I love this product-(shampoo too)-my hair is very long and always looks fantstic because of this conditioner-I highly recommend it. I live in florida and my hair takes a real beating between the sun, swimming, etc... People always comment on how shiney and silky my hair is.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is so smooth and it really makes my hair feel ridiculously soft, but not like &amp;#34;flat soft&amp;#34; just the right amount of moisture to make my hair do what it naturally does, with a little added shine.</li>
    <li> you know, until this product i have never found the perfect conditioner. but this is it! unlike any other, it really get all the knots out! it also really soothes your hair. heres the thing, my hair is ultra thick and curly/wavy. and it is super hard, A. to find a hair product that wont weigh my hair down and keep my hair light weight and curly, B. to get the knots out of my hair (it takes hours) and keep it unfrizzy. but this stuff fixed everything. it also smells like aprocots and peaches, which makes your hair have a nice after scent. i truly think u will like this conditioner, because it sure helped me!</li>
    <li> Just fine for what my wife wanted it for. Good price and shipped right to my door. Will buy more again later.</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner, it has to be purchased separate from the shampoo but the combo is a must in this house.</li>
    <li> I used the Sleek and Shine line for years to tame my wavy/curly, fine, thin, frizzy hair and it really did improve the condition of my hair. It smoothed it out, helped control frizz, seemed to define my curls, and made them so shiny. During this time I was also experiencing terrible, severe acne all over my back. I had so many pimples on my back that people would sometimes think I was covered in freckles from a distance. After trying tons of different body washes, creams, and masques, I came across a post somewhere online in which someone stated that this conditioner was a major pore-clogger and has a reputation for causing body acne. I thought to myself &amp;#34;There&#x27;s no way this is my problem, I always wash my body after conditioning to make sure there is no conditioner sitting on my skin&amp;#34;, but decided to stop using it anyway just in case. My back almost immediately cleared up and I went from having dozens of pimples to maybe getting one or two on occasion (normal for me). I loved what this product did for my hair but I will never use it again because of what it did to my skin.</li>
    <li> Garnier is what I use most often unless a another more costly brand I love goes on sale. I don&#x27;t ever shampoo so I wanted a conditioner that had some cleaning ability as well and looking at the ingredients it did. My hair feels very clean, not at all greasy, and very healthy so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Love the way this smells and makes my hair feel so smooth and soft. I highly recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> Really, really bad texture on my hair, thick and rough even after flat ironing which i certainly cannot define as sleek, and NO shine whatsoever!!!! It totally absorbs the humidity in the air and makes my hair really unmanageably fuzzy and super dull right off the drying/flat ironing session. Because of that it takes me twice the time and effort to style my hair. If i use this conditioner i know it&#x27;s gonna be a bad hair day for sure. The only nice thing of it is the smell but that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> Tames the frizz considerably better than what I was using before.</li>
    <li> I understand now why I&#x27;ve seen all the great reviews in the magazines.  This product has a wonderful refreshing wake you up kind of scent for the morning shower.  It also has my hair looking better in just two days.  Frizzes down, softness up.  This one is a winner.</li>
    <li> After about 3 months of using the Sleek and Shine line of products, my normally frizzy hair is sleek and shiny! I use the shampoo, conditioner and creme.</li>
    <li> This conditioner does leave the hair a bit heavy and it can feel as if it&#x27;s dirty even though it isn&#x27;t. I enjoy it and the smell is nice. I am definitely going to use the rest of the bottle although I will not be repurchasing. I bought mine at my local Family Dollar. It does the job of keeping your hair straight and flat, that&#x27;s for sure. I didn&#x27;t know what to think with all these good AND bad reviews so I got it myself and it is not good enough to repurchase but right now, it does a good job for its price.</li>
    <li> I love the Fructis shampoo and conditioner.  Leaves my hair so silky smooth and smelling great.  Love not having to go out to buy it also!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. It is the only conditioner that detangles my and my daughter&#x27;s baby fine hair. Our hair breaks off easily, and will not grow past our shoulders without the help of this condtioner.</li>
    <li> This is the only conditioner I use because it does the best job at detangling.  I have tried many conditioner products and always go back to this one.</li>
    <li> My family of 5 love this shampoo and conditioner. It is light, great smell and really does leave hair sleekand shiney!</li>
    <li> Feels slimey in the shower which is fun, but the results are great. My hair always feels bouncy and soft afterwards. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this type of conditioner for at least a year or more now and there isn&#x27;t anything that works quite as well as this that I have found, I have even used higher end conditioners that I felt like didn&#x27;t do as good of a job as this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thicker and slightly course hair, coming from an Asian/Native ethnicity. Even if I have knotty and uncontrollable hair, if I put this product in after shampooing it quickly makes it soft, shiny and untangles everything. Though it can feel somewhat greasy I haven&#x27;t had problems rinsing the conditioner off at all! I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> hair became smooth straight and glossy sinceI use this conditioner. And for sure the whole set of Garnier sleek and shine. great products at great price.</li>
    <li> My boys use this with the coordinating shampoo.  One has fine, wavy hair and the other has dry, curly hair.  They both like the way their hair feels and smells with these products.</li>
    <li> Having long, thick natural curls, you can imagine how I&#x27;ve struggled all my life to find a conditioner that actually works and doesn&#x27;t cost a grip of money. I&#x27;ve been using this Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine for a couple of years now and will continue to do so until something even thicker can be found. Bonus! It smells great. Basically, I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good conditioner.  My wife is african american and she simply loves to use this conditioner in her hair.  It works much better than some of the other more expensive conditioners.</li>
    <li> I have been the shampoo with the conditioner regularly for the last year and I love the smell and the smoothness of my hair after use. The subscribe and save is a great deal, I can get the large bottles for $7 combo while at CVS or Rite Aid I&#x27;d pay that much for just one of the smaller bottles sometimes. These prices even beat the prices of the drug stores even when they have these items on sale, and the subscribe and save is more reliable.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite conditioner. It smells awesome (like all of Garnier&#x27;s products do) and it makes my hair feel so nice and shiny! I have very dry, frizzy, thick hair so this isn&#x27;t an easy task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that this conditioner might be too heavy for someone with finer, thinner hair- so please bear that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the large size bottle I&#x27;m very happy with the price and would definitely buy this from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> Both my 5 year old daughter and I love this conditioner. I will always buy the &amp;#34;sleek and shine&amp;#34; variety from now on because of the amazing apricot scent. My daughter has very long straight hair that is always getting tangled. After switching to this conditioner, I hardly even need to comb it out -- her hair is soft and smooth and tangle-free. No more tears or threats to cut her hair!</li>
    <li> I have really dead thin hair due to hot tools, hair dying and living near the beach in socal and ever since I&#x27;ve been using this my hair has been getting thick and repaired. Love this stuff</li>
    <li> This is a shamppo the whole family loves and a perfect size for the kids shower! All 4 of my kids (especially my girls) love the shine and feel of their hair now!</li>
    <li> love all their products, buy them all from the hair color on down this is one of the best products on the market today.</li>
    <li> My favorite winter conditioner. It makes my hair shiny and much less straw-like. I also feel like my hear breaks much less.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Garnier Fructis conditioner! it smells so good and keeps my hair so smooth shiny and healthy looking!</li>
    <li> I dropped a star for price/value.&lt;br /&gt;As far as quality goes, hair products are very individual.&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my daughter&#x27;s thin blond hair and it helps with the detangling.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly like what I buy at Target. Great conditioner</li>
</ol>
