      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I was pretty impressed.  </li>
      <li>I love this deodorant!</li>
      <li>And, the protection of this Clinical Strength deodorant is just as nice as the $15 Clinical Strength brands on the top drugstore shelves!</li>
      <li>/&gt;While not without its flaws I liked this product for it&#x27;s pleasant scent more than anything.</li>
      <li>This deodorant is amazing-</li>
      <li>Now that warm weather is here, a reliable deodorant is a must.  </li>
      <li>I actually really liked this product.  </li>
      <li>It also smells really nice.</li>
      <li>Nice job</li>
      <li>I tend to often shower at night and liked that the recommended directions were to apply it before bed.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice, does the trick.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice, the product goes on well and seems to work well.  </li>
      <li>When I wake, I can&#x27;t smell the scent lingering, which is nice since I work in an office where we aren&#x27;t supposed to wear perfume.  </li>
      <li>a nice bright &#x27;clean laundry&#x27; kind of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>- the scent is very strong.</li>
      <li>Like I said a really great deodorant/antiperspirant that is worth the price.</li>
      <li>It smells really good, provides excellent protection against wetness and odor, and has not broken/melted or whatever the other brand was doing.</li>
      <li>I am happy to report that the function of this anti-perspirant was consistent throughout her period of use.  </li>
      <li>I fearded this would have too feminine an odor, but the everlasting sunshine fragrance seems perfectly okay to me without being overly feminine but suitable also for guys.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent of this deodorant is nice, but strong.</li>
      <li>It has a hint of something more, and this clinical protection version is 20% aluminum, so extra strength basically, and on the higher end of Suave products - it works great and smells great too!</li>
      <li>What a refreshing springtime fragrance.  </li>
      <li>just okay.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s magic.  </li>
      <li>is the one most should consider, and for that, I have to say it does.</li>
      <li>For me, the dove and degree solids work much better.</li>
      <li>It is more of a floral scent, to me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>Ive had better</li>
      <li>Turn the knob and deodorant comes out of the holes in the top.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many</li>
      <li>I LOVE THEIR powder version...</li>
      <li>you will love this one.</li>
      <li>Is there really more you need from an anti-perspirant/deodorant combo?</li>
      <li>im glad i didnt waist 4 more dollars</li>
      <li>If my clothes don&#x27;t smell like B.O., they sure smell like Suave deodorant.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s my favorite deodorant.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this one.</li>
      <li>LOVE this scent.</li>
      <li>Love the scent.</li>
      <li>Maybe they have a keen sense of smell but it smelled lovely to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff smells great and works very well.  </li>
      <li>but then I find that I have to use more and that it stains my clothing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this deodorant~</li>
      <li>The smell of this everlasting sunshine is a bit more than the powder one or lavender one but</li>
      <li>This was a better deal than in store.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a feminine scent, but somewhat more neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>like that it is one of the roll on deodorants that you have to dial up to get more product out.</li>
      <li>I love this smell more than anything.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, the solid worked perfectly for me.</li>
      <li>the humidity is so overwhelming that you will perspire under your arm even if you aren&#x27;t a sweater.</li>
      <li>Just wish they had more than one scent for subscribing...</li>
      <li>I love the scent of this deodorant.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the strongest deodorant I have found. With this deodorant you will no longer have embarassing sweat marks under your arms. It is much better than the Dove or Secret clinical strength and it is cheaper too!</li>
    <li> I bought this at Walmart about 4 days ago and have used it everyday. Let me tell you, if you have hyperhidrosis like me this will *probably* not work 100% for you. It definitely controlled the sweat more, there was not nearly as much sweat as there used to be, but, there was still just enough to still get some small underarm circles. They&#x27;re really only visible if I lift up my arms though. The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, I like the sweet smell, and to me it&#x27;s not nearly as strong as others say it is. The smell is usually faded by morning. Overall, it was okay. I&#x27;ll be ordering another anti-perspirant to try and get complete underarm dryness though.</li>
    <li> This was a better deal than in store. I&#x27;d buy this product again. It works as far as keeping me dry and it smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell a difference from regular deodorant.  I also had itching and broke out.  In the past I used the Secret clinical protection and it worked better but I was trying to save money so I tried this.  It does have a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> It smells great and seems to get the job done. However it leaves behind white flakes after drying. That&#x27;s unacceptable especially when wearing a tank top.</li>
    <li> Would recommend to anyone that needs a little extra protection.</li>
    <li> Goes on too wet for my liking, and also seemed a bit sticky.  Protection/coverage was acceptable.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is alright.  Doesn&#x27;t work great for me, just okay.  I noticed switching deodorants from time to time is the best.</li>
    <li> I actually smelled bad after wearing this for a day! I was so surprised! I wont use it again. Its garbage.</li>
    <li> This stuff is full of aluminium which is highly toxic and can cause cancer. Stay away. Not to mention it makes you actually sweat more.  I threw mine in the garbage and went out and bought the Crystal spray deodorant you can get at Sprouts, Whole Foods, or at Target.</li>
    <li> Works very well. This is a reorder</li>
    <li> Less expensive then the competitors, but just as effective. A-ok in my book.</li>
    <li> LOVE this scent. It&#x27;s not overpowering, but my husband noticed it when i was standing next to him. Anti-perspirant works well, but the smell is what makes me keep buying it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this clinical deodorant from Suave. I had been using another brand, but the gooey deodorant stick always broke off before the container was empty (even though I had it stored in a cool, dry place), so I was wasting a lot of money on replacements. I saw the Suave brand on Amazon, so I decided to try it. It smells really good, provides excellent protection against wetness and odor, and has not broken/melted or whatever the other brand was doing. I&#x27;m going to subscribe to this item once I know how long a stick typically lasts.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. For me, the dove and degree solids work much better. Then again, I have never had good luck with any sort of liquid/gel antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is amazing- It seems to be really hard to find in stores. I am a Zumba instructor and I am drenched in sweat after every class but man this little stick of deodorant does the trick! I&#x27;ve tried all the others- Secret, Degree, Dove, and this is the best hands down</li>
    <li> Antiperspirant wise, this works. During humid weather, this has held up. My only complaint is that it stinks. I am not a fan of this scent. It has a musky, spicy, flowery smell. Not my thing. I like clean shower or fresh scent, nothing with Patchouli.</li>
    <li> I sweat... a lot and for no damn reason lol This works awesome! Keeps me, fresh, dry and smelling good :-) I can&#x27;t get this fragrance in stores, just the powder fresh, I was so happy to learn I could switch up scents! If you sweat a lot, this is for you!</li>
    <li> okay i was buying the 8 dollar secret one then i seen the suave for 4 dollars i never tried clinical but why not just test the 4 dollar one first im glad i did because it works very well im glad i didnt waist 4 more dollars and i just purchased this one and cant wait to try this one</li>
    <li> This product has a very nice scent but I found I had to apply it multiple times and still had problems with BO. Everybody&#x27;s chemistry is different tho.</li>
    <li> I love how well &amp;#34;Certain-Dri&amp;#34; works, but it can be only applied at night and it stings the underarms!  Suave clinical protection doesn&#x27;t work quite as well, but it doesn&#x27;t sting and can be applied any time, even after showering/shaving, unlike &amp;#34;Certain-Dri.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I work for Starbucks. If you&#x27;ve ever taken a moment to watch the chaos behind the counter, you&#x27;ll understand why I opt for clinical strength deodorant. It just works better! This stuff keeps me dry as I battle the crazy rushes of customers. It also smells really nice. It has vanilla notes to it, and it&#x27;s not too strong. For some reason I cannot find this particular scent in any store in my area, so it&#x27;s great to be able to purchase it from Amazon. You also have the option to subscribe to this item, and have it auto-shipped to your home every couple of months. It&#x27;s great for people like me that get so busy they sometimes forget to pick up essentials from the store. There&#x27;s nothing worse than getting ready for work in the morning and attempting to apply your deodorant and.....click, click..$***.</li>
    <li> Ive had better i love the smell light and definitely for a woman I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s clinical strength</li>
    <li> I ordered this by mistake not realizing it was Suave and not Secret; definitely not the same.  As it gets hotter here in the desert climate where I live it is painfully evident that Secret is still the gold standard, this just does not offer the same level of protection.</li>
    <li> I love this scent!  The Bath and Body scent that (I think) Suave was trying to replicate actually gives me a headache, but this is a great scent.  Also, just an fyi: this deodorant is much cheaper than the Secret Clinical, and the active ingredients are the same... If I remember correctly, Suave actually has more of the same active ingredient.  I really can&#x27;t tell the difference between the two in use.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love the scent. So fresh</li>
    <li> It is all I use now.  Beware of the white on your black clothes.</li>
    <li> I never have b.o. but when i wear this, after I workout, I always have it!</li>
    <li> Regular deodorants and antiperspirants get me nowhere, so I always go clinical strength. This stuff works. I don&#x27;t have massive armpit sweat marks on my shirts mid-day, and I like the smell. It seems nice, but isn&#x27;t too bouquet-of-flowers-in-your-face smelly like a lot of other deodorants. It&#x27;s still a feminine scent, but somewhat more neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is one of the roll on deodorants that you have to dial up to get more product out. I have used deodorants that have all of the product out and exposed, and they have often broken when thrown around in my workout bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to any excessive sweater or athlete!</li>
    <li> I seem to have to change deodorant every couple years.  I used Secret for a very long time and either the product changed or my body did!  It took me a long time to find something else that worked, and I found Ban.  It&#x27;s been a year since I started using that and it&#x27;s not working great anymore.  Tried this and it is working great!  I don&#x27;t usually like a scent, but this is a nice one and not overwhelming.  It&#x27;s been about a month so who knows if I will have to change in another year, but for now I love it and it is working great!!!</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant! I started ordering it on Amazon because Target and WalMart tend to be sold out or don&#x27;t carry it. I mainly buy/use it in the summer when the California heat is at it&#x27;s peak. It smells great and keeps me from smelling offense!</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant and it smells great but.........this invisible deodorant is NOT invisible at all !  I will buy it again because it works and I like the smell but only under light color tops</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Invisible solid&amp;#34; is what I wanted. This deodorant is actually a click deodorant.  More squisy than solid. Not what I wanted:( I did add a star because it smells nice!:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using other brands of deodorant and honestly just got tired of having to reapply in the afternoons because of the summer heat, so I ordered a stick (although technically this gel formula isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;stick\\&quot;) of Suave Clinical Protection in Everlasting Sunshine as I&#x27;ve used it in the past and it worked.  This clinical deodorant has yet to let me down and I have zero issues with the ingredients leaving white streaks on my blouses or not working in the summer heat.  The \\&quot;everlasting sunshine\\&quot; scent is difficult to describe; it smells faintly like vanilla extract.  The 1.7 ounce size definitely means it&#x27;s small, but honestly not much is needed to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What surprised me the most was the fact that the main anti perspirant ingredient (aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrex GLY) is almost the same amount in the Suave as it is in Secret InvisibleSolid, which I was previously using and wasn&#x27;t entirely working for me.  Thankfully, Suave *does* work the entire 24 hours it claims!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this one.</li>
    <li> People think I&#x27;m wearing perfume!  This has the most wonderful scent!  I have to admit, when I get stressed out I stink!  I&#x27;ve tried different clinical strength deodorants and this Suave one works the best for me.  At the end of the day the armpits in my shirts no longer smell like BO.  I used to have to spray my shirts with vinegar to get the smell out of them, but I no longer need to do that.  I feel normal again!  Only word of caution is that this deodorant will leave a film on your armpits that is noticeable when showering.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and works very well.  My favorite clinical strength deodorant and it&#x27;s very well priced.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant~</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Suave Clinical Protection Antiperspirant Deodorant Everlasting Sunshine and I was not disappointed. The Suave brand is significantly less expensive than the other brands that I have used and actually works even better. I love that the deodorant was quickly dissolved under my arm and I didn&#x27;t have any white marks or white streaks under my arm or on my clothing. The Suave Antiperspirant lasted all day and if you happened to miss a day you will still be covered and I like that this deodorant is strong but not too strong so that it would cause irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in South Florida and the humidity is so overwhelming that you will perspire under your arm even if you aren&#x27;t a sweater. I loved the smell of the Everlasting Sunshine it smells like a tropical pina colada. I love this brand and will definitely be using this again because a little goes a long way and works even longer than the 24 hours.</li>
    <li> Phoenix has already been heating up to near-record highs so I&#x27;ve had some good chances to try out this \\&quot;clinical protection\\&quot; antiperspirant from Suave. So far, I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two major requirements I have for being a good antiperspirant: Does it keep me dry? and Does it smell good? The latter is of a less importance, but even if it was #1 I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d complain about the scent. The \\&quot;Everlasting Sunshine\\&quot; smell is a classic fragrance that doesn&#x27;t try to go too fem or be overbearing. I&#x27;m a guy and not in the least embarrassed to use it. It has a refreshing \\&quot;powder\\&quot; kind scent with a faint hint of citrus. It&#x27;s a distinct scent, but not so intense that it haunts you like a shadow. Even if you go sleeveless, I don&#x27;t expect too many people are going to catch a whiff of anything other than the faint illusion of freshness. That&#x27;s what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the big question of Does it Work? is the one most should consider, and for that, I have to say it does. The true test will come a few months from now during the 120 degree heat, but as for my trial in mid-90s, I&#x27;m very impressed. Very powerful, does the trick. Lasts a long time. No complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I&#x27;m new to \\&quot;clinical protection\\&quot; antiperspirants but I have to say I like it. Seems to be much more powerful than a regular stick. You also don&#x27;t have to use very much, just a few clicks. I know this product is probably \\&quot;made for a woman\\&quot; but as a guy, I hope my trial also holds some merit in the review. I can honestly say that it is strong enough for a man!</li>
    <li> This is a 24 hour, once a day deodorant that offers pretty good protection against wetness and odor, although you may want to apply twice day on high-activity days to keep smelling fresh.  The applicator could be improved; the holes are large and somewhat scratchy to my underarms, and it&#x27;s somewhat difficult to apply evenly.  It isn&#x27;t clear after applying, so you might want to try another deodorant if you&#x27;re going sleeveless.  I found the Everlasting Sunshine scent to be overly sweet, and prefer the Powder Fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this deodorant.  It isn&#x27;t overpowering, it smells light and like springtime.  I like how you put it on at night, and let it do it&#x27;s magic.  This eliminates white streaks on your clothing the next day.  When I wake, I can&#x27;t smell the scent lingering, which is nice since I work in an office where we aren&#x27;t supposed to wear perfume.  It continues to protect me throughout the day.  I haven&#x27;t had it fail yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes on wet, so you rotate the lever to dispense the deodorant.  It is like a wet powder, so it dries quickly, which eliminates that wet, sticky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that it is better to apply deodorant at night, because it is actually the deodorant that causes armpit stains on clothing, not the actual sweat itself.  That makes this a smart choice for deodorant, since it is formulated in this fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleasant scent, great protection, eliminates white streaks, and doesn&#x27;t leave my underarms coated with the residue that other deodorants do.  What more can I ask for!  Nice job Suave!</li>
    <li> I ordered this without smelling it, and I was really impressed. Smells awesome but not too strong or floral. Works exactly as advertised. Highly recommend! I&#x27;m now buying through Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> The smell is absolutely nauseating.  I can not stand to wear it.</li>
    <li> Wow, this really works! I don&#x27;t mind sweating when it is hot, but I hate drenched clothing. This has reduced my sweating down to normal people.</li>
    <li> I really love the fresh, citrusy smell of this deodorant, it&#x27;s very clean smelling and lasts all day long, I really love how clean my underarms still smell even at days end with this brand, I can still smell the citrus faintly, unlike any other deodorant I&#x27;ve used before. I don&#x27;t have to reapply this like with most others a second time during the say, it really does last and maintain it&#x27;s fresh smell. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This seems to be a really good product and It does a really good job of protecting. This is probably one of the best Deodorants that I&#x27;ve ever used. I would definitely recommend getting this I know it&#x27;s a little pricey but it is definitely worth it. It has a great scent that is not too faint or Overpowering. Like I said a really great deodorant/antiperspirant that is worth the price.</li>
    <li> I gave this product to a female member of my family to try, because she has some challenges with respect to anti-perspirants.  So the perspective on this particular product is hers, as are some of the more interesting phrases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was skeptical when she began to use Suave Clinical Protection, but for good reason.  She sweats.  Not just regular sweat, but real, serious sweat that does not smell pretty and comes in copious quantities at the rise of a degree.  Being female, that&#x27;s very inconvenient, and some people consider it to be gross.  She used Suave Clinical Protection for over a month before providing me with review feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her experience, many similar products stopped working after a few weeks.  I am happy to report that the function of this anti-perspirant was consistent throughout her period of use.  The anti-perspirant also smells absolutely wonderful.  Surprisingly, even though she did perspire, she still smelled great all day.  The texture of the anti-perspirant is also a positive.  The texture is creamy but feels almost powdery.  As for the \\&quot;prescription strength wetness protection,\\&quot; the product fell short.  It did very little to stop sweating for her even for a little while, let alone 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The anti-perspirant provides a few other perks.  She has sensitive skin and this anti-perspirant did not dry her skin, it was invisible, and it was not tacky.  For those who sweat lightly, Suave Clinical Protection is likely a great product because of the amazing odor (unless you are one of those people who are sensitive to odors), but for those who need heavy protection against sweat, this anti-perspirant is probably not the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although we thought the odor was fabulous, we will not be purchasing this anti-perspirant again because it did nothing for her torrential downpour (her phrase).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of clinical strength A/D products. I&#x27;m that girl who for years changed shirts in the middle of the day... even in cold months. So I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands and found that many of them dried my skin out pretty bad. This particular one from Suave hasn&#x27;t had that effect in the couple of weeks I&#x27;ve been using it but it has failed me once. There&#x27;s nothing like putting it on at night (a trick I learned helps with clinical strength A/D products) and waking up stinking like B.O. and vanilla. I had to shower again just to get rid of the vanilla smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like orchid or vanilla type smells you will love this one. It smells really nice and very feminine, not powdery or rosey as some lady&#x27;s deodorants do. The formula is very soft and messy and I did find it doesn&#x27;t come out very well so be cautious as you crank it or you&#x27;ll get way too much or none and then a LOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not without its flaws I liked this product for it&#x27;s pleasant scent more than anything. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d purchase the brand again since I had the failure the one time but I&#x27;ll finish the whole one before I decide for sure. Could have been a fluke and I do like that it didn&#x27;t overly dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> Loved this deodorant when I bought it in store. Something must have happened during storage or shipment because when it got to me it had a sandy and even sharp texture to it. Had to throw it out because the texture was irritating my underarms.</li>
    <li> I like the scent but it&#x27;s definatley not like another leading brand.  By the end of the day, it didn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job :(  Will have to return to the other more expensive brand.</li>
    <li> I have been using degree clinical strength for a few months, and that was working wonderfully. However, i noticed that this was cheaper, so i decided to try it. I was very disappointed.  The smell is strong and unpleasant.  The wetness protection is not even close to that of degree. I can&#x27;t even use up the one that I bought because the smell bothers me so much. I will definitely be switching back to degree.</li>
    <li> This Suave Clinical Protection worked a little better than I expected, but was not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that while it did not let me stink, it did let some wetness come trough. I don&#x27;t like the feeling of wet or damp armpits, so this was disappointing. I&#x27;ve tried many different deodorants in my time and this seems to be an issue with a lot of them, whether Clinical Strength, or not. It doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin after shaving, so that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this deodorant is nice, but strong. It is more of a floral scent, to me. Not what I would think of as \\&quot;sunshine.\\&quot; However, the \\&quot;Everlasting\\&quot; part is true - the scent lasts a long time after you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This I the first time I have used a Suave brand product in about 15 years, so I was a little surprised with the quality  - it did seem to be pretty decent. I probably would not buy this one though, because it does allow the wetness as the day goes on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not picky about scents, but this one is a no-go for me. I LOVE THEIR powder version... it&#x27;s my favorite deodorant. But this one just smells too close to yucky armpits that I can&#x27;t tolerate it. I guess I just wore too many deodorants that didn&#x27;t work well when I was a teen and they all had this sour flower scent to them so I don&#x27;t appreciate it.  The scent is too strong and overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as keeping me dry, it works decent. For some reason the powder version works GREAT; this one is sub-par compared to it but it does do the job and keeps the odor down and relatively dry.  So I can&#x27;t recommend this one, but I do recommend the http://www.amazon.com/Suave-Protection-Anti-perspirant-Deodorant-1-7-Ounce/dp/B001FSK8Q2/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hpc_3</li>
    <li> I actually really liked this product.  I tend to often shower at night and liked that the recommended directions were to apply it before bed.  It worked well and the smell was sweet but not clingy or overpowering.  I didn&#x27;t break out or itch or anything strange. It went on smoothly and kept me dry all day. Is there really more you need from an anti-perspirant/deodorant combo?</li>
    <li> The Suave Clinical Protection Antiperspirant offers long lasting protection but is still gentle enough for daily use. I am not sure why it is called \\&quot;Everlasting Sunshine\\&quot; since it reminds me of vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Long Lasting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Smells a bit too much like vanilla - the scent is very strong. Goes on strong but the scent does fade throughout the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Did not cause any type of rash or irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Goes on wet but it dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Have not noticed it staining any of my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict - Another great product by Suave - While it is not my absolute favorite scent it is a long lasting product that is gentle enough for daily use, but strong enough that you can survive beyond 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 Stars</li>
    <li> Love this new genre of deodorant.  The smell of this everlasting sunshine is a bit more than the powder one or lavender one but nonetheless a great antiperspirant that is better than the old ones.</li>
    <li> A little over a year ago, my teenage daughter insisted that she had to use a clinical deodorant because the \\&quot;other\\&quot; deodorants did not work sufficiently &amp; allowed her to perspire even when just doing basic school stuff (class change, lunch chat, etc).  She had been using Ban [[ASIN:B000GCE99U Unscented Invisible Solid Antiperspirant Deodorant by Ban, 2.6 Ounce]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has now tried 4 different clinical deodorants and, despite the fact that they all contain the same active ingredient - Aluminum Zicronium Tetrachlorohydrex GLY 20% , she has declared that 2 brands are heroes &amp; 2 brands are zeros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The losers:  Suave Clinical &amp; Dove Clinical&lt;br /&gt;The winners: Degree Clinical &amp; Secret Clinical&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why?  Even after wearing all of the brands multiple times, she cannot tell you why she thinks one brand works better than the others.  We looked at ingredients, application, and activity level.  There was no rhyme or reason.  She continued to feel that Degree &amp; Secret kept her drier.  Her verdict was that her results with the Suave &amp; Dove brand were the same as her results with Ban (Aluminum Zicronium Tetrachlorohydrex GLY 19%).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the 2 different Suave Clinical deodorants tried, she preferred the powder fresh scent over the everlasting sunshine scent (which was deemed, \\&quot;yuck\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:  if you need a clinical deodorant, go with Degree or Secret.</li>
    <li> I fearded this would have too feminine an odor, but the everlasting sunshine fragrance seems perfectly okay to me without being overly feminine but suitable also for guys.  And it does protect throuout the day.  I&#x27;m quite satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Now that warm weather is here, a reliable deodorant is a must.  This deodorant keeps me dry and has a pleasant, not too strong scent. Suave products are always reasonably priced and this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works just as well as the $8-10 clinical strength brands.  Just wish they had more than one scent for subscribing...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using &#x27;clinical protection&#x27; ever since they&#x27;ve been available over-the-counter.  Dove, Suave, you name it.  This one, [[ASIN:B006VTIPHY Suave Clinical Protection AntiPerspirant Deodorant, Everlasting Sunshine, 1.7 Ounce]], works very well - but the scent- Everlasting Sunshine - is a good name.  The scent isn&#x27;t unpleasant in itself, but it is extremely strong and lasts a long, long time.  I have a sensitive sense of smell, so this is very distracting to me.  I do not prefer to wear perfume so having something so noticeable on isn&#x27;t my first choice.  However, I&#x27;m finishing up the tube, so it isn&#x27;t horrible.  But the important part, in my opinion, is that it controls perspiration well.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite deodorant. I love this smell more than anything. I&#x27;ve tried so many and I tend to just sweat right through them and I&#x27;m very self conscious about that. I started trying some combinations and I&#x27;ve found that if I use a little of the Suave Invisible Solid (or any other brand, type solid) first and then use this on top, it works amazing! I think of it like a makeup primer...you need the primer to help it last longer. I don&#x27;t layer on the bottom solid a bunch, just a couple quick swipes and this over it. It lasts all day and night without any issues.</li>
    <li> It definitely does the job.  I stay dry and no body odor.  Clinical under arm products are the only ones that work for me. Some are better than others and this one is very good at keeping me dry and keeping any odor away however, I do not like the smell.  It is very strong sweet smell like candy. A very sweet candy.  It fades after awhile, but for the price and how good it works I will probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> I really want to like this but I don&#x27;t like how it smells. This may be my personal preference, but it smells like a very sweet vanilla. It does transfer quite easily onto clothes. As a cheaper alternative this is great, the generic drug store brands are terrible and this one definitely stops sweating better than standard deodorants. It&#x27;s comfortable and doesn&#x27;t flake or bead up. So if you don&#x27;t mind sweet vanilla scents I think you will be very happy with this.</li>
    <li> Everlasting Sunshine is the perfect name for this!  What a refreshing springtime fragrance.  This deodorant goes on smooth with no clumps, lumps or white residue like some deodorants do. It has a very pleasant smell that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm the senses.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased that its protection lasted all day and didn&#x27;t leave me that uncomfortable sticky feeling either.&lt;br /&gt;I like the way this deodorant feels on me and I really like the fact that there is no white powdery residue.</li>
    <li> Our house gives Everlasting Sunshine a thumbs up and recommends you give it a try.  The smell is nice, the product goes on well and seems to work well.  Our only problem was that the directions recommended putting it on before you go to bed -- the smell was just enough to keep light sleepers awake.  Other than that, recommended.</li>
    <li> Almost 1/2 the price of other brands...works just as well</li>
    <li> Keeps you dry lasts all day</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It works as well as the other &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength brand but costs less.</li>
    <li> I like the protection it gives me and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I received Suave Clinical Protection AntiPerspirant Deodorant, Everlasting Sunshine from the Vine program and couldn&#x27;t wait to test it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A. TEST 1 - Being around a seven and 5 year old all day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have my grandson and daughter every day while their parents work and they tire me out! They have so much energy and in this case, in addition to chasing after them, I put it to the test with yard work, gardening, housekeeping, cooking, walking and doing this in 80-90 degree weather. Throughout the day, I did an underarm check and sure enough, no sweat and no perspiration or odor. And by the way, I don&#x27;t get the people complaining about the strong scent it has. Maybe they have a keen sense of smell but it smelled lovely to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B. TEST 2 - The Gym&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the kiddies go home, I go to the gym every other day. After a rigorous workot, no sweat, no perspiration, no odor under the arms. Everywhere else however, soaked! I wonder if they could make this in a body spray. Hmmmmm...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL RESULT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the solid worked perfectly for me. One thing I was concerned about was an allergic reaction because I tend to be sensitive. Thankfully though I didn&#x27;t have any problem with this anti-perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would deffinitely buy this product again because it worked so well. So, there you have it. Tested and approved!</li>
    <li> My partner uses this product daily since we got it, and he loves it. He says its the best deodorant he&#x27;s ever used. It keeps him very dry, and he tends to work up a sweat with very little effort. With his recommendation, and he&#x27;s difficult to please, I can tell you this is a great product!</li>
    <li> Note that the blurb on Amazon states how well Suave Everlasting Sunshine works \\&quot;while resting.\\&quot; Definitely while resting, because it didn&#x27;t work for me when not resting. The deodorant scent is strong. If my clothes don&#x27;t smell like B.O., they sure smell like Suave deodorant. It&#x27;s sweet and fresh but very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like: I like the dispensing mechanism. Turn the knob and deodorant comes out of the holes in the top. I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to dry, I don&#x27;t have white marks all over my clothes, and it really does work when resting. 3 ½ stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM: I would like to add that instructions say to use it at bedtime for maximum protection, but the product can also be used in the morning. I used it in the mornings, because that&#x27;s easier than having to remember to do it at night.</li>
    <li> This item, unlike some other brands, smells exactly like the body wash which smells exactly like the lotion which smells exactly like the conditioner and so on lol. With some brands, their \\&quot;matching\\&quot; items smell nothing alike. These, aside from smelling so wonderful and serene, all match up. And, the protection of this Clinical Strength deodorant is just as nice as the $15 Clinical Strength brands on the top drugstore shelves! Found only the solid (yes it smells the same too lol) in my area so I keep the Clinical Strength on Amazon auto-sending because it&#x27;s the only kind I purchase now.</li>
    <li> My only real complaint about this deodorant is that it just isn&#x27;t as powerful as other clinical strength deodorants.  So those looking for some truly serious protection would best look elsewhere.  But if the most powerful of the powerful is not a necessity, this is a great deodorant that is stronger than the regular stuff, is very soothing to underarms, and has a wonderful fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have always been a Secret anti-perspirant user and for my first time in a long time trying another brand I was pretty impressed.  I like how easily it glided on and that even after using this for a couple of weeks I never had to deal with it caking on when applied.  It also absorbs into my skin relatively quickly which is a plus since I am nearly always time-starved in the morning but dislike getting deodorant stains on my shirt.  The scent is also mild and not overpowering.  I like it a little bit better than some of the other Suave deodorant scents because it smells vaguely floral and vanilla-y, but without being overpowering or smelling like perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I disagree with is that this lasts 24-hours.  Not for me.  Usually by morning, especially if the room is warm, I&#x27;m sweating again with a little bit of odor.  However I can easily make it through 12 hours just fine.  I think clinical protection can make it sound like this bridges the gap between OTC and prescription deodorants and that&#x27;s a little it of an over promise.  It performs well for a deodorant, but not necessarily noticeably better than others from a longevity standpoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a solid anti-perspirant.</li>
    <li> First, I confess, I am one of those people who for most of my life had those underarm circles of sweat, pretty much no matter how I tried to address it--wearing short sleeves in winter, going through &#x27;dress shields&#x27;, you name it.  It&#x27;s silly that our culture gets us so hung up on stuff like that, but there you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s all to say, when I say this stuff works, I&#x27;m telling you it works on someone who was a serious sweat hog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I tend to hate perfumed deodorants, because, hey, thanks for guaranteeing you&#x27;ll clash with any perfume I put on, but this is subtle enough that it&#x27;s not overpowering.  And it&#x27;s not syrupy or bubblegummy in scent, either, but a nice bright &#x27;clean laundry&#x27; kind of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Smells nice, does the trick. It DOES leave some white residue though. It does not get on my clothes, but if I start to sweat, and I am wearing a tank top, I can see it on my arm pits, kinda gross.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit that Secret does this too:  they call their clinical strength deodorant \\&quot;solid\\&quot; when it&#x27;s really a cream.  Either way I like them both, however, I like Secret&#x27;s just a tad bit better.  I was able to use two of their deodorants and they are exactly the same (which is why my reviews are the same).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use deodorant in areas of my body where chafing occurs.  Regular deodorant doesn&#x27;t cut it sometimes.  Clinical USUALLY works.  As I stated, I like Secret better but this comes in at a close second.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant i&#x27;ve had in a long time. there something about it that&#x27;s in this product that masks the musky deodorant smell i usually experience. def recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best antiperspirant deodorant I have ever used.  It keeps me dry.  It is also the least expensive Clinical antiperspirant I have used.  I love Suave Clinical!</li>
    <li> Although it seems to have the same active ingredients (Aluminum Zicronium Tetrachlorohydrex GLY 20%) as the Secret Clinical strength antiperspirant it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well for me. On the bright side it is a bit cheaper but then I find that I have to use more and that it stains my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried the Powder Fresh scent and I prefer this one.</li>
    <li> The Suave product line is great for a few reasons, the least of which is that it&#x27;s a very affordable product line: everlasting sunshine deodorant has a pleasant smell, it smells sweet and flowery but not too perfumey.  It has a hint of something more, and this clinical protection version is 20% aluminum, so extra strength basically, and on the higher end of Suave products - it works great and smells great too!</li>
    <li> This deodorant anti antiperspirant takes forever to dry. So if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t want to sit on your bed naked for 10 minutes while you wait for it to dry so you can get dressed, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> FINALLY a reliable deodorant that lasts!!!  Follow their directions to apply at bedtime for extra effectiveness!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this to compare to [[ASIN:B001ECQ58E Dove Clinical Protection Antiperspirant/Deodorant, Cool Essentials, 1.7 oz Stick (Pack of 2)]] as I am always curious about the difference in products among all the brands. The main ingredient that provides the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; antiperspirant effect -- aluminum Zirconium tetrocholorohydrex GLY 20% - is identical in both. As far as I can tell, the only differences are the scents (I prefer the Cool Essentials cucumber smell) to the more floral smell with the Suave) and my notion that the Dove deodorant is a bit more creamy vs the powdery feel of the Suave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has been dermatologist tested and it does not contain aluminum chloride or alcohols that have been known to cause skin irritation, itching or discomfort even on freshly shaved areas. It glides on smoothly once the white product is forced up through the holes in the applicator. You don&#x27;t need to use much to get the effect you want and the protection lasts for at least 24 hours. No white marks on dark clothing either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally apply this type of product in the morning, but may try it at night before bed to allow it time to acclimate to my body as suggested on the package. I will likely buy this product and will check out other scents.</li>
</ol>
