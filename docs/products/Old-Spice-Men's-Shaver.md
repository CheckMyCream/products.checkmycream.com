      <li>Great Product.</li>
      <li>Great job.</li>
      <li>Good price works great</li>

      <li>(I never keep a dense beard - just nicely groomed shadow).  </li>
      <li>My boyfriend loved it :)</li>
      <li>plus it&#x27;s handy that it has everything attached to the machine so you don&#x27;t have to worry about changing heads to use it,</li>
      <li>liked the design and the charger of this shaver.</li>
      <li>I were enjoyable and gorgeous.</li>
      <li>This Old Spice Braun razor is awesome.</li>
      <li>Works great on short whiskers, but if you have a 2 or 3 day growth not so great.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite things about the trimmer : the packaging and the product design to my</li>
      <li>There are much better options for $50.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used any of the trimming attachments yet, but as a shaver it&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
      <li>I love this thing.  </li>
      <li>The guards included would probably work better for longer beards.</li>
      <li>The shaver works alot better without using shaving cream.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall. 5 stars for everything from design, to build quality, to usefulness, to innovative thinking on the part of Braun. bravo</li>
      <li>I have most recently been accomplishing this awesome look with 3...</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;Overall. 5 stars for everything from design, to build quality, to usefulness, to innovative thinking on the part of Braun.</li>
      <li>I love this thing.  </li>
      <li>Got it free from BzzAgent to test!</li>
      <li>The trimmer however has been excellent especially considering you can flip it 180 degrees...</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
      <li>One adjustable length beard trimmer to make sure the goatee doesn&#x27;t get away from me.  </li>
      <li>and all, if you need a good every day shaver and good trimmer is important to you than this is a very good buy for a very good price, however i am sure for some extra cashyou could probably get yourself a more powerful shaver with a longer lasting battery.</li>
      <li>Having received this product for free from Braun to test and review, I can honestly say that it does a pretty good job.</li>
      <li>Also the trimmer is pretty good, he shapes and grooms is goatee with it and It has never looked better.</li>
      <li>I was able to use it in the shower just fine.</li>
      <li>They are easy on easy off.</li>
      <li>Very practical razor, I very love.</li>
      <li>The machine takes about 2 - 3 hours for a full charge which is allot faster then most of the electric shavers out there.&lt;br /&gt;Faults:&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall it was a great product and was easy to use</li>
      <li>light weight</li>
      <li>One electric razor to keep the sides smooth for my lady friend.  </li>
      <li>That’s wayyyy to much maintenance for someone who hates shaving and doesn’t have time to do that kind of maintenance.</li>
      <li>I received the product for free to review.  </li>
      <li>Its not fulfilling my need, not able to do perfect trim.</li>
      <li>Maybe I love having a wireless shaver more than I love the actual product.  </li>
      <li>So full disclosure I got this trimmer free for market research.</li>
      <li>Since I don&#x27;t clean shave myself</li>
      <li>That being said, at least it does have lots more trimming options than most devices, so if you&#x27;re looking for an all in one electric device, this is probably a good bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I gave this as a Christmas present, and the recipient says he&#x27;s delighted.  </li>
      <li>Who knows, maybe I’d love a Phillips just as much who knows.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe more companies aren&#x27;t putting out some sort of all in one to accomplish these tasks, but there isn&#x27;t much out there.  </li>
      <li>The trimmer is sleek with a high quality feel in the rubberized portions, and actually fits quite beautifully into the hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so different things work best for different people.  </li>
      <li>I keep short stubble on my face most of the time, and this wasn&#x27;t really able to do that.  </li>
      <li>This product is good ,but nt much handy to use as the trimmer and shaver position is nt friendly use, for my beard which is very hard</li>
      <li>If you are going for a slightly stubbly look, or are maintaining a beard, this razor does great.</li>
      <li>Also, this unit isn&#x27;t really just easy to find in stores... or online for that matter.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend this product!!!</li>
      <li>Its a great little device</li>
      <li>, this scores pretty high marks - it gives close shaves and comes with a ton of trimming add-ons (though I haven&#x27;t tried many since I don&#x27;t keep a beard).</li>
      <li>the smaller head is really nice to get into the portions around the ears under the nose.</li>
      <li>This razor gives a better shave than the old model.</li>
      <li>I read all of the reviews, I made my decision, and I ordered the old spice version because it looks cooler on my counter top.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion though, if you shave frequently (like every day or two), a manual razor with shaving cream is still better for speed and efficiency.</li>
      <li>I still prefer my rotary electric shaver over this foil style shaver, but it is still worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
      <li>Well worth the $</li>
      <li>, I just honestly feel that other shavers would be much more adept at handling real beards, or actual electric shaving.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin that gets irritated easily and</li>
      <li>His favorite part is the shaving foil (surprising, I though it sould be the less favorite based on other reviews).</li>
      <li>: I would recommend it to men who keep some facial hair style and want easy and comfortable precision trimming.</li>
      <li>and it charges super fast, plus the fact you can use it in the shower and with gel and shaving cream</li>
      <li>Also, he says that for an electric shaver the shave is pretty damn close.</li>
      <li>when i pushed order i didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, I&#x27;ve heard great feedback from braun in the past but never tried it myself...</li>
      <li>Also read some where people were complaining about having to go over the same area more than once....</li>
      <li>Also read some where people were complaining about having to go over the same area more than once....</li>
      <li>and I have to go back over places many times to get a decent shave.</li>
      <li>This piece of hardware has a great wide trimmer for getting rid of a lot of hairs and style your beard and the trimmer also turns into a thinner smaller trimmer which can allow you to style with greater perfection and get to harder to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
      <li>In fact, this certainly gives me a closer shave than any rotary electric razor</li>
      <li>It holds a decent charge, and has been consistent for two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> Did this unit meet my needs.... ?&lt;br /&gt;It EXCEEDED it !&lt;br /&gt;One word............  &amp;#34; INCREDIBLE &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Braun made the unit....so how can anyone complain.&lt;br /&gt;it looks nice and it&#x27;s the Ferrari of Electric Shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used any of the trimming attachments yet, but as a shaver it&#x27;s just ok.  It misses quite a few hairs and I have to go back over places many times to get a decent shave.</li>
    <li> Husband didn&#x27;t care for the shaver. Not as close as the 3 head rotating heads.</li>
    <li> Works great on short whiskers, but if you have a 2 or 3 day growth not so great. Runs well and charges well.</li>
    <li> Has problems actually trimming a beard. And I don&#x27;t have a tough one.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product through a BZZ Agent Campaign. I have to say that this was a pretty decent shaver overall. You do get a very close shave using this product. But I noticed that i would still have a few hairs here and there on my face and couldn&#x27;t get those off. I ended up having to get a regular razor to get those few places. The shaver works alot better without using shaving cream. Overall it was a great product and was easy to use but I dont think its worth the price now that ive been using this product over the past few months.</li>
    <li> It was a Gift and receiver was really happy about the product.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband for last Christmas and he really likes it.</li>
    <li> It works in the shower which is a plus and trims sideburns and mustache nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Says it works with shaving cream however I have found that the results are less than adequate.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t get a completely smooth shave like I do with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;For this reason I will stick to my razor.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun CruZer 3 for the last 8 years. I used it for shaving every day and cutting my hair every 2 weeks. I have a short crew cut so the wide trimmer with attachment worked nice enough. The trimmer broke off the razor so I bought this new model. I read where it was the same as the CruZer 6 and cost less. This razor gives a better shave than the old model. It gives a good haircut for someone with short hair even though it is advertised as not for cutting hair. It really is the swiss army knife of electric shavers and I think I made a very good buy.</li>
    <li> I had previously owned many Norelco dry shavers which were not very good and left me with cuts and bruises and did not give me such a close shave. as a result of the aforementioned fact i decided to buy this Old Spice Wet &amp; Dry Shave &amp; Trim. when i pushed order i didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, I&#x27;ve heard great feedback from braun in the past but never tried it myself...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, let me just say, out of the box this shaver looks beautiful. This shaver is  basically the equivalent of the braun Cruzer 6 with a red old spice twist so if you wanna find reviews and videos about the shaver just search &amp;#34;BRAUN CRUZER 6&amp;#34; on youtube or google. In this review i would like to point out four great things about the shaver and two faults which i noticed in this shaver which is why i gave it four stars.&lt;br /&gt;Great things:&lt;br /&gt;1. This shaver gives a much closer shave then the Norelco shavers and does not leave any nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;2. This piece of hardware has a great wide trimmer for getting rid of a lot of hairs and style your beard and the trimmer also turns into a thinner smaller trimmer which can allow you to style with greater perfection and get to harder to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;3. This shaver comes with many add on pieces, it comes with a custom 4 length brush for the the wide trimmer and a one length brush&lt;br /&gt;for the thin trimmer. It also comes with a  one length brush for the shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;4. The machine takes about 2 - 3 hours for a full charge which is allot faster then most of the electric shavers out there.&lt;br /&gt;Faults:&lt;br /&gt;1. The shaver does leave some hairs unshaven, so i sometimes have to go over the same places two or three times.&lt;br /&gt;2. The shaver cannot be used while charging which is quite an annoyance considering the battery only lastes about 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;All and all, if you need a good every day shaver and good trimmer is important to you than this is a very good buy for a very good price, however i am sure for some extra cashyou could probably get yourself a more powerful shaver with a longer lasting battery.</li>
    <li> This was a complete waste of time and money. It did not deliver anything resembling a close shave.</li>
    <li> After having this product for a few weeks I can honestly say it will get the job done.I still prefer my rotary electric shaver over this foil style shaver, but it is still worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;With all the attachments and different trimming features you will deffinately get your moneys work. The battery life is excellent. I would reccommend this product</li>
    <li> I think it is a nice shaver if you have less or average amount of hair. It works well for me( i use dry shaving) but I did not like the beard guard, it did not work for me, maybe if you have a longer beard it may work for you.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the design and the charger of this shaver.</li>
    <li> really good plus it&#x27;s handy that it has everything attached to the machine so you don&#x27;t have to worry about changing heads to use it, light weight and it charges super fast, plus the fact you can use it in the shower and with gel and shaving cream it&#x27;s awesome I definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> This shaver works well as beard trimmer if you keep it pretty short (I never keep a dense beard - just nicely groomed shadow).  I&#x27;d imagine that it would feel uncomfortable or hard to use if your beard exceeded a centimeter or more.  The charge lasts pretty long which is a plus, but you cannot charge while you shave if you are in a hurry.  The shaver portion of this device is very uncomfortable and does not provide a close shave.  I have had terrible results with both light shaving cream and dry shaving - making me use my old razor whenever I really want to be smooth and clean.  The various pieces that come with it are durable and efficient.  It does do its job, I just honestly feel that other shavers would be much more adept at handling real beards, or actual electric shaving.  This shaver works for me, but it feels like it doesn&#x27;t do any one job well - more like several jobs averagely.</li>
    <li> pretty good,but not excellent.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a Christmas present, and the recipient says he&#x27;s delighted.  He said it gives a good shave, and he likes the looks of it, too.</li>
    <li> ***** I couldn&#x27;t ask for more. Great job. Nice product. Will hope to do another transaction with you in the future.</li>
    <li> This product is good ,but nt much handy to use as the trimmer and shaver position is nt friendly use, for my beard which is very hard it&#x27;s nt working efficiently,</li>
    <li> Very practical razor, I very love.</li>
    <li> 50/50&lt;br /&gt;only for young skin</li>
    <li> Great Product. Item as described. Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> Good price works great</li>
    <li> I feel this work is well recommended</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved it :) His favorite part is the shaving foil (surprising, I though it sould be the less favorite based on other reviews). He claims it will save him a lot on disposable razors and that it is so much less irritating than regular razors. Also, he says that for an electric shaver the shave is pretty damn close. But keep in mind every skin and hair is different, he has very white sensitive skin and his hair is thin and straight. Also the trimmer is pretty good, he shapes and grooms is goatee with it and It has never looked better. I&#x27;m a fan of his beard, that&#x27;s why I got this for him. I also was worried about his face getting irritated every time he shaved his cheeks and neck. I totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer &amp; shaver. Well worth the $</li>
    <li> I have used this type of razor in the past. It was a good buy then and a good buy now. You need to be careful of the red beard guide. It will break or snap off the razor without putting much pressure on it.</li>
    <li> Worked good in the beginning as I got it as a campaign off of bzzagent. Its a great little device but it has its faults. The trim part does not work that all to great. And the shave part irratated my skin with shaving cream. I do recommend to have around but not as the main shaver. Thanks</li>
    <li> Having received this product for free from Braun to test and review, I can honestly say that it does a pretty good job. This trimmer is great for keeping a beard or goatee neat and trimmed. However, it does not give the same close shave that a regular razor does. You can also get the occasional tugging and does not work that well with shaving gel. If you are going for a slightly stubbly look, or are maintaining a beard, this razor does great. There&#x27;s plenty of versatility as well, having 2 different sideburn trimmers along with the shaver and beard attachments. It holds its charge very well and doesn&#x27;t take to long to charge either. Overall, a good electric razor, but not a complete replacement for a standard razor.</li>
    <li> At first glance, one may wonder how to use such a complicated machine.  But this shaver is truly a simple machine.  It cuts down hairs without any effort on your part, and the interchangeable blades take care of all the precision.  I would highly suggest purchasing this product if you&#x27;re trying to tame that wild beast living on your face.</li>
    <li> So full disclosure I got this trimmer free for market research. Anyway my overall impression is pretty strong but that doesn&#x27;t mean its not without faults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First is the packaging, if I spend $60, on a trimmer I want it to have an unboxing experience, this is so commonly overlooked and the product is simply placed into the box in the most efficient manner. This is one of my favorite things about the trimmer : the packaging and the product design to my I were enjoyable and gorgeous. The trimmer is sleek with a high quality feel in the rubberized portions, and actually fits quite beautifully into the hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s big selling point of being completely waterproof isn&#x27;t really my thing as I explicitly shave before the shower however I tested it out anyway and it does work as advertised. I keep a medium length beard however I still shave my neck down completely, I think this is the biggest con for me because my hair is rather curly and I had an extremely difficult time getting a perfectly clean shave with the actual shaving part. The trimmer however has been excellent especially considering you can flip it 180 degrees... the smaller head is really nice to get into the portions around the ears under the nose. It holds a decent charge, and has been consistent for two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final: I would recommend it to men who keep some facial hair style and want easy and comfortable precision trimming. Since I don&#x27;t clean shave myself it&#x27;s hard to say but I might tell those guys who do to maybe look for something else. Anyone looking for something explicitly to shave in the shower with this is definitely the best waterproof machine I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This Old Spice Braun razor is awesome. It comes with a lot of extras and it is very convenient to use because it is a Wet &amp; Dry razor. I highly recommend this product! This product was sent to me for review.</li>
    <li> Worked great!! I have really tough facial hair and most electric shavers don&#x27;t give me the close shave that I need for work or leave hairs behind. But this is the first shaver that I&#x27;ve used that actually does the job that it&#x27;s intended to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> As a man with a pretty nice beard, I have been having a hard time getting a handle, literally, on the Old Spice Wet &amp; Dry Shave &amp; Trim. It&#x27;s rather hard for me to get a good hold on it to give me that precision trim I&#x27;m looking for. I seem to have a hard time seeing certain parts of my face while holding the shaver. I do like that it&#x27;s something I can use with shaving cream and get wet. I looked up the price on Walmart.com and it was $60!! I definitely would not pay that much money for this razor. It&#x27;s amazing to have received such a fancy item for free to try and review, courtesy of BzzAgent, but, unless I hit the lottery and have countless amounts of money to spend, I won&#x27;t be purchasing a replacement if this one breaks down. I applaud Old Spice for really stepping into what seems to be a new line of products for them, but I think they need to do a little bit more work on this shaver. Also, I would recommend figuring out how to bring the cost way down.&lt;br /&gt;The Old Spice Wet &amp; Dry Shave &amp; Trim is a really attractive tool and I will continue using it over my previous one strictly because it&#x27;s so versatile, and neat to have. I will pair it with my personal trimmer to get those hard to see areas. It&#x27;s convenient to have a Wet &amp; Dry tool for whatever fits the right mood.</li>
    <li> Got this piece of crap for a gift from my lovely wife. Takes 15 minutes to shave and only plus is the 2 pop out shavers for sideburns.  There are much better options for $50.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this item would work well being a Braun but they failed with this particular shaver/trimmer. The trimmer would not set at different length&#x27;s only the closest. The shaver left hairs and took forever to get even a half way decent shave. I returned it and got a Panasonic along with a Mangroomer trimmer and am very happy with both.</li>
    <li> A quick side note on the instructions: The instruction booklet is confusing with lots of small icons. Given that this razor has lots of parts/add-ons that come with it, a slightly clearer instruction booklet would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the actual shaving:&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of shave: I usually shave with a manual/wet razor (a Gillette ProGlide). In terms of closeness, this Old Spice razor gives a much closer shave than using the manual razor in-the-direction-of-the-grain. In fact, it gives almost as close a shave as using a manual razor against-the-grain. Since I often avoid using a manual razor against-the-grain as it tends to give me razor burns, this Old Spice lets me get that closeness without the burns. In fact, this certainly gives me a closer shave than any rotary electric razor I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like every other electric razor I&#x27;ve tried, it does however take much longer to shave with this thing than with my manual ProGlide as you often have to make multiple passes with this. Since I shave everyday and don&#x27;t want to spend more than a few minutes shaving, I find my self using the ProGlide frequently, and this on the weekends when I have time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for all the fancy add-ons this comes with, I&#x27;ve only used one (as I don&#x27;t have a beard), and I&#x27;ve found it harder to get a consistent length than a specialized trimmer. That being said, at least it does have lots more trimming options than most devices, so if you&#x27;re looking for an all in one electric device, this is probably a good bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, for an electric razor, this scores pretty high marks - it gives close shaves and comes with a ton of trimming add-ons (though I haven&#x27;t tried many since I don&#x27;t keep a beard). In my opinion though, if you shave frequently (like every day or two), a manual razor with shaving cream is still better for speed and efficiency.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great as a trimmer, however it doesn&#x27;t get a close shave to get all the hair off. But the trimmer portion is really nice!!! Got it free from BzzAgent to test!</li>
    <li> I received this product as part of a BzzAgent Campaign and now use it daily. I have very sensitive skin that gets irritated easily and this combined with after shave gel works great on my skin. I would recommend it to any guy with sensitive skin looking for a shaver.</li>
    <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t get a perfectly close shave it worked quite well. I was able to use it in the shower just fine. I have dropped it quite a few times and still working. There are a couple attachments I have personally only used 2 of them. They are easy on easy off. Stays charged for a decent amount of time as well. Overall i would recommend if looking to replace an old razor but wouldn&#x27;t replace one that works just fine. #GotItFree</li>
    <li> Prior to receiving the Old Spice Wet &amp; Dry shaver, I had been using a $15 Phillips Norelco shaver...and loved it.  It&#x27;s lightweight, holds a long charge and worked really well.  This one from Old Spice isn&#x27;t necessarily bad...but isn&#x27;t worth $60.  I received the product for free to review.  I keep short stubble on my face most of the time, and this wasn&#x27;t really able to do that.  The guards included would probably work better for longer beards.</li>
    <li> The best electric shaver I have used yet.</li>
    <li> This shaver won&#x27;t even attempt to shave my legs - why?? Had to send it back for refund. Only part that sort of cut some of my leg hairs was the side burn part of it.</li>
    <li> Simply put: this thing rocks.</li>
    <li> the part is broken....</li>
    <li> Its not fulfilling my need, not able to do perfect trim. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something like this for along time.  I have used electric shavers for almost 20 years.  Through that time I have found that my skin/facial hair type prefers the foil/screen shavers over the circulars.  Everybody has a different thickness, grain and pattern of hair as well as different pores and skin sensitivity so different things work best for different people.  That being said, I keep a short goatee with smooth sides.  I have most recently been accomplishing this awesome look with 3... count them, 3 different appliances.  One interchangeable head trimmer/clipper to keep the sideburns and edges neat. One adjustable length beard trimmer to make sure the goatee doesn&#x27;t get away from me.  One electric razor to keep the sides smooth for my lady friend.  I was fed up, and so was she.  These 3 things, with chargers, took up a lot of counterspace, and made for a lot of little hairs (x3) all over.  Also, I would forget to rotate the 3 chargers into my 2 plugs available and inevitably wind up with one dead and not be able to complete my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Braun Cruzer series.  I can&#x27;t believe more companies aren&#x27;t putting out some sort of all in one to accomplish these tasks, but there isn&#x27;t much out there.  Also, this unit isn&#x27;t really just easy to find in stores... or online for that matter.  I came across it after much searching and was hopeful that it might be my solution.  I read all of the reviews, I made my decision, and I ordered the old spice version because it looks cooler on my counter top.  I assume the Cruzer5 and Cruzer6 would be just as good.  Here are my impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking it out of the box it came with a nice little charging stand (helping solve the cluttery countertop issue), the charging cable (nice coily type vs the long straight ones so, again, better for clutter and space), a brush and a few little attachments and things.  In playing around with it (since the instructions are all cartoons with no words) I found that one is a guard that just barely covers the foil to make stubbly shave (the wife won&#x27;t like that one) one is the beard trimmer attachment you see in the picture, and one is a little tiny guard that covers the smaller/detail side of the slide up trimmer so you can to eyebrows or something similar...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plugged it in, charged it up, and used it the next morning. Wow.  I love this thing.  It shaved my sides smoother than my last one (per the old lady), has 4 length settings for the beard trimmer... one being perfect for my style, and the edge trimmers worked wonderfully for the detail.  Some notes I will give that I think could have helped some previous reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a couple that said the beard trimmer didn&#x27;t really do much..... you have to actually slide the trimmer up to meet the bottom of the guard before you turn it on.  If you are expecting the foil shaver to catch your beard hairs you will be sorely disappointed.  Also read some where people were complaining about having to go over the same area more than once.... have you ever used an electric razor? It&#x27;s not a barber&#x27;s flat razor that mows everything down in one pass.  Most electrics will tell you to use a circular motion or pass the same area from different directions to achieve your desired results.  Also, if you have a day or 2 growth... no problem... if you have let it go a week and have some longer stuff going on... maybe razor it this time or trim it short with the detail trimmers first and then hit it with the foil.... no problem.  As far as the longevity of this unit... It seems well built and I feel that if I treat it with respect I should have no problems.  Some have said the guard adjustment for the beard trimmer gets loose.... if so I&#x27;ll just glue it in place.  I don&#x27;t really trick up my length much.... or ever. so....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall. 5 stars for everything from design, to build quality, to usefulness, to innovative thinking on the part of Braun. bravofound that one is a guard that just barely covers the foil to make stubbly shave (the wife won&#x27;t like that one) one is the beard trimmer attachment you see in the picture, and one is a little tiny guard that covers the smaller/detail side of the slide up trimmer so you can to eyebrows or something similar...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plugged it in, charged it up, and used it the next morning.

    <li> I love it.  Maybe I love having a wireless shaver more than I love the actual product.  Who knows, maybe I’d love a Phillips just as much who knows.  All I know is that I’ve turned into one of those guys you see shaving in his car in the parking lot outside of his office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven’t tested it in the shower and probably never will because after every wet shave you have to dry and oil it.  That’s wayyyy to much maintenance for someone who hates shaving and doesn’t have time to do that kind of maintenance.</li>
    <li> if you want a close shave then you will be disapointed with this. going over the same areas 5 and 6 times and still leaving much hair.</li>
