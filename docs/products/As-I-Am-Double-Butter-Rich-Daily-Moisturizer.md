      <li>I love it but some of it had run out.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product and will use it again. Great for moisturizing dry hair.  Will use again.  I am trying to avoid relaxers, so this works for now.</li>
    <li> This product moistures my hair nicely.  It gives it a nice shine and I only need a small amount.  I do not have to use it everyday. I imagine because the curling jelly also aids in giving my hair a nice sheen.</li>
    <li> Makes dry hair feel really good. I like this lind of products.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the truth.  After buying cold label and being disappointed I bought this at sallys beauty supply after doing some research online. And I love it.. My waves are crispy and my hair is moisturized. Great stuff.. Can&#x27;t wait to try their Co wash</li>
    <li> Light and fluffy. Its great!</li>
    <li> i love this moisturizer its smooth smells great, you don&#x27;t need much if you have a low cut</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth. Not greasy. No build up in your hair. Not too heavy, Lots of moisture and shine.</li>
    <li> Love it! I use it when I twist my hair and it really cuts down on frizz. I will buy this product again and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it...wonderful daily conditioner for my husband&#x27;s hair....smell is awesome too</li>
    <li> This cream does moisturize your hair.  The problem is that it somehow also flaked up my scalp--I switched from this product back to my old Jane Carter and other moisturizers and my scalp stopped itching and flaking.  Bummer</li>
    <li> Works amazing for thirsty curls. Decent smell, easy to wash out.</li>
    <li> I ordered the butter, moisturizer and curling jelly. All items came quickly and can&#x27;t wait to use them</li>
    <li> This product has a scent that is too overpowering for me. Plus it smells like candy and, as a grown woman,its not the way I want to smell. I don&#x27;t know why these companies think we want to smell like fruits, vegetables ,chocolate or coconut and candy Why is so hard to find a delicate, adult  feminine scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just growing my hair back after losing it to chemo and this cream is gentle, smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft, not greasy.  Love this for daily use.</li>
    <li> Did nothing but sit on top of my 4b/4c low porosity strands even though it has a nice whipped consistency. Would recommend this product for those with medium to high porosity hair.</li>
    <li> Love it...and so does my dry hair!</li>
    <li> I love it but some of it had run out.  You should package it differently.  Place it in a plastic bag or bubble wrap so if it runs out, it will stay in the bag and not get on everything else.  I believe I didn&#x27;t receive a full jar but I will keep it and use it.</li>
    <li> Awesome as usual. All thier products are wonderful for my 3b curly hair.  only complaint is the scent is too strong for those with fragrance senitivities.  JessiCurl make no fragrance 3b curly hair products.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, I used it everyday i wish the product came in a big bottle.  I would recommend this product to my friend.</li>
    <li> I have used this product 3 times so the jury is still out if I like it.  Its ok. Nothing good or bad not sure if I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have waves all around my head. Other wavers recommended it to maintain the moisture in my hair. It&#x27;s not used to hold. Don&#x27;t buy it and expect it to hold your hair because that&#x27;s not it&#x27;s purpose. Smells wonderful unlike a lot of products and it&#x27;s all natural. Leaves a nice shine too.</li>
    <li> Need I say more?  Okay, I think I will... think back to the days gone by when the infamous \\&quot;jheri curl\\&quot; was so popular, which by the way, made even the shortest of short hair grow.  Allow me to explain... everyyone&#x27;s hair grew because we KEPT IT MOISTURIZED &amp; as long as you moisturize the hair &amp; not the scalp so much, it will grow thick &amp; long as long as you nurse/feed it like we did those doggone jheri curls.  This product is FABULOUS &amp; smells ls so good</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  Its just not thick enough for my hair. My hair soaks up products do I need one that is thick.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I am going through a transitional period with my hair and I believe once my hair is healthy again I will like this even more.</li>
    <li> So I had bought this awhile ago used it on my relaxed hair I did not like so I put I away for awhile so when I went natural I used it on my hair I love it very nice texture the cream is and when I put it on my hair my hair felt light and my hair was not weigh down I love this cream</li>
    <li> It smells great, moisturises my hair but too much can weigh the hair down. However, it&#x27;s a great product and i would try it again when it&#x27;s finished</li>
    <li> it smells good and it makes your hair feel so soft;definetly worth the money and will last a long time</li>
    <li> I am a african american woman with natural hair. I use this as a moisturizer and it makes it soft whether its wet or dry! Love it i use it in conjunction with Honey Dew</li>
    <li> This moisturizes my hair so well I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t try it before! I tried the home remedies for a little while and they weren&#x27;t working out for me, but this does! And the smell is great too, which is a big deal because I have a horribly sensitive nose and most products are too strong for me.</li>
    <li> Works very well on my biracial son&#x27;s curly hair.  I generally apply it while his hair is still damp from his bath.  When I apply it to his dry hair (which is a finer texture) it&#x27;s a little too heavy.</li>
    <li> As I Am Double Butter Rich Daily Moisterizer is very rich and creamy, and did add softness to my natural hair.  The cream is very rich and heavy, so I would not recommend using it daily, but definitely as needed depending on your hair type.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  My hair is softer, don&#x27;t need anything extra.  I mostly wear braids right now but I still can tell the difference.  It keeps my own hair soft and no itching, no patting because it itches and no burning scalp because of dryness.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this stuff is terrible.  It has no &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; when you want to comb your hair out in the shower.  When you put this conditioner in your hair it just sort of dissipates into your hair and doesn&#x27;t moisturize it at all! I seriously don&#x27;t undertstand how anyone with curly hair would like this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, smells well and does what it says it meant to--- moisturise! I will definitely be using this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, every time I use this my hair feels really moisturized after I use it. I highly recommend this to anyone who has natural hair. I only wish this product came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> This is everything. I&#x27;m hooked. Perfect for daily revitalizing (I live in dry climes and my fine 3C hair has perpetually dry ends). It&#x27;s luxurious and my hair drinks it right up and is healthier than when I started using it. Will definitely be buying again. My twist outs have never been better.</li>
    <li> IT MAY BE DOUBLE BUTTER BUT I SURE CAN&#x27;T TELL CAUSE JUST AIN&#x27;T ENOUGH OIL FOR MY 4CB HAIR TYPE</li>
    <li> This was a very good purchase. I liked the flavor and will be buying this product again in the near future.</li>
    <li> oh my god i am in love wiyh this product i use it all i will be getting more but right now the price is to high i paid way less then that for this one when it goes down i will be buying more trust me</li>
    <li> The double butter cream has a very thick consistency and is hydrating.  After washing and deep conditioning my hair, I use this product when putting my hair in twists to let it air dry overnight. My hair is always soft, very moisturized and my curls are well defined. I also use this product to re-moisturize my hair during the week as well. I find that the more As I Am products I try, the more I love the product line in totality. Definite keeper in my hair care routine.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair nice and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Left my hair stringy and moisturised for only ten minutes. Dries out to nothing.</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT!!! It has a great smell, made my hair feel very soft, great for twist outs, and it elongated my curls. I will purchase this product again!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product but hate the price. Glad I ordered it though just yo try it out. It is available for a lower price at biggest chain of beauty supply stores (named after a lady). You get twice as much for $6 more.</li>
    <li> This product is by far the best for natural hair.  It keeps it moisturized throughout the day.</li>
    <li> this product is really good. It smells good and makes your hair feel so soft and smooth. I love it</li>
    <li> I am newly natural and I have this crazy mixture of 3C-4B hair.  I was in my local Sally&#x27;s to get a shower cap and I decided to walk around. I came upon this product and read what was in it. I needed something with no cones and other stuff that is considered bad for natural hair. I liked the ingredients, so I wanted to see what it looked like. I asked the lady if I could open the container to look at it. She walked over and opened it for me. It was white and creamy. Not that I was expecting something different. I LOVE THE SMELL! Its sweet, but not overly sweet ( well that&#x27;s my opinion) Even though its a thick-ish cream its quite light.  It keeps my hair pretty soft. I&#x27;m liking it.</li>
    <li> Works great will definitely keep using this product.</li>
    <li> It smells great and my hair feels soft after use. I love it.</li>
    <li> product works really good, and the smell is the best I have ever smelled</li>
    <li> smells good and feels so good on my hair. will definitely be using/trying other &#x27;as i am&#x27; products.</li>
    <li> Dried my hair out didn&#x27;t like it..</li>
    <li> This product really helps with my waves. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I actually love this it is a staple product for me.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good but not the best product i had try</li>
    <li> This is sooo creamy and moisturising. Definitely a new staple product!</li>
    <li> makes my hair smell great and feel soft but the moisturizer doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling moist for long...I use this daily and it leaves my hair feeling and looking great for a few hours and then the clock runs out and I&#x27;d either need to apply more or spritz with water to rehydrate things</li>
    <li> I really love this product!! I loved how it left my hair soft and moisturized and the smell was not overpowering. It had a nice fragrance to it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for natural hair</li>
    <li> Delivery in time. Love the product. I will come back to rate it if i use it. I attend to use 8n my daughter hair.</li>
    <li> Since going natural and reading myself to oblivion about hair regimens i finally added co washing to my bi weekly regimen and chose As I am. This co wash leaves my hair very soft and smells wonderful.  i co wash once a week and shampoo once a month. this helps keeps my 4c hair tamed for the most part and holds in moisture on my dry hair.</li>
    <li> I loveeeeeeee this moisturizer! If you are natural this product is a must! I did the big chop about 3 months ago and have been looking for a product like this. My hair used to be so dry, rough and not manageable. Not anymore! I use this moisturizer along with a little water and Jamaicain black castor oil. A little goes a long! You will not regret it ladies!! :)</li>
    <li> Dear Amazon, I am using this daily moisturizer on my different texture hair, then seal with a pinch of mixed oils by me, and I can honestly say that my hair is looking better and better everyday, and not to mention practically no shedding at all.  My hair even looks thicker and feels fuller.  It also did wonders on my ends, but since I love to used different products I am looking at other creams that are closely related, but its good to know you have AIM in stock.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and you only need a little bit. My hair was super dry and kinky and tight ... basically tangled and just with a little bit of this stuff it has that wet and wavy look and I was able to brush right through. Now it doesn&#x27;t keep the wet and wavy look but it does stay moisturized.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from WalMart for the same price and I absolutely love it! I use it on my hair for twist outs along with my Jane Carter Nourish and Shine and my hair feels sooo soft!! Would definitely recommend this product to natural women. Also keeps my hair very moisturized.</li>
    <li> I really cannot give a personal review because the product is not for my hair style.  It is for more natural styles.  My son loves it.  It would have been helpful if I could have read the directions. Honestly, the directions should be situated on the screen so they could be easily read before purchase.</li>
    <li> Softens my wife&#x27;s hair and smells terrific. Great for women with natural styled hair.</li>
    <li> I feel this product serves its purpose. At first I thought it would be similar to miss Jessie&#x27;s buttercream.....nope..its a moisturizer. It has thicker consistency than I imagined but I really like the scent and the moisturuxing effects</li>
    <li> This product really moisturizes you hair without making it feel too greasy and smells good too</li>
    <li> Great consistency. Arrived fast. Awesome product. Very creamy and not too heavy or too light. A happy medium that leaves my 3c/ 4a hair feeling soft and supple</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it had to grow on me at first because I was not use to moisturizing my hair, but once I got use to it I loved it. It leaves my hair so refreshed and moisturized for a good two- three days. I will definitely repurchase this again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all in how you use this product that yields the great results. I use the doublebutter cream moisturizer before I put in my styler. If I am doing wash and gos, I do the following: use a leave in condition, double butter cream, styler - either curling jelly or for my twist outs, the twisting cream - then seal with an oil (like Coconut or any favorite oil). The doublebutter is the moisturizing foundation for the styler. Even if you&#x27;re not just washing the hair, it&#x27;s a good idea to put a dab of the doublebutter moisturizer on before the styler. This is how moisture is sealed for longer periods of time. I suppose it could be used as a stand alone product, but I find it works best in combinations of products. I am a huge fan of the As I Am line. My hair loves all their products. And, it works well in conjuction with my Shea Moisture Coconut and Hisbiscus Curl Milk. I&#x27;ve finally found my holy grail line. **Update: A little goes a long way and I wait until it&#x27;s on sale with Amazon or other retailers. I am still quite pleased with this product - Kim October 18, 2015.</li>
    <li> Great, very conditioning and not too strongly scented.</li>
    <li> I have coily curls, very frizzy and hard to tame. I am always in a look out for something better to style and manage my hair. This product is the best curling cream so far! It is thick initially when u start applying but it does not feel heavy and waxy on your hair as most of the curling creams would. It doesn&#x27;t have strong perfume, feels very natural in my hair. Absolutely loved it!!!!</li>
    <li> I like this product the only thing is it leaves my hair kind wet which I don&#x27;t like but it does leave my hair soft it&#x27;s just too wet  usually when I use this product I&#x27;m going to bed so I put my scarf on. I don&#x27;t wear my hair out with this product its way too wet personally but it is a good product my hair is growing I have been using it a little over a month and I do massage my  head when I use it</li>
    <li> This butter will quench your hair thirst!! The consistency is thick and pleasant smelling, My sister loved it so much that she took it from me. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> As I Am has  a great product line for natural hair. I have at least 5 of their products. This product is great for moisture.</li>
    <li> It does smell nice and moisturizes your hair but it doesn&#x27;t last all day. Your hair will &amp;#34;frizz.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Hey everyone, I see a lot of great comments. I am going to try this and get back with a final result. For&lt;br /&gt;now I will give it a 5 star...let&#x27;s see if it stays the same or changes.</li>
    <li> i like the texture of this product. time will tell if i will purchase it again. a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I really love this product its good for natural kinky hair, it keeps it moisturize all day, the only thing is I wish it came bigger. I use it on me and my daughters hair, and because I moisturize everyday it didn&#x27;t last long about four to five days. I have short natural hair and she has shoulder length natural hair when blown out, and our hair is really thick and requires more product than usually. If your looking to use every so often this is a good amount but if your like me and use it everyday I wouldn&#x27;t recommend just because of the cost and size.</li>
    <li> Dries my hear out. I have a 4B/c hair type</li>
    <li> Great daily moisturizer. However I was very disappointed that the jar was half empty.  I don&#x27;t mind paying for quality but if the jar is supposed to hold 8oz then i should get all 8oz.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb!  I love the consistency of it and the way it feels on my hair.  It melts like &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; in my hair and makes it so soft.  It has such a pleasant feel to it and smell.  Will definitely reorder more.</li>
    <li> I am constantly on the prowl for products for natural hair products for my thick 4b/c hair, and have found that most moisturising products achieve their objectives either by making and keep the hair wet or may soften for a short period before eventually making the hair dry and brittle.  The As I Am Double Butter works well and makes my hair feel really soft without any wetness. My only concern is that I tend to have to use a lot on my hair and have to use it every day. It&#x27;s is pretty expensive and the small tub lasts me less than two weeks.  Not a really cost efficient product.</li>
    <li> It smells delightful.  Reminds me of cake or icing. It&#x27;s somewhat thick but not as thick as I&#x27;d liked it to be. I have VERY dry 4c hair. I tried this for twist outs. It works alright. But I&#x27;m looking for something more hydrating.</li>
    <li> This is very moisturizing. It smells sweet. I haven&#x27;t really figured a precise way I want to use it in my hair. For now, I&#x27;m adding it to hair after my conditioner and leaving some in after rinsing. I&#x27;m careful not too leave too much in because my hair will smell buttery. This might work as a good leave in spray. So overall, good product.</li>
    <li> I like how it kept my hair very moisturized... because I have been looking for a butter cream moisturizer for my hair. My hair likes butter types of moisturizers and it smells good too. This is my new staple!</li>
    <li> Too heavy for my hair.</li>
    <li> The double butter rich daily moisturizer starts the morning making your hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I purchased, Curl clarity Shampoo, Coconut  Cowash, Leave-in Conditioner, twist Define cream, moisture milk and Double butter cream. I regret this decision being as though i have been Natural for 7 years, my hair was strong and growing beautifully &amp; now it is dry and brittle and breaking off.  I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love the smell however as it says on the label its a daily moisturizer. I noticed that I would have to use it everyday to keep my hair moisturized or my hair would tend be dry the next day, I am transitioning and definitely need to keep moisturized hair..</li>
    <li> I love this product and will purchase it again.  Adds lots of moisture to my afro and truly smells great.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of most of As I Am products.  This Double Butter Cream is no exception.  It&#x27;s creamy, moisturizing and leaves my hair feeling wonderful.  I am going to have to see if they have a larger jar because I am almost out and it is really that good.  It is not super heavy like pure Shea butter; but is heavy enough to help keep my hair moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> I use this as a moisturizer between twist outs when I&#x27;m pulling my hair up in a bun or ponytail. It adds a nice smell and plenty of moisture without being greasy and without any residue of any kind (yay).  My hair is very thirsty and this cream seems to penetrate fairly well into my hair and keep my hair moisturized for more than one day. I did not find this to be a good choice for setting my twists. It just didn&#x27;t do what official twist creams do such as really define, create and hold the curl. However when I want my curls to just kinda spring back to life between twist outs, this is very good option. It doesn&#x27;t slick the hair down, just moisturizes and gives it a refreshed look when dry and brittle. It&#x27;s labeled as &amp;#34;Rich&amp;#34; but I find it to be light and fluffy, NOT heavy and rich...which I&#x27;m perfectly happy about.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of As I Am&#x27;s non-sulfate products with natural ingredients. I use this daily moisturizer in conjunction with the cleansing pudding, both of which result in shiny, ultra-soft, curls. Remember that every product works differently on various hair types, so keep the search to find the one that works for you. FYI: I wear my hair natural.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my daughter hair silky smooth. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing. The cream adds shine and softness without a heft of oiliness. Did I mention the smell! Sooooo yummy. I like that the first ingredients are natural components (water and extracts) but this isn&#x27;t entirely chemical free.</li>
    <li> This product feels great on my natural hair.  Keeps it moisture and feeling great. Best product for the money. I have found the product that I need to use for my natural hair.</li>
    <li> This natural product seems to have some unnatural ingredients because the moisture is short lived.  Shea Moisture is a much better product line.  I&#x27;m going back to it.</li>
    <li> I love the moisturizer!  It smells nice and provides the moisture my hair needs.</li>
    <li> Out most products I&#x27;ve used, this moisturizer works best for keeping hair soft in between washes. Looking forward to trying other products.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because of the rave review from my friend but I must say it didn&#x27;t wow me like it did her and everyone else.  For me it was just okay, it didn&#x27;t leave my hair any softer, shinier or more moisturized than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  In fact she gave me a sample of the AIA moisture milk and that was my \\&quot;WOW\\&quot; and what I now use faithfully. I love it!  So if the butter doesn&#x27;t work for you try the milk you may have better results...</li>
    <li> Okay, first I have to begin by saying that I appreicate the Beautiful Textures products the most. I use about 5 or 6 of the prodcuts to do twist outs when my hair is not in a protective style(braids, flat twist etc). I have tried 4 of the As I am Hair products(the Twist Defining Cream,Cleansing Pudding,Coconut cleansing wash(my favorite.)&lt;br /&gt;And I recently tried the doublebutter cream, using the LOC (Liquid, OIl, Cream) method. My twist were very tight(shrinkage) and my hair was not a visiably shiney(however to touch it was very moist)I am going to try this and add the MOisture Milk...&lt;br /&gt; At first I was not going to use this product again, as I have yet to get a satisfying result for the Twist Defining Cream, and I am still working on that product.Still this double butter wasn&#x27;t bad...I will keep in my rotations for days when I want a really really tight twist out....And by the way I got this from Duane Reades(WAlgreens) for 15.00. Not all of the stores carry them but a few do...... at least in my area.</li>
    <li> Co washes extremely well, but not a fan of the overly high artificial coconut scent however.</li>
    <li> More pasty than I expected.</li>
    <li> This producst is also awesome.  It made my hair soft and managable.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> Never knew moisture like this existed. So wonderful! Very thick and creamy and long lasting moisture. My kinks love this product</li>
    <li> Expensive but it is a last all day moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizer. It mostly smells like shea butter and nothing else really. It keeps my hair moisturized but it doesn&#x27;t make like a crazy magical difference. It&#x27;s just a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Just an average product in my opinion. It doesn&#x27;t appear to be an actual moisturizer for my hair- as it is just too liquidity.</li>
    <li> For me this product is the bomb,as some might will say.I like how it keeps my hair hydrated and soft,but most importantly I like how it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.I am running out of this product,and for me it&#x27;s worth the price.It lasted me a long time,now I need some more.</li>
    <li> I just used the product today, I have medium length locs. I washed my hair and used this product to re-twist my hair. Usually after I re-twist my hair the new growth defiantly stick up, but I didn&#x27;t have this problem at all. I may have found a product that has the ability to tame my wild natural hair. This is a great product I was told to try this product out, and even though the same company As I Am has a product especially for twists for the time being I will stay with this moisturizing product. I am so glad that I bought this when I did. If you are wondering whether your natural hair needs a moisturizer definitely try this product, it worked for me and I have locs</li>
    <li> Great product...i am only 4 months into getting off the crack cream and my hair is extremely difficult it comb. This product makes it so much easier. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. The only problem is the high price, but if it is going to prevent me from ripping and tearing out my hair while I&#x27;m trying to comb it, then it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Another great product for my African American hair, which is kinky, curly,  and straight (I have these three types of hair due to mixed lineage).  Just a little dab will do for big results.  My hair looks healthy and moisturized.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Great product to use after you wash with the As I Am Coconut CoWash .&lt;br /&gt;Great product to use daily!</li>
    <li> loving this it makes my natural hair soft n nice.</li>
    <li> Nice...not slippery so you can&#x27;t detangle well with it. It&#x27;s light, so it doesn&#x27;t provide much moisture in my hair..kinky curly..not sure if it&#x27;s a 4a/4b..sui I&#x27;m still looking for the ultimate softening product for my hair..anyone have any ideas please let me know.</li>
    <li> Made my hair smooth for days. I love the smell! Will try their other products.</li>
    <li> I recently used a friend&#x27;s Double Butter and was obligated to purchase it! I am newly natural and experimenting with various products. This leaves my hair very soft for days!  It adds great moisture and I will continue to buy it. I was somewhat disappointed by the 8oz size. I expected a larger size for the price. Nonetheless, it is worth the money.</li>
