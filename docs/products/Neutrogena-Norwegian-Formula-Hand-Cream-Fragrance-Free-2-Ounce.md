<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the only thing I have discovered which will &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; my dry and cracked hands.</li>
    <li> Works for hands, elbows, and any dry skin. It also works well for the scuffs on the leather of a steering wheel and gear shifter as you can imagine how that was discovered.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product a number of times for my sister-in-law.  She loves its results and especially appreciates the fact that it is fragrance-free.</li>
    <li> My hands, especially my knuckles, used to get (notice how it&#x27;s past tense) super dry.  Like...they would flake.  You could see the dryness!  A couple days after using this Neutrogena hand cream &amp; my problem disappeared.  It actually restored my skin.  Other hand lotions never did this for me.  I&#x27;d have to reapply them constantly to stay moisturized.  Not with this! Once a day is fine.  I applied it every morning &amp; night just to speed up the healing process.  Now that my hands are healed though, I don&#x27;t have to use it as often.  I use it once every few days now.  It&#x27;s like it actually restored my skin.  It&#x27;s crazy.  Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Best Hand Cream - Hands Down!</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using the hand cream for years and it never fails us. We love the brand!</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream ! Its verrry thick but absorbs so quickly which is great and leaves no greasy feel. IT REALLY M O I S T U R I Z E S . My hands get so dry in the winter, &amp; being that at my job I am not stop touching money, I constantly have to wash them which makes them dry out even more. A dab of this and the difference is so noticeable. It is designed for dry hands!</li>
    <li> it really does the job as neutrogena products are known for their good job. it stays in your hand for a longer time</li>
    <li> As a nurse I wash my hands a lot and my cuticles get dry as well as my hands, this softens quickly and leave a protective barrier even after washing.</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell, glycerin is the only ingredient in moisturizers that adds moisture to skin. Nitrogen Hand Cream has it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin. Neutrogena does not irritate my skin. This product keeps my hands from cracking. It has NO fragrance. (I not sure why anything needs fragrance.) I would buy this product again. It works as expected.</li>
    <li> I didnt always have eczema but it hit me in college and the worst of it was my elbows and fingertips. I could not write or tap on a keyboard, put pressure on it by pointing at anything. and it would split and crack. No bleeding but just splitting of the finger tips. I was on vacation in Taiwan with family and they had half a bottle of this left. All i asked for was lotion and this was all my non english speaking  aunt had. it saved my life</li>
    <li> I love this lotion- it stays on through a hand washing and it sinks in well.  However they changed the lid on it recently to a screw on lid (used to be a flip top) and I dinged it a star for that.  The new lid is VERY cumbersome (big lid, tiny hole to match up to the screw thingy).  I am always dropping them on the floor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway the lotion is great if you are constantly washing your hands!</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff I have found that actually repairs the cracks I get at the tips of my fingers this time of year. My dermatologist recommended and I&#x27;m glad she did. Use it every day for positive results. A plus is the no fragrance.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist who claimed I had eczema on my bleeding fingers.  Without buying the prescription cream, faithful applications of Neutragena hand cream healed everything.  I have suffered from this for years. The other must for me is to wear gloves when using harsh dish detergent.  I can&#x27;t figure out why local drugstores do not stock this great product.</li>
    <li> I am so sorry I bought this product. I had never used it before and thought I would try it. It is sticky and gummy and seems to never dry on your hands.</li>
    <li> This must be some of the very best hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I both use it prior to bedtime and after working in the yard.&lt;br /&gt;It is great for repairing chapped and rough hands (and feet but be sure to slip on a pair of cotton socks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast and reliable service when purchased via Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this hand cream for years, and it continues to do the trick for my dried, chapped hands. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> WARNING FOR TRAVELERS! This product tests positive for explosives at the airport!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I used to use this lotion regularly - the lotion itself works great. BUT! (And this is a big but!) While we going through security at the airport, everything we had touched tested positive for explosives because of this lotion (backpacks, purse, our daughters carseat, etc.). They were about to pull us, along with our infant daughter, away for questioning when a head security officer asked if we had used any lotion. Thank goodness we had the bottle with us to show him! They let us go after all that. We had to wipe down and wash everything when we arrived at our destination to get the residue off. Terrible experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use if traveling!</li>
    <li> Simply one of the best lotions available.</li>
    <li> this is the best lotion ever!!!</li>
    <li> Good stuff, but it&#x27;s less expensive at my local drugstore.</li>
    <li> My review is based solely on the product, not seller.&lt;br /&gt;I have severely dry hands, which is especially noticeable in the winter months. Between finger and on my knuckles - dry. They do tend to crack and become painful if I don&#x27;t take care of my hands. I have used many lotions in the past that never quite gave me quick relief. Several years ago I came across Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Hand Cream for dry skin.  I was blown away by how fast (over night) and well it started to work on my hands. I would always rub some in before I went to bed. And by morning, the pain was gone, my hands didn&#x27;t feel nearly as rough. I found it best to use at night before I go to bed because it is a little heavy feeling and takes a bit to absorb fully, plus I&#x27;m not apt to wash it off. I am on my fourth tube/bottle of this hand cream and I will NOT stray from it! It works! And it lasts a good while. I can use a 2 oz. tube in about a year. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This works so good. You only use a small amount and rub it in. It does not seem to be very greasy after you rub it in.</li>
    <li> (that means before 1980) I think it&#x27;s the best. I try other hand lotions, but they don&#x27;t compare, considering I&#x27;m not very careful about using  rubber gloves or other protection, winter dryness, harsh chemicals, age, it really combats all that stuff,  It&#x27;s just plain great.</li>
    <li> Even ark spots on hands disappEared</li>
    <li> Recommended to me by my frequent-flyer sister as a great cure for dry hands. I bought a multi-pack and am happy with that choice. This stuff is great! After one application, I noticed a marked improvement. The skin on my hands was soft and pliant instead of cracked and papery. Definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> I put a dime size in my hand and then add a little water since the lotion is a little thick and it works very well on my severly dry hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this hand cream. Since it&#x27;s winter my hands have been cracking a lot and feeling really dry. If it isn&#x27;t the weather, it&#x27;s washing my hands too often, but this cream has completely healed my hands. After one or two uses (overnight) my hands feel and look better! You need only a small amount to get this result too (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does feel a little tacky after you apply it, but give a minute or two and it&#x27;ll sink into your skin. It&#x27;ll be like it&#x27;s not even there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product. No doubt in my mind.</li>
    <li> I have really dry hands/cuticles and this worked really well, as well as the high-end creams I have been buying (Origins, Bliss, etc.)  The value is great and I love the small size, I keep one in both cars.  Highly recommend.  If you are not sensitive to perfume, the unscented version is great too, smells nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this hand cream for years.  It does a great job, healing hands and keeping them in great shape, soft, smooth with regular use.  You can only use a dab and work it in.  If you use too much it takes forever to &#x27;disappear&#x27;.  I like that it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena hand cream is just about the best heavy-duty hand lotion out there.  It isn&#x27;t nearly as greasy as many of the hand creams on the market.  It is quick and easy to apply because it rubs into your skin fairy quickly, yet its effects are long lasting.  Using this cream a couple of times a day really helps my chapped hands.  The only drawback of this product as far as I&#x27;m concerned is its packaging.  The old version of this product used to have a flip-top cap which was much easier to use and less messy than the screw-on cap which the new version has.</li>
    <li> Not sure what all is in this stuff, but it is our go-to cracked skin formula.  Hands, feet, lips...  Doesn&#x27;t matter.  We usually apply at night and issue will be gone after like 24-48 hours.  \</li>
    <li> This is more of an ointment than a cream, and better suited for consistent application (every day) rather than instant-healing. Not a \\&quot;fire-extinguisher\\&quot; of dry skin, more like dousing your roof with the garden hose to prevent it from catching fire. I&#x27;ve been using a bit each day, and my hands have felt smooth and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally I was using much more than a drop or two, (more like five--per hand), but that was in the beginning when my hands were in bad shape. After a few days of consistent use, I now use a drop or two per hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have taken photos of my hands before and after using this product--the difference is that staggering.</li>
    <li> So far so good, but the scent is not perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Goes on feeling a bit greasy and heavy, but it does smooth out.  I thought this would be good as a general moisturizer, but it is so thick and comes in a small package it really is only good for the hands.</li>
    <li> Best way to keep hands from getting dry and cracking</li>
    <li> Honestly this might be closer to 4 stars, but after seeing a zillion 5 star reviews, I think it&#x27;s misleadingly rated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it effective? Yeah, seems like. Nothing life changing, but seemed like a good hand cream and no annoying fragrance. However, it feels a bit like putting vaseline on your skin - in other words, it doesn&#x27;t really get absorbed and sits on the outside of your skin. I s&#x27;pose this protects it from the elements, but it also makes for kinda greasy hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally prefer moisturizers that absorb into the skin eventually, so maybe I&#x27;m not the target audience. If you&#x27;re looking for a vaseline type hand cream, this is great - but if you&#x27;re expecting something like Eucerin or Lubriderm or Kiehl&#x27;s Hand Cream, this is a very different style product.</li>
    <li> The best hand cream I have. I use it every day, several times. I have a tube in my purse, one in my bathroom and another in my car. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this hand cream for several years now and its just fantastic with getting rid of dryness. I even use it as lip balm and over other dry areas and even minor cuts.</li>
    <li> I have really bad allergy/eczema on my hands mainly palms or between fingers during warm months. It gets little blisters with fluid inside and that&#x27;s when it gets very itchy. It&#x27;s such intense itchiness that I can&#x27;t stop itching... Then blisters open and crusted on the skin, then it gets cracked open. This year is the worst, it spread on my entire right hand, which really makes it difficult to do anything. I went to doctors for this, probably couple times previously, only thing they give out is prescription strength hydrocortisone that works temporarily but soon enough stop working altogether. I tried homeopathic, herbs, all kinds of stuff but this is the cream that succeeded to moisturize the cracked skin without getting itchy. Other moisturizing creams even the kind for sensitive skin or natural kind, always made my skin even more itchy though it moisturize it okay. But this cream moisturize best, and if used on my kind of skin problem, it&#x27;ll feel so much better after the skin absorbs it. If your skin feels greasy after using this cream, then this must be too heavy for your dry skin. So I recommend this cream to only those who have EXTREME dryness that cracks the skin and bleed, or you have allergy/eczema like me. I sleep with glove on after I put generous amount of this cream, then my skin feels so much better in the morning. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Excellent. I tried samples a few years back..</li>
    <li> I love this product so much that I had to vouch for it and write my first product review (ever). This is the ONLY hand cream that my mom, sister and I use. It works like no other. My mom has been using this for approx 20 years (it used to have a different scent which I loved so much as a child--because to me, that was my mom&#x27;s scent...but they changed the scent for some reason). I get eczema in the winters when my hands get dry--this hand cream goes a long way in preventing it!! Love it.</li>
    <li> 2 mins after putting this on my hands no longer feel greasy nor rough. It leaves them soft thought a couple hand washings as well. A little goes a long way with this so dont be freaked when you get it and it looks like jelly coming out the tube!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much into skin creams, but my wife is and she likes this product. So, I buy it and she&#x27;s happy. I&#x27;m happy that she&#x27;s happy. Happy wife: happy life, and at a good price.</li>
    <li> This cream is highly concentrated, so be careful to use a small amount. Otherwise, if you apply a large amount and then try to rub it all in, you will wind up with a thick layer of cream all over the applied area of skin, and then you have to dab or wipe it off, thus wasting the cream. It seems to work pretty well overall, but O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands seems to last longer, and is easier to control with regard to amount when applying.</li>
    <li> On time and as advertised.  Stuff really works!</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years, it works for me very well esp in the winter time. Love it.</li>
    <li> I really recommend this products works and feels great!  It doesn&#x27;t leave that heavy or sticky feeling, since it came with two I just stuck one in my everyday purse!</li>
    <li> perfect for very dry hands. very luxurious feeling.</li>
    <li> It is a OK hand cream but I had used many brands that achieve similar result or better result at better pricing. I am not sure whether this is the original ones I used to buy from target, feel different. I swift back to other brands.</li>
    <li> works great on dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is some fabulous hand cream! Small tube but a little really goes a long way.  I am not exaggerating when I say this is the best hand cream I have ever used. I hope Amazon carries it for a long time!!</li>
    <li> This cream is the BEST for soft hands! During the winter my hands always get super dry and the Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Hand Cream is the only product that works to soften my hands.</li>
    <li> First tried this over a year ago when it was on sale, 2 for 5 bucks, and have been hooked ever since. This stuff is AMAZING, I usually hate most lotions/creams for one reason or another, too oily, smell, etc but this stuff is the BEST. I won&#x27;t use anything else now, if you&#x27;ve hated lotions in the past but have dry hands do yourself a favor and just try it, I bet you wont be dissapointed!</li>
    <li> Really helps dry hands</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and it&#x27;s just what she needs! Using the S&amp;S can even save more for you, and I also did that.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I am in health care and constantly washing my hands.  This has lead to eczema that cracks and bleeds.  This lotion has helped me so much.  And that fact that its not greasy is awesome. I have tried so many lotions otc and rx. This is the best by far.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream one winter for dry skin and very drying tap water, but didn&#x27;t use it very much because I live in a pretty warm climate where  super cold/dry spells are pretty rare. I nearly tossed it when I was moving but decided to keep it, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I use Epiduo for my acne, which dried out my combo/dry skin even more and made it very red and sensitive. My entire face, and especially around my eyes, was so painfully dry and flaky. Even fragrance-free/sensitive skin creams and lotions still burned and irritated my skin. My skin was flaking so bad during the day from my makeup it was disgusting by the end of the day. I thought I was just going to have to stop using my acne creams altogether, my face was so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night in desperation I pulled this out of the medicine cabinet, and noticed on the back it was non-comodegenic and said you could use it anywhere- lips, eyes, face. I bravely slathered this everywhere, and it was like a miracle for my skin. It didn&#x27;t burn, there was no fragrance, and it soothed my irritated skin. After a few days of using it morning and night my skin was 200% improved, and my acne has almost entirely cleared up. My acne creams are able to work since my skin isn&#x27;t constantly dry and irritated, and my skin is seriously glowing from how healthy and moisturized it is now. My makeup goes on perfectly! I use this every night, and sometimes very lightly in the morning if I have a dry spot. It&#x27;s great on lips and, of course, hands and everywhere else. I carry this with me all the time now. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have always loved this hand cream. It is thick and great to put on before bed so it has time to soak into your dry skin. I keep one at work and one in my nightstand and use it regularly. You will be thankful you did! One bottle will last a long time as a small dab is all you need at a time. Great value for the money!</li>
    <li> I have been using this hand cream for nearly 20 years and is perfect. I have has issues with my hands cracking and bleeding during the winter months, I worked at a hospital and a nurse told me about trying this and it almost seemed impossible to have hands that could feel so soft and not bleed. I have dry skin to start with then the winters have made them almost impossible to keep them from hurting and this stuff has made them feel almost normal. I gave some to my grandma that had very dry skin like mine and this is all she uses and was so thankful for the product. I would recommend this to anyone who has any issue with dryness on the body. You will thank yourself for giving this a try.</li>
    <li> Great for keeping in my diaper bag. It&#x27;s nice and thick and really keeps my hands soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing drywall work around the house the past few months which seems to suck every last drop of moisture from my hands. I put this Neutrogena hand cream on every night and it&#x27;s wonderfully comforting and seems to heal my dry skin as I sleep. I like that it has little to no scent and goes on feeling a little heavy-greasy, but quickly disappears under my skin.</li>
    <li> A friend turned me on to this cream years ago and I won&#x27;t leave home without it. Thick, pasty, and not oily. It is THE BEST.</li>
    <li> I love this hand lotion.  Only need to use a tiny bit to moisturize my hands.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Needed an intensive hand moisturizer and this one had lots of great reviews from many different sources (beauty magazines/amazon, etc). Figured we would give it a try and so far I am pleased. It is thick but I guess that&#x27;s what you need for really abused hands.</li>
    <li> Just as it states on the tube, you&#x27;ll get need a dab. My hands go from dry and stiff to moist, smooth, and gorgeous. This is a get stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> This stuff has no smell no dyes not greasy mess works one use lasts 24hrs i am always washing with sand soap and or gojo which drys hand badly brake cleaners and other solvents dont help this fixes a days worth of abuse in one shot so my wife does not have to feel my mechanical use hands all cut dry and bleeding.</li>
    <li> It does an excellent job of hydrating your skin and there are plenty of reviews that confirm that. But if your hands are in decent/OK shape and you&#x27;re just looking for a little moisturizing from time to time, get something else. This is not something that you just keep rubbing in, leaving your hands normal and free to use when the \\&quot;rubbing\\&quot; has finished. Nope. It&#x27;s hard to explain, but 10 minutes later I am still left rubbing my hands together to make that feeling go away so that I can continue using my computer in a normal way again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for feet though! or if you don&#x27;t use your hands (before going sleep maybe?). But expect to want to wash your hand after using this before going on with your day to day life.</li>
    <li> I took this product to work with me, and everyone started talking about it.  I had burly tattooed employees begging me to use this hand moisturizer because their hands were too chapped. After a few uses it really starts to be noticeable.  I really like this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is DEFINITELY working with my cracked/peeling hands. I have psoriasis, and the dry scaly skin on my hands was becoming a big embarrassment. After researching the reviews on this cream, I decided to give it a shot (despite the price per ounce). I&#x27;m very glad that I did. My hands are infinitely less scaly and the skin is left moisturized for hours. I just wish it was a little less pricey, or a little bigger in quantity. Thank you so much, Neutrogena~</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It softens your hands instantly and gives you long lasting moisture thought the day. I am a frequent hand washer, so hand creams like this are certainly best for me. Plus the price is very affordable. Best hand cream out there at this price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very thick, but after you work it into your skin it is not greasy at all, unlike Vaseline or Aquaphor. Plus we found that the Neutrogena did a much better job moisturizing, soothing, and healing dry skin than those other products. My daughter went through a mild OCD phase where she washed her hands too often, leading to very red, rough skin. We tried Vaseline, Aquaphor, and many other hand creams but nothing worked well and some of them would sting her irritated skin. Then I found Neutrogena Hand Cream and within 5 days her hands were nearly healed. Now we keep a bottle by everyone&#x27;s bedside, even my husband likes it. We prefer the fragrance free version.</li>
    <li> If you have really, really dry hands, you should use this product. It is awesome! I prefer the one with fragrance but this one was in a good price, so I bought two units.</li>
    <li> What a bargain!  This lotion is great.  My husband will even use it since it isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t smell like &#x27;girl&#x27;.  A mus have for the winter months.</li>
    <li> Best hand lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  Keep it at home and at the office.</li>
    <li> Very thick.  Stays on well</li>
    <li> I bought this because I touch a lot of paper and cardboard at my job. We have a tube of this cream for the employees to use throughout the day but I wanted to have some for myself at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is truly as it says on the bottle, just a little dab of this cream will heal dry hands for hours. It also does not leave an odd sticky residue on your hands, instead your hands absorbs the cream and you will feel moisturized for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative comment is that the cream at my work seems to work a bit better than the one I have at home. At work I simply put a tiny dab of it on my hand and it&#x27;s good for moisturizing both of my hands, but at home I need at least double that amount for some reason. Though, I still do not need to use much of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price available here on Amazon is much better than at my local CVS. I was able to buy two bottles on Amazon for only two dollars more than what a single bottle is at CVS, and I got free shipping.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that I&#x27;ve never used a product (ANY type of product) that I was so satisfied with. This produced such drastic results in such a short amount of time, I could call it magic. I used Eucerin Calming Creme for years, but recently it completely stopped working on my hands; I guess they got used to the product and needed something new. My hands got so dry and cracked and painful. My skin was peeling and itched non-stop. I tried product after product and nothing worked for longer than 10 minutes. Seriously! It got to the point where I couldn&#x27;t concentrate in school because I could not focus on anything but how much my hands itched. As soon as I tried this product, the itch was gone. 10 minutes later, it was still gone. I tried not to get my hopes up, but there was no reason to fear. The itch didn&#x27;t return, my hands healed, and after a week, they were baby-soft. I apply this after every time I wash my hands and it&#x27;s just perfect. To the people saying it&#x27;s too thick and that it doesn&#x27;t sink in: try applying it to damp hands. That should solve your problem. This is the \\&quot;Holy Grail\\&quot; of hand products. I can not say enough positive things about it. What a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It keeps your hands hydrated and a bottle is so small but will last forever! You really just need a dab and your hands will be silky smooth. Perfect for the winter!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years. It is super effective for dry, chapped hands (my skin seems to heal overnight), and it helps to keep my nails from breaking / splitting due to dryness. Amazing stuff! And may I say, shipping was freakishly fast. Almost scary.</li>
    <li> for my mom because I see her constantly using lotion. She is an older lady and has bottles of lotion. I saw this on sale during one of the Gold Box events and bought this for her. She was very pleased with the lotion and said it really has helped her hands.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll be as effective for you as it was for my mom, but she seemed very pleased with this lotion.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is essential for anyone who lives where the winters get cold and dry! It absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. You only need a little dab, so one tube  lasts a long time. Use it for feet and elbows too. Use it on cuticles to avoid hangnails. Fragrance-free is perfect, so men and women can use it, and it never clashes with any other scents you may be wearing. Locally, I haven&#x27;t ever found this cheaper than $4.99 per tube. The Amazon price of $7.28 for two tubes was a great bargain (and I got free shipping).</li>
    <li> I have been using Neutrogena Hand Cream for years.  My mom got me hooked on it when I was much younger, and I recommend it to everyone.  I have extremely dry skin, so when other companies come out with some &#x27;wonderful&#x27; hand cream, I give it a shot.  They are never as good.  This deal on Amazon.com is awesome!  It&#x27;s a better deal than if you get it at the store.</li>
    <li> I received the goods, but only 1 pack. I would like to ask, my order is set 1 bags or 2 bags?I remember my order choice is paclk of 2!Thanks.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does work. The hype is real. I have been using Crabtree &amp; Evelyn&#x27;s gardner&#x27;s hand therapy for years and have really liked it, but this stuff just plain works better. The other stuff is good though, if you need an alternative, but it&#x27;s more expensive and frankly isn&#x27;t as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in the Pacific Northwest, which typically doesn&#x27;t have a very dry climate. But we are having a very cold spell right now with no moisture in the air and my skin is drying up something awful. And, this stuff has saved my hands and, believe it or not, my face! I use argan &amp; maracuja oils on my face typically and they do wonders, but this magic potion is taking care of a pesky dry spot on my face as we speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is fragrance free too, so any of you sensitive folks will have no problem. And a little goes a long way as it is very concentrated.</li>
    <li> My hands have always gotten pretty awful in the winter but this year is worse because I work at a job where I have to wash my hands many many times a day.  My hands were horribly red and between my fingers were starting to bleed.  It got to the point if water even touched my hands, it really hurt.  I bought this after seeing some adverts for it.  I am so happy I did.  The first time I used it, it was a little off putting because it is so thick.  I didn&#x27;t know why it wasn&#x27;t absorbing into my hands.  Then I realized I just had to work it into my hands more than normal lotion.  After the first use, I noticed a difference.  After daily use for months, my hands feel great and are still soft.&lt;br /&gt;I only use this right before I go to bed.  I work it into my hands, wait a couple minutes, then work a little more in.  Some people may find this overkill but like I said, my hands get very dry.  Because it&#x27;s so thick, I don&#x27;t use this during the day.  I uses Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion a few times throughout the day.  But, if I didn&#x27;t use this at night, the Aveeno wouldn&#x27;t be so effective during the day.</li>
    <li> My hands are damaged and dry. Neutrogena is healing. This handcream does the job. My hands are much better&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic for chapped hands.</li>
    <li> Seems to work okay. Product reminds me of Vaseline in its texture and how well it works, only slightly better.</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite. Always goes back to this. Good absorbency, mild fragrance, moisturizing with no oily residue. Unique formula. Not found this in any other hand creams</li>
    <li> best hand cream I&#x27;ve found. Great for winter dry skin &amp; summer cracked heels. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love using this product for dry skin because you only need a little amount to make your hands soft and smooth. I received this product when it said it would arrive with no problems with the package and I would order from them again.</li>
    <li> An excellent hand cream.  Helps smooth rough, dry hands almost instantly.  Great value at Amazon, at Wal Mart the price was $11.99 per 2 Ounce tube.</li>
    <li> During the winter my hands get super dry. I was trying to find a good hand cream and this was what i needed. Love that i can use it for other dry areas</li>
    <li> It is so difficult to apply on the hands. The lotion does not spread at all. It is sticky, and can&#x27;t be absorbed at all. Unless you want to apply on your lips, it is useless.</li>
    <li> First of all, thank you to all the other reviewers who persuaded me to give the Norwegian Formula Hand Cream a try! I can&#x27;t remember the last time my hands were this soft... if ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a little less than 7 days of regular use to smooth my rough, winter skin and now my hands are soft all the time and that includes after washing dishes.  There is no scent so the men in the household also did not mind giving it a try. I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from chronically dry, rough hands and probably will never buy another brand of hand cream again.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite hand moisturizing cream. I just use a small amount every night and my hands are always so soft when I wake up in the morning. It is a thicker cream so it feels better than a watery lotion. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Works great for any dryness on my hands, face, neck, and feet.  Also softens calluses on hands and feet.  Not greasy and washes easily.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I only applied this to hands and a few dry areas on ankle areas once---noticed immediate results overnight---only used a DAB!  No need, yet to reapply---Totally satisfied and pleased! TRULY is an AMAZING product!  I would definitely recommend it to friends.  No wonder it receives so many RAVE reviews!</li>
    <li> i love putting this cream on my hands at night before i go to bed.  it nourishes my hands and smoothens it.</li>
    <li> Best cream money can buy. It instantly soothes my cracked dry hands and provides relief after one application!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this worked, but after using it for the past few weeks my hands feel dry after an hour or so. Before this purchase, I used Aveeno Skin Relief Hand Cream and provided relief all day. When this tube of Neutrogena runs out i&#x27;ll be going back to Aveeno.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and have not found anything better.  Not smelly, not greasy, doesn&#x27;t take a lot to make a big difference.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this lotion.  It saves my hands - I was them a ton and they tend to dry out and crack.  I apply this after every time I wash.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This product saved my hands when I had eczema.  It kept my hands soft and hydrated during this horrible winter.  The only thing is you have to use this product over night because it&#x27;s too thick to use during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this product to carpenters to health care workers to people with chronic problems with their hands and they all say it worked wonders for them.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Good cream for such a price. Would definitely recommend as well as other neutrogena products.</li>
    <li> I used this while in Russia during deep freeze (-30 C) for many weeks. I put in on my face, my hands when I come home. It does help to regenerate skin after exposure to cold if you apply it daily.</li>
    <li> I used the best hand cream, wash your hands after using it, hands become moist, soft, very good product I used the best hand cream, wash your hands after using it, hands become moist, soft, very good product</li>
    <li> Takes time to rub in but softens your nail beds and rough hands in one application. I wash my hands all day long (I&#x27;m a dentist) and have for the past 44 years and my hands are still moisturized at the end of the day. If I remember to use it just after my shower each morning my hands do not dry out and crack easily. I live in a very cold, arid climate (Alaska) so chapped hands are a constant issue. If I neglect using Neutrogena hand cream for several days my fingers crack around the nails and become painful. Just a few applications and the pain is gone and the healing process is rapid. I have used this product for nearly 40 years, well as long as I can remember.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this.  It is so worth the hype that surrounds it.  I don&#x27;t typically have dry hands but this winter was brutal. I had dry scaled skin that sometimes cracked and bled. I tried high end and low end hand creams to no avail. Korres hand butter, bliss hand cream, L&#x27;occitane shea hand cream, caudalie hand cream, the body shop hemp hand cream, Eucerin hand cream, working hands etc.  Nothing worked.  They would keep me moisturized(greasy) for a few hours and then I was back to square one, it was crazy.  Then I tried this.  Bliss! I used a lot of it one night and slept. By morning, my hands were back to normal.  It was unbelievable! This had actually healed my hands. No scales or discoloration.  Have been using it ever since.  Mind you, it is super greasy and can only be used at nights.  But it is so good that you don&#x27;t feel the need to use anything in the mornings.</li>
    <li> I am one of the unlucky people in my family to have inherited a strong allergy to cleaning products. To make it worse, in my case this allergy includes every single product I have used in my life, even regular soap that normal people use to shower and wash hands (I can only use baby soap or a certain brand that I have used since forever and thus am not allergic to anymore, but is not sold in the US).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year, I started teaching at a school in my country and the allergy in my hands escalated to a level it had never reached before; I had contact dermatities, which meant my fingers were covered in thousands of tiny blisters that would pop and leave ulcers and open cuts in my skin for days, until new blisters were formed and the cycle recommenced. It got to a point that my nails would not grow anymore, and I had to keep bandages on 24/7 to be able to touch anything. It took me 6 months to realize I was allergic to certain blackboard markers, but by then I was in the US, and the mix of having the very strong soap/sanitizers EVERYWHERE and not having my regular, trusted soap did not allow me to get rid of the dermatitis completely even with corticosteroids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was already used to having my right hand completely scarred, chaffed and painful when I stumbled upon this lotion at Walmart. I knew from experience that it would probably only make it worse, since putting anything in the wounded area only made it hurt more, but I decided to try. I added it to my nightly regimen of putting on barely effective medicine, and honestly hated it in the beggining. Yes, this lotion is too thick and oily, and is not absorbed completely. Yes, the regular one smells funny. But I kept trying anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took 3 uses to realize my meds were finally working. The lotion hydrated my hands enough to allow them to heal, and helped in some of that as well. The scarred and cracked areas are gone, and now I only need to apply the meds once a week to keep the blisters from reappearing. I add a generous amount of the cream right before going to sleep, when I don&#x27;t have to touch anything anymore, and wash my hands as usual in the morning. Every night I can feel my skin&#x27;s relief at soaking in the moisture after a long day of washing hands with strong soaps and even some dish detergent, which I wasn&#x27;t able to touch at all without tears before. This lotion has saved my hands from getting infected and me from taking so much corticosteroids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you guys need to stop using so much chemical-filled skin-dehydrating allergy-inducing soaps everywhere. You don&#x27;t really need antibacterial agents and god knows what to get your hands clean. ;)</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Norwegian Formular Hand Cream, is a great product.  This hand cream makes my hands very soft. This product will be good for many people.</li>
    <li> Spectacular.  Thick as toothpaste.  Quickly absorbs into your skin.  Zero scent.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it took care of my dry skin immediately.  The product did not leave my skin feeling greasy and as an added bonus, I rubbed a little bit on my lips as a silky lip balm. I think this product is a great value for the money, since you only need a little dab. I can&#x27;t wait to try it on my feet. I would reccomend this product to everybody!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena always gets five stars from me. This ultra thick hand cream does wonders for my feet. After applying I put on a pair of socks. After a couple of hours I remove the socks and voila, nice smooth happy feet.</li>
    <li> This is thick but not overly so. It does not leave c hands feeling overly greasy or tacky. Works well.</li>
    <li> This hand cream can heal cracked skin in one night. It is better than any other hand creams I have used. It is a little bit dry, so I recommend use it right after washing your hands.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT HAS PARABEN IN IT. PARABENS ARE LINKED TO OPENING THE BODY TO CANCER, PER ONCOLOGISTS. DO NOT USE ANY PRODUCTS WITH PARABENS. SHAME ON NEUTROGENA FOR USING PARABENS!</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and constantly have my hands in water all day.  This hand cream works wonders at keeping my hands soft without having to reapply the cream after I wash my hands each time.  A little goes a long way and the cream starts out as a semi-clear gel that just melts into yur hands.  I keep one in my salon and one at home.  For me, its important to have sufficient moisture with no sticky residue and this hand cream does that job for me.  There is no sticky residue and it absorbs into your skin extremely well.</li>
    <li> This stuff works better than a polysporin for me for all kinds of skin issues. It is super effective in a short time.  It is not greasy and has zero odor.  Love it.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way.  Suggestion -- your hands should be a bit damp when using this.  It helps the product spread.  It really keeps your hands nice and soft, and I love the fact that its fragrance-free.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hand lotion.  A tiny dab moisturizes both hands.  I find I have to reapply it fairly often, but I haven&#x27;t found any better products.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but it is not what I would call a hand &amp;#34;cream.&amp;#34;  The formula is a yellowish almost clear oil/petroleum-like based formula.  It does absorb into the skin but not completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use this during the day to avoid leaving greasy prints on things.  This is a great product to use at night because it does absorb somewhat into hands and the residue creates a &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; soaking completely into the skin after a few hours.  It leaves hands very soft and well moisturized; perfect for night treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have severely chapped dry hands this is a great product because it will not cause a burning sensation that most hand lotions will.  The formula is extremely gentle and would work on most cases of dry cracked skin.</li>
    <li> I wash my hands a lot and when I do calligraphy my I don&#x27;t put lotion on my skin.  You don&#x27;t want oils rubbing off on your project.  This is so soothing and it absorbs into my skin and it&#x27;s not slick.</li>
    <li> At work, I must wear nitrile gloves and wash my hands frequently. Winter is an ordeal of chapped skin, torn cuticles, and bleeding knuckles. My husband is a massage therapist who spends a lot of his spare time cutting firewood and working on carprentry projects, and he found himself in the same situation. When he apologized to a client because he thought she might notice his rough hands, she recommended this hand cream. He tried it, and we were both hooked. A little goes a long way, and the small tube fits easily in a lunch box or briefcase. For this winter, I just ordered this two-pack, and now we will have tubes stationed in a couple of strategic spots around the house. Here&#x27;s to soft, comfortable hands!</li>
    <li> I cook professionally so I wash my hands constantly and after eight hours my hand bleed when closed, but this stuff works like magic! By the time I get home from work they are soft and healing and another small application before bed they are perfect by morning.  I have nothing bad to say about this product, a little goes a long way and I carry a tube everywhere I go!</li>
    <li> I wash my hands a lot and as a result they show it - this cream is the best by far in healing my dry cracked skin and cuticles.</li>
    <li> Heavy and very moisturizing. You can definitely tell that you have a layer of something (feels like vaseline) on your hands when you apply it - no matter how much or how little ypou use. That said, it is amazing on chapped skin, weathered hands, and even lips.</li>
    <li> only hand cream to work on my dry hands. hands get dry from constant washing (housework/new baby). have to use numerous times a day to get full healing</li>
    <li> Hangnails and split fingertips. They were the story of my family&#x27;s hands until we found this a few years ago. Just before going to bed we put it on and give our poor hands a nice massage to heat up the cream and let it soak in. When we wake up our skin is soft and supple. Works great on elbows too!</li>
    <li> Works great on my dry chapped hands. do recommend to those with the same problem. Great product will buy again.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have tried most hand creams on the market and always come back to this one. Great texture and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Overnight cure for extreme cracked skin on my hands....put liberal amounts on both hands, put on some nitrale gloves, wear overnight.&lt;br /&gt;Works for a few weeks, I use a lot of hand sanitizer everyday for work.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been using nothing else on my hands and feet for 20yrs. It doesn&#x27;t take much and you need to massage it in really well but your hands will feel so soft and supple -don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever used that word before but it was what came to mind when I thought of this so I&#x27;m going with it. Try it , I think you&#x27;ll love it too....A Note: when you&#x27;ve squeezed out all you can get, cut the end off and there&#x27;s still a lot there Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and do not want to be without. Try it you will like it.</li>
    <li> I used to spend each winter going to bed with cotton gloves on covering my vaseline coated hands in order to stop my hands from being so dry that the skin  by my nails split open and bled.  This was even with always using hand cream after having my hands in water.  Then I found Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Hand Cream and haven&#x27;t had the problem since!  The price seems high, but you only need to use a small amount each time.  This cream also works for chapped lips &amp; a sore nose (from constantly blowing it when you have a head cold).</li>
    <li> I love it ,because my hand so dry after I wash them. After i used it, it make my hands feel softer and comfortable. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and psoriasis (life&#x27;s a party over here!) and my skin cracks at the first sign of cold weather. It only gets worse from there. Before the snow even shows up, my hands are bloody and gross. This cream is some sort of magic, for sure!! A tiny little drop every day and my hands are silky smooth. When it gets really cold, I use it after every time I wash my hands. One little tube really goes a long way!!</li>
    <li> I have used this for 12 years now. I have again and again bought other brands and nothing comes close.&lt;br /&gt;Is true what reads in the package: just a dab is enough. Fragrance fre, not to oily. Perfect.</li>
    <li> hoped this would really work but did not absorb as I thought is would...left hands feeling like something still not absorbed...found ahava products which work so much better for me</li>
    <li> This works better for my dry hands than any other lotion or hand cream I&#x27;ve tried. It rubs in nicely.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands sticky like alot of the heavier creams do.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is thick and extremely effective at moisturizing!  I moved from beautiful Southern California to the the Midwest... my first winter here was a lesson in dry skin.  (Amongst other things.)  This hand cream has saved my hands; my dry, cracked skin healed immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is small, but you don&#x27;t need a lot.  It is very thick, and you should make sure you have a minute to work it into your skin.  (Maybe 30 seconds?)  The fact that it&#x27;s unscented is a nice bonus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this highly enough!</li>
    <li> This is the best hand cream I have ever used. My hands are very rough because of household chores and cold weather. Tried different hand creams but this is the best one! Totally recommend for everyone who has rough hands. One of my friends recommended this and after seeing her hands becoming soft after regular usage of this cream, I too tried it. Unfortunately my hands didnt become soft maybe because of not applying this cream regularly (somedays I just forget). But overall a great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion for my son who gets very chapped hands in the winter.  He uses it all the time.  The packaging doesn&#x27;t look girly so that&#x27;s a plus for him.  :)</li>
    <li> I live in very dry climate (Aspen, CO) and the skin of my hands gets very rough and even cracked. No other hand cream has ever helped me as much as this one. It really heals and regenerates the health of your skin. No need for you to spend money on expensive ones - this cream is the best on the market.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, it&#x27;s the only non-prescription product that can keep the mild eczema on my hands in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite thick, and leaves a slightly tacky residue that takes time to absorb, but a little goes a really long way, and it&#x27;s super moisturizing. Start off using a small dab, about half the size of a frozen pea for your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product contains parabens, which is a shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a less thick alternative that absorbs faster, try [[ASIN:B001B1831U Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Fast Absorbing Hand Cream, 3 Ounce]]. This one works pretty well for more instant relief, but sadly does not come in a fragrance-free version. It also contains parabens, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> nice texture and no smell as I like it to be. Cheap and works the best. I use it all seasons</li>
    <li> This is a good hand cream, but it&#x27;s really thick and makes my hands feel greasy for a little while after I put it on so I usually put it on at night. I haven&#x27;t found anything better yet.</li>
    <li> Wanted &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; moisturizer for my mechanic husband&#x27;s chewed up hands.  He seems to like this stuff.  Yes, it is oily and you cannot touch your cell phone w/in 20 minutes of using, but a little bit really does work.  we have been using for over a month now and still have plenty left.  No smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for people who work with their hands. It is unscented and concentrated. It&#x27;s the only lotion my husband will use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. But not really &amp;#34;wow!&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Winter brings so much dryness, but with Neutrogena, you have the very best hand cream to help you out.  Put one in your purse&lt;br /&gt;keep chapped hands at bay!</li>
    <li> Dry hands in the frigid weather? Living in Vermont is challenging in the winter - shoveling, chipping ice, cleaning the car off and even getting the snow off the roof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That means hands become dry and chapped unless one uses some sort of hand cream.  This product is the best that I have found to prevent and protect hands.  No matter how much one tries, at times hands become exposed to the elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding product and most highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really help. This thing is very sticky. Not very comfortable after you put them on your hands. It seems like the skin doesn&#x27;t digest this or it&#x27;s too thick.</li>
    <li> Forget lotions, they just don&#x27;t penetrate and stay on.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best cream ever.  I live in Montana where it&#x27;s semi-arid and I use it overnight on my hands and arms.&lt;br /&gt;It works when nothing else will.  I don&#x27;t waste time and money on other products anymore.</li>
    <li> Every winter my hands get really chapped.  Even if I wear gloves.  They crack and bleed and are just not attractive.  Every year I try to find something that works.  I took a chance and bought this item.  It&#x27;s amazing!  I put some on last night and immediately noticed that my knuckles weren&#x27;t as tight and my skin was softer.  Applied a little more before bedtime.  This morning, my hands are silky smooth.  There&#x27;s no cracking, no chapping and they look amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is thick, and until it absorbs it leaves your hands feeling a little weird.  But it doesn&#x27;t take long to absorb and that feeling goes away.  For the results, it&#x27;s well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who can&#x27;t find anything that works.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t kidding when it says you&#x27;ll only need one dab! This product is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried, and is great on hands and anywhere else you have dry skin. The formula is gentle, soothing, and doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance which I personally prefer when looking for beauty products. It&#x27;s compact for travel but lasts ages, as the tiniest bit goes such a long way! It stays on through all sorts of washing, whether it be dishes, floors, walls, or just your hands themselves! Amazing product!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hand cream. It is very thick, so you only need to use a small amount at once. No other hand cream I&#x27;ve tried shows results as quickly.</li>
    <li> I work in a medical office, wash my hands about 60 times a day and get very dry skin,especially in the winter and this is the BEST hand cream out there, and I have tried dozens of hand creams. It is greasy at first, but absorbs quickly and prevents cracking and dry skin if you apply frequently. This is a must in my purse at all times.</li>
    <li> This hand cream was created for use by Norwegian fishermen working in the North Atlantic.  There is nothing glamorous about it. It doesn&#x27;t have pretty packaging, there is no pretty fragrance, it tends to be a little slow to absorb and it is gooey if you get  too much on.  However...it is hands down, without a doubt, the hand cream that produces the best results over any other, in my opinion.  I use it at night (I use a more easily absorbed cream during the day) and the next morning my hands are kitten-soft and incredibly smooth.  Not surprising.  After all, if it can help those fishermen braving the icey waters of the North Atlantic, think what it can do with our hands!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every night for over 20 years and I swear by it. I use it generously on my hands and elbows just before retiring and I never have to apply hand cream all day long. I live in Minnesota. My hands are in water a LOT and I&#x27;m a zealous hand washer who uses soap. The only hand cream I use is this one. Cannot be beat. Totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hands, especially in the winter. I am always washing my hands as a mom and nurse. I have tried MANY hand creams, lotions etc, and this one is the best! It truely moisturizes my skin, leaving my hands soft for hours. It is a thick consistency like petroleum jelly, so you don&#x27;t need alot, the small tube lasts for months. I hope they do not D/C this ever.</li>
    <li> I live near Buffalo NY, the Winter here is extremely harsh. The skin on my fingers always ends up peeling due to dry indoor heat and freezing, blowing, cold outside. this product is the best I&#x27;ve found for this problem. I shied away from buying it because I thought it was too expensive, that was a BIG mistake. You only need a tiny amount for both hands. One tube has lasted me over a year. Is excellent hand cream.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve found to prevent and heal chapped hands and even chapped lips.  I use it twice a day after I brush my teeth and the chapped dry skin on my hands and lips are a thing of the past.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Leaves an oily residue; the fancier (and more expensive) L&#x27;Occitane hand lotion does not.</li>
    <li> Good product, but I prefer the concentrated hand cream as it is far less greasy and absorbes into the skin much better.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin...</li>
    <li> One of the best creams for hands and nails in winter.</li>
    <li> Been using it for about 25 years, since I went tree-planting as a teen. My hands were a mess with cracks from the pesticides. Even split skin. A few days of application and they were healed. A few more days and the scars I thought I&#x27;d have were gone as well.&lt;br /&gt;You only need a little so it&#x27;s still good value for it&#x27;s deceptively small size.</li>
    <li> very good! I like it!</li>
    <li> The most fantastic hand cream out there.  The winter is hard on hands and this cream is non-greasy, has no scent, and actually works to heal your hands.  It can also stand up to light hand washing making it even that much more effective.  As many other reviewers here, this was also recommended to me from a random person who swore by it.  Fantastic!</li>
    <li> I developed allergy for this cream</li>
    <li> Was disappointed in this.  Okeefes ended up working way better and was not as oily.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this product locally any more and was thrilled to find it at Amazon. This is not a lotion. It&#x27;s a cream. It is thick and a little sticky, but get in bed and then put it on your hands or put cotton gloves over your hands after you put it on. By morning your hands will be much softer. If your hands are sore from being in water or cold dry weather, it will relieve the soreness.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this cream as a body moisturizer right out of the shower, because it is water soluble and can spread easily. He has extremely dry skin and daily usage of this product prevents itching and flaking. It is a staple in our house!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion because my hands were dry and cracked from having to wash them so much. They were so much softer after just one use! Glad I bought 2, my boyfriend took the other one and uses it all the time! Great product</li>
    <li> I use it only once at bed time and my hands stays moisturized.</li>
    <li> My hands are extremely dry during the winter time.  These hand creams do provide plenty of moisture but more like a thin coating on applied areas.  I like these hand creams because they are not so oily and it is absorbed fast.</li>
    <li> Yikes this stuff is overrated imo.  It definitely works but I wouldn&#x27;t classify it as an every day hand cream to be used all the time.  It says &amp;#34;just a dab heals dry skin&amp;#34; well that&#x27;s true. Except I have a hard time getting that dab to spread all over my hands and into my cuticles so my cuticles actually look worse after using this. I know if I used more to slather all over my hands it would work better but then it would leave too much residue on my hands. This would be perfect to use before going to bed but I like to put hand lotion on after every time I wash my hands and then I&#x27;d need to go back to my laptop for work.. I don&#x27;t want to get this gunk all over my computer.  So yes this is useful and effective and the 2oz will go a looooong way. Idk if/when I&#x27;ll ever finish all of it. But it doesn&#x27;t serve the every day purpose I need it for.</li>
    <li> Works but it is really thick... I feel it on my hands for a long time. I like creams that get absorbed more quickly.</li>
    <li> Really one of the best, silkiest moisturizers you can get for your hands and body. It smells more &#x27;medicinal&#x27; than standard lotions, but I usually can&#x27;t stand those smells anyway so it doesn&#x27;t bother me!</li>
    <li> I live in a cold, wet climate, and I&#x27;m not quite sure what I&#x27;d do without this hand cream.  It&#x27;s necessary for me to have the heat on much of the year, and this cream keeps my hands from drying out - which is a must, since (among other things) I&#x27;m a pianist!  I discovered it when I was living in Colorado, which is a cold, DRY climate, and it handled even that sort of low indoor humidity.  You don&#x27;t need to use much - it is HIGHLY concentrated, so start out small (you can always add more); just enough \\&quot;sits\\&quot; on the surface of the skin to keep moisture in, without feeling greasy or interfering with one&#x27;s dexterity - an obvious issue in my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have one (very small) complaint, it&#x27;s the scent; when I first started using it, the scent was \\&quot;sweeter\\&quot; (for lack of a better term); it now has a sort of combination aloe/cucumber scent, but it&#x27;s light, so it&#x27;s something I can live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way - Neutrogena also makes a foot cream, and I definitely recommend it as well!</li>
    <li> It keeps my hands from drying, itching, cracking (which happens from frequent hand washing).  It&#x27;s also fragrance-free (I would not buy if it had fragrance because of my allergies to fragrance).</li>
    <li> Excellent product if you have extra dry skin in the winter time.</li>
    <li> This thing is heaven sent. I recently had been experiencing dryness and flaking around the corners of my mouth and chin and no amount of exfoliating and cetaphil could help me out. So one night after washing my face I used just a little bit of this product on the areas that need it and like magic the dryness was gone. I also like using this on my feet during winter. Works amazing. Buy it.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Fast shipping !!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s clear like an ointment and after rubbing it into my hands, I give it a second to really sink in. almost immediately I can tell a difference and my hands look so fresh and youthful.  Having a baby, I get little time for any beauty treatments. Before I would love taking an evening to exfoliate, pumice, etc my feet then top it off with fresh polish. Well, I haven&#x27;t done that in six and a half months (baby is 6.5 months!) So I was super pleased the other night when I was looking at my winter heels (yuck) and decided to at least put some of this lotion on them and got great results! My feet were so soft and smooth like I&#x27;d spent an hour on them instead of two minutes.  I&#x27;d recommend this product whether you&#x27;re a Norwegian fisherman or just a busy person who loves seriously soft and healthy looking skin.  Since it&#x27;s fragrance free and not all girly in the design, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it for guys too.</li>
    <li> Being a CNA keeping my hands from cracking &amp; bleeding is a full time chore. The gloves dry my hands out &amp; washing them so much during the day really does mess up my skin badly. I&#x27;ve tried other lotions, creams, gels, everything I can think of &amp; nothing has worked. After reading the reviews on this hand cream I thought maybe it would be worth a try &amp; if it didn&#x27;t work, then there wasn&#x27;t a real loss because the price is so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hands are cracking, bleeding &amp; they hurt so bad. I can&#x27;t even get rid of one cut before there&#x27;s another on my fingers or top of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using this cream &amp; immediately it softened the cuts that are already healing &amp; soothed the skin around them. My hands are smoother, softer &amp; the cream absorbed quickly without a greasy after feel.&lt;br /&gt;Even after washing my hands it didn&#x27;t feel like I had to put on more cream right away, my skin wasn&#x27;t so dry that it was about to crack like it normally does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really does take just a little bit at a time &amp; leaves my skin smooth. I&#x27;m going to try it on my feet too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered a couple more so I can have one in the car &amp; another at home. Plus I&#x27;m going to give this away as a gift to someone else who suffers from cracking, bleeding hands. I&#x27;m so glad to have ordered this stuff.  If you have dry skin, consider giving this a try.</li>
    <li> It was delivered on time. And the quality is really good. Since winter is coming, best thing to give my mom for her winter skin care!</li>
    <li> My knuckles get extremely dry and cracked during winter months. I have tried numerous types of lotions (OTC and medical samples). This stuff is cheap and excellent! I use it nightly and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I work in the hospital, care for my infant son, wash dishes...needless to say, I do a lot of handwashing. My hands get even more dry in the winter so dry that my husband would not like holding my hands.. I have tried different hand creams...some pricey ones, too. This beats them all in terms of cost and quality. After using for one month, I notice that the product really sinks into skin versus sit on top of skin. After washing hands, product does not feel like it comes off nor do hands go back to being so dry.  Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do...leave skin feeling silky smooth, and for cheap, too! By the way, you can also use on other parts of body and works as a great moisturizer for lips.</li>
    <li> Me and the rest of my family have been using this product for chapped hands and feet for more than 30 yrs.  We can&#x27;t rave about it any more than that.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> We apply before bedtime. Keeps our Hands from cracking</li>
    <li> One of the few hand creams that help my hands (ezcema and get severely chapped - ie, bloody). Works even better than some of the messier (Eucerin) and more expensive (Philosophy) kinds I&#x27;ve tried. Clears up chap and eczema, softens hands beautifully. Is a little greasy, but not bad and don&#x27;t need gloves at night as with the Eucerin. Only need to use it at night for good effect.</li>
    <li> I have tried soooo many hand creams and have been disappointed in many of them except this Neutrogena one.  There is no perfume in this cream.  My hands don&#x27;t burn or itch after putting it on.  It absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving your hands sticky or slimy!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought it through Amazon because they shipped to Afghanistan.  This produce saved my hands &amp; face from the Afghanistan weather and sun.</li>
    <li> This series is full of great ideas that are simple and easy ways to help your little one stay constructively active.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite hand lotion. Great deal to get 2 at once - here in Colorado we have to stock up on these sorts of things! :)</li>
    <li> My family has used this cream for 10 years now. Excellent, much better than any other cream for dry hands.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  I use this every day.  It&#x27;s not expensive and it works better than any moisturizer I have tried for hands.  It also works as a serum for the face--a great protector that doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes or gunk up your skin, and it keeps you moist.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is excellent. Ordered like 6 of them because my wife likes them, like a little too much. But great quality and I always wake up and can feel the difference in my hands.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. All I need is a tiny amount (the size of a pea) applied to slightly damp hands, and it keeps my hands moist and non-greasy until I wash them again. Don&#x27;t use too much or it will feel greasy. Great for your cuticles too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is normal/dry, not severely chapped or ultra-sensitive. It&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes the hand without leaving it greasy. The fragrance-free is great to allergic people and for those who don&#x27;t like fragrances in the hand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s decent for small dry spot treatment, but for an all-around moisturizing cream for severely dry skin, I would still have to recommend my tried and true Eucerin Original Healing Repair Creme.  It goes on heavy but absorbs quickly and relieves cracked, painful, dry skin.  This Neutrogena product is a good travel creme because of its size.  Very portable.  But for those of you seeking relief, Eucerin is the way to go.  Some all natural products are great too - pure african shea butter, evoo, etc.</li>
    <li> Fear not, for this stuff is kicking ass and taking names with regard to dry, winter hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep a bottle in my car and apply whenever I go anywhere, it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy. Buy. Buy.</li>
    <li> Got it today, ahead of time, after 6 days.&lt;br /&gt;I love Neutrogena and think that this hand cream is really good.&lt;br /&gt;B U T -&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product, pack of 2, as it is fragrance free. I got 2 tubes that says &amp;#34;new fragrance&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to use it as I hate having my hands perfumed. disappointing.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for people who get severely dry hands in the winter (or year-round of course). Although I wouldn&#x27;t classify myself as having \\&quot;severely\\&quot; dry hands, mine always get a little cracked around the knuckles during the winter and since I handle a lot of paper, that sucks a lot of the moisture right out of my hands too. I keep this on my desk during the cold months and this little tube lasted almost two winters with almost daily use. Just a little bit goes a long way. It takes a very small pea sized amount- dab on the back of your hand and add more if needed. What I like most about it is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling slippery and greasy. (It shouldn&#x27;t feel greasy if you use the right amount. I can imagine if you use too much of this you&#x27;d feel very greasy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the original version and I don&#x27;t find that the added fragrance irritates my skin. Its very light and not at all unpleasant. Other heavily perfumed lotions will sting when my skin gets cracked like that but this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream, especially in the winter.  It&#x27;s the only hand cream I&#x27;ve found that really keeps my hands from being so dry.  It works great on feet, too.</li>
    <li> this product 100% works. No doubt about it. I have inherited my family&#x27;s horribly chapped, cracked to the point of bleeding, hands during the winter. This is the ONLY product that sooths and heals them without stinging (I buy the fragrance free version). It helps sooth the dryness instantly and overnight there is a 100% improvement. I try to use twice a day in winter but definitely at least once per day before bed.  I have been buying this cream for over ten years. It is a MUST have on my bed stand.</li>
    <li> This is good especially as the winter progresses, but I prefer something a little creamier. I like the size for purse, desk drawer  and car.</li>
    <li> This, in and of itself, did not keep keep my hands from cracking (e.g. at the ends of my fingers) when only applying it once at the end of the day.  It&#x27;ll be -6° today for a high (Minnesota) so it&#x27;s quite dry where I am.  I also might wash my hands more than most folk. I find I have to apply hand lotion after every time I wash my hands.  For that I use a cheaper, no frills one (Vaseline Intensive Care), which also wouldn&#x27;t be enough if applied just once a day.  I can carry the latter in a refillable squeeze bottle (REI sells them).</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a couple of years and I cannot live without it! My hands tend to get really dry and this is the only cream that gives them a long lasting relief. It it also great for elbows, knees and feet.</li>
    <li> It is so-so. It is not bad, but I do not like them. Maybe it is good for kids to use.</li>
    <li> As in the old Brylcreem ads - &amp;#34;A little dab will do you&amp;#34;.  The product does not fell greasy and lasts quite a while.  Plus it works!!</li>
    <li> I applied the cream correctly every time, and it soothes effectively and provides a protective barrier for the skin, BUT does not deliver moisture to the skin The product doesn&#x27;t have much moisture in it in the first place because it is \\&quot;concentrated\\&quot; apparently but i need moisture!! WHY ELSE WOULD I BUY HAND CREAM? obviously i want to moisturize my dry hands.The texture is grainy, I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the concentrated bits of dried cream or something, but it&#x27;s very unpleasant feeling. It smells like plastic even though it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
    <li> This is an old stand by for chapped or rough hands. I couldn&#x27;t get through winter without it. Summer either, now that I think about it. My hands take a beating year round with weather, gardening and cleaning. This cream heals and softens my hands, elbows, face, you name it. As far as I am concerned, it is the best!</li>
    <li> Fantastic hand cream.  I have been using this hand cream for more than 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;I knocked off one star because this tube came with a screw on cap.  My previous tube had a flip open cap, which is far more convenient.</li>
    <li> I had used this hand cream almost 15 years ago and completely forgot about it until recently when my current creams were just not cutting it for the extremely dry and chapped hands and cuticles i have been suffering from. This stuff is great!! After just 2 uses my hands are back to normal! You have to get used to the texture and consistancy of this product but it leaves my hands as soft as my 6wk old sons skin!</li>
    <li> order the 2 back. better deal than local stores. shipped very fast. great deal. would rec to others. thanks good.</li>
    <li> Good product. There&#x27;s no scent so you can put your favorite lotion or perfume over it!&lt;br /&gt;I also used it on my kids.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of the better moisturizers according to the Skin Doctor Score....read the review at theskindoctor.com</li>
    <li> Love this product, one of the few that doesn&#x27;t stink with perfume.  It really helps to stop drying out of hands especially in the winter!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very fair price to buy this hand cream. And it&#x27;s good to use during winter. My dry skin loves it so much!</li>
    <li> Highly recommended for dry skin - feels like it is actually changing the chemical balance within your skin. Wikipedia lists the following as methods of moisturizing skin, and I think this lotion would qualify as the third method:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three methods are used to moisturize skin:&lt;br /&gt;Occlusives: These work by forming a thin film on the surface of the skin to prevent any loss of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Humectants: These attract water from the air to moisturize the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Restoration of deficient materials: These are more complex and try to restore natural moisturizing factors on the skin such as amino-lipids.</li>
    <li> this stuff is so essential to my happiness during the winter months: it actually does heal cracked, dry, painfully chapped hands within days... and no weird stink!  awesome.</li>
    <li> love this cream. my mother-in-law recommended me. my skin is the softest when I use THIS cream.</li>
    <li> i have tried a lot different brands with different price point. this is better than any other cream in the market. i have to come back and stock up</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I suffer from extremely dry skin and nothing seems to help.  I tried Neutrogena hand cream and it has really made a difference.  You have to use it daily, but I started seeing results just a few days into it.  It&#x27;s not greasy or have any fragrance.  I will definitely use this product forever.  I have also shared this will my friends and family.  They are loving it, too!  It&#x27;s definitely a good buy!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for your hands. Feels clean. There is little to no smell. Definitely recommended. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> After putting this on I forget about my dry winter hands for hours. I just wish it came in a lager size and with a better cap.</li>
    <li> I love this product but this is another product that costs more than I would spend on a regular basis for daily use.</li>
    <li> Only use a little bit. If you use a lot it will take a lot longer to try to rub it into your hands or skin. Honestly. Just a little bit cures cracked skin.</li>
    <li> A great product at a great price.  I highly recommend ordering this through &#x27;em to supply you entire family (and then some).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and must admit I&#x27;ve tried many others but keep coming back to this hand cream.  So wonderful the way it soaks in and protects my hands for hours.</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s not greasy feeling. One of the few hand creams that meet that criteria!</li>
    <li> Really good product for dry hands. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> My hands always crack during the winter with microscopic cracks so that sweating hurts. This lotion solved that problem. My hands felt great all winter.</li>
    <li> best hang cream around.  very good quality.  i love it.</li>
    <li> This cream is the only one I have tried that soothes my very dry, sensitive skin hands. Normally I wouldn&#x27;t have even tried it because I am trying to not use skin products containing parabens (which is why I deducted one star), but I was desperate. I have tried so many products, many labeled for very dry hands but that didn&#x27;t do anything for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hands are very dry, to the point of cracking and bleeding. I have to wash my hands a lot at work, and the harsh soap is awful on my sensitive skin. I put this cream on at night and it has really helped. Application during the day would be pointless for me because of all the handwashing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says that a tubes has over 200 applications and you only need a dab...but my hands are so dry I went through a tube in one month. If my hands were not as dry I would have been able to get more applications out of the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, despite the parabens I will continue to use this product. Wish I would have found it before trying all the other expensive creams (including ones recommended to me by two different dermatologists).</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and find it the best for giving me soft smooth hands and good nails.  When I try other similar products, my hands get dry and my nails break.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Neutrogena products.  I love Norway.  I can&#x27;t understand the great reviews for this hand cream though, it&#x27;s like spreading wax or lard on your hands, it&#x27;s stiff, waxy, and doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin well.  It&#x27;s basically the worst hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used, but at least it wasn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many other hand creams and this one is the best. A little bit on every night before going to bed makes all the difference between having dry hands throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Feels a bit greasy but it works well overall. In the end, I prefer Bath and Body&#x27;s Hemp hand cream, but this is a good alternative because it&#x27;s unscented.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s dermatologist recommended this product for his dry, cracked hands that sometimes even bleed in the winter.  I was somewhat skeptical having tried so many hand cremes from expensive to drugstore priced variations. But this Neutrogena Norwegian Formula is amazing and I&#x27;ve never had a hand creme that has worked so well.  It&#x27;s not greasy or wet and has no fragrance.  How nice to hold hands with my hubby again- no more cringing at his alligator cracked skin touch!</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist recommend this product..He was right ,Great for dry chapped hands in cold weather...A little pricy, but still a great product....... .</li>
    <li> I have been using this hand lotion for over 20 years. I have very dry skin on my hands and feet and this is the only lotion that gives me any relief. My skin feels moisturized and soft  And 2 oz goes a long way. I can&#x27;t be without it. I have a tube in my purse, in my kitchen and bathroom and a stock in my linen closet. If you have dry skin. Give this one a try.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the other person it is to heavy and has grease fill you can use it better on your feet but still grease fill not the right lotion for my hands</li>
    <li> Not oily and no perfume smell.</li>
    <li> So far I am not a huge fan of this hand cream. I was looking for a lotion, and this is a strange consistency that feels more like spreading chapstick on your hands. Ultimately it works, but it just makes your hands feel weird.</li>
    <li> My friend was having major problems with dry skin while she was in basic training.  Sent her some of this in a care package and it was all taken care of!</li>
    <li> This hand cream is magical. I usually apply it before going to sleep, and in the morning my hands already look better.</li>
    <li> I have trouble with hand creams because my hands sweat more than the average person&#x27;s. As a result, I find this lotion to be somewhat slow absorbing. It almost feels like a thicker version of aquaphor - very rich and emoliant, maybe even a bit greasy. However, I notice that my cuticles are very well moisturized when I use this and the effects last several hours. I suggest using it sparingly. It won&#x27;t be my holy grail hand cream, but I will definitely use it in conjunction with a more fast absorbing and lighter lotion.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is too thick and not spreadable for me. It doesn&#x27;t absorb as well as other hand creams I&#x27;ve used. The only time I like using this is before bed, when I don&#x27;t touch anything throughout the night, I then wakeup with soft hands. It&#x27;s just too much for day time use. I end up getting everything sticky. I prefer Eucerin Intensive Therapy Hand Cream to this, at least that spreads and absorbs in to my hands.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist advised that I use this hand cream and it is a great product.  I have ordered it a few times from Amazon as an add-on product to other orders.  I have severe problems with my hands cracking and this cream is the best non-prescription product that I have found.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hand cream for 3 years now, geat product, moisturing an not oily,best thing is no fragrence at all, ad it works for all seasons, summer, winter, all good.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the positive reviews and the reasonable price. I was going on vacation to a cold-weather, snowy place in the mountains. The last time I went there, I had super dry skin, and the lotion I used didn&#x27;t help much. So this time around, I wanted to be prepared. I looked through the Amazon reviews for lotions and creams that were effective for very dry skin. Based on the reviews, I thought this Neutrogena cream would be a good purchase. But when I applied it on my hand, I disliked the feel and texture. I&#x27;m not sure if it did much for my dry skin, either. And the smell of the product leaves something to be desired. I know it&#x27;s fragrance-free, but it still has a less-than-pleasant \\&quot;scent.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it a few times, and disliked it each time. I&#x27;ve only used a bit of one of the tubes. The other tube hasn&#x27;t been opened. I feel like I&#x27;ve wasted my money on this. I give this cream 2 stars instead of 1 star because it&#x27;s not godawful and I didn&#x27;t get a adverse skin reaction from it. I can use it in a pinch, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the snowy mountain vacation, I ended up using some far superior creams, such as Eucerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again and again, I&#x27;ve found that I dislike a product even if it has countless 5-star reviews on Amazon. Maybe I&#x27;m just different from most people.</li>
    <li> Does a good job softening dry skin, but is much too greasy and heavy.</li>
    <li> I had a lot of trouble with dry hands in the winter, painful cracks on my thumbs and other fingers.  Then a dermatologist told me to go with cream, not lotion.  I have few problems since using this cream.</li>
    <li> Some people complain it&#x27;s too sticky, it doesn&#x27;t bother me &#x27;cause I put it without touching with the front of my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried others, no other product does the job so well for my dry skin. I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena hand cream for years, i always like it! for the price, no other hand cream can beat it!</li>
    <li> I have spent so much money over the years on skincare ! Bought all the expensive brands ( Estee Lauder, Lancome etc ) My skin is sensitive and on the drier side and almost everything I used did not work .  I use this for my face !  I am 53  and this stuff is incredible ! It makes your skin very soft and not greasy at all ! I  Great under your make up too . The glycerine is the ingredient that will do the trick !  I have used it now for years and I will not buy anything else . You need so little that it lasts a long time too .</li>
    <li> I keep this cream on my nightstand and I also keep a tube in my desk drawer at work. A little bit goes a long way. In the winter, this is the only cream I really trust to keep the dry hands at bay! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have the worse kind of dry skin its itchy, flaky, sandpaper dry. I used this stuff for about a week and it has improved my skin so much I wish it came in a bigger size though.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I work in healthcare and my hands are constantly chapped during the winter months due to the cold and the constant washing.  This lotion is a lifesaver.  It&#x27;s not too greasy and absorbs very quickly.  It&#x27;s also unscented, so the smell doesn&#x27;t bother sensitive patients.</li>
    <li> It’s good but too small</li>
    <li> makes your skin look younger.. not sticky. no smell to battle with perfume youre wearing.</li>
    <li> This stuff is basically magic. Nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried comes close to healing dry skin as fast as this, and that includes prescription strength formulas. It&#x27;s not just for hands. I use it on my lips frequently, as they often get chapped. You will notice a difference in even the most dry, crocodile-like skin in about an hour, with significant improvement occurring in less than 48 hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other hand creams and I&#x27;m surprised how well this one works. Most creams that are good usually have a slimy/slippery feel to it but this dries perfectly. It helps sooth and hydrate my skin, I love it. I&#x27;m definitely going to be using this hand cream for some time now.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hand cream for almost 30 years and I have still never found anything as good as this! Paul Harvey (a radio personality) used to recommend it on his radio program back in the early 1980&#x27;s and so I gave it a try and started using it and have never stopped! I recommend this hand cream to anyone with serious skin dryness. It really works! A tiny dab is all that is needed and it heals most dry skin problems very quickly!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hand cream after trying many other brands.  I live in CO, known for it&#x27;s dry climate, so constantly need hand cream.  This is the only one that works and it was also recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I have always used Neutrogena during the winter to fight chapped hands and splitting finger tips.  When I needed it most, I was down to the smallest amount and had to cut the bottom off the bottle to get the gel out.  I will still cut the bottom off so I can get to all of it but I was delighted to find these on Amazon in  two pack.  I have enough now  to share and not worry that I will run out.</li>
    <li> i was at my wits end 30 years ago - i spent so much money (clinique, etc.) for creams to use on my face and around my eyes.  i tried many different brands.  finally i tried neutrogena hand cream - fragrance free!  voila!!!  no reaction or rash!  so i&#x27;ve been using neutrogena hand cream on my face, around my eyes, my hands and arms.  it&#x27;s the best product i&#x27;ve found and i&#x27;m thankful for &amp;#34;fragrance-free&amp;#34; items.  neutrogena should make more &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent cream, this USA made version is much better than the locally available product which is Korean made! Love this cream!</li>
    <li> I saw an improvement on my very dry hands almost immediately. I would definitely purchase this product again and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> In the dry, cold winter, the only cream that stops my hands from cracking is Neutrogena Norweigan Hand Cream.  I prefer the unfragranced product, even though it has a slight scent.  The scented version is way to strong for me.  Try it.  I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Good product. The soap at my office really does a number on my hands each time I &#x27;visit&#x27; the bathroom. Neutrogena hand cream prevents my hands from feeling like scotchbrite. It also keeps my elbows from looking ashy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband and he likes this cream - it do its job and has not fragrance, that it good for men. I took the second cream and like it very much too. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> Great product for really dry skin.  Only need a dab.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE USED THIS CREAM FOR TIME OUT OF MIND.  IT DOES THE BEST JOB OF KEEPING HANDS SOFT AND A TEENSY AMOUNT IS ALL YOU NEED WHICH MAKES A TUBE LAST A GOOD LONG WHILE</li>
    <li> This is MUCH more than a hand cream. It&#x27;s not really a cream, which initially disappointed me; it&#x27;s basically a slightly thinner, petrolatum/vaseline-type product. I initially just wanted a fragrance-free creamy hand lotion I could put rub into my hands the same way I would with any other lotion. But this has a slightly different purpose; it&#x27;s more of a dry skin treatment than a standard lotion-type moisturizer. I found that if I rubbed just a dab on the backs of my hands and on my nails where they can get a rough, ragged and chapped, it softened them up within a matter of a few days. And because it&#x27;s a little thinner than vaseline, it rubs right in. If it leaves behind any residue, I haven&#x27;t noticed. I also use it on other dry areas like my elbows and knees without concern that it will come off on my clothes. I have also started using it 2 or 3 times a day on the very rough, dry areas on my feet, including my heels. I spend much of the year barefoot and never wear socks down here in our almost tropical climate. Now, with just a few applications, most of the dry areas are basically \\&quot;cured,\\&quot; and my VERY dry, cracked heels are close to it. I will have to continue using it as a preventive measure, but it does work beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the tube size is legally small enough to put in my carry-on on flights and I prefer the fragrance-free version, I can also use it on my face around my eyes and my lips which get dry on long flights. It&#x27;s basically a multi-purpose product I wouldn&#x27;t be without and costs no more than a regular jar of vaseline. OTOH, if you ARE looking for something thicker like vaseline, you might find this a little on the thin side. I still recommend trying it, though.</li>
    <li> It is a nice size and fits easily in my purse.  it makes my hands feel good without being overly greasy.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  Non-greasy.  No strong scent. 2 oz size is handy - fits in my pocket.</li>
    <li> No way.  This lotion soothes and nurtures and penetrates.  Just remember to keep it handy (pun intended) so you can keep your hands nice and soft.</li>
    <li> When I use it, I then want to wipe off my hands, because it is too greasy on my palms. That is rubbing it into the skin on top of my hands and wrists does not reduce the greasy feel on my palms, no matter how little I use.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand cream on the market.  It absorbs immediately, isn&#x27;t greasy, and really works.  I have used this for years.  No matter how many other products I try, I still come back to it as the best out there.</li>
    <li> This product, just a small dab, used daily will keep your hands nice and smooth/soft. It is amazing. You would never guess you could get such big results from a tiny tube and a tiny nightly dab. I have used this cream for years and years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema on my hand for almost 3 years now and tried almost every hand cream out there.  This one is one of the best I&#x27;ve found!  It goes on like a thick lather (like petroleum jelly) but doesn&#x27;t have the oily feel after.  This and Cutemol are my favorite hand creams (the Cutemol leaves the oily feel after).</li>
    <li> I find this product very good for taking care of dry skin.  I mainly use it on my feet, it has cleared up my dry cracked heals and I use it daily.  I have used this Neutrogena product for several years with out any problems.</li>
    <li> The dermatologist recommended this hand cream to moisturize the hands--and it certainly does the job.  So many expensive moisturizers have an appealing fragrance but that&#x27;s it.  This Neutrogena hand cream truly penetrates your skin and leaves your hands soft longer.</li>
    <li> i always have dry skin during cold season and my skin would crack and bleed. This hand cream is truly the best remedy. Just a small dab and my hands feel so smooth and soft. I don&#x27;t find it greasy at all as long as I don&#x27;t put too much on. This works way better than using aquaphor + normal hand cream. The price is affordable too. But I can only find it on amazon, couldn&#x27;t get it from cvs.</li>
    <li> Sometimes a girl gets really dry, cracked skin.  This is what I use in an emergency elephant skin situation.  Hands, elbows, soles of my feet.  A few days of using this and my skin feels normal.  During the summer when I am flip-flopping it all over the place, I slather this on my feet in the morning and at night.  Love it!</li>
    <li> for dry, problematic winter skin, there is no better moisturizer out there as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> This stuff is miraculous. In seconds it provided relief to my hands that every year crack during the winter. It&#x27;s in the teens outside and my hands, feet and lips are paying the price. Today my hand look and feel almost normal. I do have Eczema which I just found out I had a few months ago and I&#x27;m 35 years old. I wish I had this stuff last year! I am so glad it&#x27;s easy to find and a good price.</li>
    <li> Just to clarify, here&#x27;s what this product is NOT:&lt;br /&gt;-this is NOT lightweight&lt;br /&gt;-this is NOT instantly-absorbing&lt;br /&gt;-this is NOT watery or creamy&lt;br /&gt;Basically, don&#x27;t expect the milky, instantly-absorbing hand creams you&#x27;d find at places like L&#x27;occitane or C&amp;E. The formula is more akin to stuff like Aquaphor, so &#x27;hand cream&#x27; might be a bit of a misnomer (this is more of a waxy gel than a cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned--this formula IS waxy, thick, and not as easy to spread as runny, milky hand creams. BUT, it absorbs quickly enough, and application isn&#x27;t particularly laborious. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I like it:&lt;br /&gt;-NON-IRRITATING: I tend to get eczema during dry winters, on sensitive areas of my face/arms (e.g. around my lips, elbows, etc). I&#x27;ve tried tons of creams meant for &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27;, that only served to provoke already-irritated/dry skin. This stuff has never once irritated inflamed skin.&lt;br /&gt;-NON-GREASY: ok, so this stuff doesn&#x27;t instantly disappear onto your skin. BUT, it&#x27;s not nearly as grossly greasy as products that are mostly petrolatum (e.g. Aquaphor, Vaseline). If I have an eczema flareup on my face, I don&#x27;t want patches of shiny grease. Thankfully, this stuff is not that.&lt;br /&gt;-ACTUALLY HEALS DRY SKIN: I visited to numerous dermatologists who all told me \\&quot;no idea what causes eczema, nothing you can do except use your topical steroid creams\\&quot;. It was a vicious cycle: sensitive-skin formulas like Cetaphil, Cerave, Eucerin, etc, only provoked already-irritated skin, and thus couldn&#x27;t provide much-needed hydration. Which made my skin dry. But when I used water, it only further dried out my skin. Topical steroid ointments were the only things that worked, until I tried this stuff. It&#x27;s seriously a life saver!</li>
    <li> It is fragrance free. But it is too thick. To apply it is like to apply Play-Doh on your hand, instead of like yogurt, which was what I was expecting. Maybe it was design in that way so that it works in Arctic or Norway. So, if you are in Alaska, maybe this is good.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is just the best out there. My father has faithfully used it for decades. I rarely needed it until my mid-20s, but when my hands are dry it follows true to its motto, &amp;#34;Just a dab heals dry skin.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is, at first, something like vaseline. You expect it to be oily and slick. Rub your hands together for about 10 seconds, though, and they feel baby-soft with no residue. It&#x27;s borderline-magical. It also works for me on elbows and any dry patch of skin. I wish there were versions of this for feet and face, though; it doesn&#x27;t apply as well to those areas. Cracked heels and breakouts will have to find another cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, this is the only brand of lotion I have ever bought twice. You should put it at the top of your list to try if you have dry hands.</li>
    <li> I work in a lab where constant hand washing is necessary. On my free time, I spend a lot of times outdoors, whitewater kayaking, rafting, climbing, etc. Oh, and I live in the Southwest...Needless to say I have extremely dry hands. Some days, it is so bad I have to use Super Glue to seal the cracks on my fingers. Painful. I have tried a lot of lotions on the market, natural balms/salves, coconut oil, etc. Neutrogena is, by far, the most effective.  No more dry skin, no more cracks. I bring it with me on all my river trips. Its texture is a bit thick and does leave a \\&quot;film\\&quot; on your hands but I think this is what makes it effective...it seals the moisture in, and seems to have a slight \\&quot;repelling\\&quot; effect. Even after my hands have been in water, I still feel some lotion remaining.  Not too keen on some of the ingredients (e.g. parabens) but I try to use it only when really needed, mostly in the winter, when outdoors, and on the river.</li>
    <li> I read a ton of the Amazon reviews and was excited to help find a solution to my dry hands issue. So yeah it&#x27;s works if you use it everyday (twice a day) it also requires more than a dab. So if you miss putting it on then it seems the dryness quickly returns. I did not like the way that my hands felt after putting it on. They felt sticky and not soft like normal lotion.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is somewhere between a cream and an ointment.  It&#x27;s really thick and does leave a residue.  I have to wipe my palms off after using it.  It does moisturize my hands well, however.  It has no discernible fragrance.  It comes in a small tube, perfect for stashing in my glove compartment.  It works on my cuticles before a manicure and leaves them soft and pliable.  I don&#x27;t use it often because I almost always forget to, but when I do use it, I&#x27;m pleased with how well it works.  I&#x27;m taking a star off for the greasy component, but for some people, that characteristic may be welcome relief from severely chapped hands.  I don&#x27;t have that problem living in Florida but I did when I lived up in the great white north.  If this cream had been on the market then, I would have welcomed it.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist, along with another much more expensive cream.  While it did the job healing my dry hands, it does leave them feeling quite greasy for a while.  Great results, no annoying aroma, but greasy.</li>
    <li> It meets all my requirements for hand cream with a good price. The tube volume is small and convenient to take-along.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  Really helps to keep my hands from cracking and bleeding in winter cold weather.  Only use it a night while sleeping.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this product on sale in the store and fell in love with it.  I don&#x27;t have to use very much of it and my hands tend to be very dry.</li>
    <li> I LOVED the old Neutrogena hand cream, and bought it for years, and recommended it, without hesitation, to friends and family. So why did they have to change a formula that worked so well? The old formula had a very pleasant, subtle scent; with this new, unscented formula, I felt like I was rubbing Crisco all over my hands. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I have really dry hands.  The kind of hands that don&#x27;t leave fingerprints on glass.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of hand creams, this one works the best.  You don&#x27;t have to use very much either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  Stays on your hands without being sticky or uncomfortable.  You can see results overnight.</li>
    <li> I have dry cuticles and hands due to the harsh winter and I deal with a lot of water at work. This is the only cream that really works for me. Leaves hands moisturized, soft and with no fragrance. Just a dab three times a day I keep a tube everywhere my purse, work and car.</li>
    <li> I work outdoors year round and have used this product for many years because it works wonders on cracked hands.  A friend of mine noticed me using this hand cream and warned me that it contains PARABENS which have been linked to various types of cancer including breast cancer.  I have since learned that Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Hand Cream contains not just one but two different types of Parabens.  I researched and found that PARABENS are a chemical that mimics estrogen.  Furthermore, Parabens are found in many lotions and cosmetics as well as food products.  Men who read up on Parabens will never go near them again because PARABENS can shrink testcles and damage male libido.  I will never use this product again.  In my opinion, this product should be banned.  Don&#x27;t take my word or anyone elses word for it, do your own research, become informed and then make your own judgement.  I for one am done with this stuff.</li>
    <li> Only odor free lotion that has cured my super dry, cut, sensitive skin hands. Even softens my really dry feet if I put it on after showering, exfoliating and then socks.</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  Its the only cream that will take care of my dry skin on my hands.</li>
    <li> I like the Neutrogena hand cream because the consistency is slightly different from a regular body lotion.  It seems to last a bit longer.  The size of these is convenient as well.</li>
    <li> excellent hand cream my hands feel so much better using this hands in water lots &amp; washing hands great asset to my hands</li>
    <li> Feels a bit too much like neosporin when rubbing it in. Won&#x27;t be using this product again.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this is the best hand lotion available.  It is not too greasy and it moisturizes my dry hands.  I am a dude and my hands would look the years older without this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! This is by far the most moisturizing cream I have used without being oily. I use it on my lips and as eye cream and can totally see the difference. If you have chapped skin I would use this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Hand Cream (Fragrance-Free) for many years.  It&#x27;s very thick so you only need a little dab each time.  With consistent use, it really works to keep hands soft even in the winter.  The small tube is handy to keep wherever you need it -- next to different sinks at home, at work, etc.  It&#x27;s best to use it right after washing your hands, to seal in the moisture.</li>
    <li> This stuff works magic on everything.  Lips, hands, feet, knees, elbows.  Put some on before bed and wake up soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part is no fragrance and it absorbs fast.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. I use it on all dry spots such as my elbows, knees &amp; of course my hands. My hands stay super soft through out the day.</li>
    <li> Must have for dry skin and winter weather. The only product that works for me.</li>
    <li> My hands get very dry in the winter, and, after using many hand lotions that did a poor job at moisturizing or were otherwise just too greasy, I opted for this more expensive option.  I have not been disappointed - a very small dab suffices to fully moisturize my hands, making it just as effective as much larger tube.  Further, unlike most other hand creams, this is not at all greasy or oily. It has more of a wax-like consistency that feels a little strange at first until you get used to it.</li>
    <li> Good product. But if you don&#x27;t need FORMULA cream, don&#x27;t buy it. I can live with just common cream.</li>
    <li> Do your hands dry out at the first hint of cool, dry weather in the fall? Do your hands dry out even worse in the cold winter weather? Yes to both of those questions for me! My hands get so dry in the winter that sometimes the tips of my fingers will split like a bad paper cut and take many painful days to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is a way to prevent this from happening, and when I say \\&quot;a\\&quot; way, I mean I&#x27;ve only found one way that if used regularly works to keep my hands moist and crack free, and that way is Neutrogena&#x27;s Norwegian Formula Hand Cream. This stuff not only prevents severe dry hands, it quickly heals them too if you stick to a regimen of using it a few times a day. In the winter I try to reapply after almost every hand washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is highly concentrated, so it only requires about a pea-sized dab to thoroughly coat both hands. I&#x27;ve seen a few complaints about how its hard to work into the hands. And that&#x27;s exactly the idea! You don&#x27;t want to use too much of this; you want to find just the right amount that will be absorbed by your hands, and that amount shouldn&#x27;t be much more than the pea-sized (or smaller) dab that I mentioned a second ago. Even a small amount will take a little effort to work into your hands so that you&#x27;re not left feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this Hand Cream doesn&#x27;t sound right for you, Neutrogena offers other options, as do a plethora of other brands that might suit your needs. But this is indeed the right stuff for me. So whether it&#x27;s the cold weather or you work with cleaners/chemicals that dry out your hands...or maybe you just need to wash your hands frequently causing severe dry hands...if nothing else seems to be helping and you&#x27;re in search of a therapy. I think you may have just found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do give it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie and say that this is the least greasy hand cream out there, because it&#x27;s not.  You&#x27;re not going to want to go around and touch things like your smartphone screen or a stainless steel refrigerator after using this product.  But I am going to say that this hand cream works very well if you have horribly chapped skin.  It works wonders for your fingertips or any part of your skin that has become rough and cracked.  The tube itself is a lot smaller than I would like it to be, but once you use the lotion, you&#x27;ll realize that a tiny dab goes a long way.  I tend to have horribly dry skin on my finger tips so I dab a little bit of this onto a bandaid and wrap it around the problem area. A little while later, it&#x27;s practically completely healed.  It also has a minimal neutral scent, so you won&#x27;t be disturbing those around you while you reapply.</li>
    <li> I lived in Midwest and this hand cream helped me cope with the severe winters. My family also like it a lot.</li>
    <li> My hands get very dry during the winter. Sometimes, my hands chap really bad, they even bleed. Until Neutrogena I tried a lot of hand creams, including fancy ones. None of them helped. Then I tried Neutrogena and now I do not have any bleeding problem :) This cream is a miracle if your hands get very dry. It&#x27;s very oily so I use it before going bed. Otherwise, you have the oily feeling when you wash your hands until your skin absorbs it. I strongly recommend this cream :)</li>
    <li> I had very dry hands that burned and sometimes bled. This clears that up quite quickly as advertised. A little does go a long way, but I order these several at a time.</li>
    <li> One dab of this hand cream really does go a long way. It&#x27;s not greasy in any way, but it doesn&#x27;t dry out quickly either. I can still feel it soaking in and moisturizing my skin for hours, even after using only a small amount. It creates a silky, luxurious feel on my hands and it makes my skin just feel healthier in general after using it. For dry, chapped, and cracked skin you can&#x27;t get any better than this. It helps to heal my dry and flaky skin areas, but unlike some other creams it never irritates my skin under any circumstances. I definitely recommend this product to anyone in need of some real skin therapy!</li>
