      <li>I absolutely love this polish!  </li>
      <li>, it looks amazing.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather pay $75.00 every time to get my own nails done.</li>
      <li>The gel goes on very easy no problems at all.</li>
      <li>I used my own nail color that was not a gel polish, and it worked just fine.</li>
      <li>Clients love the thermal color change effect</li>
      <li>and my nails still look fabulous!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering more note.</li>
      <li>I love the idea of this product and it is priced well.  </li>
      <li>Works ok...</li>
      <li>I do LOVE the sensitivity of temperature change in this polish.</li>
      <li>I was UN sure of how it would look because it&#x27;s kind of thick and globby looking, but it goes on nice and the color change is perfect.</li>
      <li>The curing time is quick, which is always nice.</li>
      <li>Peels off so easily.</li>
      <li>Still this polish could be peeled off rather easily.</li>
      <li>It is a great Pink when my temperature is warm.  </li>
      <li>I give 4 stars, only because the sparkle is unregular, but the colors are great and I love the  thermal thing.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to get it on your skin which makes it peel off.</li>
      <li>I had washed and dryed my nails and lightly buffed them before I began.</li>
      <li>Gel polish goes on smoothly and cures well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even used it to seal a cracked nail so that I can let it grow out to a comfortable length to cut it off.  </li>
      <li>and I also make hair bows tutus and all kinds of crafty things.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have used gel, and I love this.</li>
      <li>This s stuff is really cool and has lasted longer then</li>
      <li>While the finish has dulled a bit, this polish has held up extraordinarily well.  </li>
      <li>Super Quick Delivery, nail polish lasts 2 weeks, and colors are very vibrant!</li>
      <li>I love it so far.  </li>
      <li>I like how my nails change from dark to light when my hands are warm</li>
      <li>Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think the color isn&#x27;t accurately represented in the listing.</li>
      <li>It changes fast with temperature changes.</li>
      <li>The pink phase is definitely much more coral-peach than depicted in the listing photos.</li>
      <li>It sets really fast too.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much</li>
      <li>The polish stayed on for a whole week.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>Color change is very responsive.</li>
      <li>This polish provides a strong protective coating so that I can grow my nails long.  </li>
      <li>Plus the base coat and top coat make it a great value.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a licensed nail tech always trying new products</li>
      <li>any geek paint I have bought so far.</li>
      <li>Love the fact the the color changes and that it is thick.  </li>
      <li>This brand doesn&#x27;t stick well either even with their own Base and top coat.</li>
      <li>It lasted about 2 weeks only one nail started to lift at the cuticle I could have left it on for a few more days.</li>
      <li>The polish really changes color from a purple-ish brown to a glitter pink.  </li>
      <li>The top coat is a little thick as well so if you&#x27;re not careful</li>

<li> polish is a little thick so getting the color to look good is a bit hard.</li>
<li> The base coat and the top coat work really well</li>
<li> I will see how long it will take to soak off - 4 stars for now.</li>
<li> Lasts a long time on your nails!!</li>
<li> but the polish is thick and hard to apply but the price still made it worth it.</li>
<li> I was rough on them, I put it to the test dishes, gave dogs a bath, pulled weeds you name it.</li>
<li> The base layer didn&#x27;t cure smoothly and then the actual color only lasted a day before chipping.</li>
<li> My nails are thin and weak and tear - not break - easily.  </li>
<li> but the tips stay dark.  </li>
<li> I have decently thin nails, this stuff does harden them considerably.</li>
<li> I used the base coat, color and top coat.</li>
<li> If my nail growth didn&#x27;t make this look silly, I&#x27;d keep it on just to see how long it could last!</li>
<li> Waste of time and money.</li>
<li> I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s just a little thick but taking my time to apply</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
<li> This is a gel polish record for me, as they usually start to lift or chip at about the 10 day mark.  </li>
<li> Polish is way way too thick and not easy to apply.</li>
<li> It is really thick though</li>
<li> and this one is no good</li>
<li> What I have NOT liked is how hard it can be to get thin coats on (especially the base coat).</li>
<li> there starting to peel already :(</li>
<li> but all you have to do is wipe the brush on the side of the bottle and get a very thin layer!</li>
<li> HATED IT.</li>
<li> Worst product I have ever used for gel nail polish.</li>
<li> Has a terrible smell too.</li>

    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! Worst product I have ever used for gel nail polish. The base layer didn&#x27;t cure smoothly and then the actual color only lasted a day before chipping. I&#x27;m a licensed nail tech always trying new products and this one is no good, I&#x27;ll stick with gelish, it lasts 2 weeks guaranteed.</li>
    <li> The base coat and the top coat work really well but the polish is thick and hard to apply but the price still made it worth it.</li>
    <li> Works ok...polish is a little thick so getting the color to look good is a bit hard. The top coat is a little thick as well so if you&#x27;re not careful it&#x27;s easy to get it on your skin which makes it peel off. If you can get it on perfectly then it works great and looks good</li>
    <li> Super Quick Delivery, nail polish lasts 2 weeks, and colors are very vibrant! Packaged well also. I will be ordering again for sure!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this polish!  I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s just a little thick but taking my time to apply, it looks amazing.  I get tons of compliments on how it looks and people are fascinated with the color changing.  My nails are thin and weak and tear - not break - easily.  This polish provides a strong protective coating so that I can grow my nails long.  It doesn&#x27;t chip.  I like how my nails change from dark to light when my hands are warm but the tips stay dark.  It looks like I&#x27;ve had a French manicure.  I&#x27;ve even used it to seal a cracked nail so that I can let it grow out to a comfortable length to cut it off.  I would definitely buy again and recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Clients love the thermal color change effect</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this polish. I used the base coat, color and top coat. This is what I have found. I do LOVE the sensitivity of temperature change in this polish. The colors change beautifully and easily. The curing time is quick, which is always nice. I have decently thin nails, this stuff does harden them considerably. What I have NOT liked is how hard it can be to get thin coats on (especially the base coat). Also, the polish does NOT adhere to the nail that well. I had washed and dryed my nails and lightly buffed them before I began. Still this polish could be peeled off rather easily. Funnily enough, this polish did not chip. So there is a plus. I love the idea of this product and it is priced well.  But it definitely has its downfalls. Still debating if I should continue using it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this!!! Used it almost 2 weeks ago &amp; still looks like the day I put it on. The color changing is awesome, get a lot of complements.</li>
    <li> Just like salon nails!</li>
    <li> HATED IT. This brand doesn&#x27;t stick well either even with their own Base and top coat. Peels off so easily. Waste of time and money. I&#x27;d rather pay $75.00 every time to get my own nails done.</li>
    <li> This polish  is wonderful.  The polish stayed on for a whole week. It changes fast with temperature changes. It is a great Pink when my temperature is warm.  It sets really fast too.</li>
    <li> Lil upset with this polish .. painted them Friday and it&#x27;s Monday now and there starting to peel already :(</li>
    <li> This s stuff is really cool and has lasted longer then any geek paint I have bought so far. It is really thick though</li>
    <li> I love it so far.  I have not tried to remove the polish but this is a cheaper option than paying for gel nails every couple of weeks at the salon.  Love the fact the the color changes and that it is thick.  I will see how long it will take to soak off - 4 stars for now.</li>
    <li> Absolutely awesome!! I was UN sure of how it would look because it&#x27;s kind of thick and globby looking, but it goes on nice and the color change is perfect. I&#x27;m ordering more note.</li>
    <li> Not too happy with this product. Polish is way way too thick and not easy to apply. Has a terrible smell too.</li>
    <li> I give 4 stars, only because the sparkle is unregular, but the colors are great and I love the  thermal thing.</li>
    <li> Gel polish goes on smoothly and cures well. No inhibition layer to remove!  Color change is very responsive. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think the color isn&#x27;t accurately represented in the listing. The pink phase is definitely much more coral-peach than depicted in the listing photos. I&#x27;ve attached photos of my results. I&#x27;d buy again.    Editing to add:  I&#x27;ve been wearing this polish for 15 days now.  This is a gel polish record for me, as they usually start to lift or chip at about the 10 day mark.  While the finish has dulled a bit, this polish has held up extraordinarily well.  If my nail growth didn&#x27;t make this look silly, I&#x27;d keep it on just to see how long it could last!</li>
    <li> I think this has all the competitors beat! It&#x27;s been one week and my nails still look fabulous! I am a stay at home mom with three kids and I also make hair bows tutus and all kinds of crafty things. Plus I do all the cleaning and cooking. I even moved around my entire bedroom the day I did my nails and not one chipped or broke. I will be buying all of the colors they have..lol one thing I did notice is the pink/brown color changing one is thicker then the white/ blue color changing one...but all you have to do is wipe the brush on the side of the bottle and get a very thin layer! And yes I did one hand one color and one hand a diff color cause this is my test run!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used gel, and I love this. I did not use the color yet I just did a tester and I really like it. The gel goes on very easy no problems at all. It lasted about 2 weeks only one nail started to lift at the cuticle I could have left it on for a few more days. I was rough on them, I put it to the test dishes, gave dogs a bath, pulled weeds you name it. I will be buying this gel again. I used my own nail color that was not a gel polish, and it worked just fine. Thanks so much this stuff is great!</li>
    <li> Awesome products.  The polish really changes color from a purple-ish brown to a glitter pink.  Plus the base coat and top coat make it a great value.  Lasts a long time on your nails!!</li>
