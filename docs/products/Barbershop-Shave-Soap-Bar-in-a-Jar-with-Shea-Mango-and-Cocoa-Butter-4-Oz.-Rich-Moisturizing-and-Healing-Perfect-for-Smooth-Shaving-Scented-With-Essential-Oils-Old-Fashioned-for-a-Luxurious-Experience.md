      <li>Great lather.</li>
      <li>Lathers up nicely and has a wonderful &amp;#34;Woodsy&amp;#34; sent.</li>
      <li>But a great wake up without any menthol- its</li>
      <li>Paired with Gillette&#x27;s newest fusion razor yielded the closest, smoothest, shave that I have ever experienced.</li>
      <li>Great scent.</li>
      <li>The Bay Rum, Orange and Clove scent Barbershop Shave Soap Bar in a Jar smells so nice!</li>
      <li>My husband looked great and smelled so good after using this.</li>
      <li>Good for travelling and at home.</li>
      <li>Best there is for a smooth face.</li>
      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>but I did and was very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I got the cedarwood and the scent is very nice , if you can get this to lather it would make for an enjoyable shave .</li>
      <li>was given this product in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>Scent is very mild but in a good way.  </li>
      <li>Very light and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells!he lather will start to build.</li>
      <li>and I seem to get a better glide than the Proraso.  </li>
      <li>He has been using products with Bay rum scent for a long time and this Bebelush product has a delicious tropical scent.</li>
      <li>MUCH BETTER SMELL IS VERY MILD BUT SHAVE IS SOOOOOO SMOOTH</li>
      <li>This has a clean scent that I appreciate a lot more than the foofy florals that ladies shave cream comes in.</li>
      <li>It lathers up very well and does a good job of providing a comfortable shave but</li>
      <li>The soap washes off my silver tip badger brush pretty good and does not leave a residue; keep in mind that I use a mild hand soap to wash off the preShave oil and shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like how it made the razor glide smoothly</li>
      <li>In fact my underarms look hydrated and smooth.</li>
      <li>I received a free sample of this product to review on my blog.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The lather is good and after shaving, his skin is soft and touchable.</li>
      <li>I also loved it because it didn&#x27;t make my underarms itchy or red.</li>
      <li>This stuff is a lot thinner than standard shaving cream, which is a good thing because it helps you see what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Positively makes shaving so much nicer, and has a Nice aroma.</li>
      <li>A quick note-</li>
      <li>I was clean shaven- smooth and silky, with no knicks and bumps like I normally get.</li>
      <li>My husband was very excited to try out this old fashioned shave soap when I told him about it.</li>
      <li>it stays nice and wet.  </li>
      <li>Lathers up pretty well</li>
      <li>Makes shaving so much easier!</li>
      <li>The smell is very nice but subtle - in a good way, not overwhelming as some soaps tend to be.</li>
      <li>It certainly wasn&#x27;t slippy.</li>
      <li>doesnt lather very well.</li>
      <li>Very fall/winter scent (cedarwood/clove).  </li>
      <li>Got a really good lather with only a minimal amount of soap.</li>
      <li>Having shaven with an electric razor for my most of my adult life, I&#x27;m a noob when it comes to the old-school double edge razor.</li>
      <li>For this review, I received one BebeLush Barbershop Shave Soap in a handy little tin!  </li>
      <li>I have gotten good results with several other soaps using less water , more water , whipping in a bowl  or in my hand .</li>
      <li>Just a small amount is enough to make the razor glide more smoothly.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I use mostly DE razors with a few injectors and GEM SE razors to mix things up and it works well with all of them.  </li>
      <li>I was glad that it worked good for my husband, but I was disappointed with two of the ingredients, which were propylene Glycol and Titanium Dioxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This might not be a problem for most people as I shave rather slowly â€” after all, no need for yet-another-trip to the Emergency Room (you know you&#x27;re going to the ER too much when the billing department starts to send you Christmas cards and the CEO of your insurance company</li>
      <li>More moisturizing than usual shave soap.  </li>
      <li>I live in an area with soft water, so</li>
      <li>I can get great thick lather off it with an average badger brush- 20 seconds to load the brush, then build it up in a bowl.  </li>
      <li>It makes an OK lather , but doesn&#x27;t last long enough to finish a pass .</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive leg flesh, so shaving can be a horror show for me.</li>
      <li>Used once so far.</li>
      <li>WAIT TO FINISH OLD ONE</li>
      <li>HAVEN&#x27;T USED UP OLD CAKE</li>
      <li>does make your skin feel soft after shaving.</li>
      <li>I use it daily and my jar has already lasted more than a month and a half with plenty left!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended and I plan on trying future sents!</li>
      <li>a new thing might motivate him to shave his extra fur.</li>
      <li>Creamy and smooth, delicate on the skin.</li>
      <li>I have also noticed my face doesn&#x27;t burn as much nor seem as irritated as it has with other brands.</li>
      <li>The lather also does not dry out on your face-</li>
      <li>only complaint is that the soap dries up fairly rapidly (this could be common for all soaps like this, I don&#x27;t know).</li>

<li> isn&#x27;t terrible, but its below average for shave soaps that i use.</li>
<li> , sorry dudes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
<li> And I&#x27;ve used them all up, except one was so bad, I threw it away.  </li>
<li> getting lather never seems to be a problem except with really bad soaps so YMMV.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very light and moisturizing. Makes shaving so much easier!</li>
    <li> Used once so far. I wanted this for shaving kit. Lip pops on with friction not a screw on. I like it. Good price.</li>
    <li> More moisturizing than usual shave soap.  Cinnamon/clove scent may slightly irritate your skin if you&#x27;re highly sensitive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different shave soaps.  And I&#x27;ve used them all up, except one was so bad, I threw it away.  This was not thrown away.  It&#x27;s very strange, there was a sensation that it was ... gritty.  It wasn&#x27;t, but... there was an awareness, or sensation of grittiness.  It certainly wasn&#x27;t slippy.</li>
    <li> The Bay Rum, Orange and Clove scent Barbershop Shave Soap Bar in a Jar smells so nice! It made it easier for me to shave. Since it&#x27;s like a solid wax, I used my fingers to make a circular motion on the surface of the Barbershop Shave Soap Bar and then I applied it to my underarms. I like how it made the razor glide smoothly and how I got a closer shave. I also loved it because it didn&#x27;t make my underarms itchy or red. Just a small amount is enough to make the razor glide more smoothly. The BebeLush Shave Soap Bar in a Jar didn&#x27;t leave my underarms dry. In fact my underarms look hydrated and smooth.</li>
    <li> I got a chance to review Barbershop Shave Soap Bar in a Jar. This is a perfect gift for Father&#x27;s Day, or birthday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does make your skin feel soft after shaving. I love the way it smells!he lather will start to build. Shave, rinse and feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> Lathers up nicely and has a wonderful &amp;#34;Woodsy&amp;#34; sent. I love that it has nothing fake in the ingredients. I have also noticed my face doesn&#x27;t burn as much nor seem as irritated as it has with other brands. I use it daily and my jar has already lasted more than a month and a half with plenty left! Highly recommended and I plan on trying future sents!</li>
    <li> Got a really good lather with only a minimal amount of soap. The smell is very nice but subtle - in a good way, not overwhelming as some soaps tend to be.</li>
    <li> doesnt lather very well. isn&#x27;t terrible, but its below average for shave soaps that i use.</li>
    <li> Very fall/winter scent (cedarwood/clove).  But a great wake up without any menthol- its the clove- lots of clove.  If you don&#x27;t like clove this is not the soap for you.  Scent does not linger after the shave and rinse off.  I can get great thick lather off it with an average badger brush- 20 seconds to load the brush, then build it up in a bowl.  It does not seem to dry out my skin.  I would classify it as slightly above average slickness with tons of cushion.  The lather also does not dry out on your face- it stays nice and wet.  I use mostly DE razors with a few injectors and GEM SE razors to mix things up and it works well with all of them.  A quick note- I live in an area with soft water, so getting lather never seems to be a problem except with really bad soaps so YMMV.</li>
    <li> Best there is for a smooth face. My husband looked great and smelled so good after using this. He loves the way his face feels!</li>
    <li> People have different ways that they shave, some use shaving cream, shaving gel or soap.  Have you heard about the BebeLush Barbershop Shave Soap yet?  For this review, I received one BebeLush Barbershop Shave Soap in a handy little tin!  My husband has been using it to shave his face and he says, that the soap makes it easier to shave, since itâ€™s not so thick, like shaving cream.  Even though we got the cedarwood, cassia and clove scented soap, it has a very little scent that you can hardly smell.  I was glad that it worked good for my husband, but I was disappointed with two of the ingredients, which were propylene Glycol and Titanium Dioxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> My husband was very excited to try out this old fashioned shave soap when I told him about it. He has been using products with Bay rum scent for a long time and this Bebelush product has a delicious tropical scent. The lather is good and after shaving, his skin is soft and touchable. I like that this container lasts for several months and he likes that it evokes an oldfashioned barbershop shave.</li>
    <li> One of the best shaving soap I have used until now. Creamy and smooth, delicate on the skin. Good for travelling and at home.</li>
    <li> Having shaven with an electric razor for my most of my adult life, I&#x27;m a noob when it comes to the old-school double edge razor. Based on my limited experience, I like this soap a lot. This stuff is a lot thinner than standard shaving cream, which is a good thing because it helps you see what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the soap dries up fairly rapidly (this could be common for all soaps like this, I don&#x27;t know). This might not be a problem for most people as I shave rather slowly â€” after all, no need for yet-another-trip to the Emergency Room (you know you&#x27;re going to the ER too much when the billing department starts to send you Christmas cards and the CEO of your insurance company writes you a personally to thank you for helping them get a volume discount)</li>
    <li> Got this bad boy a few weeks ago and was amazed at how good it smelled!  I&#x27;ve been a Proraso user for several years and recently wanted to switch it up, thankfully I picked a winner.  Lathers up pretty well and I seem to get a better glide than the Proraso.  Scent is very mild but in a good way.  The soap washes off my silver tip badger brush pretty good and does not leave a residue; keep in mind that I use a mild hand soap to wash off the preShave oil and shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - I always use a pre-shave oil and after shave balm- I would never do without.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product to review on my blog.&lt;br /&gt;I have a fuzzy man that needs to shave. He has a raging neck beard, so I was happy to receive this product to review. I thought- hey- a new thing might motivate him to shave his extra fur. Well, I was mistaken. I guess the Stanley Cup Playoffs are still on and shaving is a no go. However, all is not lost! I also have some furry legs in need of a close shave. I decided to try the soap for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW- the ladies are missing out on the experience of shave soap. This has a clean scent that I appreciate a lot more than the foofy florals that ladies shave cream comes in. I have really sensitive leg flesh, so shaving can be a horror show for me. I was a little nervous to try this soap.. but I did and was very pleased with the results. I was clean shaven- smooth and silky, with no knicks and bumps like I normally get. I think I will be keeping this for myself, sorry dudes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> It makes an OK lather , but doesn&#x27;t last long enough to finish a pass . By the time I get to my neck the lather has almost dried up. This also does not produce the slickness that some other soaps have. I have only been wet shaving for about 3 months , so maybe I don&#x27;t have enough experience to find what works with this soap. I have gotten good results with several other soaps using less water , more water , whipping in a bowl  or in my hand . Just could not get this to perform well enough for me. I got the cedarwood and the scent is very nice , if you can get this to lather it would make for an enjoyable shave .</li>
    <li> HAVEN&#x27;T USED UP OLD CAKE YET BUT TRIED THIS ONE ANYWAY CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO FINISH OLD ONE THIS IS MUCH BETTER SMELL IS VERY MILD BUT SHAVE IS SOOOOOO SMOOTH</li>
    <li> Great lather. Great scent. Paired with Gillette&#x27;s newest fusion razor yielded the closest, smoothest, shave that I have ever experienced.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good! Received it from my wife as part of a gift and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever smelt so manly. It lathers up very well and does a good job of providing a comfortable shave but the best part is the lingering smell of the soap under your nose after you&#x27;re done. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Positively makes shaving so much nicer, and has a Nice aroma. I will never purchase canned shaving cream again. I recommend this product.</li>
