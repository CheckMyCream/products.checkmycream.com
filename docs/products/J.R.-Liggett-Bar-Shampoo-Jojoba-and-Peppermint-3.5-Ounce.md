<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Long lasting and pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I use this for my dandruff and can now get my scalp washed so well I am no longer itching. My hair is growing again!</li>
    <li> I like it but it is hard to make it last. It is also small to begin with. If you share your shower it will shrink when other people use it and it gets wet from the water or steam. Otherwise I really like it.</li>
    <li> 5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Thank you very much Looking forward to cooperate</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think you could wash your hair with a bar of soap. Until I found this. Does not take much to fully lather your head. This would be especially great if you got stuck in the wilderness and only had a lake to shower. Also good to carry in your gym bag if you don&#x27;t know where your next shower will be.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo for me so I was gald to stock up. The order cam very quickly and the price was right. I am pleased!</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo but I prefer the tree oil and hemp over the peppermint. This stuff cleans my hair better than any other I have ever tried. I used to use dandruff shampoo on my beard but this stuff is way better. I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
    <li> Thought I was going to try a new product that was advertised to remove excess sebum... but it smelled like rancid fat. I&#x27;m slowly learning not to buy food or health products from Amazon. Who knows how old the bar of soap was before they sent it to me? I bought some bulk mints from Amazon before, and they were expired!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware, the bar I received didn&#x27;t smell like peppermint at all!</li>
    <li> I love shampoo bars for the gym - no worries about leaky bottles of shampoo in my bag, and they last a long time. I tried the original unscented one before this and found it to not only not be &#x27;unscented&#x27;, but have an especially noxious odor which I was then putting into my hair. The Jojoba and Peppermint one smells much better. Still a little medicine-like but it is old fashioned after all.</li>
    <li> We are trying to use simple safe products in our house and this is perfect for cleaning the kids&#x27; hair.  Smells nice and leaves their hair soft and clean.</li>
    <li> Bar of soap disintegrated in the shower and completely dissolved after a week. Wish I could have my money back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I tried this bar. My first impressions: it has a nice smell, provides a decent amount of lather, and makes my hair feel oh so soft! We will see what the results are after long term use, but I have high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***For those of you who have given up on using shampoo bars in hard water areas, try this: While keeping your hair dry, in an empty cup or bottle mix a tablespoon or so of baking soda with shower water (or better yet, filtered water). Apply that water to your hair and lather up thoroughly with a shampoo bar. Rinse with the running shower water. Mixing baking soda with your water helps soften it and helps prevents residue buildup. You can rinse with hard water but just be sure to lather with the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; water. I&#x27;ve been doing this for a few weeks and so far I am very happy with the results, it just takes adjusting your routine a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy grooming!</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and I hate carrying liquids with me due to TSA standards, so when I first spotted this type of product I did a little research and found this product.       This soap/shampoo isn&#x27;t too hard on your hair or skin. The smell is pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin which is a plus because that means your skin isn&#x27;t clogged up with soap scum.    I only have two complaints: 1. The size of the soap is too small to travel long with (runs out a little over a month if you shower everyday) 2. Towards the end of its use the bar starts to turn into jelly.    + Easy to travel with  + Great smell  ++ Not hard on hair or skin    - Turns to jelly at the end of it&#x27;s 6 week long life.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product on a whim.  I have been looking for a shampoo that I like that doesn&#x27;t have sodium laureth sulfate, which is really harsh on your hair.  This shampoo fits that bill- with ingredients that you have actually heard of.  On top of that, this bar has the smell of peppermint (which I will admit, is a bit odd for hair fragrance, but not necessarily bad).  I have been using this shampoo for a week now- I have noticed that the dryness of my scalp is significantly reduced (this has been an on going problem for me, so it is nice to finally find something that is actually helping).&lt;br /&gt;I thought that the use of this shampoo bar would be a little bit odd, but it is actually very easy.  It goes on easily just running the bar over your head and works into a decent lather (not as much as you would get with a traditional shampoo though).  It gets through the hair easily and when you rinse it out, you will really notice how slick and clean your hair is.&lt;br /&gt;Love this shampoo!</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo bar by far. I have long, really long, abundant and thick hair. I have used this bar during my field excursions and I&#x27;ve never regretted it. Whenever I use this bar I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner. My scalp is happy, my hair is soft and shiny and I&#x27;m a very happy costumer. I would totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am new to this brand, but so far this has been the best natural shampoo I have used. Feels great in my scalp. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get away from chemicals and plastic bottles for a while. I have thick hair with medium curls that were getting flatter and heavier every time I washed. First I cut out shampoo, slight improvement and then both shampoo and conditioner. Wonderful results! Except my hair product was still leaving build up. Did some searching and came across the J.R. Liggett&#x27;s line. Took the plunge and ordered a bar. I love this stuff! I rub this on my scalp, massage a bit and I am good to go! No conditioner needed, my hair is soft, shiny and I can comb it with no hassles.</li>
    <li> Like the shampoo but it leaves hair a bit dry</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice and so far I love it. I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; for just over a year and have been using the same process for several months now. I had gotten back into researching new shampoos and found this bar recommended by a no-poo group I&#x27;m in on facebook. It has no harsh chemicals, is all natural, and leaves my hair feeling very clean and shiny. Currently I wash my hair once/week and I hope to use this bar to extend that to two weeks eventually. I&#x27;ll be buying this again, but next time will buy multiple to have on hand.</li>
    <li> My first experience with a shampoo bar was a good one. The product smells great and leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> This product did not help curing the itchiness of my scalp. I Was hoping more natural products will work. It&#x27;s no different from other shampoos. My hair gets quite rough using this.</li>
    <li> I am Caucasian female with long, coarse, frizzy, wavy brown hair. I was amazed that this product worked on my finicky hair that has always demanded high dollar products. I can now trade in my $20 bottle of aveda shampoo for a $6 bar of soap that will travel with me to Europe in my carry on! Score! My only quip: it does NOT work without conditioner for me, I tried it without and it got that &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; sticky feeling, which is terrible for long hair and it totally frizzed out. I am on the hunt for a less expensive, natural conditioner so I can trade in my expensive stuff....any suggestions? :)</li>
    <li> Texture changed after being in the shower. It also made my hair feel sticky.  Not happy with this product.  Going back to Lush&#x27;s shampoo bar.</li>
    <li> Leaves a waxy feeling but that goes away once you condition it.</li>
    <li> I bought this bar shampoo for my backpacking trip to Costa Rica.  I have long hair and a 3 oz bottle of shampoo would in no way last anything close to 8 days.  But, I also did not want to have to check my bag.  This bar was perfect for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really, really want to love this product as a shampoo.  But, it makes my hair feel sticky and unmanageable when wet.  I hate the feeling.  Dry, my hair is fine and shows no signs of stickiness but not being able to run my fingers through my hair in the shower kind of hinders any deep cleaning.  I read about the \\&quot;sticky hair syndrome\\&quot; that organic shampoos can cause so I used the bar for a week and a half before my trip to test it out.  The stickiness never did resolve itself, even with an apple cider vinegar rinse every so often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that I like it most as a facial bar.  It cleanses well but also moisturizers and does not leave my skin feeling dry or tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the convenience of the bar prevails and I will buy again for my next backpacking trip.  I can put up with temporary sticky-feeling hair if it means I can skip the baggage check.</li>
    <li> I am a female with very short hair. I love shampoo bars and anything that is minty. I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try. I&#x27;m certainly not disappointed. I love the smell and how great it makes my hair feel: super clean! Highly recommended product!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, great quality! Firs time using a shampoo bar, but so far very happy. I had an issue with a waxy feel in my hair, but was able to fix that with an ACV rinse :) Very happy so far!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, my husband threw this out after I had only used it a few times. Apparently he thought it was tofu :/    But, before he did, I got the chance to use it about 2-4 times. I used it both on my hair, and on my hair, in hard water. It worked great, and smelled great too! I highly recommend this to anyone. I love that the ingredients are so simple, and there is nothing to worry about. Very \\&quot;green\\&quot;! :)</li>
    <li> I have been trying to go for more natural, less ingredient shampoo products recently. My scalp has really been acting up. I am pretty sure my scalp is allergic to something in lots of shampoos--and now is getting even worse in the winter!  The instructions say you shouldn&#x27;t even really need to use a conditioner with this bar, i would say this really depends on your hair though. I have not been using conditioner in the shower with this, but I do put a leave in conditioner spray right away. If I don&#x27;t use SOME sort of conditioner the issue is that my hair gets static charged! But other than that no conditioner surprisinlgy doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dry. So far i really love the bar, there is barely any scent and it still actually lathers in your hair, which was surprising because there are so few ingredients!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an all natural shampoo for a while now. I&#x27;m so happy I found this! I do not have hard water at all. So from me this shampoo bar gets 5 stars! Leathers great, light fresh scent. I got the balancing bar as well to supplement every few washes but I&#x27;ve not had the need for it quite yet. I have thick hair and its long, but I got a great lather and my head felt clean without build up. Would strongly recommend this over salon brands!</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Great for travel - no liquids to go through security.  I like the results of this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I feel like my hair gets less oily with this product. It also gets my hair super clean. I don&#x27;t have problems with excess build up but then again I like to rotate my shampoos. This stuff lathers well too. I first wet my hair then rub thecbsr against my scalp.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this bar shampoo made my hair dryer than it ever felt before. I already have dry, curly hair and this did not help at all. I used it for two weeks before I couldn&#x27;t take the dryness feeling of my hair anymore. I did follow with conditioner but had to load up on the conditioner to relief the dryness from just using the bar shampoo.  My search for a natural shampoo will continue.  If you need moisture in your hair, you might want to think about this before you purchase.</li>
    <li> The product smells good and lathers well, but I never felt like I could get my scalp clean with it and started having some serious issues with the skin health of my scalp after a month of using it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I wash my hair twice a week and follow with ACV rinse.  It leaves my hair soft and clean.</li>
    <li> I have curly ish hair. I wanted to go the curly girl hair route. The first two weeks were awful, my hair was very greasy. After about two weeks my hair got used to it and is now softer and better then ever. The bar may seem small, but I hardly used any of it so far.</li>
    <li> This is great for traveling when you don&#x27;t want to check luggage and are restricted by the TWA&#x27;s limits on shampoo in carry-ons. It was somewhat more drying than my usual shampoo but lasted forever. A 2-week trip hardly used any of it. Suds up easily. I have long hair and 3 oz of shampoo doesn&#x27;t work for me for a long trip but I travel to places where it is hard to buy toiletries and I try to avoid checking baggage.</li>
    <li> The bar shampoo arrived promptly. I have not used the product yet as  I bought it for travel so I would have more room in my quart carry on   baggie for other liquids.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling unnaturally dry. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and it has basically eliminated the need for me to use conditioner. It&#x27;s a simple product that works really well, it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in the shower, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting unnecessary chemicals in my hair.    The one minor draw back is that I feel i need to take it out of the shower so that it will dry properly. Since it&#x27;s a bar, it tends to get soggy if it&#x27;s left soaking.  Also, I don&#x27;t consider myself to be a green-freak but it does feel good to know that this product is environmentally friendly.    Overall, I definitely plan to continue using this product but since it lasts for quite a while, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to buy another bar for at least 2 more months.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Bar was smaller than expected, but good.</li>
    <li> I bought this bar shampoo because I wanted to get away from less natural hair products that I have always used. I have found that this bar doesn&#x27;t smell very much at all or lather as much as regular shampoo. But I think I am so used to expecting those things from regular shampoos and after a few washes I got used to what I thought I was missing. I also lathered the bar in my hands a bit more before setting it down and that helped. I like how my hair responds to this shampoo, it feels clean without washing out my natural oils. I have been using it for about 5 weeks and have only gone back to regular shampoo once in that time. I can go 4 days or so without washing my hair and my hair looks and responds better to how I arrange it on days two and three! I will definitely buy this bar shampoo again.</li>
    <li> This soap is the greatest. I don&#x27;t have to use a conditioner. My scalp has been problematic since moving to the desert. This soap works better at healing scalp condition than Dr. prescription which dried out my hair making it look like straw. The price is so low, the quality so high.</li>
    <li> Bar shampoo is great! Lasts a really long time and has only a slight sent to it.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Very clean hair and product lasts a long time</li>
    <li> Not harsh like some bar shampoos I&#x27;ve used. Followed with a 50-50 cider vinegar and water rinse, it allows me to wash my very thick and oil-prone hair every 4 days or so, which is a first for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African american and I&#x27;ve just transitioned from relaxed to natural hair. I have a 4a/4b texture. This shampoo bar leaves my hair very soft, but it feels clean. I was skeptical, because a lot of products tend to not work on my hair.I have a sensitive scalp and a lot of products leave me with an itchy scalp. It&#x27;s true you don&#x27;t need to use a conditioner afterwards, but I use one anyway, because my hair is very thick. I hope this review helps others.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo. I have been using it for several years. The hair is not over dried. The hair does not feel oily either. You can use it every day or as often you need and the hair feels and looks wonderful. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> I have pixie-cut short hair, which is unusual for most of the females that I know. I decided to give this product a go, just because the idea of all-natural seemed like a nice thing to try out. I don&#x27;t really need to use a conditioner in the first place, and it was advertised that this product would leave absolutely no need for a conditioner. Right? Wrong. After using this product, my hair was much drier than normal, my scalp was especially itchy, which drove me nutso. I really did not enjoy the uses of this product, and although it sounds very natural and healthy, most of the other products I have used that contain SLS and other harsh chemicals have been nicer on my hair than this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true, you don&#x27;t need conditioner! When my hair was still wet it felt like straw and I was thinking I should have used conditioner, but after it dried my hair is so soft and shiny. I&#x27;m never using regular shampoo and conditioner again!</li>
    <li> I love this because it acts like a revitalizing cleansing shampoo every time I use it!  I have long blond curly/wavy hair that gets oily, and my hair comes out light and fluffy -- especially at the roots where I most need it to be clean.  I HAVE to use conditioner afterwards, because the clean is so intense, it&#x27;s actually sticky, and I have found COWASH to be the most amazing moisturizing conditioner (tho they call it a cleanser -- we call it COW WASH) that restores a clean softness to all my hair and still leaves my hair fluffy at the scalp.  TRY IT!  I converted my husband.  He hates change.  :)</li>
    <li> This shampoo bar would be great for a person with dryer hair than mine. It left me with a greasy spot at the back of my head that didn&#x27;t wash out. My blonde hair went from bright to brown after a few uses. Too bad, this would have been a great travel product.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, I noticed there is no lather. Not too big of a deal because I&#x27;ve used natural products and was expecting little to no lather. Second thing I noticed was when I rinsed my hair it was grippy like if you&#x27;ve ever washed with a bar of soap when you forgot to bring shampoo on a trip. Third, I noticed the water just dripped off of my hair and drying time was significantly reduced. I was very happy,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I used it a second time and then a third time. The third time was the worst. My hair had an oily buildup and I rinsed it a long time under warm water. My hair looked and felt much greasier than before I washed to a disgusting level. In fact, my hair has NEVER been that greasy in my entire life. It looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed in two months. I have come to realize the more I used this shampoo bar, the more buildup I had. Because I had no clarifying shampoo, I created my own with vinegar and boiled water. That worked to remove the oily buildup and my hair looked clean and fresh with no tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I won&#x27;t be able to use this shampoo bar except for every once in a while and never twice in a row.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a trip abroad because I was not going to be able to bring my regular shampoo or conditioner. It left my hair dry after one wash. I kind of felt like I had used dishwashing soap on my head. I guess it did the trick of ensuring my scalp was clean but I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> (the wife posting here, medium length straight/wavy hair) I got this one after using the original formula for about a month. The reason I got this one is because of the peppermint. I&#x27;ve been having problems with smelly hair with the original formula and thought the peppermint would help.  While the soap does have a peppermint scent to it, it&#x27;s extremely light and I can barely smell it on the soap, let alone on my hair. It does control my hair odor better than the original formula, but I&#x27;m looking into other things I can do to make this shampoo bar perfect for me. It leaves my hair soft and with no tangles, but a bit dull (something I&#x27;m working on as well). I&#x27;d recommend the soap by itself for short-term use. For long-term use, at least I have to use one other product to make it perfect.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lush Shampoo Bars for a few years now because I just don&#x27;t like the liquid shampoo. I feel that sometimes it doesn&#x27;t get the dirty out(my personal preference). But lately Lush has been really expensive on the pocket so I decided to branch out and look for other shampoo bars. I found this one and decided to try it out. Boy was I surprised at how clean and refreshing it made my scalp feel. And on top of that it was twice the size of Lush&#x27;s shampoo bar and half the price!! Needless to say I have whole-heartedly changed from Lush to these guys.</li>
    <li> Hair Type: 10 Month transitioning African American hair - 3C . Colored processed&lt;br /&gt;Hair Routine: I flat iron my hair once a week and wear it straight until my next shampoo. ( every week or two )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started transitioning I used to use the Brazilian Blowout shampoo , conditioner and hair masque which worked very well and did maintain the Brazilian blowout treatments I used to receive. However, I wouldn&#x27;t say that it was worth the $40+ price tag for each product. Then, I tried a trial of Organix Coconut Milk shampoo and it was horrible,  instantly made my hair dry and seemingly brittle. That exprience made become very conscious of placing unnatural ingredients on my hair. In January, I began using Virgin Coconut Oil (sealing and setting) and Unrefined Raw Shea butter on my tresses ( as a flat iron protectant,styling, and sealing and setting, which in itself tremendously improved the health of my hair and added brilliant shine and silkiness on top of softness. However, I was still working on emptying the contents of the Organix Coconut Milk shampoo and each time I shampooed, it felt like I was cheating my hair from the full benefits of health. I researched LUSH&#x27;s shampoo bars which isn&#x27;t as completely natural as they market it as , their shampoo bars has a tremendous amount of sulfates and too many unnatural ingredients for my liking . So, I decided to try J.R Liggets shampoo bar in Jojoba oil, since the ingredients are completely natural and instantly my hair was sooooo soft, curls very defined,  hair  much more manageable, easier to detangle and hair shine and silkiness was enhanced ( along with my typical hair routine of raw shea butter &amp; sometimes unrefined coconut oil ). It&#x27;s true a conditioner isn&#x27;t necessary. I&#x27;m excited to try the other formulas .</li>
    <li> I never used to be able to shampoo without conditioner but this bar allows me to do that, and it is natural to boot!</li>
    <li> The first few times I tried it, my hair was covered in tacky film. Rinsing with vinegar did not work. However, I followed the hard water tips on Liggett&#x27;s website, putting a little baking soda in a large tupperware and filling that with warm water and using that to saturate my dry hair in the shower and it has worked just fine since. You can use regular water for competing the lather and rinsing. Worked well as is in NYC and VA. I think the bar has best results when your hair has more natural oils in it, so I&#x27;ve been brushing with a boar bristle brush to distribute oils at night and before washing. Have been able to stretch out time between shampoos to a few days rather than every other.</li>
    <li> I used baking soda for about three years until I switched to this shampoo bar. While I loved baking soda for a squeaky clean scalp with no build up, it made my hair a little dry. I have been using this shampoo bar for two months and I love the feel of my hair every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular shampoo &amp;#60; Baking Soda &amp;#60; J.R.Liggett&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Different to use than liquid shampoo, but suds well and easy to pick up.</li>
    <li> love the scent, but made my hair heavy and waxy to where I just wanted to wear a ponytail.  I even tried an apple cider vinegar rinse after washing.  I really wanted to love it and make it work for me, but no go.  I ended up using it as a body wash.</li>
    <li> Was a little disappointed with the results.  I have very curly and unruly hair.  The soap did make my hair soft, but also made it very dull and lifeless.  I agree with other reviewers that it would make a good camp soap though.  Smells good, and makes a nice ladies shaving soap for tender bits.</li>
    <li> I really like this bar. It takes a little getting used to less lather. I don&#x27;t use a conditioner, just comb my hair out while the shampoo is in it and rinse. Rinses right out and my hair just feels clean.</li>
    <li> I am sure this is great for some people, but my hair did not like it! My hair got even worse frizzy!</li>
    <li> just found this and i like it very much, in fact i just ordered a second bar... jojoba moisturizes my scalp nicely, the peppermint scent is not bad, something both males and females would like, and it lathers up nicely too... An excellent ALL NATURAL bar of shampoo, try it!</li>
    <li> Shampoo leaves my hair clean.  I like the convenience of a bar shampoo easy to travel with. 4 stars for price for the size of the bar it disappears quickly. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really speak to the performance, as I bought it as a stocking stuffer.  However, I neglected to measure out the dimensions first (didn&#x27;t think I needed to measure out a bar of soap).  Unfortunately, it was a little embarrassing to give, as the BAR IS TINY.</li>
    <li> Not as &#x27;minty&#x27; smelling as i had hoped, but does a nice job cleaning hair. I personally still use conditioner afterwards.</li>
    <li> Took a bit of getting used to but after a week or two, like it alot.  Sure beats having the shampoo bottles in the shower.</li>
    <li> This shampoo bar has a very light peppermint scent and produces alot of lather with minimal effort. Result is squeaky clean hair and scalp. This bar must be kept out of direct contact with water between uses or it will disappear quickly. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for four months now and am very satisfied.  I won&#x27;t be going back to any other product and am trying to get the rest of the family to start using it too.  I have long straight hair, length tends to be dry, scalp normal.  I can go three days before needing to wash again.  I found that the best method to use it is to make sure your hair is very wet and then rub the bar over your scalp, since I have long hair, I have to part it and rub over sections.  On the first few uses it did not lather much, but once the build up in my hair from other products was removed, it lathers up really nicely now.  The lather does tend to disappear quickly, but it lasts long enough to make sure you&#x27;ve covered your entire scalp.  Because my ends are dry, I do use a natural apple cider vinegar and water rinse to condition the length of my hair.  The peppermint extract can sting your eyes, but I have had no problems...I don&#x27;t usually get it in my eyes.  Like I said, I am sold on this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I switched to this after trying the baking soda and vinegar shampoo method for a few weeks, and having minimal luck. Now my hair is soft, my scalp isn&#x27;t itchy, and it&#x27;s really easy to use in the morning! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Long lasting, cleans and makes my hair soft and clean.  Good deal to naturally replace shampoo bottles.  whole family loves it!</li>
    <li> I have tried the \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; method of cleaning my hair for 3 months and the baking soda ended up really drying out my ends.  A friend told me about Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bar and I tried it. I can honestly say I have never tried a shampoo that makes my hair look so healthy and soft! My hair is usually (all my life) on the dry/coarse side and I always use more conditioner than shampoo for softer hair. With Liggetts a rarely use conditioner anymore if I do, just a tiny bit.  I have been telling everyone I know about this shampoo and I will be using it exclusivly from now on! I love that it is all natural with no laurel sulfates and that in doesn&#x27;t cost a ton like most healthy beauty products do.</li>
    <li> I got it super quick, but it left residue on my hair.  It just doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to Lush.  That being said, the service was good.  Shipping was great.</li>
    <li> I originally wanted to try this bar because I&#x27;ve been trying to be more gentle on my hair as it&#x27;s been falling out due to PCOS symptoms. Though I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice results with hair fall out, it does make my hair feel stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think this is a wonderful product, and great for travel. I enjoy how clean it makes my hair feel, but I do find that I still need to use a conditioner of some sort, as my preference. There wasn&#x27;t as much movement to my hair as I&#x27;m accustomed to. However, I can see how/why they would claim that you didn&#x27;t NEED a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can have quite an oily scalp by day 2 and this shampoo bar left my hair feeling clean, voluminous, and manageable even on second day hair. If you&#x27;re a beauty geek like me, then you may want to research other natural/gentle products to finesse and style your look because it did also give me quite a few fly aways, but that&#x27;s no biggie, just me being the stickler I am :) haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is so small you may lose it before it&#x27;s time to use it!  photos make it seem like a regular sized bar, but it&#x27;s really, really tiny !!&lt;br /&gt;When I received this item I thought it was some kind of joke:  a tiny little bar of soap that is about one quarter the size of a regular, SMALL bar of soap.  And \\&quot;hand made\\&quot;?  what does that claim mean?  well, it means that it was cut into these tiny little pieces BY HAND,  therefore making \\&quot;each piece unique\\&quot;.  What a cynical bit of promotion.  Seriously folks,  just go into any health/beauty store or bed/bath accessories store and buy a regular sized bar of this soap for about five bucks ... then cut it BY HAND into four pieces, and you&#x27;ll have the same thing as this eight dollar rip-off.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the great transaction!!  Love this shampoo!!!</li>
    <li> No scent tangledmy hair bad</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for solid shampoo...fell in love with LUSH...but so pricey.  This is a nice alternative.</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely wonderful! The peppermint leaves my scalp feeling tingly and my hair feeling soft and clean. Doesn&#x27;t lather as much as &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; shampoo but it does lather, and it&#x27;s plenty for me. Worth getting if you&#x27;re trying to get away from chemical shampoo. I use an apple cider vinegar rinse after.</li>
    <li> Getting pregnant has really taken a toll on my hair (I&#x27;m so envious of the mamas out there who say their hair was at its healthiest and shiniest during pregnancy). I was having split ends like nobody&#x27;s business - probably the result of multiple ombre hair colorings and the poor nutrition that resulted from my first trimester of serious morning sickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was looking for a shampoo that didn&#x27;t have all the harsh chemicals... I&#x27;d debated doing the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; method but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to do it. I read the reviews on this product and decided to take a chance. So glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is so, so soft. It doesn&#x27;t really lather a lot which may take some getting used to (at first I didn&#x27;t think it was working) but that&#x27;s really the only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; that I have. I love the fresh smell. I love how soft it leaves my hair. I love that it actually cleans it (I was admittedly a little skeptical over whether or not I would be left with a clean feeling). It&#x27;s really wonderful.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo after using the original formula for a month.  I like the smell and texture that I get from the Jojoba and Peppermint Shampoo bar.  My hair is extra soft and beautiful, and I&#x27;m excited to see how it will look over time. I do not need conditioner or a detangler with this product.</li>
    <li> wow best soap. I thought soap would be harsh but all my dandruff problems I had with traditional shampoo are gone.</li>
    <li> I would have loved it if it weren&#x27;t for the old rancid scent that the bar had. I still used it. I don&#x27;t like things to go to waste, but seriously smelly. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this stuff is the all natural awesomeness that it claims to be, but it is way too expensive for how much you get. This bar will be gone and down the drain in a couple weeks, along with the $5+ I spent on it!</li>
    <li> Lathers up nice, but kind of dries my hair out.</li>
    <li> I stopped using commercially prepared shampoos about a year or so ago. Prior to that I was cutting down on shampoo frequency and amount. My sorta dry, mostly wavy, super long hair was always looking greasy at the scalp and unruly everywhere else even with shampooing every day. So I began to cut back to every other day to every couple of days (or many more- depending on what I was doing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I switched to not using anything but water (meh), to home made concoctions (a lot of trial and error, but good experience overall) and occasionally a store bought organic, low toxicant formula. Whether home made or store bought, I want something that will clean my hair, not coat my hair with anything, and to contain just a few ingredients, with all of them being safe, non toxic, and environmentally friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curious about a few products, I went to the Environmental Working Group to check out the safety of the ingredients. While doing so, I randomly came across this product. It had a good rating, so I decided to check it out on Amazon. I&#x27;m glad I did, since between the information gleaned from EWG and the reviews provided here, I made a purchase of one bar of the Jojoba and Peppermint Shampoo. To use: wet hair thoroughly. Lightly stroke the bar of soap down the hair. It will suds up. It doesn&#x27;t suds up much in the hand, which is how I initially tried to apply it. I then add a little more water to my head, and once again stroke the bar down my hair. The amount of suds was impressive. I had gotten used to low suds homemade/organic soap \\&quot;shampoos\\&quot;, and it was rather nice to feel the building up of lather. Excess suds went to washing my face, etc. Finish up by thoroughly rinsing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Very clean hair.  Borderline clarifying.&lt;br /&gt;-Full looking hair after it dries&lt;br /&gt;-Inexpensive (this bar WILL last awhile)&lt;br /&gt;-Very few ingredients&lt;br /&gt;-Minimal (and quaint) packaging&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to handle in the shower&lt;br /&gt;-Smells good, yet very minimal.

This is caustic soda or lye, which is a great cleaning agent but can be irritating to eyes. Just keep the suds out of them. (I used the excess suds to wash my face without issue)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip to keep the bar lasting a long time:&lt;br /&gt;- Grab a baggie or buy a cute little water tight container. As with any shampoo bar, this bar will disintegrate, semi liquify if left out in the open in the shower. Plan to put it in a baggie or some water tight container after each use. I go a few days between shampoos, so I have forgotten to take care of my shampoo bar more often than not. I leave it sitting in a plastic dish, and the dish collects water/humidity from other showers. Then when I go to shampoo, the bar is sticking to the container on the bottom and a tad bit dried out on top. Similar to any bar of soap, really. Anyway, I plan to take better care of my shampoo bar so it lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see Liggett&#x27;s has a few formulations available, I&#x27;m going to consider purchasing another one to see if I can find one that is more moisturizing.al.

    <li> Despite all positive feedbacks this magic bar didn&#x27;t work for my hair. There is now rich leather as promised, hair feels like unwashed and it&#x27;s a real problem to brush them after using this &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34;. If you have ever washed your hair with ordinary soap - you will get the same experience if you use this &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34;. I wish I didn&#x27;t buy it, just wasted my money ((</li>
    <li> Every winter I lost a lot of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;But after i use it (I do not need any conditioner), it reduced my hair loss!!&lt;br /&gt;Also each hair looks healty. (not greasy, each hair stands healty).&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo bar. It cleans your hair without stripping it. You can feel the clean feeling and you will be satisfied. This is a great product with great results. The smell is wonderful as well.</li>
    <li> This always leaves me hair a bit dry and squeaky clean so I sometimes have trouble untangling my hair.</li>
    <li> Wooooow!!! I bought this while stocking up on family toiletries. I had never seen or heard of it before, so, I bought it on a whim. We use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint body wash, so I chose the peppermint scent of this shampoo, figuring my husband would use it, if nothing else. I will never buy anything different, except to try other scents. My husband loves it too.&lt;br /&gt;I have Very fine, untreated hair with Zero body, that goes to about the middle of my back. I used to wash and condition my hair every other day with Alba, or face dealing with oily, slicked down hair. I noticed an immediate change in my hair, for the better! It lathers up nicely but leaves your hair feeling stringy and just all kinds of awful while wet. Truly terrible. I have yet to work up the courage to solely use this product, but plan on it. I&#x27;ve been following up with a half cap of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Citrus Conditioning rinse, diluted in a cup of water. This leaves hair feeling, possibly, a shade less scary. I towel dry and I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled to say, No Tangles. My hair is left feeling freaking amazing! Better part, it looks even better the following day. Best part, I only need to wash my hair every 3 or 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;Best beauty product I&#x27;ve found a Very long time. I highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I love this bar shampoo. It seems to last longer than a jar of shampoo and it&#x27;s much more compact (great for traveling). I also love the Jojoba/peppermint scent and feel. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had gone the &#x27;no poo&#x27; method for the last 6 months and liked the fact that I wasn&#x27;t using chemicals,  but after a couple of months, I had to start using &#x27;no poo&#x27; every other day, and regular shampoo every week or 10 days because the baking soda/vinegar was drying my hair out and leaving it a mess. I also had to keep using conditioner once a week throughout the process. I received this bar shampoo in the mail a week ago, and I LOVE it!! My hair took to it right away. All the dry fly-away&#x27;s are gone, and my hair is soft, silky, and bouncy. My curls are defined with absolutely no frizz! I haven&#x27;t used conditioner at all this week, and my hair is still noticeably softer than before. My color is brighter and the shine is amazing! Love, love, love it! Will definitely be buying this for gifts for my mom and my daughters.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the thought of how natural it is.... BUT it feels aweful on the skin and hair ... It just feels dirty rough and makes the hair feel like rubber bands... The hair actually can be pulled like a rubberband and snap! But also when you let the hair air dry ... It feels somewhat healthier. Just the feeling is gross.</li>
    <li> I have long, straight, very thick, bond hair. I have to use a conditioner just to get a pick through after washing because it tangles so easily. Yes, your hair feels different when its wet after you rinse it out but I could brush it without conditioner! Now that it is dry so soft I can&#x27;t stop touching it! (yes I know thats a no no) I tried no poo for several months and it just didn&#x27;t work for me. They say its supposed to take some time for your hair to get used to being washed this way but I already love it! My traditional shampoo and conditioner are going in the trash!  **Update** Been using this almost 4 months now and still love it! Dandruff is no longer a problem. This is the only product I use for shaving my legs as well. If your having problems with your hair feeling oily I solved this by washing and rinsing until it lathers. At most I only have to wash it twice and this is very rare. I also use the coconut one and love that, it lathers a bit more if you like that. What are you waiting for? Try it!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very low suds, good for my septic and the environment&lt;br /&gt;Smells delicious&lt;br /&gt;Cleans my hair as well as the expensive stuff&lt;br /&gt;No frizzies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rub the bar onto my palm several times, rub my palms together and work into my scalp. I think the idea behind this is to clean the scalp instead of the ends of the hair. That prevents excessive tangles and eliminates the need for conditioner...which is simply an &amp;#34;oil change&amp;#34;. I do use diluted apple cider vinegar as a rinse and sometimes a spray detangler before I comb. I have fairly short, highlighted hair and it looks nice and clean and shiny. I keep the bar in a plastic box outside of the shower so it does not melt. Will definitely keep using this bar shampoo (and try the others as well). Also going to use it on my dog!!!</li>
    <li> This cleans, but does not strip or dry the hair or scalp.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast.  Yes, it is a small block of soap, but it does later well and I expect it will last awhile. Smells nice, and cleaned well. Only thing is I have long coarse color treated hair, I still need traditional conditioner. I did notice that it didn&#x27;t strip my hair of its red color. My hair seems to stay cleaner longer than with bottled shampoos.</li>
    <li> You cannot pick a better product to wash your hair with. No toxic chemicals, little packaging, and no conditioner needed. My hair hasn&#x27;t looked better.</li>
    <li> nothing special about it. it melts quickly,you can wash your hair maximum 10 times if not less. not worth the money.</li>
    <li> i love it, girl.  this is the best.  you betta work that hair, girl.  work it.  love it. reuse it.</li>
    <li> This product is great because it&#x27;s light weight and won&#x27;t spill in either a suitcase or backpack.  Washes hair well,but I do need to put conditioner on afterwards</li>
    <li> It stripped my hair and made it dry frizz.  I wanted to try the other kinds when I was first considering this product, but now I&#x27;m not sure I will venture in that direction.</li>
    <li> Cleans well, almost too well. Leaves hair feeling very dry, like all of the natural oils were stripped.</li>
    <li> Not for me. Leaves my hair with a waxy residue. At first, it seemed to clean so well but later on that night the clean feeling dried to a sticky unpleasant residue. The residue attracts more dirt and oil. I tried using it only on my scalp and not on the rest of my hair but I found I had to was my hair more often. I hear it works wonders on others maybe I didn&#x27;t give it enough of a chance I used it for 2 weeks but chose to stick to WEN. Bummer because the price was so low.</li>
    <li> Great product but leaves hair a bit waxy.</li>
    <li> Totally love it! Love the way it makes hair feel and it&#x27;s good stuff besides, natural and full of goodness. Thank you!</li>
    <li> My scalp is sensitive.  The previous shampoos and conditioners, even more expensive brands still left me with an itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba and Peppermint is the best of the J.R Liggetts soaps.  I&#x27;ve used the original formula, but this one seems gentler to use.  I don&#x27;t even need to use conditioner.  Though I know I may have shampoo buildup eventually.  I would use 2 tbsp organic apple cider vinegar in 1 cup warm water as a rinse every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful Hint:&lt;br /&gt;This my second bar and learned to make the bar last longer is to use a soap saver. I bought InterDesign Soap Saver. It helps keep the soap from desolving in the waterlogged soap holder after a shower. It holds the soap up to allow the soap to dry between uses. Also, the oval one (best price) fits in travel soap holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do a swipe on each side on my head with the bar,its enough to shampoo the hair. Rub gently massaging the scalp, won&#x27;t produce a lot of lather but will clean the hair without stripping it of the natural oil the scalp produces. Rinse thoroughly to remove the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this shampoo bar, highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now. My itchy scalp is gone and less hair seems to be falling out in the shower. Even better, the waste of packaging is almost nonexistent. The bar also lasts quite a long time. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Having very long hair [mid thighs], I was worried it would not work.  I wanted to pre-test it before traveling with it. It is awesome, I like it better than liquid. I do still use a dime size dab of conditioner, but it leaves it really shiney.  I am going to check if they have a conditioner bar. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> My hair has never felt better!</li>
    <li> A fine alternative to regular liquid shampoos. Nice light smell, lathers great. Only possible knock is that my hair feels a bit on the dry side after using, but it&#x27;s not a significant issue - scalp isn&#x27;t dry, and I use product on my hair anyhow. The bar is long-lasting as well, so it&#x27;s good bang for the buck</li>
    <li> I love this so much, it leaves my hair so soft.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let this little bar fool you.  This shampoo gets your hair super clean and shiny and your scalp tingling.  I love the fact that it is made with all natural ingredients.  The smell is subtle and fresh not like most shampoos that overdo with the artificial fragrances.  The only downfall is that you really have to work at it to get a nice lather, but once you start it&#x27;s surprising how soapy it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this soap for men who have short hair.  It cleans the scalp and does not leave a flowery smell.  The bar lasts a long time, about a month if you shampoo every day.  I used it and I didn&#x27;t need any conditioner with it.  My hair was soft without added products.  It didn&#x27;t dry out my scalp either, even using it every day.  I would recommend it even though I understand it won&#x27;t be the perfect shampoo for everyone.</li>
    <li> i am very happy with this product.  It does add a film to your hair that helps volumize thin hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo bar surprised me. I have fine, curly hair past the shoulders and in effort to switch my products to more natural, gave this a try. For my hair, I definitely need a conditioner (first try without it left me fuzzy!). It took my hair about 3 washes to adjust and now it is fuller than I can ever remember. There is no smell. Be sure to drag the bar across your hair and don&#x27;t rub it between your hands for lather. You won&#x27;t think it will work, but it does. I make 6 swipes front to back starting above my ear and going across the top of my head to the other ear, then lather. It rinses very fast - that was a shock the first time. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This lathers up really well and leaves my hair shiny and very clean. It&#x27;s a small bar but lasts a long time. Mild fragrance. Try it!</li>
    <li> It works really well, got the peppermint sensation on my scalp very mild</li>
    <li> I have been using the bar for a month now and I do enjoy using it.  Be warned: There was an adjustment period for me in using this.  In the beginning a waxy substance coated my hair and I wore up-dos to keep my hair from looking unkempt.  After a week or so, the waxy substance was gone and my hair has been smooth looking since.  I don&#x27;t know if I wasn&#x27;t washing the shampoo out well enough or if I was washing out build-up from years of using whatever cheap shampoo I could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 37 year old Caucasian, use this daily, and my hair looks great.  I use the bar directly on my scalp and hair and scrub it out in the shower.  Every few days I rinse with apple cider vinegar afterward.  My hair is manageable, clean and looks smooth and thick.  I am overall very happy with the shampoo bar.  Also, my hair produced a large amount of sebum and that is also becoming more manageable and my hair looks much less greasy in the mornings.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> My beard is now &amp;#34;free at last, free at last, thank God almighty, it&#x27;s free at last!&amp;#34;  NO more beard-druff.  I can wear black shirts again.</li>
    <li> I found this shampoo while shopping for alternatives to liquids for traveling. I ordered just one and cut off slivers for several friends to try. We liked the shampoo so well that we have ditched all our liquid shampoos forever and ordered enough to last several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all noticed that our heads no longer itch. And we all seemed to notice better body and can go longer between shampoos. I am still using a little hair conditioner once in awhile, but expect to no longer need that soon. And, the little slivers which i cut off for each of us were about 1/4 inch cut of the bar. That was 2 weeks or so ago...and i still haven&#x27;t used up the sliver. So these bars must last a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy customer! Very glad to find yet one more product that is a bit healthier for my hair and body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh! and my hair and that of my friends is short if that helps anyone. So that might account for how little is used of this little bar! The bar is smaller than a normal bar of soap, but it does not take much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, i read in other reviews about people having so much trouble with the bar melting...i have no idea why their bars are melting into a glob of goo. I keep a dry towel near the bathtub and just set the shampoo bar on that so it will dry in the air. It dries within minutes and works great! I have never had trouble with it turning into a glob of goo. I think as long as you take care to dry it with a dry cloth or whatever before you put it in your travel case, you should be fine!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been following the \\&quot;no-poo\\&quot; movement for about three weeks now and I am extremely happy with how my hair is turning out. I was only extremely greasy for about a week, which was surprising because I thought I would have to wait a month until I wasn&#x27;t super oily. My hair is extremely soft and no longer frizzy. However, about the same time I decided to go without shampoo, I also decided to exercise daily, which means I get sweaty. I was using baking soda on my hair more often than I would have liked. I also really missed lathering my hair. So I went ahead and decided to try this out. It&#x27;s AMAZING. My hair feels so clean AND it still feels as soft as it was yesterday. Normally when I shampoo, my hair gets frizzy, but that didn&#x27;t happen with this product. It doesn&#x27;t smell too bad either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no harsh chemicals and I know I&#x27;ll be saving a lot of money with this bar, since I only plan to wash my hair maybe once every week or two, possibly going for a month without washing. For anyone who can&#x27;t stand the thought of going without shampoo but still wants to try out no-poo, do your hair a favor and use this product, instead of killing your hair with the shampoo we all know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Not too long ago my bar ran out. I was slightly reluctant to purchase some more because I was saving up. For a while I stuck with conditioner only washes and baking soda. My mom bought me regular shampoo and I tried to avoid using it but I ended up using it in desperation. My scalp is a flaky mess now. I&#x27;ve ordered two more JR Liggett&#x27;s bars. Never going back and never going to hesitate on buying more when I run out.</li>
    <li> All of JR Liggetts shampoos are really good.  I bought this shipment for my grandson before he left for college.  He really likes the shampoo and he has the traveling case to go with it.  It makes for a great dorm room shampoo.  Easy to carry to the shower.</li>
    <li> I wished I had known this product decades ago, but am nonetheless happy to experience it now. Practical, economical, pure shampoo. Lathering once lightly is all is needed to feel the clean under my fingers and see it in the shine of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I use Dr. Bronner Lavender and Coconut Hair conditioning right after to perfect this new healthy routine. My hair are beautiful/</li>
    <li> I really wanted a peppermint shampoo and this brand is the best shampoo I have ever used on my hair.  My local store only carries the original and herbal scent.  This shampoo works as well as the other 2 but the smell is much fainter than I expected.</li>
    <li> This product leaves your hair squeaky clean.  It takes some time getting used to how to apply it.  I was always used to liquid and this is in a bar format so I had to get used to it.  Once I got that down, I feel the suds and it really cleans my scalp/hair.  It smells great, but not too strong (I&#x27;m reactive to strong odors).  I&#x27;m also reactive to many ingredients and I had no reactions to this at all.  I also recommend buying a tin or plastic holder for it so it doesn&#x27;t get wet in the shower.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> Holy cow, where have you been all my life, and I&#x27;m no spring chicken? How do you make my hair squeaky clean, but not dry? One more question. How do you make any money? A couple of swipes across my wet head, and I&#x27;m fully lathered. There are three members of our family, one male and two females, and we all use it. Trust me we will be regular customers. This is our opinion after a couple of weeks use.</li>
    <li> I love love love this shampoo!</li>
    <li> BUY IT! I have natural African hair and suffered from intense dandruff and dermatitis for years prior to using this. My condition isn&#x27;t cured but it has definitely been minimized. I love this natural shampoo so much. It doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out, it lathers so well you don&#x27;t need much. I wash weekly so 1 bar lasts me a year. Screw head and shoulders and other s***ty shampoos that make dry scalp so much worse.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, leaves my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about the potential of using a bar shampoo, but I was ultimately disappointed by this product. I did my research prior to purchasing this item and knew that it took several washes to really see results. I gave the bar 2 weeks before I gave up. The first wash, I noticed my hair felt stiff and stripped (but again, I knew this was to be expected). I got out of the shower and found it impossible to move a comb through my hair - it took me upwards of a 30 minutes to brush out all the tangles. I decided to let my hair air dry, so I waited... and waited... and waited... until I realized, my hair was still soaking wet after hours of air drying. Not only was it wet, but it felt stiff, waxy, and frizzy beyond belief. I did some more research and discovered I had likely not washed out the product adequately. So I tried again. The results were even worse. My hair looked stringy and felt sticky, almost as if I had run honey through my ends. It was awful. It wasn&#x27;t until the third wash that I began to notice DANDRUFF. I&#x27;ve never had dandruff before, but it came full force with this product. It took three washes of my regular shampoo to cut through the build-up this product left in my hair. The one redeeming quality of this product is that it really does keep my roots from getting oily, and that is why I gave it two stars.</li>
    <li> After seeing all the good reviews on this I decided to try it -- I&#x27;ve used it twice so far, and I won&#x27;t be going back to regular shampoo!  I have fine, slightly longer than shoulder length straight hair, and I&#x27;ve tried SO many shampoos that promise volume.  This little inexpensive shampoo bar is the first product that has given my hair what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  My hair looks and feels fuller, and not only that, it curls better!  No more over-priced,  under-promising shampoos for me!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these. I have been using them for months now and my hair feels amazing. I can go a couple days without washing now and I feel like my hair is softer overall and less frizzy.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s non-toxic and it cleans my hair really well. It&#x27;s a little hard to rinse and would leave a white residue when the hair drys - it happens when you use soap to wash hair. I now use diluted ACV to aid the rinsing. It makes hair smoother so it&#x27;s easier to rinse and it seems to solve the residue issue as well.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. I have thick long hair. My roots get oily and my ends are dry. Works well. Lathers. Smells good. Hair feels weird with a residue when wet, however soft and manageable when dry. Adds body.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well - smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars because it requires some kind of container for the shower. Otherwise, if even a little bit of water gets on it, the bar dies very quickly. I had mine only a couple weeks before it turned into nothing from just the spray of water bouncing off my skin (no direct water spraying on it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You probably need a box or something to keep it dry when you&#x27;re not using it at that moment.</li>
    <li> Oh I love this so much! I&#x27;ve been trying to use more natural products and decided to throw away every hair/skin/face product that includes any sort of chemical/artificial ingredients. I love jojoba oil and use it regularly on my skin and hair, so I was hoping I would like it in this form. The peppermint is surprisingly refreshing. I was surprised how well it lathers and cleans. My hair felt really waxy after I rinsed out the shampoo, but I put argan oil on my hair once I got out of the shower and my hair feels amazing now that it&#x27;s dry! My hair is very thick and can be super unruly, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would react to this. But I&#x27;m so happy with this product, I&#x27;m never going to buy regular shampoo again. This is way too gentle, practical, natural, and easy to travel with to ever not use.</li>
    <li> I got tired of using those liquid shampoo with all of those unnecessary ingredients and wanted something natural and get my hair clean. I came across this and was skeptical at first. Shampoo bar? Seemed a bit weird to me. But I read the reviews and thought I&#x27;ll give it a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did! The shampoo smells wonderful and it helps my hair lather quickly (usually I have to wash my hair 3-4 times to get a good lather; with this it&#x27;s only 2 washes). It&#x27;s all natural so if you have sensitive skin you should have a problem at all using this shampoo. Also, it has tea tree and peppermint oil, which helps get rid of dandruff and itching. Also, my hair feels lighter and bouncier than when I used regular shampoo. It&#x27;s small, so it&#x27;s also great for traveling. Because of my hair type (I&#x27;m black and I have a 4a/b type hair) I still use conditioner, but I can see why you wouldn&#x27;t need one. I like this conditioner [[ASIN:B003RSY1NE TRESemme Naturals Conditioner, Nourishing Moisture, with Aloe Vera and Avocado, 25 oz.]] because it&#x27;s also natural and is light on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to all women of all hair types!</li>
    <li> Round two, works great clean soft hair, no need for conditioners</li>
    <li> a great product. no larelates or laureates . works well and easy for airplanes</li>
    <li> Wow!!!  this is great. my hair is so soft. Happy!!!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, took on vacation, I had a little bar every one else had brought their LG. bottles. Worked into wonderful bubbles rinsed out quickly,clean fresh smell,bar&#x27;s too dern small. But you do need some conditioners with longer hair. Wonderful stuff</li>
    <li> Easy to use - wet your hair and wet the soap. Rub the soap against your hair a few times. Lathers very well (better than liquid shampoo), cleans very well and leaves hair feeling softer and more manageable. My hair doesn&#x27;t dry out or get oilier (is there such a word?) between washes . With one or two exceptions, I won&#x27;t go back to liquid shampoo. Best of all, there is no plastic bottle to dispose of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key to my rating system (extrapolate for music and movies): * &#x3D; Terrible. Unusable. Fiction so bad it&#x27;s not even laughable.  ** &#x3D; Substandard. Partially usable with modification, or with lowered expectations. Fiction is laughable.  *** &#x3D; Usable, but won&#x27;t purchase again. Wouldn&#x27;t read fiction by this author again, unless stuck in an airport for 12 hours with nothing else to read.  **** &#x3D; Meets my expectations. Will buy again unless I find a better product. Will read this author again. ***** &#x3D; Exceeds my expectations. Will buy author&#x27;s work automatically.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - excellent service!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair -- it&#x27;s shoulder length now and falls in ringlets when air-dryed.  Brushed or combed out, it&#x27;s a fro (i.e. very big and frizzy).  I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s and have tried all kinds of for-curly-hair $$$ salon products (conditioners, shampoos, moose, etc.).  I&#x27;ve tried \\&quot;No Poo.\\&quot;  But J.R. Liggetts Shampoo Bars (all varieties!) are the BEST by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair tends to be dry.  I have to wet my hair and let it hair dry daily (it gets frizzy and messy looking overnight).  I might not need to shampoo daily except that I put product in my hair everyday (leave in conditioner -- it helps keep the ringlets formed and not frizzy).  If I don&#x27;t shampoo, the conditioner builds up making my hair flat.  I use J.R. Liggetts everyday and it cleans my hair, removing the conditioner I use, but it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out like every other shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I can feel the difference when I run my fingers through my hair after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE this shampoo!  If you have curly hair, if you are using \\&quot;No Poo\\&quot;, or some other for-curly-hair product, I highly recommend you try J.R. Liggetts!</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife, she says it worked, but she wasn&#x27;t really thrilled with the results. It is a little harder to use than regular shampoo and does not lather up as easily. The wife says she would be ok with a product that is a little harder to use of it performed better than her regular shampoo but this bar was no better or worse than regular shampoo in her opinion.</li>
    <li> You could safely eat this stuff, and isn&#x27;t that the point?  What goes on also goes in.  Magnificent ingredients, voluminous lather, and a great clean.  Revitalized by short, over-55 hair.</li>
    <li> I got this to see if it would help keep things simple when traveling.  Or camping.  Or emergency kits.  It does what it says it does, that&#x27;s certain.  I have a beard, so I don&#x27;t need it to do much shaving, but it definitely does the job.  More sensitive faces or the nether regions of the more adventurous may prove more difficult; it isn&#x27;t as smooth as the gels or lotions.  Its pleasant minty scent is not overpowering, so it could go well with certain bodywashes or even aftershaves.  I have actually forgotten to put aftershave on a few times and didn&#x27;t get a rash or anything after using it.  But then my mug is a little tough...&lt;br /&gt;One of the main drawbacks is the peculiar size; it does not lend itself to any soap containers I&#x27;ve found, being much thicker than the small soaps, but much smaller overall dimensions than family size bars.  It&#x27;s nearly a square.  The other is price; OUCH! Even though with this stuff, a little goes a very long way, particularly depending upon what you&#x27;re using it for.  But the last time I bought bar soap, I could get a multi-bar package for the price of an individual bar of this stuff.  Also, my unfortunate experience has been that it doesn&#x27;t re-grow hair-lol.  And obviously, being barsoap, if you put this down on anything wet, it would create some very expensive glop indeed.  It very much likes being kept as dry as possible.&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford it and you have the right hair/skin, it can indeed replace your shampoo, conditioner, shave cream, &amp; body shampoo/soap.  It gets top marks for its convenience, at least for skin/hairtypes like mine.  Can you imagine hosing down after a workout/whatever with one bar, head-to-toe? It&#x27;s just really pricey.  But I recommend it; high quality stuff!</li>
    <li> I bought this since I&#x27;ve heard such good reviews, however it didn&#x27;t seem to quite work on my hair. I thought by using this, it would cure the scalp build up that I had. I have coarse wavy hair and it ended up with a weird texture even after I rinsed it (a lot).</li>
    <li> Love it! I switched to bar shampoo 6 weeks ago in my effort to use chemical free products.  It has taken several weeks for my hair to adjust, the first two weeks were awful! Lots of ponytails!  I have tried three other brands, two being a castille bar soap and one being a shampoo bar. The jr liggett with peppermint is my favorite!! Left my hair the softest, shiniest, and smoothest of all that I&#x27;ve tried. No waxy or greasy feel!  So happy to have found the one! The adjustment period to bars is not fun, but going chemical free is so worth it!</li>
    <li> Works great and couldn&#x27;t be easier or more convenient for traveling.</li>
    <li> The peppermint aroma is not overwhelming, very pleasant. It takes a litle bit more than I use of the Lush product to wash my hair but the price different probably still makes this a less expensive option. However, I like the softer feel that Lush leaves on my hair than this product, which is squeaky clean and I lost a lot more hair when combing it out.</li>
    <li> I was looking for more hard products I could stick in my carry-on to save weight on my check-in.  This product works great and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  So far I&#x27;ve only used 1/4th of the product (I cut the block in 4 pieces and put it in a soap traveling container) and use pieces of it.  You could easily use this for 3-4 months if you cut the block in pieces.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo bar for more than a week now and I LOVE it! My hair and scalp feel so much cleaner since using this soap. As someone with ultra sensitive skin, I would highly recommend this soap to others with the same issues. I plan on never using regular shampoo again!</li>
    <li> The first  was awesome, hair full of body. Scalp felt super fresh. The second time my hair was dry and brittle. My mother made me go out and buy new products after consulting with hairdresser. Used the remainder of the bar on the dogs. Didn&#x27;t last too long. Smell wasn&#x27;t that great either.</li>
    <li> I have long blonde caucasian hair (chemically processed of course!) and this product was horrible for my hair type.  It made it feel sticky and gross.  I didnt want to toss it out right away so I tried using it to shave my legs but then my skin felt tacky and greasy for 2 more days even after taking 2 more showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably a good shampoo bar for people with short curly hair as I can see where it might help to tame curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was difficult to get it to suds up too.  I wasted alot of hot water and time trying to get it on my hair and scalp evenly.</li>
    <li> seller was great but just not a fan of these hair bars. maybe if your a camper and can&#x27;t really do anything with yur hair but dry shampoo much better.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo bar. I recently tried the no shampoo movement (washing hair with baking soda/water and conditioning with apple cider vinegar/water). I was a month in and my hair was getting unbearably greasy, so I tried this shampoo bar because it claimed that it did not strip the natural oils from your hair. I have been using this bar and then still conditioning with the vinegar/water. I love it and it is good for my hair too! No more grease, my hair is soft, and the smell is wonderful! It is also very convenient to travel with. No downsides in my book!</li>
    <li> I have never tried a solid shampoo before and I was little bit skeptical at first but since I love the smell of peppermint, this could not go wrong. I love the smell of this stuff and when I use it my hair feels really nice and clean but never dry and never greasy. It is really convenient that I do not have to use conditioner but I do anyway sometimes. The only thing that might bother a person is that it can make your hair feel sort of draggy or sticky-ish and tangled when it is wet. This has not been a problem for me since I have short hair. It is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this at all.  It is very small as well.  Better off going to your local artisan shop and buying home made soap from there.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo bar for people looking to go &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34;.  Only a handful of ingredients and none of the harsh chemicals usually found in shampoos.  I can go 2-3 days before washes with my oily, fine hair.  Be careful not to get it in your eyes because it will sting.  Product from seller was delivered well-protected and on time.</li>
    <li> I really want to get behind this product.  In an industry where other companies package their product in an unnecessary amount of plastic that is just going to end up in the land fill, I was happy to find a shampoo that came in a bar form.  It lathers well and it smells great.  But for my scalp it was a disaster.  My head began to itch and I started to get pretty bad dandruff.  If you all every come out with a 2in1, shampoo and conditioner, bar with dandruff control, sign me up. But until then, I&#x27;m stuck with head and shoulders.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t even need conditioner!</li>
    <li> So far so good! Used this for almost a month. I have long hair so cant get by with no conditioner yet. Still put conditioner on my ends...NOT near my roots as it will become too greasy! My hair seems less tangled and ratty since using this!</li>
    <li> Only one time use, a lot of lather.  After shower my hair feel dry and sticky.  Bad experience for me, I rinsed my hair again.  I purchased two of them, one for my brother and also did not work for him, he got dandruff.  I think it may work for other customers but not for me.</li>
    <li> Nice scent! Makes hair thicker. However, hair is very very dry! First i thought that it was only going to be like that in the beginning, but even with continuous use, hair kept being really dry and hard to brush through after shampoo! wouldn&#x27;t recommend it again.</li>
    <li> Smell bad, make my hair sticky. NOT working for me. :(</li>
    <li> Works great! Not impressed with scent, but doesn&#x27;t really matter. Man don&#x27;t get it in your eyes though!!! :) Burns just like the old bar soaps did!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo. My girlfriend was having problems with her hair due to PCOS. This shampoo cleans, retains, the oils, conditions, and keeps the hair healthy. I use it too now. It&#x27;s compact and lasts a long time. I hope they keep their price down and its a wonder they don&#x27;t sell in more brick and mortar stores.</li>
    <li> Bar lathers very well and leaves my hair very managable</li>
    <li> I bought this bar, because I read about it on a blog. I was interested in doing the whole no &#x27;poo thing, but was afraid of using baking soda and apple cider vinegar because I dye my hair. This bar seemed like a good alternative. But, I&#x27;m pretty torn about this shampoo. Before I used it, I was washing my hair about ever 4-5 days, concentrating on the roots, with no greasiness until the last day (day 4 or 5). The first two weeks were great. Everything was going as usual. Then, randomly, after the fourth washing, my hair was really waxy. When my hair dried, my roots were slick and gross looking. I washed again the next day (ensuring that I rinsed thoroughly), and it was even worse. I used bottled shampoo the day after, and things are getting back to normal. I want to try this bar again, because I expect great things like after the first time I used it. However, I&#x27;m kind of afraid to try it again.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo bar.  It felt a little strange (slightly sticky) while lathering my hair, but when my hair dried...it felt silky, smooth &amp; manageable.  I didn&#x27;t need a conditioner.  This bar is all natural, and I don&#x27;t need to buy a big bottle of liquid shampoo, then have to throw away the plastic bottle when done.  This shampoo bar is good for you &amp; good for the planet.  What more do you want?</li>
    <li> This bar leaves my natural, african american hair feeling okay after a wash. It does not dry my hair out like commercial shampoos and it also does not make it feel oh so lovely. I would have loved a little more tingling action from the peppermint for added scalp stimulation. It DOES get my scalp clean though. I am definitely satisfied with this bar but would like to try other kinds of bars from this same company that might provide more moisture. My thirsty coils can never get enough moisture!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. Its so hard.  Can&#x27;t easily apply on my hair</li>
    <li> I bought this product because lately my hair has been going through a protein over load  from my other shampoo which  caused excessive dryness and breakage. So far I&#x27;ve used this shampoo bar twice and my hair seems to love it. The bar  seems like it will last me awhile since I&#x27;m black I only shampoo about 2 times a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: although bar is small it will last you longer than you think...especially if your hair doesn&#x27;t require as many washes as mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar lathers well and doesn&#x27;t dissolve as easily if kept in a dry place away from water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: there really isn&#x27;t any con to this product.I like it. The smell might be a little bit overbearing at first but it&#x27;s nothing you can&#x27;t get over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they say you don&#x27;t need to condition after, but if you are black or have dry hair you might want to put a light leave-in conditioner afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although amazon doesn&#x27;t give 2day shipping on this product...I still receive this package within a reasonable amount of time.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel really clean.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a month and a half now and the only thing I am disappointed about is that I didn&#x27;t find it earlier.  It manages to clean your hair without stripping it of the oils, removing the need for conditioner.  I&#x27;ll probably be using this for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I have tried other shampoo bars before and they left my hair tangly and dry. But i wanted to try one again and decided to give this one a shot. It works well in that it lathers well, has a great fragrance, and is super easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am impressed that my hair was not tangly and really was soft afterward. I have fine, wavy hair and do not use conditioner with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I give it only three stars is that my hair is kind of dull and lifeless with it. I mentioned that my hair is somewhat wavy and was hoping that using a shampoo bar with no conditioner would enhance the wave (I have been told conditioner will weigh it down) but I had less wave than with my regular shampoo. FYI - my regular shampoo is Loreal cleansing conditioner and I don&#x27;t use styling products. If this is what my hair looks like au naturale then I will stick with the unnatural way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy I got the shampoo bar though because a) it confirmed I am using a good shampoo (I need to be reminded occasionally) and b) I think it will work great for weekends when I like to switch up my routine a bit. So I will continue to use it on occasion but not an every day product.</li>
    <li> It may take some time for your scalp to adjust to the lack of stripping chemicals, so give it a chance. My scalp felt a bit oily for the first week or two but has since balanced out, and my hair is now curlier and more manageable than with any other product. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the J.R. Liggett shampoo bars exclusively for the past two years and have made it a point to try every one of their formulas. This one has a very refreshing scent and the peppermint oil has a cooling effect on your skin and scalp. It is very moisturizing, intensely so, in fact. Since my hair is very fine, it actually was a bit too much for me, but it would be excellent for dry or thick hair in need of moisture therapy.</li>
    <li> - Leaves hair clean.&lt;br /&gt;- Does not strip oils from hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Economic.&lt;br /&gt;- No harsh sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with type 4 hair knows how difficult it is to clean your hair without leaving it dry and brittle. This does the job and some. No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> This is my first Liggett&#x27;s soap and it&#x27;s not bad at all.  For the first week or two,  it left both my hair and my skin clean,  shiny and ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks though I found my skin being a bit dry and flaky.  Even with a stronger moisturizer it didn&#x27;t go away.  It still works beautifully on my henna&#x27;ed hair though.  Just not my face.</li>
    <li> I tried this as a &amp;#34;no &#x27;poo&amp;#34; alternative and it failed miserably. It had this uncanny ability to make my hair feel both greasy at the roots and as brittle as straw along the strand. I gave it about 2.5 weeks hoping my hair was adjusting to it but NOPE. Yuck. Do not recommend! The bar also disintegrated very quickly.</li>
    <li> This shampoo actually seemed to dry out my hair. I think it&#x27;s a good product for cleansing your hair once in a while, but not as a daily shampoo. I found it also works well as a soap for before shaving, helps keep razor from getting clogged with dead skin/deodorant. I had been wanting to try solid shampoo for a while, but I don&#x27;t think this is the product for me.</li>
    <li> Right from the first use....I really loved it. Great lather. No conditioner. I am a skeptical person and did not expect these results.</li>
    <li> the product is as advertised and it arrived timely</li>
    <li> As hard as a bar of soap, this shampoo lasts longer than you would think. After rinsing, it feels like your hair is coated with an &amp;#34;Ivory bar soap&amp;#34; kind of residue. When it dries, it looks great, on curly hair anyway. This bar is very handy for travel.</li>
    <li> I have a love/ hate relationship with this product. The scent is dreamy (I love peppermint) but that is the best I can say. I am Black with very thick, natural hair that reaches my bra-strap. This stuff made my hair feel dirty... In the shower. Due to the oil content, it felt like buildup and residue and was difficult to wash out. The after affects were worse. My hair was a tangled mess. It says on the packaging that most people don&#x27;t need a conditioner, but I did. I can not use this on my hair ever again. In order to not waste it, I now use it on my face. My skin loves it. So I will purchase again but definitely not for a shampoo.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell you my exact hair type, but it is long, thick and wavy. It also tends to get dry and frizzy quite easily, while still producing maddening amounts of oil from being stripped by the sulfates in shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing though. It cleans my hair quite well, but keeps it moisturized. As an added bonus, I can wash my hair more often than I was with normal shampoo. I am able to wash my hair at least 3 times a week, which makes me very happy, as I find washing my hair to be quite relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really love the smell. I am quite fond of peppermint, so this did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: STORE THIS IN AN AIRTIGHT CONTAINER. If you leave it in the shower it will melt. Mine did before I got to use it more than 5 times. Store this thing.</li>
    <li> My husband used Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle shampoo for years, thinking there was so sulfates in it. Well, there are. Hidden sulfates. So I figured we would try this out. He loves it, no problem switching over. We keep it on the shower ledge so it doesn&#x27;t get dissolved under the shower water. Only downside is the price.</li>
    <li> Made my scalp flake a lot more. Left waxy residue but after my hair dried it felt super soft and a little frizzy than usual. Overall this product wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Great experience and great product!</li>
    <li> I use a lot less of this than the bottled shampoo.  I still need a conditioner as I have very long hair.  My husband doesn&#x27;t, and he likes that his hair is less frizzy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 52 year old Caucasian female. I bought this for a trip from Los Angeles to Bali so I wouldn&#x27;t be adding to my liquids baggie.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect in my destination, and needed the basics.  I&#x27;m back from Bali and I&#x27;m still using the bar soap.  It leaves my hair feeling clean, but not stripped of natural oils and the scent is minimal but pleasant.  It&#x27;s become the staple shampoo at my bathtub.  Not bad JR Liggetts!</li>
    <li> Having tried - and been disappointed by - a handful of SLS-free shampoos, I was quite skeptical of the results I&#x27;d realize using this product.  But this little bar didn&#x27;t disappoint.  It creates a luxurious lather that leaves my hair clean, healthy, and easy to style.  In fact, I no longer need to use conditioner!  And don&#x27;t be put off by the size of the bar (I&#x27;ve attached a pic for scale) - dollar for dollar, it offers far more mileage than the average bottle of shampoo.  Five stars for an excellent product that exceeded expectations.</li>
    <li> Is a good alternative no exoestrogens because liquid shampoo have them</li>
    <li> So far it is very good.  My hair feels great with this soap.  I&#x27;ll update the status in details in future after prolonged use of this product.</li>
    <li> I did not try this for any specific health reasons or to avoid sodium laureth sulfate which seams to be in every shampoo. I read about it for hiking as a light weight carry item. I am middle-aged male with thick brown hair.  I wanted to know if it would last a month, the answer is absolutely yes. It lasted me about 7 weeks but my wife also used it some. I don&#x27;t skimp when I use it either.  The peppermint in this one is a nice touch, especially if you don&#x27;t like those flowery fragrances. This shampoo will not dry your hands, which is one the most important thing for me. I sometime get dry cracking hands in winter and must avoid shampoo that will dry your hands.  There are plenty the will.  This is good stuff!! It leaves your hair clean and rinses out easily.  It feels different in that my hands and/or hair are &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; after using it. No itching of any kind on the scalp but never was much of a problem for me.  It is made from saponified olive oil, based on some quick research I believe this method is common to soap making regardless of the type of fat used.  Saponification refers to the chemical reaction between the fat and added alkali which yields water, glycerin and soap. This is a simple old fashioned tried and true good formula that seems to be made with care and the customer in mind.  It would be best kept on a soap dish that allows it to dry so it last a long time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing, and pure and simple.  I was getting headaches and other neurological symptoms from my regular hair products, which I was shocked to learn, are full of chemicals that have known neurotoxic effects (check out http://www.ewg.org/skindeep ).  I did a lot of research on shampoo alternatives, and found Liggett&#x27;s.  Many users said the same thing: the shampoos and other hair products they were using were making them sick.  LIGGETT&#x27;S is pure and natural, and leaves my hair feeling shiny and clean.  Just a few rubs in a wet head of hair lathers up an amazing volume of foam.  The package claims that one bar &#x3D; a 32 oz of liquid shampoo, and that is absolutely true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product also if you are worried about the carbon footprint of products that are mostly water, transported over great distances, and packaged in plastic.  Liggett&#x27;s is small, efficient, and packaged in paper.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!  Oh, and it is MADE IN THE U.S.A.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length straight hair and while the individual hairs are thin they are plentiful. I always was intrigued by natural shampoos (and felt icky about applying harsh chemicals on a daily basis to my head/hair). If found this shampoo easy to lather (while not as bubbly as conventional shampoos I still think it lathers plenty and certainly enough) and rinse. Yes, your hair will first feel &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean and for some it may be best to follow with a natural conditioning rinse. I use Dr. Bronners Citrus Hair rinse (very diluted) about three days a week (other days, only this shampoo). My hair is clean, full of body, and does not get greasy. Love it.</li>
    <li> My hair twirls a little when it gets to about shoulder length. I stopped using any other chemicals in my hair but shampoo since abt 5yrs now. My hair isn&#x27;t too thick or thin, I&#x27;m just about a normal blonde. This shampoo worked better than the original J.R. Ligget&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried about this peppermint scent in my hair, but it isn&#x27;t strong, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. My hair hasn&#x27;t felt or looked better since I started with this shampoo, except when I was 5yrs old maybe, I don&#x27;t use any conditioner or anything else, I just wash my hair 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel a lot better using this shampoo as well because I don&#x27;t have to throw out any plastic bottle when I&#x27;m done with it. Just wish it was available locally. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Washes hair good. Hair feels very healthy afterwards. Fragrance disappears in a week though and it smells like nothing. Unlike Lush products that still smells nice after a year of use (on and off). But then again it costs almost 1/10 of lush hair soap.&lt;br /&gt;So this one is a winner in my book.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried SLS-free shampoos from Burt&#x27;s Bees, L&#x27;Oreal, Oscar Blandi, and the super-pricey Number 4. None of them clarify and volumize my baby-fine, easily broken hair like Ligget&#x27;s--and it&#x27;s less expensive than them all! About to buy my third bar. Be sure not to leave this in water/in the shower, as it&#x27;ll melt!</li>
    <li> Sadly, I will continue my search for a chemical-free shampoo bar that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky with a residue feeling. Like all others, a vinegar rinse has been recommended- I do not want to rinse with vinegar after I shampoo. It will be a good camping bar, when a little hair stickiness won&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> Alright.. So I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo bar since February 15th, 2014. It has worked well, though fair warning it takes some getting used to..&lt;br /&gt;To get a great lather I&#x27;ve had to run the bar down my hair rather than get a lather in my palms then apply to my hair..  Rinsing is the tricky part. You must rinse, rinse, rinse. When you think you&#x27;re done rinsing, rinse some more. Otherwise you&#x27;ll leave soap residue and it doesn&#x27;t feel very nice. But once you do it right, man does it feel nice and clean..&lt;br /&gt;I get a good lather in, sometimes twice if I feel the need to, take a big cup full of water and soak my hair about three times or so.. Then 1 part apple cider vinegar, 2 parts water poured/sprayed throughout the hair (sprayed meaning you make this mixture in a spray bottle), focusing more on the ends. The apple cider vinegar conditions your hair, keeping it at it&#x27;s natural pH balance and not stripping/coating it.. I&#x27;ve also heard it&#x27;s a natural protector against heat damage instead of putting that oil stuff in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;The smell rinses/dries out, but if you want you can add an essential oil of your choice (really helps).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a great product. All natural, no chemicals, healthy and happy hair!  Oh, I forgot to mention it&#x27;s cheap too! Win, win, WIN, &lt;3soft?? Love, love, LOVE!! Totally stocking up!!</li>
    <li> Love this bar shampoo.  I am in the Peace Corps in Ghana, West Africa and the shampoo works the best with my &amp;#34;bucket showers&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This shampoo bar has a nice smell but it doesn&#x27;t stay on your hair. I find it hard to tell if I&#x27;ve gotten it all over my hair because it&#x27;s as if this washes off instantly. Not sure if I&#x27;m doing it wrong or what, after the shower my hair does feel clean and less heavy than with a liquid chemical shampoo. I might just be paranoid that I&#x27;m not hitting all the spots on my hair, other than that I like it. I don&#x27;t think it will last as long as a 24oz liquid shampoo though.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on the reviews I read about it and glad I did. I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding a good shampoo, and have used some of the best. My Mother is a hairdresser and only buys from the Beauty Supply houses. This nifty little bar type shampoo is the just the berries. Even in our crummy water it whips up a big frothy lather. When I placed my order they had mistakenly put the order in for two bars. I caught this in time for them to remove the extra bar and credit my account. I was not sure I&#x27;d even like it, so definitely did not want to spend twice as much on what could have been a waste of money. Now regret cancelling the second bar.</li>
    <li> Trust the old ladies.  I was on a quest to find a better way to deal with my hair.  I was hoping to go natural, and as chemical free as possible so I started with the baking soda and vinegar method.  That didn&#x27;t work for me, despite a valiant 4 week effort.  My aunt, whose age will remain anonymous, said she has always used a shampoo bar.  I was like, &amp;#34;a shampoo bar?  What the heck is THAT?&amp;#34; But I immediately went to Amazon and ordered one to give it a shot.  When I got the bar and saw the ingredients were all these natural oils, I was skeptical of my crazy aunt.  Washing my hair with oils?  Better do this on a day I can wear a hat!  I wasn&#x27;t even sure what to do with a BAR of soap on my head, but I just rubbed it on near the roots.  And it LATHERED.  Yes, bubbles made from oil.  Who&#x27;d have guessed?  Now, according to other reviews you don&#x27;t need conditioner with this, so my first attempt I skipped it.  I rinsed and let my hair dry a bit.  And then I tried to brush it.  Whoa... No tangles.  but not like it was greasy, like it has been treated with conditioner.  Yay.  And it smelled fantastic.  Currently I alternate back and forth with this and a cleansing conditioner, though I think I will probably be able to do just this shampoo bar when I run out of the other stuff.  I love this.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for your hair and scalp and great for the environment as well. I wish it were easier to apply to long tresses, but it&#x27;s a small inconvenience overall.</li>
    <li> The bar is definitely a new (hair care) concept for me and although I can say that it did leave my scalp feeling cleaner, my hair felt greasy and brittle after rinsing it out so I went ahead and used my conditioner anyway (something you&#x27;re advised against when doing a shampoo bar) but even though I didn&#x27;t follow instructions *to a tee* I found that this bar is great for travel (I can save my precious 3 oz bottles, and the mess, for another day) and the gym. I would definitely recommend everyone try this product at least once!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It leaves my hair soft and curly. .high five!</li>
    <li> Who would have thought that a bar of soap would change my hair? My hair feels fuller, healthier and it has more body. Definitely never going back to paraben-laden store bought shampoo! Love this one, but trying the other varieties before I commit to a favorite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of Liggett shampoo - it&#x27;s AMAZING how much fuller my hair is... also, it actually swings back and forth - it used to be a static bush! The only thing is this: If you usually blow dry your hair standing up, then WASH your hair in the same position, i.e. if you dry your hair with your head upside down (like I do) then wash your hair in that same position and COMB it while the rinse water is being applied. Squeeze out excess water, gently wrap in a head towel. Comb hair with a very wide toothed comb and dry with your head upside down. All I mean by this is don&#x27;t wash your hair and rinse it with it resting on your back/shoulders IF you dry it brushed forward and upside down... it&#x27;s just extra stress on it.  I LOVE it. I then use my Perfecter (that&#x27;s how they spell it) heated ion round brush to style it. I&#x27;ve never known my hair to &amp;#34;move/sway&amp;#34; as I walk before using this product. Andrew Perlot told me about it (raw food guru, check him out, google his name). So, thanks Andrew, and thanks Amazon seller for having this great product!  This review left my Alan&#x27;s wife, Susan - user of said shampoo bar.  Oh, keep the bar in a small glass or plastic container then it doesn&#x27;t get wet in the shower and waste away.</li>
    <li> This shampoo, like the other J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoos, is a wonderful alternative to the petroleum product shampoos that can be horrible to your hair. Cost-wise it is fairly economical, provided you use the wood shelf or an equivalent that will allow the shampoo bar to dry out between uses. Search Amazon for *J.R. Liggett&#x27;s* and the bar with the shelf will show up. Our family has run the gamut of the usual store bought liquid shampoos without finding anything we really like. But the first use of this bar set our determination to use nothing less from now on. Great shampoo, mild aroma, very much thumbs up for this wonderful stuff.</li>
    <li> This soap is awesome. Just remember it&#x27;s soap, it&#x27;s gonna sting a little if you let it slip into your eyes!</li>
    <li> Loving it so far, I have been conditioning my hair about once a week on top of using this shampoo every day, but it has done a great job of getting my hair clean without stripping off all of the natural oils.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap i have ever used on my hair. I was very skeptic when i ordered it. But my hair had never been so soft and shiny..It is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;The peppermint really cools you down. Amazing product</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this shampoo bar. I&#x27;m always looking for ways to lower my environmental impact through natural ingredients and minimal packaging. After the first week or so I noticed just that this bar left my hair feeling a bit heavy and oily, but I was willing to live with that – as well as continue using to see if my hair adjusted after some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of getting used to the product I developed dandruff for the first time in my life. Not one to give up easily I went through 3 bars of the stuff over months but never saw improvement. I am now nursing my scalp back to normalcy with a tea-tree oil shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I found this product worked great as a shave-oil substitute. Just the right consistency for a smooth shave, and soft skin afterward.</li>
    <li> Creates a nice rich lather, makes hair smoother, shinier than regular shampoo, only has natural essential oils. The only minus is that if it gets to your eyes it itches quite a lot. Could also be that I am sensitive to olive oil. However compared to the SLS shampoos out there, it&#x27;s probably not as bad as if you get SLS or parabens in your eyes. In any case, rinse your eyes with luke warm water carefully. If I use a regular organic shampoo with similar ingredients (without the olive and castor oils), there is no itching. If your hair is oily, you won&#x27;t get much lather the first time around, so repeat the washing and rinsing within a couple minutes. The lather will come the second time around.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend not using this product in your hair.  It leaves an incredibly waxy residue, which has proven very difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair sparkling and squeaky clean with NO residue.  Love this shampoo</li>
    <li> I was skeptical before purchase, but after 3 weeks use, I&#x27;m loving this bar shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, straight hair so I do add a touch of conditioner to the ends, but I&#x27;m enjoying the bar&#x27;s lather, fresh peppermint scent &amp; squeaky clean hair!</li>
    <li> Lathers beautifully and likely will give many more shampoos than an equivalent liquid shampoo. Rinses cleanly and I am happy with this product. However, I am giving it 4 stars because the net weight on each of the two bars I ordered is less than the 3.5 ounce net weight. Net weight is net weight to the consumer. I wrote to the manufacturer and they replied that the bar was 3.5 ounces when cut and that it loses moisture and weight after packaging. Hmmmm . . .</li>
    <li> I like it. I am a male with short hair so do not know how it works with long. All in all I like it.</li>
    <li> I am 45 and going silver/white naturally but I didn&#x27;t like it for my hair type.  It was tangled and dry after use...UGH!  I recommend that the bars be a more rounded shape than such harsh corners.  Other people swear by this product, so try it for yourself.  I am using a cleansing conditioner product now (like WEN) that seems to do the trick on my white \\&quot;highlights\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I did not think this bar did anything. Barely any lather and did not even feel it cleaned my scalp and hair at all.</li>
    <li> This is a great and more natural shampoo for all hair types, and it smells very nice.</li>
    <li> Perfect for taking to the gym.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, leaves my long hair clean and soft without conditioner!</li>
    <li> Purchased this shampoo for my husband who has (had) a terrible dandruff issue on his scalp and in his beard. After 4 consecutive days of use it looks like his 40+ year dandruff issue has come to an end. In the past we have used medicated shampoos, other bar soaps (one was a beer soap from Europe that Amazon stopped selling), conditioners, and countless other home remedies including hot oil treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging says that this bar will give approximately the same number of shampoos as a 24oz bottle of shampoo. So, I&#x27;m tickled to find an inexpensive, natural product with a long shelf life.</li>
    <li> This product is great! Lathers very nicely in my hair, and makes my hair so clean it actually squeaks. I started using this because my hair gets very oily quickly, at forts I felt like it was making my hair gross but it took a little adjusting and now I could go 4 days without washing it and it look just fine, before I used to have to wash my hair every other day! I will say though my hair gets very knotty from using it so I always end up using a conditioner after web though it says its not needed.</li>
    <li> I have become a shampoo bar convert in the past six months or so and had been quite pleased with my former supplier. However, I decided to try this one with a recent Vitacost order and I am so pleased I did! It is... well, amazeballs may begin to cover it. I normally use an extremely lightweight grapeseed conditioner after using my regular shampoo bar; however, I have barely found that necessary since using this brand (a little over a week). Now, for all of those new to shampoo bars, you MUST give your hair/scalp about two weeks to get over its &amp;#34;shock&amp;#34; at the lack of &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; that it will be used to from bottled shampoos (even the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;natual&amp;#34; stuff). But I promise, the wait is SO worth it! I have struggled my whole life with oily skin/scalp and from one morning to the next, the oiliness would just be... ridiculous (no matter what type of bottled shampoo used). However, with this product I can wake up and not feel completely icked out by my own hair. LOL</li>
    <li> I have only used this product twice so far and I already love it. Great natural smell, washes nicely, and no need for conditioner just as advertised. I highly recommend this product; my hair feels and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Great buy and leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo mainly because there aren&#x27;t any of the FDA approved toxins and poisons in it. It is pure and leaves my hair with a very clean smell. My hair is naturally dry, with this shampoo I don&#x27;t even need a conditioner. It is great for camping or out-door enthusiasts, because it is so light-weight and compact. I use it at home, as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo.  It&#x27;s really much cleaner and better for your hair.  The scent is not outstanding, but that&#x27;s because it isn&#x27;t buried in perfumes.  I can use it everyday, and much prefer it to bottle shampoos.  If you have short hair like me, it will last quite a while.  Also, I don&#x27;t have to use other products in my hair like gels to keep it from flying all over the place.  My hair just behaves, and doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all.</li>
    <li> This is the first bar shampoo that I have used and I love it! I was a little nervous to make the switch but I&#x27;m glad I did! It smells great, gets my hair clean and doesn&#x27;t have any of the chemicals I&#x27;m trying to stay away from. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I tried \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; for almost a year...  yes, that&#x27;s right, a whole year.  No one can tell me I didn&#x27;t stick it out long enough!  I wanted to rave about it.  For those individuals where the no poo method works - they gush about how wonderful their hair looks and feels.  Soft, shiny, no fly aways...  just magnificent lovely hair.  And to top it off: no weird or potentially toxic chemicals and *almost* as cheap as just plain water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not to love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Answer: Dandruff.  Blasted dandruff.  I tried every different ratio of baking soda to water.  And for an after rinse, tried multiple ratios of apple cider vinegar to water.  But nothing worked.  I got dandruff galore (never had dandruff before), my roots were really waxy feeling (waxy, not oily), and my ends were dry.  It was an epic fail.  I couldn&#x27;t take the dandruff anymore, so I gave up and was back to my regular shampoo/conditioner again...  but I was still having dandruff issues.  EGADS!  I started to think my no poo experiment gave me a permanent dandruff problem.  Not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I stumbled upon JR Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bar.  I was intrigued and hopeful.  Very simple ingredients, nothing weird or potentially toxic.  It doesn&#x27;t strip hair of its natural oils (which is also the main reason most people do \\&quot;no poo\\&quot;). I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just say: AMAZEBALLS.  It got rid of my dandruff completely, my hair is soft, shiny and clean.  I can easily go 2 days between washing.  What a HUGE timesaver to only have to wash/dry my hair 50% as often.  With regular shampoo, washing daily was a must, or my scalp started to itch and get super oily.  I&#x27;ve been using JR Liggett&#x27;s for about a month and soon will see if I can extend to 3 days between washing as my scalp adjusts and normalizes its oil production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need a couple washings to get the hang of it.  Part your hair and run in along your scalp in a downwards direction like a brush.  Just a few strokes then massage with your fingertips and it will produce a suprising amount of lather (unlike BS no poo, which has no lather).  Don&#x27;t rub the bar back and forth or it will leave you tangle-y.  Concentrate on your scalp area - you don&#x27;t really need to worry about your ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will feel SQUEAKY clean.  It will not feel slick.  That&#x27;s a good thing, in my opinion.  Commercial products often include ingredients to coat your hair and give you a slick feeling.  That leads to build up after time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company says that many people do not need conditioner when this bar shampoo.  But my water is moderately hard, so I need something after washing.  Instead of commercial conditioner I use 3:1 ratio of water:apple cider vinegar and it&#x27;s perfect.  My hair is not tangled and I can brush it really easily.  My hair also dries really quickly.  Another signal to me that my hair is healthy and the cuticles are closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.  Here&#x27;s what the JR website claims, and I have to say that it&#x27;s all true in my experience (except I don&#x27;t have permed or colored hair, so I don&#x27;t know about that claim)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made entirely from pure 100% natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;It contains NO animal products, or preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t strip hair of its natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;It makes a luxuriously thick lather.&lt;br /&gt;It rinses out clean and easily.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s especially good for permed or colored hair.&lt;br /&gt;It gives your hair body, and manageability.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your hair soft, healthy and smelling clean.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for TRAVELING, OR BACKPACKING.&lt;br /&gt;100% Biodegradable with minimal packaging.&lt;br /&gt;No Petroleum Based Detergents.&lt;br /&gt;No Sodium Lauryl Sulfate or DEA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
    <li> My hair is soft and healthy</li>
    <li> My hair feels greasy and gross after using it. Also, I had more dandruff. This may not be good for those with thin and long hair</li>
    <li> This is great for anyone. kids, pets, adults, great shampoo and it smells nice in your hair. it is natural which is awesome</li>
    <li> This shampoo bar left my hair feeling saturated and hard to manage. I am prone to oily hair, and this shampoo left my hair oily in less than 24 hours after washing. It lathers up nicely, but has a heavy feel to it. The peppermint smell is not very strong, but rather you smell some other scent. I&#x27;m not sure what it is, but it smells not too great. For an all natural product, I expected more.</li>
    <li> I have dandruff problem, and I have used many shampoos so far. This bar shampoo is amazing. Makes my hair and scalp feel beautiful.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this product at first, but let me tell you,  it has exceeded my expectations.  It goes on really nice  lathers up and you can feel it working.  While you have it on, it feels smooth and conditioning.  When you rinse it feels squeaky clean so, I do use a little conditioner afterwards (Curly Hair).  The results are considerable, so much to prompt me to leave a review.  My hair has never been so full of body with shine and NO dandruff.  Give it a try you might be amazed like me :)</li>
    <li> It smells great and lathers well. I bought it to treat my dandruff. Unfortunately I have insanely stubborn impossible dandruff that responds to absolutely no treatment. I tried every other dandruff product on the market. I decided to give this a shot, but it did nothing for my dandruff. After trying this I tried less and less conventional means of treating my dandruff (no shampoo at all, no poo recipes, washing in cold water. All tried for 1 month +). I have come to the conclusion that my dandruff is incurable. Yes I have seen a dermatologist and used prescription shampoo. Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This could however be the perfect cure for you if you have regular old non stubborn dandruff. If nothing else it smells nice and is all natural.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Million times better than shampoos that is made using harmful chemicals.After wash, hair feels soft and clean. Need to wash the hair moving the soap gently on your hair. Otherwise, you hair can get really tangled  For the price, the soap bar is tiny in size.  If you are ok to pay the price, it certainly is the best product around.</li>
    <li> Really saw improvements in my hair quality immediately. It leaves my hair softer than conditioner AND my hair retains all of its natural oils. The scent of this shampoo is very light mint - works for me!</li>
    <li> First try at a bar shampoo. I like the smell, pretty good lather for being sulfur free. Not really sure yet if I&#x27;m sold on how my hair feels. After the first use, and what I thought was a really good scrubbing, my hair once it dried, it still looked greasy in the back. I understand this could be because it doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of it&#x27;s natural oils. In other words; it could be too soon to tell to know whether or not I&#x27;m going to stay loyal to this product or not.</li>
    <li> My hair is doing so great with this product. Good for texturized/relaxed hair!!! I love it! Glad I bought it!!</li>
    <li> great on hair and skin too.&lt;br /&gt;the peppermint scent is invigorating, but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the best non-drying shampoo/soap that i have tried.&lt;br /&gt;bought it because it&#x27;s not loaded with harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;leaves hair and skin feeling clean and healthy, great for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like to keep this bar in the shower and use a natural liquid peppermint soap for hand-washing dispensers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003GLGA3G Dr Woods Castile Soap Pure Peppermint 32 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;the Dr Woods liquid makes a fine shower gel too.&lt;br /&gt;but i like it just for the convenience and non-mess factor of not having a bar of soap on the sink.&lt;br /&gt;for the shower, i find Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bar lathers better and is a little easier on the skin.</li>
    <li> Get away from those bottles of goo. Makes my hair soft and shiny, and doesn&#x27;t cause the bounceback greasiness because it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair, just cleans it nicely. Smells great, feels great.</li>
    <li> Works like &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shampoo but it has PURE ingredients!!!!! No chemicals and additives. Nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave your hair a bit more &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; like in feeling but that&#x27;s bc main stream shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners have product in them that coat your hair with chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has no chemicals. I do the ACV (Apple Cider Vinegar) rinse afterwards, as if suggests.</li>
    <li> Simple is better!&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves J.R. Liggett Bar shampoos. They lather well, and leave her hair soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m noticing I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as much and the color isn&#x27;t fading as quickly</li>
    <li> This works really well.  It suds up nicely, and does a good job cleaning everything!  The only drawback I have found is that you do not want to get this soap in your eyes.  It really smarts when you do.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my girlfriend to try it out and very glad I did. Works much better than any regular shampoo in my opinion. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  This shampoo bar will clean your hair as well as any liquid shampoo without stripping it of it&#x27;s natural oils.  I usually have to have conditioner, but not with this shampoo bar.  Also, my once itchy scalp isn&#x27;t anymore.</li>
    <li> I used this only on the top of my head like other reviewers suggested but it made my hair very greasy and heavy feeling. Not so much the top where I used the soap but further down at the roots, like the coconut oil in the soap just ran down my head and didn&#x27;t wash out.</li>
    <li> I am using my husband&#x27;s account. I bought this after seeing a youtube video on this. I love it! I have been washing my hair for over a year with baking soda and water for almost a year because regular shampoo dries my hair out. I couldn&#x27;t hardly let it grow out because of it. Anyway after I watched the youtube video on how this shampoo bar is even better for your hair than the baking soda I had to give it a try. I am so glad I did. I love it. My hair is healthier now and I am in process of letting it grow out! It is a small bar but a little goes a long way. The package says it is equivalent to a 24oz bottle of shampoo and I would have to agree with that because it don&#x27;t take much! I will be buying this over and over again!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! Exactly what I was looking for. My hair feels nice and clean after using the shampoo bar and is very soft, shiney and manageable. No need for conditioner. I will continue to buy this product. I am in love!!!</li>
    <li> We are looking to decrease the amount of chemicals in our lives and we are slowly replacing products as they run out. I am intrigued by the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; idea, but I sometimes use hairspray and didn&#x27;t think it was a method for me. I happily came across this product while browsing Amazon during a late night BF session. I have never used a shampoo bar before but decided to give it a try. It lathers nicely and cleans the hair well. It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp. I have done naturally blonde hair that easily shows product build up, but NO BUILD up here. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Ordered this to use on a trip to Europe to limit the number of liquid needed.  I did not care for it at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this with high expectations but it was a total disappointment and a waste of money. This made my hair very frizzy and unmanageable. Although the bar itself smelled nice, it didn&#x27;t make my hair smell good at all. Overall, this product did nothing for me.</li>
