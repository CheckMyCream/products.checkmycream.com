      <li>Great orange scent without being overpowering and keeps you soft for hours.</li>
      <li>Came across this in Pennsylvannia, liked it so much I needed to find more.</li>
      <li>Plus it absorbs easily and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
      <li>Not too strong.</li>
      <li>Super Favorite.</li>
      <li>The Orange Petalooza is a light sweet/citrus scent-</li>
      <li>I really liked the scent of it and it lasted the whole day.</li>
      <li>Light scent</li>
      <li>I feel good knowing that the product is natural, without parabens.</li>
      <li>It is light and sweet.</li>
      <li>Great body lotion, cleared up all my dry skin,better then what the doctor order for me.</li>
      <li>Dries clean, not sticky, or runny.</li>
      <li>It soaks in, not greasy and leaves skin nice and soft.</li>
      <li>Would I purchase again for full price?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s natural, it smells good (not like oranges, just normal lotion scent)</li>
      <li>You might like this lotion if you&#x27;ve got very young skin and are just looking for a non-perfume way to smell summery--it would make a cute addition to a college care package, for example.</li>
      <li>I wanted to change the lotion I was using to something more natural since I&#x27;m 5 months pregnant.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for actual moisturizing, though, you may not find this product effective.</li>
      <li>Lovely, natural orange scent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just absorbed.</li>
      <li>The orange scent is very light and actually delightful, which is surprising since I don&#x27;t usually like artificial orange scents.</li>
      <li>bought it at Rite Aid on clearance for under $4, so for that price I can&#x27;t complain too much!</li>
      <li>but no luck, I was only hoping though :)</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Seems as if this company is trying to put out better, safer products, unlike other companies, but in the end I feel the ingredient phenoxyethanol is listed too high on the ingredients list to chance using this product again.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t enjoy those seconds of stickiness since it feels rather gross, but other than that it&#x27;s a fine</li>
      <li>Writing this review made me want to put some more on to get rid of the other summer scent - CHLORINE!</li>
      <li>I love the orange scent, although it doesn&#x27;t last for a long time.</li>
      <li>But that stickiness seems to fade away after a few seconds, as though your skin soaked it all up, and it feels so soft and looks so healthy afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My skin stays soft all day long and the energizing scent is the longest lasting fragrance I have used.</li>

    <li> I tried this lotion after swimming the other day, and my skin went from dry and itchy to dry, irritated, and itchy. You might like this lotion if you&#x27;ve got very young skin and are just looking for a non-perfume way to smell summery--it would make a cute addition to a college care package, for example. If you&#x27;re looking for actual moisturizing, though, you may not find this product effective.</li>
    <li> I wish the fragrance was stronger, but the lotion works well on dry skin and is nongreasy.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a bit weird. The orange scent is very light and actually delightful, which is surprising since I don&#x27;t usually like artificial orange scents. But, when you rub the lotion in, it gets a bit sticky on your skin. But that stickiness seems to fade away after a few seconds, as though your skin soaked it all up, and it feels so soft and looks so healthy afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t enjoy those seconds of stickiness since it feels rather gross, but other than that it&#x27;s a fine lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it at Rite Aid on clearance for under $4, so for that price I can&#x27;t complain too much! Would I purchase again for full price? Probably not.</li>
    <li> Great body lotion, cleared up all my dry skin,better then what the doctor order for me.</li>
    <li> Awesome scent--love this lotion</li>
    <li> Got this after receiving a coupon and seeing it on sale at our local Walgreens. It is awesome! Love the smell and it lasts. It soaks in, not greasy and leaves skin nice and soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s natural, it smells good (not like oranges, just normal lotion scent), it rubs in well (doesn&#x27;t pill up), it&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave skin sticky hours later.</li>
    <li> This is some of the nicest smelling lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and it&#x27;s not overpowering at all. I do like the feeling of the lotion as well, it&#x27;s not runny like some cheaper lotions tend to be. It moisturizes nicely, smells good, and it&#x27;s a decent price.  I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I wanted to change the lotion I was using to something more natural since I&#x27;m 5 months pregnant. The Orange Petalooza is a light sweet/citrus scent- I love it! Plus it absorbs easily and isn&#x27;t greasy at all. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love the orange scent, although it doesn&#x27;t last for a long time. I feel good knowing that the product is natural, without parabens. I will continue to buy this lotion. Writing this review made me want to put some more on to get rid of the other summer scent - CHLORINE!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I don&#x27;t think they make this fragrance in the body lotion / moisturizer any longer so scoop em up while there&#x27;s still some around.</li>
    <li> I tried this lotion in the store, it did not leave my hands greasy. I really liked the scent of it and it lasted the whole day. Bonus points for Burt&#x27;s Bees for creating this product line!!</li>
    <li> Best feeling coverage for my money. I&#x27;m a guy who only needs occasional relief from&lt;br /&gt;seasonal dryness. I&#x27;ve tried Gold Bond Men&#x27;s Lotion which it&#x27;s great but not in the league of my Bert&#x27;s Bees GUD lotion. A little goes a long way. Dries clean, not sticky, or runny. It&#x27;s just absorbed. Until they come out with a men&#x27;s fragrance, I&#x27;m happy to smell of Orange Petalooza lotion and feel re-hydrated. Cheers Bert&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> Love this product, smells wonderful</li>
    <li> This smells so good and I get so many compliments when I wear it.  It is also an excellent moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I liked the scent of the conditioner, and it worked well. There are better conditioners at this price point.  I ditched this product once I realized it contains the preservative Phenoxyethanol.  Seems as if this company is trying to put out better, safer products, unlike other companies, but in the end I feel the ingredient phenoxyethanol is listed too high on the ingredients list to chance using this product again.</li>
    <li> just love it. good service</li>
    <li> I LOVE the smell. I was hoping it would help with some skin marks I got as a result of using some harsh laundry detergent but no luck, I was only hoping though :) This arrived one time and I will recommend the seller and the product!</li>
    <li> Light scent&lt;br /&gt;Not oily&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what I was looking for&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s moisture doesn&#x27;t last very long and semi-frequent requires reapplication</li>
    <li> Smooth transaction and a great product...Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, and use it every day.  I just wish they packaged it in bigger bottles!  This is a good, lighter lotion that has a pleasant scent.  It does take a bit of time to absorb, so can appear white for a couples of minutes after you put it on.</li>
    <li> Came across this in Pennsylvannia, liked it so much I needed to find more. Great orange scent without being overpowering and keeps you soft for hours.</li>
    <li> Super Favorite. THE BEST</li>
    <li> I purchased the pear body wash and lotion for my daughter&#x27;s teacher. It is light and sweet. Perfect for summer! And it uses healthy ingredients and no animal testing! Love the beautiful packaging and the price. The Güd line from Burt&#x27;s Bees makes a great gift!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body lotion, period! My skin stays soft all day long and the energizing scent is the longest lasting fragrance I have used.</li>
    <li> For me, a little goes a long way with this lotion.  I don&#x27;t need a lot to feel it&#x27;s moisturizing.  Lovely, natural orange scent.  Not too strong.</li>
