<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered this for a co-worker. She just could not stop raving about the quality of the wig and its fullness, especially given the price point. She talked about it so much, now her sister wants one too.</li>
    <li> Not exactly realistic looking but for the price it&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
    <li> This is a great value wig. It&#x27;s decently thick, and the fibers are beautiful. However, it seems to be prone to frizzing at the ends. The wig cap and comb that came with it kind of suck, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. Overall, I&#x27;m excited to wear this wig, and would recommend you buy it.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this! Shipped and delivered on time. It tangles a bit but that is to be expected of long wigs. It&#x27;s nice for everyday wear! After a while I ended up straightening it. I love this wig. I definitely got my moneys worth and a little bit more. :)</li>
    <li> Unexpectedly good quality for this money.</li>
    <li> I received many compliments in this wig. Though it was very tangled, I brushed it out and it is beautiful! Great price and quality verses the wigs I have seen in the store. I will buy more wigs from this vendor in the future.</li>
    <li> It was veryyy pretty when I first got it. I was scared that it not being human hair that it would really look like a wig. But I would get tons of compliments on it. BUT I suggest that you DO NOT wear this everyday. Mine got soooo tangled that nothing would help it. I even tried cutting it ( I&#x27;m a hair stylist) and it didn&#x27;t help it at all. So I had to throw it away :( Its very very pretty, just try not to wear too often.</li>
    <li> The wig is wonderful.looks like real hair!</li>
    <li> Nice when you take it out the package but after a couple of hours it tangles a lot. Gave it to my daughter to wear around the house. Wouldn&#x27;t suggest this wig to anyone.</li>
    <li> Came in a neat little box with a comb and wig cap. Well packaged and the wig itself was fabulous! I attached a few photos of me wearing to show what it looked like on. I didn&#x27;t trim it or style it besides pushing the bangs to the side. It really is a pretty wig and a great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Such a good quality wig! My only complaint is now I never want to take it off :D</li>
    <li> I almost feel bad for getting a wig of this quality at this price.  It&#x27;s very long and full and amazing, there&#x27;s even some parting freedom which is a rare thing for non-lace wigs (though it doesn&#x27;t look 100% realistic, if you wanted that you should have spent the 50-200 dollars on a lacefront).  It does tangle, but that&#x27;s just a thing that happens with long hair, just be careful when detangling it.</li>
    <li> My Granddaughter loved it</li>
    <li> This is an amazing wig for a great price, I am totally happy with it.</li>
    <li> for the price it&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> Great product worked great for what It was needed for. Super fast shipping, and easy return (1 ordered 2 by mistake).  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Perfect! it looked like my own hair</li>
    <li> This is a great wig that is amazing for long term wear and it able to remain soft and fluffy so long as you care for it. I bought this wig in black, it arrived in two days and it actually heat resistant which makes it very very versatile. It held up to 355 degrees of heat. I have been able to wear it curled, crimped, and straightened at its still soooo soft. it does get a bit tangled at the base but all wigs have a bit of tangle to them. All in all a great buy. I sewed some white streaks into it for my everyday modern bride of Frankenstein hair ^,..,^</li>
    <li> Very full and realistic! Tangles very easily, though~</li>
    <li> I was super excited when I recieved this wig. I originally bought it because I had gotten a really bad haircut. It had been months since it was cut and still wasnt growing much. So I decided to go with a wig just to try it out. When I put it on, it was really flat. didnt have much volume. I also ended up cutting it as it was wayyy too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that if I put it in a loose side pony tail it looked pretty decent. or if I wore a hat to hide the part near the bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all, it was a good buy for the price. It would be perfect for cosplays and the like. But not so much for normal use.</li>
    <li> Honestly, for the price I paid, this wig is great! It&#x27;s not artificially shiny, it&#x27;s long, it&#x27;s the exact color of my hair, and it had a nice wave and curl. Yes, it&#x27;s a lil thin but I expected that and already added synthetic extensions to it to fill it out. The bangs are cut in that &amp;#34;wig&amp;#34; way but I just trimmed them a little and adjust the wig a bit to the side. I also comb it out a couple times to make it just look fuller and more natural. It tangles easily due to the length but a quick comb through is easily done and without much shedding too! (Which I was very impressed by)&lt;br /&gt;I am going to use this wig for a cosplay and I am very happy with it!!</li>
    <li> Looks and feels like real hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great for a synthetic wig.</li>
    <li> S its great wig forts me well the only problem is the wig is berry easily tangled and verry hard to repair once its tangled but other wise its a lovely wig</li>
    <li> OK, so my natural hair is bright purple with some blue, even though I have had my hair this way for about a year my job told me I need to change my hair color. Getting my hair these bright colors damaged my hair so I had no plans on going back to a normal hair color because all of that dying and bleaching would have been for nothing, so I decided to just get a wig. I came across this one and I am very impressed with it. So impressed in fact I have decided to by more wigs and let my actual hair have a nice long break from dye and heat. This wig is long, soft, very pretty, and easy to change the style around a bit, I currently have mine in bun pigtail things. I am just over all in love with this wig and it looks real and has great color.</li>
    <li> Amazing! For the price, I am bewildered at how high quality it is. Feels natural, no ugly wig shine, looks great. I have very short hair so sometimes I just wanted something to braid. This us beautiful and perfect.</li>
    <li> Five stars!&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying, this was a great purchase, the wig feels full, soft and looks like hair. The packaging was beautiful, came wrapped up tight and everything was clean and included. Yass.♡</li>
    <li> I bought this for a costume/cosplay (Shego from Kim Possible) and I love it! I didn&#x27;t have any issue with it tangling, although it did come with a comb. It was perfectly packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern was that, despite being able to change the size of the wig, it was still a bit small for me. I do have a big head (it runs in the family!) but regardless with just some bobby pins, I was able to make it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasted through 8+ hours of wear and is still in great shape. Not to mention it looks ENTIRELY natural!</li>
    <li> I needed a wig for a cosplay and this one was even better than expected. For the price I am extremely satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend for any occasion. It&#x27;s the perfect length and is very full plus they include the wig cap and comb which even made me happier with this buy. I had my eyes on a wig that cost triple times as this one and this wig turned out much better. I cannot express my satisfaction with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Best wig I&#x27;ve ever gotten, last forever and is so long and pretty!</li>
    <li> This wig amazing. Its super soft. Length is gorgeously long. Can&#x27;t wait to wear it out. And it came fast and on time.</li>
    <li> This wig was more than I expected. It was soft and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig to be used as part of my halloween costume for Dia de los Muertos, it worked out tabula sleep. It is easy to manage, you can come it with no problems. You can even style it how you want it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS WIG! My very first cosplay wig and I love it. I&#x27;m using it for a Meulin, Jade, and Aradia cosplay. The curls are a bit wild, but not too hard to tame. Perfect. I was a bit worried because I admit, I have a big head. Seriously, ITS HUGE. With the wig cap, it helped it stay on perfectly. The shipping was fast. I&#x27;ll buy it again in a different color. 😘👌</li>
    <li> VERY CHEAP... NOT MUCH HAIR..</li>
    <li> Great packaging and good quality was very satisfied</li>
    <li> Good for a week or so. It is so cute on. It is thin but wearable. Since it is synthetic it well not be able to come out As good. This is why it does not last long. But if you just want a cute style for a quick put together, this is the do</li>
    <li> I love this wig, it looks so natural that i receive compliments about the healthy look of my hair ^^.</li>
    <li> great quality wig, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it for cosplay and people thought it was my real hair lol&lt;br /&gt;I did eventually cut it short because I got it tangled up and it was difficult to brush without damaging it. I washed it and i was just as good. I didn&#x27;t use anything special either. just shampoo. but low sodium shampoos are best for wigs. :3</li>
    <li> Sexy, realistic, fun, functional and great quality! Love these wigs, bought 4 of them!</li>
    <li> I just received mine this afternoon. I find that the length and style is very flattering, even for persons with full faces like my own. This item came very nicely packaged with the wig itself in a hair net and separate packages inside of the main packages for a &amp;#34;wig comb&amp;#34; and wig cap. Please heed other reviewers comments about taming the mats and such as these fibers really like each other and need attending to. Overall, I definitely intend to buy more of this particular wig and a few others as this was my very first wig purchase. The first image is the wig right out of the box with a bit of finger combing and the second two were taken by my roommate for a better angle of the overall look and the back of the wig.</li>
    <li> I love my hair.... it feels so good and it is soooooo beautiful. The package came on time.</li>
    <li> Came really fast and fit nicely over my hair, longer than I had expected though not nearly as thick as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> I really like this wig style and make, the touch of the fiber is so soft. In addition to that the cap is larger than most so it fits well over my head and hair. I will admit the curls at the bottom tend to gather together and frizz during an active night of wear but nothing a gentle panel brush doesn&#x27;t take care of.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super pleased with this wig! I got a lot of compliments on it and it looks pretty real. I love that it came with a comb and care instructions as well!!</li>
    <li> not to mention of course it&#x27;s super long which is what i wanted but it makes it get even more tangled so i had to cut the wig myself and relayer it to make it look fresh. theyre are way too much bangs going on and you can only sweep it to the one side, which is opposite of the side i&#x27;m used to but if you want to swept it towards the other side it is sewn kinda terribly so you can see the stitching. idk it serves its purpose for the price it is. the shipping was pretty fast but i&#x27;ve gotten other wigs for cheaper and they&#x27;ve work alot better, shipping just usually takes longer on those.</li>
    <li> Very good wig for the money you pay for it. Nice and soft, and for the most part realistic looking. Easy to wash and re-style.product  and I would defiantly suggest for cosplay.</li>
    <li> First wig I&#x27;ve ever gotten. I&#x27;m in love with it. I got the black one for Halloween but wore it out today just for play. I will be buying another wig. Different color though. Maybe brown lol. It is thick and pretty. Looks like real hair too. However, tangles easily but that&#x27;s okay. (:</li>
    <li> This piece of crap wig was not what I expected! It wasn&#x27;t the right color, the band was thin and looked as if someones dog had chewed on it. It was. Truly a nightmare.I never wore it now it just sits in its its box reminding me how its the worsr wig ever!</li>
    <li> work color dark brown its not black......i want ever buy agin i just want what i see and ask for</li>
    <li> Nice wig full and beautiful. Great quality.</li>
    <li> The parting of the wig doesn&#x27;t look too real but it&#x27;s still pretty , hair tangles easily and might wanna make adjustments like cutting some hair off the wig or fixing the bangs , looks pretty good if you wear it with a hat or beanie.</li>
    <li> Nice wig truly not long term type but good for occasions .....a lot of tangles but still not s bad wig  for the price</li>
    <li> It was really soft, but not as full as shown in the picture. It&#x27;s really fun to play with, not too shiny. Love it.</li>
    <li> I am new to the world of wigs; so i was very nervous to get this wig. But i did and honestly im glad i did. The wig itself is a lot flatter then i imagined but that makes it look more natural. Its not too shiny so that makes it look more natural, as if i just went to the salon to have my hair relaxed and straightened. The bangs are really long, mine go down to my nose, however are full easy to move around and style. Also, for a newbie like myself this wig is very easy to style, i didnt cut the bangs but i cut the hair into a shoulder length bob to make it look more normal for me and it was SOOOOO easy to achieve a perfect cut and look. The hair itself is really long and can tangle really easily so be careful about manipulation, the hair, as well, has big waves and curls that help with creating new styles if you are going to cut it or adding definition to your look. All in all i do recommend this wig and this company. Shipping was fast and the kit made me feel more comfortable, as a newbie, about the buy.</li>
    <li> Another hit with my granddaughter who wears it for Cosplay.</li>
    <li> The wig came fast and in great condition. It fits perfectly but its the wrong color. I ordered black but got a brown one instead :(</li>
    <li> Thick &amp; long, I even cut the bangs........Would never know it is not real hair.</li>
    <li> beautiful! I love the hair texture and the packing it all came in was put together neatly and organized! This is a really nice wig/set. Doesn&#x27;t shed too bad, fits nice on my head (except for the part by the front of where your ears are sticks down more than the rest of it and was really awkward and uncomfortable so I cut them off.. Not pleased with that design). Looks like real hair and it&#x27;s relatively comfortable. The bangs look slightly weird and may need some trimming and it doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture because the wave is actually more curly. Looks pretty natural tho. I can brush it easily with the comb they provide. Very long, it comes to my waist and I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 9\\&quot;. Good product and worth the price.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, soft, and gorgeous wig. My only complaint is that it gets so knotted up and snarly so fast and the wig comb is basically useless.</li>
    <li> **UPDATED**  I started purchasing this wig several years ago when I got a new corporate job, but I didn&#x27;t want to give up my years of pink and blue hair. I get compliments all the time from people who don&#x27;t know I wear a wig and even from people I&#x27;ve known my whole life that think I&#x27;ve gotten extensions or something. This wig is very comfortable. I just wish they started making them with center parts instead of the side part because I usually end up cutting the bangs straight across and it makes it a bit difficult to do that when it&#x27;s meant for side bangs. It&#x27;s long and does tangle often, but I try to comb it out and keep it clean, but because they&#x27;re super expensive I usually end up buying a new one once a month. Just last week I received a Christmas card from MelodySusie with a $10 coupon for being a loyal customer over the years. That was enough to give them 5 starts. Great wigs, great company.    I just received this wig today. I was super excited to try it on. Definitely more than I was expecting. The other reviews are spot on when they say the wig is long so it tangles, but that is for any long hair...wig or not. I will definitely have to cut it a little shorter as well as the bangs. Otherwise, this wig is beautiful and thick and I definitely will feel confident wearing it out on the town. Super excited about this wig &amp; I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more from this company!</li>
    <li> Very long, very nice. It looks somewhat realistic, as my friends thought it was my hair with extensions, but feels very fake. It&#x27;s more suited for dress-up and costumes, as opposed to everyday.</li>
    <li> It is a full, long and soft wig. It covers my blue hair and i but it in a crab clip for work. It is so full and nice it is a little hot at work. I got the black color and it is a very natural soft black which is perfect. The only thing i would change is i wish the bangs were a little longer so i could clip them back.</li>
    <li> I bought for my daughter for Halloween ! I am amazed at the quality and over all look if the wig, it&#x27;s truly more than a Halloween wig! Absolutely in love would buy again and would wear myself if I needed to! Thanks so much!!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my jade cosplay and oh god it&#x27;s beautiful, it worked perfectly and the comb it came with helped a lot</li>
    <li> For the price this wig is amazing.  It looks really good, and the bangs are perfect.  The length and shape of curls are just likt the picture.  So worthit, and looks pretty real compared to other wigs I have purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> Great quality but... Not exactly what I ordered.. :/</li>
    <li> Its VERY long. I had to trim mine a bunch but I don&#x27;t mind at all. It does get quite tangled but comes with a wig comb so there is really not much to worry about. It also came with a wig cap, just in case you do not have one. All in all its a pretty good wig for the price! (:</li>
    <li> When I got it in the mail and tried it on for the first time it was really long. Like down to your butt long, but after trimming it, it looked very natural. would recommend. One thing as others mentioned, it does get tangled a bit. So keep it maintained :}</li>
    <li> Looks real, however I did not receive a wig cap or a wig comb with my order. My package consisted of only the wig (without a cover on it) in a box. Pretty disappointing.</li>
    <li> Loved this wig- I bought for a Halloween costume and it looks like real hair! I can&#x27;t wait to wear it again next year. Everyone thought I had dyed my hair dark. It looks so real. It&#x27;s soft and easy to put on/ brush/ etc.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this wig at first being it was so inexpensive, but I was pleasantly surprised. This is the first wig I&#x27;ve bought for something other than Halloween and it looks and feels real. I got asked by a lot of my friends if I dyed my hair and got extentions, they didn&#x27;t know it was a wig until I told them. The seller also includes a wig comb (which was fantastic because I didn&#x27;t have one) and a hair net. I&#x27;m 100% satisfied and would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This wig is fantastic.</li>
    <li> This wig is absolutely beautiful! It arrived earlier this morning and I, of course, put it on immediately and it was perfect! It&#x27;s so comfortable and it looks amazing! I would have forgot I was wearing it if it wasn&#x27;t for the black in the corner of my vision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended to everybody!</li>
    <li> Great price but it tangles really bad but the longer the hair the more it will tangle,the quality is good&amp;it does fit large heads...</li>
    <li> I needed a wig for a cosplay I&#x27;m doing and I was really impressed by the quality of the wig. If I need another wig definitely will be purchasing from this seller! The wig fits my head great and the extra snaps to keep it in place are really great since I move around a lot.&lt;br /&gt;on the downside the wigcap has a hard time staying in place but that could just be my head haha.</li>
    <li> I dont know how to up load a photo on here but i absolutely love my new wig!  You cant beat the price and i look super real. Has adjustable straps to size it smaller if needed. I say go for it and put your order in, you wont be sorry</li>
    <li> I love this wig. I&#x27;ve owned it for about 2 months now and I find myself wearing it all the time, even when I&#x27;m not cosplaying. I use it for Vriska Serket, Fem Kankri Vantas, and Jade Harley from Homestuck. Its a beautiful wig and it looks natural. It gets tangled a little bit easily, but the comb included in the package works nicely for that. It is a little bit small, but it&#x27;s still a perfect wig for me.</li>
    <li> Really impressed with the quality of this wig! It looks very realistic on me, and it was perfect for a Princess Jasmine costume.</li>
    <li> lots of hair but its too shiny and synthetic looking. doesn&#x27;t really look as styled as the picture either. wouldn&#x27;t really recommend</li>
    <li> I bought a $20 wig for one of my daughters and it was awful. It was tangled, one of the ponytail clips broke during the second wear and it was simply terrible.  I returned it and ordered a $50 wig to replace it.  The $50 wig is awesome, but for twice the price of the original wig, I would hope so.  After that ordeal, I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered this wig for another daughter.  The low price scared me despite the four-star average because the terrible $20 wig I originally ordered also had a high rating. Well, some low-cost items are truly nice!  This wig looks great on my daughter.  When she tried it on, it looked so natural and blended so perfectly with her skin tone and face, I had to look twice to make sure it wasn&#x27;t her real hair.  Despite being shipped wrapped in plastic and boxed, the curls were nice and fluffy and my daughter absolutely loves it. The only thing worth mentioning is that the black wig is more very dark brown than jet black.  The photo is actually a very good representation of the wig color but some people may order expecting a darker or pure black wig.  If you absolutely want pure jet black, this isn&#x27;t that color.  The brownish black color actually makes the wig look more natural on my daughter, so we are more than happy.  It&#x27;s the best $25 wig ever!</li>
    <li> dont know what to do with it, tangles like crazy, sheds badly, i just cant bother retuning it. dont buy</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig because it looked so realistic on all the provided photos from actual customers and the stock photos. It is a decent wig with a good amount of hair. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it seems darker than the picture. Like, black. This wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if it didn&#x27;t wash out my pale skin. It would be fine for a costume but I don&#x27;t think anyone would buy it as an everyday wig.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended. Salon quality that you don&#x27;t normally find at this price. We used it for our Marceline (Adventure Time) Halloween costume.</li>
    <li> The bang is too long. Curls are gone can&#x27;t style it so its just there. I guess I got what I paid for. smh I do not recommend this.</li>
    <li> This wig lasted over a month or so without even properly caring for it. I really loved it and would most definitely buy another one in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> i love the curls and the length. its long but not super thick so you&#x27;re not drowning in it. i really love wearing it and i get lots of compliments. i would recommend buying.</li>
    <li> i am using it for my homura cosplay its sooo good i love it its nice and doesnt tangle easy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a tangled mess. It feels like a rats nest after just pulling it out of the wrap it&#x27;s in. The curls are waaaaaay too much. The picture shows bigger waves but not rings on the entire wig. The cap itself is made well, and it looks real, but if you so much as move your head 10 more knots appear.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wig (wearing it now as I write this)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the curly black for a Jade Harley cosplay.&lt;br /&gt;It came three days early and was packaged well. Comes in a nice box with some bubble wrap. It is a bit  frizzy when you open it for the fist time, but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable when worn. I have huge thick curly hair and the wig cap still fit me. Zero shedding so far, but be sure to be gentle when combing it (and use the comb they give you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No wonder they&#x27;ve sold 500+ of these!</li>
    <li> It was an awesome first wig for a cosplay! The only thing is that I didnt like the wig cap it gave me becasue I have really soft curly hair. So i had to buy a different one but it was really cheap.</li>
    <li> The black wig is a good wig.</li>
    <li> It is the first time, I purchase a wig and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of the wig. The wig arrived about a day and a half after I ordered it. It came with a hair net, comb, and ziplock bag with care instructions. I wore it that same day and received many compliments. I will definitely be purchasing another one!!! 😆</li>
    <li> this wig is gorgeous and exactly as shown. the fibers are awesome and it brushes easily with a wig comb or brush without tangling up. I can&#x27;t believe the value of this wig for the super-duper price!</li>
    <li> I LOVE It My Birthday Wig👌🙌❤️ Imma Get It Again👍</li>
    <li> Great wig! Looks and feels so real!</li>
    <li> I do not sere long hair but this one is sooooo nice i felt good and sexy in it. everyone was asking where did i get it. LOVED IT!</li>
    <li> Great value, nice quality, will be perfect for many years of Halloween costumes.  So much better than the stringy gross wigs you get at Halloween store!</li>
    <li> This is one of the few wigs I have purchased for everyday use. First things first, if you have never worn a wig before it can be tricky to get on. You NEED to use a wig cap and then you need to apply the wig over the wig cap and the wig latches with two clips at the nape of the neck. With that being said, this is a very cute wig but it doesn&#x27;t look very natural. If you are looking for something that is going to look completely natural and for everyday use, this probably isn&#x27;t going to meet your expectations. If you want a spare wig to use as a back-up for your everyday wig, this is a good choice. It is designed in a way that it will fit a variety of head sizes. With that being said, it is not a very &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; wig (meaning if you look closely you can see the weave of it against your scalp when wearing it). Is this a perfect wig that no one will be able to tell isn&#x27;t real? No. Is it great for cos-play or for a quick stand-in or for emergencies? Yes. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I can&#x27;t see spending $400 or more on a back-up wig. This will do just fine. I just wish it were a bit fuller</li>
    <li> This wig is perfection and i love it so much. i already have two. i love it. perfectly thick, and realllly good for the price! everything i was looking for. wish it came in bright blonde though. :(</li>
    <li> It gets tangled and frizzy fairly  quick.</li>
    <li> Received after 2 days only, how awesome could it be?? It&#x27;s thick, long (I&#x27;m 5&amp;#34;1 and it almost reaches to my hip.) and shiny. Very pretty. I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try!</li>
    <li> Adorable! and virtually tangle free. very little shedding and very realistic look to it. Not too shiny like more synthetic wigs are.</li>
    <li> Love this wig. It looks very real.only thing I don&#x27;t like are the bangs because they get in my eyes but other then that I am very pleased with it. Good price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this wig! Great quality and came packaged very nicely . No tangles and it&#x27;s perfect for the cosplay I am doing .</li>
    <li> Very nice quality, fits well even for someone with larger head sizes.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this wig quite a lot and it got here super fast! It&#x27;s full and realistic looking so I&#x27;m not afraid to wear in out in public. Also, the brush that came with it is very convenient when fixing the wig. Overall, I&#x27;m more than happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the quality of the wig.  Got it for a gypsy costume and am very excited.  Comes with hair net and special comb.  My head is a bit bigger than I&#x27;d like it to be and it&#x27;s a bit tight but I love it!</li>
    <li> It seems to be everything I expected, it&#x27;s really pretty and I really like it. I also love that it came with a wig comb, I&#x27;ve been needing one! I had no idea it was going to come with one! Wonderful surprise!</li>
    <li> When I first opened the package, the wig was nice and soft. It is more of a dark brown than black. It does shift alot when wearing it and I have to adjust it which is a bit annoying. It is tight around my head which gives me headaches. And it curled really well using flexi rods and hot boiling water. The only thing is it is tangly and it sheds and after three days of wearing it, it is frizzy and hard to brush.</li>
    <li> Yuck, where to begin. I was really looking forward to receiving this wig, but when I got it I was utterly disappointed. The netting shows through it and creates ugly bumps at the top of the wig. The bangs are a nightmare to try and work with, too. It just looks so poorly made. I honestly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy from here again. And with the price paid I could have gone to Walmart and bought two wigs better than this one. I had planned to use this in a few weeks, but now I think I&#x27;ll just use it for Halloween instead since I wouldn&#x27;t feel remotely bad about ruining this wig.</li>
    <li> This wig is awesome!! I&#x27;ve actually got tons of compliments from people telling me my hair is beautiful and to never cut it.. I sprayed dry shampoo on it to take away the wig shine it gives.. As soon as I figure out how to post a picture I will..</li>
    <li> Very nice and soft, couldn&#x27;t tell it was a wig. Forgot I had it on after awhile, received many compliments. Would recommend. Just ordered another one!</li>
    <li> Love this wig.  totally worth the money.  Tangles a little.  Color is great and looks real, having fun with it.</li>
    <li> Its a nice wig. The bangs are just a little too long though. The curls are nice, but I wish I had purchased the straight wig instead. The curls just seem as if they&#x27;d get tangled very easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always really scared about buying wigs online, because you never really know what you&#x27;re going to get it. This wig, however, has proved absolutely fantastic. I use it quite frequently and it&#x27;s still in good condition. It usually only gets in small tangles, which are fairly easy to brush out. It got in a slightly bigger knot once, and the hair got frizzy after I untangled it, but it was a small issue being on the underside of the wig and it&#x27;s not at all noticeable. I love this wig so much... I&#x27;m a Homestuck cosplayer and have used this so far for Jade and Vriska. It&#x27;s really a great buy. 10/10 would recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost exactly like the picture! I&#x27;m soo happy about it! Plus, I got it earlier than I was told! :D</li>
    <li> I love how nice this feels and all the extra things it comes with I would not wear it every day but its a nice touch to my collection it</li>
    <li> First of all, it came very nicely packaged! I was pleasantly surprised to find that it came with a mesh cap, instructions on wig care, and a wonderful little comb that I now use all the time for my own hair. Seriously, you won&#x27;t regret buying this wig, it&#x27;s a total steal for the value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did trim off a lot of the ends, but that&#x27;s personal preference of course. The curls have settled down a little bit since I&#x27;ve combed it out well and worn it a few times, which is actually good since they now look more like natural voluminous waves. It&#x27;s very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig is made of beautiful material that looks like real hair and definitely doesn&#x27;t show up shiny in pictures. I plan on using my wig for cosplay, mostly, but it&#x27;s something I could even get behind wearing just out of the house on a bad hair day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. if you want advice on cutting this wig you can ask! I&#x27;m no professional stylist but this was an easy wig and it turned out looking awesome after a trim of about 4 inches.</li>
    <li> I used this to cosplay Shae from Game of Thrones. It is a nice natural looking black! The material was very durable for the entire con and seems to be long lasting. I will probably use this wig again in the future for another cosplay, though who I will dress as I&#x27;m not too sure!</li>
    <li> This wig is so cute! I had to cut the bangs a little since they covered my whole face but it looks so realistic and it hardly sheads unless you actually brush it.</li>
    <li> My 10 year old daughter wore this wig for cosplay.  She was Mei Chang from FMA:B.  I decided to do lower buns than Mei&#x27;s (was worried too much of the wig net would show) but they ended up very cute.  I did cut the bangs however.  This wig is awesome!  It held the style from 9 am to 6 PM on a very active child!  It didn&#x27;t shed very much when brushed and we should be able to reuse it.  It also came with a wig cap and wig comb although I bought a wig brush from Sally&#x27;s I used instead.  It came the next day as it said it would and saved the day because a previous wig we had ordered ended up being too small.  I have very little experience working/styling wig hair but this wig seemed very easy to work with and better quality than I expected for the price.  Will buy this brand again and from this seller. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have a &amp;#34;big head&amp;#34; and this product fit my head just fine, and stayed in place pretty much for about 10hrs. It arrived quickly and looked great.</li>
    <li> very thick, comes with comb and wig cap. Great for the price. Not sure if it tangles yet, but it feels like it would . I&#x27;d definitely buy from here again</li>
    <li> So upset. As a male to female trans I RELY HEAVILY ON MY WIGS. Got to wear it 3 times. Got it less than a week ago and it got so tangled, and worn, and horrible when I tried to comb it out. I will NEVER buy another one from this company. So so so upset. Also it sheds worse than my dog.</li>
    <li> Great quality wig! Very happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! I love this wig, it was my first ever due to hair problems from my anxiety but honestly it&#x27;s extremely soft and beautiful.</li>
    <li> My daughter is into the whole Lolita look and she begged for a wig.  We were hesitant to get her one that was so inexpensive.  We thought it would be cheaply made.  We were so surprised to see the high quality of this product.  It is very very nice.  It fits her well and looks beautiful.  To all those out there that say, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34;  You are wrong in this case.  Great product for a low price!</li>
    <li> This is just perfect! I bought the black one but it has this deep green undertone and a bit of ashy color. I don&#x27;t know why it has that.. I had to cut the bangs and cut the hair to my desired length. The curls are really nice and it fits perfectly on my head. Once I cut it shorter, it did not tangle that easily and it was more manageable. This wig is literally like having real hair! (I am bald)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was quick as well, only took about 2-3 days. It comes in a really cute pink packaging, including a comb and a wig cap which is a PLUS!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this wig. It came on time and looks exactly like the picture and came with all the items it said it included. I read in another review that they ordered black but didn&#x27;t get black but I ordered mine black and it came that way so I am very pleased with this seller and would definitely order again. The wig is very long, soft and very human like, not as curly/wavy as I imagined but I am still very pleased.</li>
    <li> It came and I was sooooooooo nervous cus this is my very first wig and I didn&#x27;t want it to look fake be Cus I wanted to start wearing wigs out in public and I luv it!! My only complaint is- its just was too long I had to do sum chopping But other than that i love it !! Recommend it ! I warn u tho its veryyyy long im 5&#x27;5 N  it pasts my chest.</li>
    <li> I ordered the MS712-curly black.&lt;br /&gt;I wear wigs daily so it&#x27;s very important to me that the wig is high quality. And usually I wear one at a time until it&#x27;s worn out.&lt;br /&gt;It actually does look exactly like the stock pictures which I was concerned about, since wigs usually NEVER do. The color is a warm black, with very slight reddish tones in it (only noticeable super up close). It has adjustable straps (no combs) and a pretty average cap size. The hair are of average quality, maybe like a $35 wig at a beauty supply store. It IS heat safe but on low-medium heat. I don&#x27;t know the exact temperature because my straightener is just on/off. If you&#x27;re going to straighten it TEST IT ON A SMALL STRIP OF HAIR FIRST. One that is towards the bottom and can be hidden. I do not know if all of these wigs are the same! The hair is pretty thick but if you want it to look like the mannequin you have to fluff it out with your fingers a bit. It does tangle but you can&#x27;t really tell, and it&#x27;s not a big deal. Shedding was little to none.&lt;br /&gt;What I did love was how THICK the bangs are! They&#x27;re really nice as sidebangs (no need to cut them!) but I cut them straight across and there&#x27;s no awkward gaps due to thin hair. I also cut the hair to about 4 inches. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4 and before cutting it, it came to the bottom of my rib cage.&lt;br /&gt;The comb it came with was super cute but I don&#x27;t like it much. Also the wig cap is pretty much crap. It&#x27;s extremely small and I couldn&#x27;t fit it properly on my head...and I have a small head.</li>
    <li> Honestly, this is the best affordable wig you can come by. I&#x27;ve bought 4 of these wigs in different shades and I just love them. You can&#x27;t see the wig cap or the seams on top of the wig like you can with other wigs. This is truly a high quality affordable wig. It is also thicker than most cheap wigs. The only downside is that it will take a little more maintenance to keep this wig from getting tangled. Doesn&#x27;t tangle too bad but you just have to be more careful with it since again, it is a cheaper wig. You cannot expect to get an amazing, tangle free and heat resistant wig for $16.88 that would be unrealistic. With that being said, this wig is better than a lot of my $50 dollar wigs. I would recommend this for sure!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend bought this item for work. She has very long bright fire engine red hair. She is a waitress and her work told her to change it and she didn&#x27;t want to. She bought this and her manager never even knew she was wearing a wig. It is tight on her however so be careful if you have a larger head.&lt;br /&gt;http://puu.sh/b5hhb/85835f5e45.jpg&lt;br /&gt;pix of her wearing it</li>
    <li> I love it! It was my first time ever buying a wig and I couldn&#x27;t be happpier! It was delivered fast and was perfect in every way for me (: it looks real! Definitely satisfied!</li>
    <li> I got this to wear for a night out and it actually arrived in two days with prime. It looks really good and enough to wear out. I don&#x27;t think anyone thought it was my real hair or anything, but it was cute. It was not fake shiny at all and true hair was soft and real like. It is thick and long. The curls it came with were good and didn&#x27;t need much work, but I spayed t with homemade conditioning spray, sectioned it in two parts and braided it. When I took it down later it gave me great curls so that&#x27;s how I&#x27;m storing it. My boyfriend wanted to see me with black hair and I&#x27;m glad he helped me pick out the color because it went well with my makeup/dress style. Bonus: It also came with a free wig cap and comb.</li>
    <li> i love this wig honestly bursts my confidence another 50%</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price!</li>
    <li> First of all the packaging is great. This is an inexpensive wig so i was surprised of the high quality synthetic hair. Its soft, shiny and bouncy. I wish this brand had more of a variety of different styles. Definitely a great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> The wig got here in 2 days (I live 1 state away) and it wasn&#x27;t really tangled at all when it got here. It was easy to take out of the packaging and fits well on my head. The bangs are easy to style, and the hair is nice and full. It looks like real hair too unless you really look up close. The only downside is that it&#x27;s not black like the post says, it&#x27;s actually a very dark brown. But this doesn&#x27;t matter to me because the character I&#x27;m cosplaying can pass for dark brown or black hair in the scene the costume is from. I&#x27;m EXTREMELY happy with my purchase, especially since I only paid about 20 bucks for this</li>
    <li> I can definitively tell you it is fun to use you will laugh for hours so that&#x27;s why I gave it three stars. Unfortunately you will laugh for hours because of how ridiculous it looks. That wouldn&#x27;t matter so much because I&#x27;m sure there is people whose face shape will make this flattering and it can be used for Halloween however what really bothers me about this product is how bad it gets with tangling. IT IS LITERALLY A TANGLED MESS!! After my first use I put it back in the box and when I took it out I tried to fix the knots and tangles and it was impossible (I tried everything) so I gave up. So if you really want to purchase it I recommend putting it on a wig stand or something rather than storing it on the box because if it gets tangled trust me it is as good as garbage. Other than that it is very fun</li>
    <li> Wig was delivered quickly and it was PERFECT. It is still intact and I have used it quite a bit! The quality of the wig is amazing and it is perfect for my cosplay. The only minor problem I have is getting too hot, but doesn&#x27;t that happen with all wigs? Other than that common problem, wig is great and feels real!</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE this wig! Due to health reasons I haven&#x27;t been able to grow my hair in about five years. This hair looks exactly like how my hair used to look and I love it! It looks real doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;wig shine&amp;#34; that fake wigs have. My only sort of concern is that this wig just to get a bit tangled but I guess it comes with the territory since it&#x27;s long.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality fashion wig.  Comfort and looks is great. I would highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This wig is fantastic! I ordered it for my Vriska Serket cosplay and it came right on time, packed neatly into the seller&#x27;s box with a packaged wig cap and wig comb. The box&#x27;s exterior includes instructions for care of the wig as well. I haven&#x27;t yet worn this for a long period of time, so I don&#x27;t know how it holds up, but from what I&#x27;ve experienced it&#x27;s very comfortable. The wig is very long, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; and it reaches the small of my back. The wig required no styling for my needs, and the curls have held up well thus far. I did notice it tangles rather easily, but from what I understand that&#x27;s common for long wigs. I agree with the other reviewers, the black isn&#x27;t a jet-black color, more of a very dark brown, but it still suited its purpose well. Overall I love this wig and am completely satisfied. I will be sure to order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I love this wig. Looks very realistic and everyone said I look good in it. It tangles very easily but so does my other one so I don&#x27;t mind much. So far my favorite wig though. :)</li>
    <li> Look a little big for my head.  Does not look real for me.</li>
    <li> From what I read, I thought this wig and would be amazing. But in reality its just...okay. The wig was darker than the picture, was more curly, and the bangs seem shorter (maybe I just have a big head). Even though I comb and brush it out after every time I wear it, it still tangles like none other, but it does feel like real hair. So, if you&#x27;re not gonna wear it to everyday like me, then go for it, but if you do, be cautious.</li>
    <li> Amazing wigs and shipping was so quick. My teen girls are super excited about the wigs.</li>
    <li> Its awesome even when its tangled! The bangs stay looking perfect regardless. I love it I did trim it a little cuz this wig is super long! The only problems I really have with it is A) the fact that it cannot be detangled and B) it is itchy against your back or anywhere else it falls after a couple wears.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as part of her Halloween costume. The wig is soft and keeps it shape and is easy to style. I like that they  provided a comb and wig cap as well. I have bought her wigs in the past for her to be a certain princess or two when she was much younger. They were a lot more money and poor quality.</li>
    <li> The wig is very lovely. I tried it on immediately with the complimentary wig cap and it looked very natural. I even got several compliments on it! It&#x27;s very full, and I love the curls.&lt;br /&gt;There is a very small issue with random, tiny snarls in several places. I found four and had to cut one out near the bottom. However, another I got out, and the other two are so miniscule that they can be hidden without problem. It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d throw a fit about.</li>
    <li> This wig is the beezneez. It looks and feels like human hair when you look and touch it. It also looks like the picture exactly, but the thing is, the bangs look wonky. But my primary adjective was to cut it into a fringe. After i did so, it looked as if it were really my hair. Top looks like a wig, but i like to wear hats so its no big deal to me. Other than that, it truly is a big steal. The quality is of a 80$ wig. This is 20$. Im glad i chose to purchase this fine specimen, because i am far from regretting it. The picture does not give it justice, my opinion is that its better looking in actuallality. All in all, i highly recommend buying it. I got in black btw, and i recieved black. (;</li>
    <li> This wig is fantastic! Even thicker and softer than the picture would have you think. It looks, feels and moves like real hair. My compliments to the maker.</li>
    <li> i ordered this wig for a cosplay for someone who has full and curly hair, that being said that is very hard to find in a wig. when i got this wig i was very surprised at how heavy it was, and once i took it out of the box i was even more surprised to see how full it really was! you cant see the netting for the wig at all, and it looks and feels super natural and has a nice bounce to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as for the packaging itself it was very nice, and in the box with the wig it came with a free comb, and a free net wig cap. i am overly thrilled with this wig, and if anyone else i know is need of a a wig this will definitely be the one i direct them to</li>
    <li> The wig looks very nice, it&#x27;s a nice length and size, etc. The only problems I have it that it gets tangled pretty easily, and it&#x27;s not very easy to untangle. It also gets very frizzy if you bruh/comb it, but if you handle it properly and don&#x27;t let it get knots, then it should be fine.</li>
    <li> Excellent wig. It&#x27;s very comfortable and looks very natural. I really appreciate that the item also comes with a wide tooth comb to prush it out when necessary.</li>
    <li> This wig is the perfect wig for any cosplayer looking for Jade Harley hair.  My daughter loves it. It looks real and it&#x27;s easy to comb and the style stays in. It does tangle at the ends slightly but we use a fabric softner/water mixture, misted on and it stays tangle free for hours!  I fully recommend this wig!&lt;br /&gt;*glasses are in another review</li>
    <li> Did not burn but could not get it to curl back.but then again not too good at curling hair anyways</li>
    <li> Wow shipping was fast and it only cost 5 dollars too ship standard rate I got this literally the next day wow so happy this wig is exactly what the picture is and it&#x27;s so much more the picture doesn&#x27;t do justice I was like woah this is awesome quality cute package and wow wow wow a must have for your wig collection and just to feel pretty on those days you get dolled  up the hair is curly wavy and long so beautifully made .i will be recommending to all my friends and family this is a great product thank you Melody Susie  for such a great wig I&#x27;m excited :) :) :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Wonder Woman costume, and I am quite pleased with it. The wig is decently thick, and I couldn&#x27;t see the weft when I wore it. It is styled exactly like it is in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Also, as a bonus, it came in a nice box with the wig cap and wig comb.&lt;br /&gt;It was perfect for my purposes, and I would definitely buy again from this seller.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product. I ordered it specifically to wear with my Halloween costume and received many compliments. I did not intend on wearing it again but I will. Good quality and price. Excellent packaging and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I loved it!! It&#x27;s so pretty and looks natural!! I wore this for a rave and it stayed on the whole night! It was worth every penny :)</li>
    <li> I have a big head so I was a bit worried that this wouldn&#x27;t fit. It does. I have a pixie cut, so I didn&#x27;t need to use a wig cap. I got it for a Halloween costume, so it&#x27;s not something I wear daily. I actually had someone tell me how realistic they thought the wig was. The hair isn&#x27;t shiny and fake looking at all.</li>
    <li> I use this wig for my Jade Harley from Homestuck cosplay and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bangs are cut to short</li>
    <li> Great wig! It&#x27;s full of hair, and even has baby hairs too make it even more realistic. I&#x27;m 5 foot tall, and it ends around the bottom of my bust, so it&#x27;s pretty long! The bangs were a bit annoying, but nothing a little hair spray and bobby pins can&#x27;t fix. Definitely recommend this wig! I know people who spend almost 40$ on wigs, and some of them don&#x27;t look as good as this one. Great buy, so happy I got it!</li>
    <li> I got this wig for a cosplay of Vriska from Homestuck, and it worked out perfectly. My only complaint is that it is a little difficult to work out any tangles. (Then again, it&#x27;s my first wig, so it may just be an inexperience thing.) Very good wig, well worth the money. :)</li>
    <li> I loved the fit and feel of the wig, granted it is synthetic so treat it with love! Came in a day late due to weather conditions, but the quality made it worth it</li>
    <li> Wig made a great Halloween costume! :)</li>
    <li> So beautiful and long looks very realistic!  I buy so many wigs off amazon this wig was very worth the price will be purchasing again! My #1 favorite wig! Thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> Okay, I just got my wig...At first my impression was WOW! very pretty. I was having some issues getting it to stay on because my head if bigger and the wig cap kept falling off. styling the top for me is hard, the bangs seem too short for my liking. I like it much better with a hat or beanie. it feels just like human hair. I might have to get used to it.</li>
    <li> This wig does not look natural at all.  The curls are not as nice as in the pictures and they look really uneven and stringy.  The color is a nice shade of black but that is the only positive about it.  It was nice that it came with a wig cap and wig comb but it was so straggly looking and tangled and un-managable that it really didn&#x27;t make a difference.  The wig came down to my butt and the longer the hair got the more scarce and thin it became.  Overall I am not impressed and I wouldn&#x27;t even want to use this wig for a Halloween costume.</li>
    <li> Garbage, knots immediatly</li>
    <li> Could have been a nice wig, but the front and bangs look very unnatural and weren&#x27;t easy to style.</li>
    <li> (I purchased curly black) I got this wig a while back for one of my cosplays, it was very good quality and I was very excited that it came with a nice little comb and wig cap.  It is nice and thick and looks very realistic.  It doesn&#x27;t tangle very easily as long as you take good care of it.  The bangs are a bit longer than they were in the picture but that hardly mattered.  It was excellent and I would recommend this to my friend.</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying a wig it looks very gorgeous in the picture but didn&#x27;t quiet look like it when I received it or maybe cause I&#x27;m still learning on how to really wear a wig look it up on YouTube if it&#x27;s your first time but still a good wig. It came with a comb and a cap I tried it it did fit perfectly. The delivery was fast came sooner then expected. I will buy again. Another thing I recommend you buy a wig holder cause the length on this wig is kind of long I regret not buying on it can tangle easily.</li>
    <li> Amazing wig! it was great and i use it all the time! its good for cosplays! so awesome, I love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just using the wig for part of my Halloween costume so for what I&#x27;m using for it&#x27;s great!  Especially considering the price and quality of what you would pay at a Halloween costume shop.  I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for part of a Halloween costume.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the wig.  Very good quality for the price paid.  Comes with a comb and wig cap.</li>
    <li> Looks so real. Perfect length! I love it.</li>
    <li> Feels fake. Looks fake. You can see threw the top clear as day. Fast shipping. Tangles like crazy. Maybe someone with more patients can deal with this. But i tried for about an hour to even get it to fit correctly. Moves to much for me. Just bottom line no for me. And by the bangs you can see the band thing where the hair is being held together at. Returning it. 2 stars because of fast shipping and came a day early.</li>
    <li> I loved how the wig felt.  It was soft and the perfect amount of length.  They included a comb for the wig which I thought that was pretty cool. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I honestly love this wig.  For the price it is amazing. The color  is a nice shade to where it doesn&#x27;t make the wig look fake, although it is. I got many compliments on it regularly that may people had no idea it was  a wig. I had the wig for about a month through out the time the wig became rough and frizzy, but that&#x27;s only natural for a synthetic wig with Daly use. If you are good with scissors, I extend the life of my wigs by just cutting off the bad ends and wearing it till its \\&quot;unsavable\\&quot;. Overall this wig is amazing and has very good quality till it&#x27;s used enough. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Cons&lt;br /&gt;•a bit shiny&lt;br /&gt;•tangles easily (extremely so)&lt;br /&gt;•thin&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;•it&#x27;s so soft oh lord&lt;br /&gt;•it&#x27;s better than the &amp;#34;average amazon wig&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;•it&#x27;s not as shiny as I thought it would be</li>
    <li> This product ended up being unavailable. They refunded me with no issues.</li>
    <li> I love this wig it compliments me when I wear it out on the town at night will be Purchasing more</li>
    <li> This wig is definitely as awesome as the reviews say. &amp;#60;3 awesome</li>
    <li> I can not say how much I love MelodySusie wigs! I got one before for a convention and loaned it to a friend and never saw it again. I was sad to see it go, but now I have a new one and I am so exited. I have never had trouble with these wigs and they are honestly my favorites! I would highly recommend them to any person!</li>
    <li> I have owned several cheap wigs (most ironically cost more than this one) and none have been of the quality of this wig. It really feels like real hair. Taking it out of the box, there wasn&#x27;t any styling or fixing needed-it just fell so beautifully. It did come with a comb and a wig cap and the box has cleaning instructions. I do recommend getting a wig head if you don&#x27;t have one just so it doesn&#x27;t get tangled and lose it&#x27;s shape. I love it so much and even ordered one for a friend!</li>
    <li> I saw a photo of this wig here and I said to myself I want to buy &amp;#34; fp712 black long curly&amp;#34; because I like the way its layered at the front, its thick/fluffy, curly, black, and long hair. I was disappointed when my first and second orders arrived because they cut the front bangs and side bangs shorter than what is in their photo for that particular wig. The wig is layered different from what is in their photo. The second wig they sent me is layered worse than how the first wig was layered. There were more short bangs at the front and sides of the second wig. I like the wig so much that I&#x27;am giving MelodieSusie a third chance to get it right withfp712 black long curly.&amp;#34; Why do you cut the bangs at the front and sides short? Why isn&#x27;t it layered the way it is in the photo you attached to it or FP718 dark brown long curly? Anyways attached is a photo of &amp;#34;fp712 black long curly&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;FP718 dark brown long curly&amp;#34; because I like the way they are layered at the front and that is how I would like fp712 black long curly to look. Stop cutting the bangs short. If you get the third order right I will update and change this review.</li>
    <li> This wig is awesome. Cheaply priced, but great quality. Shipped quickly and packaged nicely!</li>
    <li> I bought this as part of my Halloween costume for Marceline from Adventure Time. The quality of the wig is fantastic - the hair doesn&#x27;t look fake or cheap. It&#x27;s not shiny or plastic looking at all. If you didn&#x27;t know me, you wouldn&#x27;t know it wasn&#x27;t my hair! It came with a wig cap &amp; a great comb for detangling it, since it is a bit long on my body (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;0). It&#x27;s a nice black with some slight brown undertones. Very comfortable to wear &amp; a great purchase!</li>
    <li> Pretty nice wig!! Thick &amp; bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly too. Satisfied.</li>
    <li> Honestly the best thing I have ever bought!! This is my first time ever buying a wig.</li>
    <li> When I first got the wig I was concerned for shedding and easy knotting, but so far none of that was happened! I&#x27;m very happy with the way this wig looks, its&#x27; quality, and how natural it looks on me. I have worn it for two cosplays (costumes) and have received many compliments about it. It was worth every cent and I highly recommend buying it!</li>
    <li> I just want to say that i am a hairstylist, i decided to cut my hair into a pixie a few months back and am now trying to grow ny hair out. I bought this wig because it was inexpensive and my expectations weren&#x27;t too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this in the mail in a timely manner and it was above my expectations. I have worn it EVERY SINGLR DAY since i recieved it and get compliments daily. Everyone thought i got extensions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reccommend for daily use to use a &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; on and actually spray the ends with water when you brush through it so it wont start frizzing. It can withstand up to no more than 300° of heat. I tested with a wand and flat iron. I put chi oil on the ends everyday to help with friz. It doesnt make it look oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing wig, i got the black curly one.</li>
    <li> I am in love with the quality and style :) It fits on my big head very comfortably, also it is extremely long ! I am 5ft tall and it goes all the way down to my hips when its uncurled :)</li>
    <li> The product arrived weeks before scheduled. The hair was so freaking soft, unlike my first wig purchase which was far more coarse. It is a very long wig, and as I&#x27;ve found, tends to tangle and even with the wig brush is a major pain to untangle. I even have up and trimmed it after 6 weeks to extend the life. It looks amazing and realistic, just add a bit of bronze powder to did  extra shine. I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 months and it&#x27;s got about 2 months left in it for semi daily wear, which is expected for the price.</li>
    <li> it looks fake and cheap</li>
    <li> Why did not the product up for now?</li>
    <li> Loved this wig. I will buy it again. The bangs are little annoying they get in your eyes. I have to pin them back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing an update. I cannot say enough how much I loved this product. I have used this wig for 2 years in a row, and have worn it about 7 time now. It gets a little more tangled each time and is harder to brush, but I have never been able to wear a wig more then once.</li>
    <li> This hair is lovely it looks real and feels real and it full it looks just like the picture I recommend buying this hair (:</li>
    <li> This wig is gorgeous! I can&#x27;t believe the quality of this wig for the money. I bought it to wear with my Halloween costume, but it is nice enough to wear for every day. The hair is thick and silky and does not have that fake shiny look at all!</li>
    <li> This wig is even lovelier than in the photo. I&#x27;ve bought it multiple times for cosplay reasons, and I&#x27;ve loved it every time I&#x27;ve gotten it. Although the ends get a little frizzy and tangled, the wig looks absolutely realistic and can definitely be worn for more than just a costume.</li>
    <li> Great quality wig for the price you are paying!</li>
    <li> Mind you, this is not for long term use. But for a few weeks, this serves it purpose. So I got another one to replace the 1st after about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> this wig is grossly misrepresented its awful! thin ,has no style its cut very strange, nothing like picture . also after one day became stiff knotted. truly junk.</li>
    <li> Very nice for 16 bucks</li>
    <li> This wig looks like a more expensive wig than it is. My daughter got it for her halloween costume...it was just as she hoped it would be and she&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very nice wig. Nice quality for the price. Perfect for my Halloween costume. However, it does frizz and tangle rather easily. But that&#x27;s what the comb is for. I got the long wavy black one. It&#x27;s not jet black but rather black with brown under tones. It looks more realistic that way. As long as you take good care of it, it should last for a long time.</li>
    <li> It looks so real! And its so full ...  N its just so awesome!! It came fast n greatest quality ever!!!!</li>
    <li> Oh gosh! This thing got tangled so bad! Granted, it was my first wig and I didn&#x27;t store it properly, but after one use it lost all its curl and tangled up grossly. &amp;#62;:/ I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This wig is awesome! It looks like my actual hair anyway. Very good quality and easy to put on, also having the wig cap and brush come with it was a bonus. It looks wonderful and keeps well.</li>
    <li> I love it just having problems how to put in on</li>
    <li> I was really excited for this wig when i ordered it i read the reviews and decided to order it for a cosplay, i wore it once stored it properly and went i took it out to test my cosplay with the thing was matted, i did everything i can think of that is healthy to the wig to try and restore it but nothing worked i plan on returning it as soon as possible.</li>
    <li> One of the first pieces I purchased. Nice dark brownish black color. It looks real, and no one notices when my natural bangs, which are almost the same color, fall out here an there. It brushes out fine with a little detangler. I wear it quite often still, even though ive had it for months. The curls seem to lose a little enthusiasm over time with lots of brushing, but it hasnt had a negative effect in my eyes. I had an awkward moment when a cashier kept telling me how good my hair looked, and how well it suited me, and I didnt have the heart to tell him it was fake.</li>
    <li> I got it to see how I would look with super long hair, and the curls hold up very well. It&#x27;s comfortable and it looks very natural for a 15 dollar wig</li>
    <li> This is ultra thin and it&#x27;s shedding waaaaayyy too much did I just get a faulty one?</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing wig!! I am in love! For eighteen dollars, it was well worth my money.  Hands down, way better than any other wig I&#x27;ve ever seen. So soft, not scratchy. Nor is it overly shiny. Tangles easy to manage. I would recommend this product to others. And I will be back to purchase this wig again. Thank you, Melody Susie!</li>
    <li> Love it.  I&#x27;m a teacher and I wore it today for the Halloween parade and festival.  Everyone commented on it, including tons of kids, who thought it was my hair!  (I&#x27;m blonde, by the way)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, everyone thought it looked very real and now wants me to go dark! (I won&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing was that is was very itchy, but I think all wigs are.</li>
    <li> its really nice to have the wig cap and comb!!! the hair is really soft and realistic and it fits snugly i had a lot of fun styling it! im really happy!!!!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this wig.  Its so pretty!  I love it and highly recommend it to anyone that wants the stylish look without the effort.  It&#x27;s comfortable to wear too!  All around pluses!</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig to go with a Halloween costume and am very pleased with it. The fit is great and quality is much better than I expected for the price. I would buy from this merchant in the future.</li>
    <li> Nice full wig. Very long but other that that it&#x27;s great. I would recommend it if u want a nice quality LONG wig</li>
    <li> Horrible wig. Kept this in my room because I didn&#x27;t want to wear it because it was so thin and it fell straight no one believed it was real if I could I would put negative stars</li>
    <li> Very, very long wig.  Cute, but so long.</li>
    <li> Bad things: Itchy, tangles easily at the bottom&lt;br /&gt;Good things: Not too shiny natural looking, nice length (not too long), style is beautiful (nice and wavy, came in a nice box with directions on how to care for your wig, came with a wig comb and hair net!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> If there was a -0 rating I would give this product that. Threw the wig in the garbage. Poor quality product and will not fir any head.</li>
    <li> i have a very odd shaped head and most wigs fall off within two second. so i was a little hesitant to buy this. but i did anyway cause the reviews where good. i love the color and length and best of all it best great. the only thing i can stress enough is it tangles so quickly i barley had it on and most of it was tangled. and i was very gentile with it. so please keep that in mind when buying. other than it tangling it would have gotten 5 starts. the comb they give u does not really help that much kinda makes it worse. my brush did a better job i just went very slow not to take so much hair out.</li>
    <li> I Put it on and it makes me look ugly,  but that is my problem not anybody else&#x27;s. :( Great product nonetheless.</li>
    <li> I bought this awhile ago, (a year) and it&#x27;s still good as new! It got kind of tangled after wearing it for awhile, but I just washed it and it came out like new. Great quality, I love this wig.</li>
    <li> So, I purchased this a fun wig to have for casual wear on a weekend out with my BF to AC.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m near the Philadelphia border and this came extremely fast. Got it in under 12 hours from order time.&lt;br /&gt;Ok so, Feels amazing. Great feeling wig. Now, I am a woman that can sleep in a wig. Jog with a wig on and literally wear it EVERYDAY for a month. So, yes this wig does tangle. The great thing about it is you can use heat on it. NOT an OVERLY excessive amount of heat. However, yes you can use a flat Iron and roll it using your fingers or with long sponge rollers.&lt;br /&gt;I parted this wig in sections. used the flat iron to heat it up. Trim up the end and put it on sponge rollers. It came out very curly and the curls have not had to be reset for a full week. A little trimming and gentle heat makes this wig snap back like new.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the typos and grammatical errors as I am doing this rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck ( $18) a great deal.  Also I used a lite oil sheen on it. MUST BE LITE or your wig will turn into something messy!</li>
    <li> I got so many compliments on my hair while wearing this wig. Many people told me black was definitely my color (natural redhead). It goes great with my darker/gothic outfits and looks amazing in photos. Not fake looking at all. And it was super nice that it came with a comb and wig cap. The comb works ok but I still had to use my brush on it -- however after finger-combing it through the curls returned as they were before. Wasn&#x27;t expecting that... I thought I&#x27;d have to straighten it after brushing the curls out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit worried the color would be more of a brown-black -- it&#x27;s really not. If the light hits it in certain ways it /shines/ brown, but the wig itself is definitely a dark black color. Exactly what I was looking for while still looking natural under direct light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost rated 4 stars because this wig does tangle a lot. But for the price and how easy it was to fix it (took less than 30 minutes to get out some pretty bad tangling my sister had caused by shaking it around) it deserves the 5 stars. I will definitely order from this company again and recommend to my friends. (:</li>
    <li> The unit looks very wiggy and rough.  It may work for someone else but for me it is more like a costume piece.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally like ordering things online. Especially wigs. But overall, this wig is of good quality. It&#x27;s pretty thick and feels like real hair. I love that the wig not only has a cap attached to the inside but with this product, you also get an extra wig cap and a comb to comb through it. I also received this product within 3 days of ordering it! My only real complaints are that the wig is a bit too long. I plan to trim it down soon. Also that the waves fall out pretty easy. I expected it to be like the picture or maybe a little curlier but when I tried it on and ran my fingers once through one side, the waves seemed to fall out. Overall though, I would order again.</li>
    <li> In October on 2013 I donated my hair (a pony tail&#x27;s worth), the rest was shaven for the fundraiser Be Bold. Be Bald. My hair is growing back fast but I was in need of a wig. Instead of paying $300 dollars or more I decided to take a look at what was being sold on Amazon. I was hesitant at first but decided to give it a try. I placed an order for the MelodySusie High Quality New Fashion Black Wig and was surprised- in a good way. The box arrived promptly. The wig, comb and cap were neatly packaged. The quality is good and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase. While this is not an expensive wig, it&#x27;s a great deal for the quality received. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate ordering from this company again.</li>
    <li> Waste of money, the hair keeps falling out and I&#x27;ve spent over an hour trying to comb it and it&#x27;s to knotty and looks terrible, it barely looks like the hairstyle in the picture.</li>
    <li> Super light weight, and easy to maintain, if you&#x27;re accustomed to longer wavy hairstyles. The cap is adjustable, and fit me quite well even though I have a rounder head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color was exactly the same (dark brown). The bangs aren&#x27;t like you see on the model. That mannequin is obviously a very small one, now that I have the item on my own head and see where the layers of hair fall. The bangs came to just below my eyebrows, resting on my eyelids. I twisted the wig&#x27;s cap about 1/4 inch to the left so that the bangs fall naturally off to one side, framing a part of my face, and it&#x27;s still extremely comfortable and very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE WARNED: This cap does NOT have a built-in part on the side like the model shows. You can part it, but it takes a little finesse to not reveal your cap underneath. I love hair scarves and flowers, so shifting it into a style to suit those things was VERY easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My package came with a wig comb and a fishnet cap, as well! Very good deal. Came almost a full day ahead of schedule. Prime eligible, so free shipping as well. Enjoy your purchases!</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a cosplay, and I was actually really worried that it was going to be a bad quality because of reviews for the same (?) one in a different color and it&#x27;s cheapness.  This is a really good, soft, high quality wig!  I layered it a lot to make it fluffier, and it looks really nice.  It&#x27;s exactly as it is pictured, well, maybe less fluffy, but that&#x27;s to be expected.  The bangs are even cut the same, too!  My only issue, which isn&#x27;t really an issue at all, is that it&#x27;s more like a natural black than the solid black that I was looking for, but that&#x27;s fine!  (^*ω*^)</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig for my mom looking picture but it look diffrent from picture. front hairs r very short with center parting.hair quality is nice but it looks good only for young girls not for my mom. but I really satisfied with cust service as they refunded me money.</li>
    <li> I loved this wig. It came in really fast. Amazing curls and super cute.</li>
    <li> Perfect length and it covered all my hair. I was able to straighten this wig when I needed to and curl it again using hairspray and toilet paper rolls.</li>
    <li> This wig is very full, long and beautiful! I&#x27;ve been using for cosplay for 6 months now and it still looks very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 5&amp;#34;6 and it reaches my bellybutton. It has gotten a bit tangly but that&#x27;s to be expected with a curly wig. I also really like the bangs!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for my Aradia Megido and Jade Harley cosplays and it works very well for both c:</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s soft and wavy and a great shade of black. I plan to gets a lot of wear out of it.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous! I love it so much. It looks very realistic and it is such a good price. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
    <li> Love it! I came on time and fits great. Everything about it I love. It&#x27;s great for Jade from Homestuck.</li>
    <li> Awesome wig for wonder women !!</li>
    <li> Tangles easily, doesn&#x27;t look natural</li>
    <li> I bought this wig to cover my hair for work. Turquoise and blue are not &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; colors. This wig is comfortable, and doesn&#x27;t itch my head after hours of wear the way a Halloween wig does. This wig is natural looking and flattering. I also really love that it came in a box, with instructions for wig care, a wig comb, and a wig cap. I&#x27;m very happy with my wig, and if I need any more wigs in the future I will definitely purchase them from this seller.</li>
    <li> This wig is beautiful_ doesn&#x27;t have as much shine as some of my others. Very pretty</li>
    <li> I bought this for Halloween and I didn&#x27;t wear it. It made my head look giant and the hair was ratty. I&#x27;m pretty short but the length didn&#x27;t bother me. Used a wig brush on it and it didn&#x27;t help at all! My $20 wig is sitting on the floor right now in a closet. Not worth my own money and I shouldn&#x27;t have bought it or I would be $20 richer right now.</li>
    <li> Good quality but it looks so fake at the same time I guess the price is good for what you get. I can use this for Halloween but not to go out!</li>
    <li> tangles a little but over all i love it its really full and thick i cut the bangs on it made it into my own style</li>
    <li> this shipped way before the estimated time! very fast.&lt;br /&gt;the picture shows a LOT of volume. The wig doesn&#x27;t have a lot of volume at all. it&#x27;s for pretty small heads, but if you braid down your hair right you won&#x27;t see any bumps or anything. This also is very long, with VERY nice feeling hair, so soft, and not fake shiny. it feels and looks like real hair. but because it&#x27;s so long, it can tangle a lot, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for everyday use, but just when you&#x27;re going out or something. It doesn&#x27;t have too many layers of hair, that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t look as thick as the picture. also, it has very pretty curls, and comes with a wig cap too!</li>
    <li> Bought this for myself because I have extremely short hair!  It looked hideous on me...I looked like a crazy homeless person!  LOL!  My sister-in-law, who has stage 3 cancer, decided to try it on....it looked amazing on her!  Her actual hair was similar to this style and length, but after the chemo and radiation she started to loose her hair and tried herself to find a suitable wig...with no luck!  This one really worked for her and she loves it, it really looks natural on her. I&#x27;m glad one of us found use for it.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about trying out a full wig but this one was a disappointment. The package came with its own cap and comb but since my hair is just still growing out, I don&#x27;t need a cap yet. Just looking at it, the wig looks decently natural with not a lot of sheen. I tried it on and couldn&#x27;t get the wig to look natural no matter how I played with it. The bangs was too long for me and the hair in the back kept getting tangled. I tried to brush it out patiently with the comb it came with but kept getting knots so I had to cut and style the hair to make it more manageable. Even at shoulder length, this wig isn&#x27;t what I was looking for so I am keeping it for costume purposes but definitely not my day to day wig.</li>
    <li> I love the quality of the wig and the easy way to adjust to fit all sizes.</li>
    <li> I wore this thang til I cudnt wear it anymore okay hunty</li>
    <li> This is a very nice wig. Loved that it came with the cap and comb. Looks very natural and is comfortable to wear. Wish the top was a little thicker because I get paranoid that people can see that its a wig through the hair, but its not that bad. I will buy another from this seller. The price is right too</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a cosplay and I plan on cutting a great deal of the length off (it is a shame because the waves are pretty).  I was happy with the packaging and shipping.  I&#x27;ve bought a number of wigs off amazon that make promises of extras like wig caps and combs, but I usually get stuck with just a plain wig, so I was happy to see that this came with everything promised.  The texture of the wig is nice.  It is very soft and looks pretty realistic.    After cutting it, I really wanted another one.  So I ordered the wig in red. I&#x27;m not nearly as happy with it as the dark brown.  It isn&#x27;t nearly as soft and definitely feels like a wig.  Straight out of the package it had a few tangles.  However it is still lovely.  I felt like the description was a little confusing. I understand with it being a Korean product, it may not be written in perfect English.  The wording was a little confusing.  It said it was &amp;#34;high temperature&amp;#34; and had &amp;#34;similar properties to human hair.&amp;#34;  I was under the impression that I was buying a heat resistant wig, and I was a little disappointed to learn that it isn&#x27;t.  This makes it a lot harder for me to style as a cosplayer, but I will find a way!</li>
    <li> I am in Love with this wig (curly black, MS712) I get a lot of compliments on it...many people think its real! I did apply baby powder on the wig just to take out a bit of the shine. Its thick and long...I&#x27;m 5&#x27;&#x27;0 tall and it goes to my belly button. This wig also fits my head well..and I have extremely thick and curly hair. I didn&#x27;t care for the comb and wig cap that came with it so I used different ones.No issues with the seller and super fast shipping! ..I received my wig within 2-3 days. Overall highly satisfied! I bought another wig (MS718) and Again I&#x27;m highly satisfied! great price and great service. &#x3D;) Did I mention the great price?</li>
    <li> This wig is SO PRETTY!!! the bangs were a bit long, so i had to trim them. this wig made me feel sooo pretty whenever i went out, and it looks super natural too. But like other wigs, the more you wear it, the more it gets tangled. i always have to brush through it with a wide toothed comb after the third or fourth use. I also bought this product again, but the wig was just a little bit different from the first one. No two wigs are ever made the same, unfortunately. but it was still pretty darn close and i was still happy :) definitely going to keep buying this product!</li>
    <li> This is cute and looks nice. Make sure you secure it properly as it weighs a bit and is awkward falling off while in public! I like it and use it every now and then.</li>
    <li> When I first laid eyes on this wig, I was excited, but upon placing the wig onto my head I was appalled! This wig is not one you would want to wear out in public unless you are wearing it with a Halloween costume! It looks totally fake. I have cancer and am bald, so I was hoping to be able to wear it out to the store and other places but no! It looks terrible on...totally unnatural. Buyer beware! It looks much better on the mannequin!!</li>
    <li> I was kind of afraid to by it.  I purchased the black color for a costume to wear on Halloween.  It looks so authentic.  I love this wig!  It feels really soft and the curls fall down perfectly.  It takes a short amount of time to get the style you are looking for that resembles the picture.  I do not regret this purchase.  After two wears it still hasn&#x27;t tangled.</li>
    <li> This wig is just as it&#x27;s expected. I would wear this everyday if i wanted to. I can&#x27;t to socially use this wig. It&#x27;s a great wig to show off. Delivery was on point too as well. I can&#x27;t complain. Great job.</li>
    <li> Do not buy. This wig is super long but tangles very easily. Took me an hour to detangle and when I put it on it got tangled all over again. Material is very sturdy but cheap. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> The texture of the hair was fine, and the length was as promised. The color of the wig was awesome as well. What I did not like was the bangs. They were a little odd and all over the place. Like the bangs had a cowlick.  Its ok for the price, I will however, never wear it. I did like that it came with a comb and cap. That was nice.</li>
    <li> Made for a gigantic sized head and very ratty looking hair.</li>
    <li> My mom thought I had gotten hair extensions when I wore this. It looks very natural and it&#x27;s fun to pretend I have mermaid hair. :)&lt;br /&gt;Great quality, wonderful price. DO IT!</li>
    <li> Very thin and flat...perfect to wear under stylish hats. I don&#x27;t think it would survive a washing or a blow drying.</li>
    <li> This wig is super soft and the color is a true black it arrived on time and it came packaged really well and came with 2 wig caps and a comb! I like that the inside is adjustable to custom fit your head And the box tells you how to care for it. The only thing I did have a problem with is it was a little tangled at the ends and they weren&#x27;t very easily combed out.</li>
    <li> You got to get one of these. Its the best. Looks and feel natural. I love it</li>
    <li> I just received my wig and it looks utterly gorgeous!!! It is not nearly as full as I expected but I&#x27;m sure that with some styling that can be fixed. It&#x27;s much softer than I expected and it looks like real hair, not synthetic. Worth the price!</li>
    <li> I recieved this wig in two days, just the shipping I selected. its a gorgeous soft natural black color and was free of tangles. EXTREAMY SOFT. one thing I was ever so slightly dissapointed about, but i knew this going in, was that my head is rather large, and this being true, the company would probably have smaller wig caps. the cap is very snug. it holds close to my head and i havent styled it yet but is not as volumus as depicted in the photo. overall i love it and will buy from these sellers again.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this wig as my hair is short and I have always dreamt of having long, thick hair. But, I was unpleasantly surprised when I tried it on. It did not fit my head properly at all, it tangled effortlessly, and the hairs at the part were extremely short and broken off. I have requested a refund and hopefully that will at least redeem the seller a bit. If you&#x27;re looking for a quality wig, I suggest not buying one online. :(</li>
    <li> i am in love with this wig. it is really long and feels like real hair. it even comes with a brush for it. the best part is its not that expensive and its one of the better ones for the price</li>
    <li> Much higher quality than I was expecting for the price. Very fast delivery. The wig isn&#x27;t too shiny and is quite soft. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months and it does tangle and get frizzy easily. Overall pretty pleased with the quality for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m unsure how I feel about this wig, to be honest. It&#x27;s nice, came pretty much as pictured, and it looks real. The only thing I dislike about it is how the &amp;#34;curls&amp;#34; are. They&#x27;re really large curls that just look awful.</li>
    <li> This wig is fabulous ! , it comes exactly like it looks in the picture . I love it and the price was perfect. Will definitely order from the seller again .</li>
    <li> This wig is beautiful! I couldn&#x27;t find any reviews where people took pictures of the black wig, so I was worried that the color would be more of a very dark brown, but I was pleased to discover this morning that the wig was the exact shade of jet black I was looking for. It doesn&#x27;t look cheap or shiny, and any tangles are easily brushed out with the wig comb that came with it. I am so happy and excited to use this wig in my costumes!</li>
    <li> Love it already. It&#x27;s a bit bulky but it breathes very well. For a first time wig it&#x27;s a great choice. Especially for the price. It does tangle easy but the comb it comes with is great. If you keep the comb with you when you wear it nothing really goes wrong. With care it&#x27;ll last a while.</li>
    <li> Amazing for the price isn&#x27;t shiny and very full and no visible tracks I am 5 6 and it almost hits my waist. For the price it looks better the the 50 dollar Isis wig I just bought.</li>
    <li> fast ship -  looks good - nice wig for the cost - did cut the bangs a little bit more. the part worked out great.</li>
    <li> I really love the wig!!! Its soo ,fluffy, and curly just how i like it. The only thing i was afraid of is it being a different color other than the one i ordered, but it was what i wanted!! I love this wig</li>
    <li> I got the wrong wig I was excited to get this on and then it was the wrong one ugh</li>
    <li> This was my first time e purchasing hair from Amazon and i am a satisfied customer the hair is silky soft and long and I love the pink comb that comes with it I didn&#x27;t even have to buy a wig cap one was already giving thank you.</li>
    <li> Shipping and packaging was great. The hair looks like real human hair. I&#x27;m more than happy with the purchase and would encourage anyone to purchase the same product.</li>
    <li> tangles easily, and is a bitch to detangle.</li>
    <li> Great wig! Amazing quality! As described! I cannot ask for anything else! Tangles a little but it is ok.</li>
    <li> I purchased the wig for a snow white costume.</li>
    <li> I am in love with my wig. Absolutely beautiful! Will totally get more from this company.</li>
    <li> Horrible  tangles so much smells bad wig cap missing</li>
    <li> Beautiful, thick, and nicely contoured. I used this for a cosplay, and this wig looked far better than those purchased from some more expensive outlets.  I did trim the bangs a bit to keep them out of my eyes, and added some extra curls (low heat setting with some spray in conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushes very easily and does not have that super shiny wig effect.</li>
    <li> I need this wig for my Feferi (from homestuck) cosplay. It is prefect. I recompiled this wig 1000% to any cosplayers, and its cheep too. The shipping was super fast and on time. I a, very, very pleased.</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig. Easily adjustable. Tons of compliments!</li>
    <li> Definitely a good buy! It does however need some volume added, not what I would call &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s easier to do then thin out a crazy fluffed up wig.</li>
    <li> Really nice wig! Curls stay even after I brushed it. Little to no fiber shedding.</li>
    <li> So cool! Love it! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Real enough, no one could think this is a cheap wig.</li>
    <li> It is so soft and feels so real! People thought it was my real hair! Quit debating between different wigs and get this one! I am gonna get a blonde one too :)</li>
    <li> Amazing and natural looking wig. Needs a bit of styling but an amazing wig!</li>
    <li> This was nothing like the picture.. at all. I returned it.</li>
    <li> This wig looks very nice and hold up well, but does tangle a lot easier than other wigs. I highly suggest having detangling spray ready every time you are done wearing it!</li>
    <li> Bought for a halloween party. Fits well and looks absolutely like real hair.</li>
    <li> Looks just like real hair!</li>
    <li> Very nice wig but had to keep combing it because it was always getting tangled. But beside that it&#x27;s very nice &amp; looks real in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Very Manageable, I worn it on a cold windy night tooo!!! LOOKS AWESOME.</li>
    <li> Beautiful!  I was extremely pleased with the quality.</li>
    <li> Great wig for the price. Love the color. It was my first wig purchase and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I wish it had more volume on the crown because it looks flat. I usually wear it with a hat so it&#x27;s not as noticeable.</li>
    <li> Very pretty but the part is a little crooked.mi cover it with a hat or headband.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my Halloween costume!!</li>
    <li> Ok first off, fast shipping. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Pulled hair out, nicely packaged, soft, looks like real hair, super pretty!  However this is my first wig, for a minute I thought \\&quot;oh no bad idea..\\&quot; when I first put it on. The trick is though, you need to make it work with you. After I brushed/bobbypinned bangs and did my thing and fit it to my face shape, I LOVED IT!&lt;br /&gt;It looks so real and great i have 3 other friends (who&#x27;ve never bought wigs) buying some tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;Theres some minor issues but not really.&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty long, so it does get easily tangled. I fixed that by putting the bottom a little bit in a messy braid. Paired with a cute dress and cowboy boots, I was sad to take it off... I would definitely be buying the same and many more. The color is a pretty dark brown. Will post pictures. Some say these wigs fit small, idk all too much about that. Though I am a really petite filipino with I guess a small/average size head. It fit perfect. I wore it on the lowest setting though so it fit snug and moved with me naturally and i loved that.. not heavy at all either, nor thick. It was literally just like my natraul hair.  U can barely tell its a wig.. My friends were so amazed they showed their husbands and friends and they couldnt believe it was a wig, it looked so real and just fit me.&lt;br /&gt;Because it does tangle easy, it may not last long probably a month tops (not for sure as I just hot it) but at the price I wouldnt mind buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish on it, would be to last forever cause I absolutely love it!</li>
