    <li> He smell is exquisite and my beard has never had this shine. I am constantly receiving complements on my shine and the ol&#x27; lady loves how soft my beard is. Thank you beard brand!</li>
    <li> It works as a beard oil but the smell is to much. You can smell it on your beard for at least an hour and no one including myself really liked the scent.</li>
    <li> I love Beardbrand Spiced Citrus Beard Oil.  The scent is wonderful.  The name describes it well.  It is light enough to not be obnoxious but delightful enough to make me keep trying to catch a whiff of it.  After thoroughly applying to my beard and skin with my palm and fingers, I use my Kent comb to completely ensure its application.  My beard is shinier, behaves better and feels softer.  I use it with a small dollop of Suavecito Pomade to give my beard the structure I desire.  I recommend Beardbrand Spiced Citrus Beard Oil without reservation.  This simple video is a good guide on how to use beard oil:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;-o6PcAtsixA</li>
    <li> I like how the beard oil has softened, and smoothed out my beard.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is mild and pleasant. I found that I like to apply the beard oil at night,  and after a hot shower before bed.&lt;br /&gt;If I were to be negative about anything, it would be that if you have a white beard it does enhance darker hairs.&lt;br /&gt;But for me I like that it has enhanced the darker hairs in my white beard, so it&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this stuff and it is great!  His beard is softer and thicker, and the smell is really nice and not overly strong.  Highly recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> Fantastic scent with wonderful performance. Stops beardruff and keeps the whiskers soft.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best smelling beard oil I have used, and softens well also. Top notch product</li>
    <li> Great beard oil! Very pricey but great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle of Spiced Citrus now. The first two times I&#x27;ve ordered direct from Beardbrand, this time I ordered from Amazon. It still comes from them in WA state, and it&#x27;s still amazing stuff. This is the only beard oil I use now, it&#x27;s truly awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving it two stars because my husband used it only once because he said it smelled like pickles all day. It smelled pleasant to me but I&#x27;m not the one wearing it on my face. This was a very expensive purchase for a one time use.</li>
    <li> Love it! Would never have survived week 2 of the beard without Beardbrand oil.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the spicy scent.  A good purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smells like fall.</li>
    <li> Makes my beard look great, doesn&#x27;t make it heavy, and has a fantastic, subtle scent that lasts throughout the day and into the night when someone else might be appreciating it;)</li>
    <li> My wife likes it. I like it... it smells nice and keeps my beard and face from drying out. The only thing I don&#x27;t like... the bottle is too small!! I should have bought TWO.</li>
    <li> More expensive than on the company&#x27;s website, convenience of using amazon may not be worth it. The product itself is fine, 4/5 stars. Works into the beard well and has a subtle pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and leaves my beard nice and shiney</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend.  It arrived an entire five days earlier than expected and in excellent condition.  Although it&#x27;s a tiny bottle, a few drops go a long way.  He was satisfied with the gift, and it we both really enjoy the scent.  If you like the smell of oranges with cloves, or always wished you could smell like an orange grove, this is the beard oil for you.</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way. I&#x27;ve only used it for a week or so. I don&#x27;t have a full bushy beard, either.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware! This beard oil smells of cloves and citrus.  When worn, men will be jealous and women will swoon.  It is also known to cause sudden urges for mulled wine in the fall and winter months.  It can cause random women to ask if they can cuddle.  Just don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying lots more of this!</li>
    <li> This beard oil is made from Gods tear drops of joy ;! Shorty said she likes my beard and my haircut!!!</li>
    <li> i was expecting a less strong smell. the bottle is cute but is a bit messy when putting the oil on your hand.</li>
