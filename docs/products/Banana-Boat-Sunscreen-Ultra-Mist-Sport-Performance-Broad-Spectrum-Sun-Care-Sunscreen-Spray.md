<li> Little bit sticky</li>
<li> Protected my skin from sunburn as I expected but the filminess was too icky for me.</li>
<li> /&gt;Because of its ease of use, I am likely to use the spray for casual sun exposure, say bike riding or walking in partial shade, instead of using nothing because of the trouble involved with applying the cream variety.</li>
<li> Not sure why the difference.</li>
<li> I hardly ever had sun burns working as an aquatics director..</li>
<li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not meant to use continuous spray sunscreens, but this left a disgusting film on my skin that was difficult to wash off in the shower even after hours in s hot tub</li>
<li> Bad thing is sprays are hit and miss and cause blotches that are missed</li>
<li> Incredibly disappointed in this product.</li>

    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not meant to use continuous spray sunscreens, but this left a disgusting film on my skin that was difficult to wash off in the shower even after hours in s hot tub and then scrubbing with a body brush and soap. Protected my skin from sunburn as I expected but the filminess was too icky for me.</li>
    <li> Could have purchased at Wal-Mart but this saved me time. Perfect for what I needed.</li>
    <li> Worked well, convenient to use. The creams may be better protection but I never could apply it to everyone before they &amp;#34;ran off&amp;#34; to take the plunge into the pool. This was much more doable.</li>
    <li> We are an outside family and very cautious about UV rays.  We have found that the Banana Boat Spray Sunscreen works the best for our family.  It also a lot easier to reapply this to our two sons who are consistently in motion and don&#x27;t like to slow down for reapply.</li>
    <li> Banana Boat has long been my sunscreen of choice. Until now, I have used the cream product that comes in squeeze tubes. I use it when I go hiking or skiing in the mountains where the UV is more intense than at sea level. I used to use the SPF 30 cream, but moved up to SPF 50 when the 50 became available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Banana Boat SPF 30 spray is interesting. It is easier to apply than the cream. It goes on easily and quickly with the exception that you are warned not to spray it on your face. You are advised to spray it on your hands and then rub it on your face. That does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of its ease of use, I am likely to use the spray for casual sun exposure, say bike riding or walking in partial shade, instead of using nothing because of the trouble involved with applying the cream variety. Comparing the spray can with the tube, I see that the active ingredients are similar. The spray does appear to be effective.</li>
    <li> I ALWAYS REORDER THIS SUNSPRAY. THE SMELL IS GREAT AND IT PROTECTS WELL. IT SPRAYS WITH A FINE MIST. GREAT!</li>
    <li> I prefer the lotion sunscreens better as I think they work better and for a longer duration. That said, I keep my hair short and I bought this to spray my head after doing my hair so I don&#x27;t get a sunburn on my scalp. It works very well without leaving the white residue all over my hair like other spray sunscreens.</li>
    <li> Spray sunscreen is so wasteful but it is also so easy to apply.. I was an aquatics director for 10 years and this is all I used! If a user is following the directions, this stuff works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember all sunscreen has to be reapplied after toweling, after swimming (The chemicals break it down) (waterproof only means it will last the suggested time in water which is normally 90 mins) and after sweating..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as with any sunscreen all day isn&#x27;t really all day! If you don&#x27;t sweat, don&#x27;t swim, down use a towel, it will probably last all day.. But again, the above activities break it down and cause it to not work as well..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this stuff is great. I hardly ever had sun burns working as an aquatics director.. This is what kept me burn free and probably skin cancer free</li>
    <li> My wife, son, and I used this for a couple hours at the beach yesterday, applying it liberally and as often as recommended  (&amp;#62;80 minutes in water) and all have varying degrees of sunburn today. Incredibly disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> My son is very fair and we had gone to a pool party. I applied this spray 3 times to his back and shoulders over the course of the afternoon. He still got red. I will stick with the good old Walmart variety spf 50 spray.</li>
    <li> Reapplied several times, still ended up with a blistery sunburn!</li>
    <li> Great deal on these! Bad thing is sprays are hit and miss and cause blotches that are missed</li>
    <li> Good stuff, and easy to apply</li>
    <li> So nice not to have to deal with the sticky white stuff. It does exactly what it says it will do, which is to be non-greasy, easy to apply, and keep me from getting sunburned in this summer heat.</li>
    <li> Sprays on nicely and coverage is adequate</li>
    <li> Yes-  Great effective spray.  No weird smell. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Does what it needs to do.</li>
    <li> I used the 30 SPF Coppertone for 3 days without issue at the beach in Mexico, then switched to the Banana boat SPF 30 which should have been the same. My wife and I both ended up with spotty sun burn. Not sure why the difference. I am no longer going with Banana boat in the future.</li>
    <li> Little bit sticky but thats what it suppose to be.</li>
