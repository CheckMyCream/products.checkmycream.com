      <li>I really wanted a finger tip length veil with multiple layers, but didn&#x27;t want to spend several hundred dollars on one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> Just what the bride to be expected.</li>
    <li> Complete cheap piece of crap.  Looks ridiculously hideous..  I would be embarrassed to wear this at my wedding.  You get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful veil and it is worth the buy....the color is amazing and it matches my ivory dress perfectly. The beading looks amazing as well!</li>
    <li> I ordered this to go with my vintage style dress.  It was absolutely perfect! Great value for the money and the beading around the edges were a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Beautiful alternative to buying from David&#x27;s Bridal. Beading is wonderful and well made, stayed intact, and got many compliments!</li>
    <li> Beautiful veil! I have tried on quite a few at bridal shops from Texas to Virginia and it would take a trained eye to see the imperfections, if any, in this veil. The embellishments on the bottom are nice. No missing beads or inconsistencies. The scalloping is a nice touch as well. The comb is a little flat and wide but stays put. I did not feel that it looked too poofy on the top and I tried it several different ways. I definitely recommend this veil! Wish I could post a picture!</li>

    <li> This is my first amazon review. I think every bride has some purchases she regrets, and others she is ridiculously pleased and proud of.

I really wanted a finger tip length veil with multiple layers, but didn&#x27;t want to spend several hundred dollars on one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This more than fit the bill - the detail along the edge is beautiful, the layers are thoughtfully constructed so you can have the top one cover your face as you walk down the aisle if you&#x27;d like, and it hangs beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: it comes very wrinkled, but looks like a new product after you leave it in the bathroom while you shower.

    <li> This veil is actually more beautiful than I had expected. Sent in s timely manner and packaged well. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> The girl was good for the price but comb was set backwards ... Just had to flex it the opposite direction</li>
    <li> This was perfect for my daughters wedding and the price was awesome.  All the other veil&lt;br /&gt;were too high and did not look as good as this one.  What a bargain and it went beautiful&lt;br /&gt;with her dress.</li>
    <li> It was great and goes well with my attire.  Looks expensive and does the job.  I recommend it those who do not want to pay a lot of money on this itme.</li>
    <li> The veil was gorgeous, I also glad I listened the the reviews. The edging was nicely done and not at all tacky. Definitely worth the money.</li>
