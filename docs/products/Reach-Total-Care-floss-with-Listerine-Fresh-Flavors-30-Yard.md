### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product!  </li>
      <li>Having said all of that, I think this is the best floss that I have ever used.</li>
      <li>This is the best and easiest way to floss.  </li>
      <li>all the best is that this has some flex in it as in stretch.</li>
      <li>I had been using Reach mint waxed floss, which I was very happy with, so I thought I would try this one.</li>
      <li>Great stretchy unbreakable floss,  gets between teeth with ease.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for helping keep stains between teeth away.</li>
      <li>great product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like to try more brands though because I&#x27;m not convinced that it is the best on the market.</li>
      <li>It works best for our teeth, does not break easily, and gets into the gums well.</li>
      <li>This leads to superior performance.</li>
      <li>They wraped really well-Sender is great!!</li>
      <li>and hopefully it&#x27;s effective.  </li>
      <li>Everyone is selling the Glide kind</li>
      <li>Reach&#x27;s superior performance makes it worthwhile.</li>
      <li>It has a nice flavor too.</li>
      <li>This is the absolute best dental floss I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I feel I get a much more effective flossing</li>
      <li>so far the best i have tried out of 12</li>
      <li>I ended up using quite a bit more of that floss because of all of the tearing.</li>
      <li>Love this floss...</li>
      <li>I am glad I found it here.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>Thus, it covers more surface area and is easier to hold.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My teeth look pretty good now.  </li>
      <li>Despite my hatred of my last nylon floss, I did find that it did a good job of scrubbing between my teeth</li>
      <li>It works great, and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s on Amazon because it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
      <li>This is our favorite floss, and we cannot find it anywhere where we live.</li>
      <li>I got a sample at a dental cleaning and don&#x27;t want to use any other kind!</li>
      <li>Nice to use once a week to keep things white.  </li>
      <li>exactly right or keep changing your grip.</li>
      <li>The rough surface is also better at material removal than smooth waxed</li>
      <li>Reach Total Care floss, on the other hand, is very good.</li>
      <li>hard to find at Walgreen&#x27;s, so happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>This may not seem like much at first, but the stretchyness means that you do not have to get the length</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Reach floss for years and the Total Care type is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I floss regularly, but now I actually enjoy it and whitening between teeth</li>
      <li>We all know how much we want to avoid &#x27;scraping&#x27; during cleanings.</li>
      <li>I like it for the same primary reason</li>
      <li>This flat ribbon type floss is excellent for getting between tight teeth or deep between tooth and gum.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, it makes flossing go faster, but it can cause some bleeding if you&#x27;re not a regular flosser.</li>
      <li>Reach Total Care Floss costs more than standard dental flosses.</li>
      <li>Unique and certainly a  improvement to other choices</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think that the ridges are really capable of doing the same.</li>
      <li>The old floss was from a discount store and it frayed, got stuck between my teeth and caused a lot of cuts.</li>
      <li>I found it a little bit harder to control because it is so springy that it snaps really quickly between your teeth.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> so far the best i have tried out of 12</li>
    <li> I had been using Reach mint waxed floss, which I was very happy with, so I thought I would try this one. I like it for the same primary reason - it&#x27;s not slippery at all. This one is extra stretchy too, which helps when trying to get into tight places. I give it 4 stars because I&#x27;m not sure the ribbon picks up as much as the thread floss.</li>
    <li> Great stretchy unbreakable floss,  gets between teeth with ease.  I floss regularly, but now I actually enjoy it and whitening between teeth is a plus. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this floss in any of our stores around here. Everyone is selling the Glide kind but it doesn&#x27;t work well and even my hygienist notices the difference. I do floss every night.</li>
    <li> Reach Floss is different from other flosses in several key characteristics. This leads to superior performance. It is a ribbon not a thread. Thus, it covers more surface area and is easier to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The surface is rough, i.e. the microgrooves, also making it easier to hold. The rough surface is also better at material removal than smooth waxed surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it stretches. This may not seem like much at first, but the stretchyness means that you do not have to get the length exactly right or keep changing your grip. The length adjusts to your need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one downside: the cost. Reach Total Care Floss costs more than standard dental flosses. However, it is competitive with Oral-B Floss Tape. Reach&#x27;s superior performance makes it worthwhile.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It is the only flossI can get between my teeth without shedding. I hate that the company is no longer making it. without</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best dental floss I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s great for helping keep stains between teeth away. We all know how much we want to avoid &#x27;scraping&#x27; during cleanings.</li>
    <li> This is the best and easiest way to floss.  This floss doesn&#x27;t break or shred, yet it reaches between my teeth and does a proper job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Reach floss for years and the Total Care type is my favorite.</li>
    <li> great product especially if you have dental work like veneers because it stretches. So you can reach into those tight spaces that ordinary floss would miss.  I feel I get a much more effective flossing</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  They wraped really well-Sender is great!!</li>
    <li> A bit stretchy. I have tried to use whitening floss every day for 10 years now.&lt;br /&gt;Scored for $2 a pack at big lots yesterday! Bought several and will buy again!</li>
    <li> this is the only floss that doesn&#x27;t shred and I have tried them all the best is that this has some flex in it as in stretch. Unique and certainly a  improvement to other choices</li>
    <li> hard to find at Walgreen&#x27;s, so happy to find it on Amazon.  This flat ribbon type floss is excellent for getting between tight teeth or deep between tooth and gum.</li>
    <li> Nice to use once a week to keep things white.  Just learned about the product and hopefully it&#x27;s effective.  My teeth look pretty good now.  Just trying to keep up!</li>
    <li> My motivation to floss probably has a lot to do with the floss I have on hand. The old floss was from a discount store and it frayed, got stuck between my teeth and caused a lot of cuts. I ended up using quite a bit more of that floss because of all of the tearing. Reach Total Care floss, on the other hand, is very good. Since it isn&#x27;t a nylon floss, there is no fraying or breaking and it hasn&#x27;t gotten stuck between my teeth. It has a nice flavor too. There are a couple of draw backs, however. It&#x27;s wide, so even though it is super thin, it can double over itself, which can make it uncomfortably thick. I found it a little bit harder to control because it is so springy that it snaps really quickly between your teeth. That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, it makes flossing go faster, but it can cause some bleeding if you&#x27;re not a regular flosser. I&#x27;m not sure that the ridges do much compared to the fibers in nylon floss. Despite my hatred of my last nylon floss, I did find that it did a good job of scrubbing between my teeth and I don&#x27;t think that the ridges are really capable of doing the same. Having said all of that, I think this is the best floss that I have ever used. I&#x27;d like to try more brands though because I&#x27;m not convinced that it is the best on the market.</li>
    <li> My teeth are extremely close together, so my dentist recommended I use this floss since it stretches in a way other kinds don&#x27;t. It works great, and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s on Amazon because it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> This is our favorite floss, and we cannot find it anywhere where we live. Somehow the stores in our area stopped handling it. It works best for our teeth, does not break easily, and gets into the gums well. I am glad I found it here.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like trying to floss with a rubber band.  I&#x27;ll stick with Glide.</li>
    <li> Love this floss...Ordered on line because I can&#x27;t find it in the stores! Either it is sold out or stores don&#x27;t sell it!  I got a sample at a dental cleaning and don&#x27;t want to use any other kind!</li>
