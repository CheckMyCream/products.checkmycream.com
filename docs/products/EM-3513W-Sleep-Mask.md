<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Absolutely love it!  Thank you! Love that there is no Velcro to get stuck in my hair or pillow!</li>
    <li> Light sneaks in under the bottom because of the nose area. If it were less stiff it might form to that area better.</li>
    <li> Works wonders. Blocks out the light perfectly. Was very easy to adjust to my head size. Also very comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> The sleep mask is very comfortable.  No issues with black fading on pillows.  Concave so your eyes can open with the mask on .  I don&#x27;t wear it in the daytime so I can&#x27;t attest to no light leakage.  I highly recommend this mask.</li>
    <li> I had some difficulty getting used to the mask, but now I have no trouble. I was staying in a hotel with family, some of which snored and one that insisted on a night light, and I wore my mask and ear plugs and sleep very well. I love that my eyelashes do not touch the mask. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love the buckle closure.  Not great for side sleeping because the contouring is rather stiff.  I like it well enough to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I love it. It is comfortable and does a great job of blocking out the light</li>
    <li> Love this! I definitely sleep better!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a light sleeper and I need both complete darkness and absolute quiet in order to fall asleep in the first place. I&#x27;ve tried other sleep masks but they&#x27;re either uncomfortably snug on my face or so loose-fitting that the mask falls off sometime during the night. So, I&#x27;d kinda given up on the idea of sleep masks before trying this one. But this mask has a hollowed out area that gives your eyes more space to &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34; while still blocking out light. It&#x27;s also got an adjustable strap and is so ultra comfortable that I forget I&#x27;m even wearing it. And I really can shut out the world.  It&#x27;s the first sleep mask I&#x27;ve been able to wear on a nightly basis. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get my hands on this product . I liked the design, the box, and purple ear plugs that the mask came with. But this here are my issues with it. I work nights, so I purchased this mask to help me fight the daylight when I sleep. Unfortunately this sleep mask doesn&#x27;t block all the light for me. For that reason, I would never be able to use it on a plane. The other reason the mask didn&#x27;t work for me was because I am a stomach sleeper and I move a lot . The mask is really stiff and when I try to lay on my belly, the mask is all I can think about. After trying to use it twice, I decided I might as well try to cover my head with sheets.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 3 stars because the mask is obviously working for others and I like the idea of it and the design, but the bottom line, it doesn&#x27;t work for me .</li>
    <li> I got this gift for my cousin and she LOVES IT!</li>
    <li> Great, comfortable pure darkness. I&#x27;ve worn it now for a month and it is by far the most comfortable eye mask I have ever worn. And I&#x27;ve worn eye masks for ten plus years.</li>
    <li> Arrived right when expected! Very lightweight. There&#x27;s a slight bit of light that comes in from below but not enough to really matter. I can open my eyes completely and wear this for a nap without worrying about my mascara smudging. Also, being the femme that I am, it is pretty! So some of us chicks that&#x27;s a big deal. ;)</li>
    <li> I do wish these came in petite, as the cover half my forehead.  However, these are SO good that I can sleep forever on the weekends without an alarm.  Completely keep the light and air out, don&#x27;t pinch my nose, and actually stay in place!</li>
    <li> This is the best sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever used. They are lightweight and give great coverage with comfort.</li>
    <li> Very soft and works well with my meditation journey</li>
    <li> This is an excellent mask. Better than expected. Love the adjustable strap not bulky. No stress, big head small head, no problem. It blocks all light, mask is soft. Well made. Looks like cotton material outside. interior has a little foam, all durable construction. It is comfortable. I am a side sleeper, it stays with you even when you move.&lt;br /&gt;Blocks all light. This is a girls best friend.&lt;br /&gt;So glad I bought this mask. 🌝</li>
    <li> Above average and does everything expected.</li>
    <li> I purchased the midnight roses color and it is beautiful, exactly as pictured.  The fabric is soft and smooth against your skin.  The fastener in the back is great!  No more velcro to pull your hair out!  It is easily adjustable and rests securely to your forehead.  I was especially drawn to this style because of the contouring around the eyes which is great for long eye lashes.  You can rest easy knowing you won&#x27;t wake up with mashed lashes!  The contoured area is nicely padded and does not leave any marks on your face.  I sleep in all different positions and have not found this to be an issue while wearing the mask; it does not shift or slide.  There is a very tiny sliver of light that sneaks in, but ideally your eyes are CLOSED when you sleep so this really shouldn&#x27;t be a reason to not buy it.  The included ear plugs are legit noise-canceling.  I feel like I have my Bose headset on when I&#x27;m wearing them!  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Best sleepmask ever!  The adjustable strap does not get caught in your hair like other velcro straps. Eye mask has rounded cups over eye so there is no pressure on the eyelid and no marks on your face in the morning.  Mine has held up to several washings in the machine but I do not put it in the dryer.  Floral pattern is pretty, comes with two sets of earplugs that are soft and comfortable to wear all night long.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable.  Does not press on my eye lids.  The design has a cup shape to it that prevents it from pressing on your eye lids.  Does a good job of keeping the light out.</li>
    <li> This mask is very comfortable and has a great fit!  No light around the bridge of the nose area....total darkness, finally!!!</li>
    <li> These are very nice.  There are reliefs on the inside of the eyes that allows you to open your eyes when wearing it making it more comfortable while sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint the clasp in the back.  When I ordered this product I thought it had safety release, but it does not.  The clasp in the back requires manual release.</li>
    <li> I love this eye mask! I&#x27;ve never been fond of eye masks, but this one is very comfortable and has a nice fit, without feeling tight. Initially I got it so I can sleep while the hubby is watching tv. I use it all the time now. I love that it doesn&#x27;t touch your eyelids. Material is very soft.</li>
    <li> Love this mask! I need darkness, and this mask blocks all the light. It&#x27;s super comfortable,  doesn&#x27;t squish your lashes, and doesn&#x27;t get caught in your hair!</li>
    <li> Great it does now crush my eyelids and I get great shut eye when sleeping in foreign places.. Nice padding foam feelings.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS. I am the lady snoring loudly in the airport during my layover 😜</li>
    <li> very cute design and very comfortable to sleep in! Does not mess up my make up when i just need a short nap because of the raised eye coverage. Gives me a much better sleep than I used to have because I am a late sleeper and the sun coming in through the very thin curtain always used to wake me up, but not anymore. great product! Only reason it isn&#x27;t getting 5 stars is because some very insignificant light does come in through the nose bridge because it isn&#x27;t a perfect fit to my nose. It&#x27;s so insignificant it doesn&#x27;t impact my good sleep but I don&#x27;t know if it would bother others.</li>
    <li> Cutest eye mask! I really like the feel of this eye mask, I bought it to take the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; way of sleeping throughout the day. I work a mix of evening and night shifts in the hospital and when I come home around 7 in the morning, all I want to do is sleep. This mask helps out a whole lot. It doesn&#x27;t push down on my eyes like other eye masks, it has this type of soft cushion around your eye sockets but keeps your eyes pressure free. I also like the shape of it, I have an Asian shaped face and this actually looks attractive unlike other masks I&#x27;ve tried. Bonus: it comes with 2 little cute earplugs, kind of like the ones I use at the shooting range, but in purple. The design is beautiful also, I love roses. Overall this face mask for women looks like ROYALTY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taken my time and agonized over how many stars to give this mask.&lt;br /&gt;I sleep so much better when I wear a mask, but it is very hard to find a good one.&lt;br /&gt;This one is better than most, but not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Pro - The clip closure doesn&#x27;t rip out your hair like Velcro closures do.&lt;br /&gt;Con - The clip is really, really hard to open, but if you&#x27;re like me you won&#x27;t really need it because you&#x27;ll just slip the mask on and off once you have the length of the strap where it&#x27;s most comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Pro - It&#x27;s made of material that is stiff enough that it doesn&#x27;t rub your eyes like traditional satin masks&lt;br /&gt;Con - The material is really stiff. The first time I wore this mask I ended up with deep dents in my forehead and cheeks. It has since softened up, which is good. The nose piece is also way too narrow for me, so it often feels like it&#x27;s pinching my nose shut. Whether this would bother someone else depends on the shape of your face, but either way it does seem to get better as the mask softens.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is the best mask I&#x27;ve found to date, so I highly recommend it, but I do still dream of the perfect sleep mask, which I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve made yet...</li>
    <li> EDIT: Update Review:  I really liked this mask at first, but the quality is sorta crap.  In a couple months of using it, the inner lining has come off of most of it, so it is a like a separate piece I have to situate everytime I put it on.  The only reason I don&#x27;t completely rip it off is because the underneath part is too scratchy.  The strap also stretched (and I have a TINY head, so its not like I was wearing it tight in the first place), so now it is almost always off in the morning, since it was already on the tightest setting.  For a $5 sleep mask, I&#x27;d expect all these things...but this one was stupid expensive for the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a super comfy, not to mention beautiful eye mask.  If it is positioned just right, it is completely black out.  Sometimes there is a tiny sliver of light by my nose...but I also just have a pointy nose, so eye masks never fit me just right.  It is surprisingly easy for side sleeping, too.  The only reason for the 4/5 stars is the position of the strap ends up rubbing on my ear weird where the adjusting piece is.  I think straps are an issue on most sleep masks, though.  Love that i can comfortably open my eyes in this!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for a great price.  Quality eye masks can be difficult to find.</li>
    <li> I love this! So worth the money. I can&#x27;t stand things on my eyes but the way it contours over the eyes is amazing!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been so pleased with this eye mask that I&#x27;ve ordered more for travel and as gifts. I was not sure abut trying this style. I thought it would feel stiff compared to a plush one that I had but this is lighter and allows plenty of room for blinking (I have big eyes). I&#x27;ve been using this eye mask for 3 months and I&#x27;m thrilled with how comfortable it is.</li>
    <li> Once i got the ear plugs adjusted right they worked great. I like the pretty designs of the masks</li>
    <li> perfect for lash extensions</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. Completely comfortable and as close as you can get to unnoticed when sleeping. I have not had to use an eye mask regularly prior to a recent move and have tried quite a few. This is the only one I can get a great night sleep with.</li>
    <li> Product works great without putting pressure on the eyes.</li>
    <li> Very good design.  The snap closure design is so much better than the velcro designs.</li>
    <li> My Fella bought me this.  He enjoys watching TV at bedtime.  It blocks all light which is great!  What I have found is it makes my face hot.  Honestly not a big deal.  I usually remove it from my face at some point during the night while sleeping anyway.  It is light weight and comfortable.  The best thing was the ear plugs that came with it.  My Fella also snores.  These ear plugs are way better than the ones from Rite Aid!</li>
    <li> High quality.  Very comfortable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great mask but it&#x27;s red not purple.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using an eye mask for sleeping for many years and know a great deal about what features I find necessary in order to get a good night’s sleep. I could see from the description that this mask by Drift To Sleep had all the features I required. As a result, I was eager to try it when the manufacturer contacted me offering a free sample in exchange for an honest review. Over the last five years, I’ve reviewed many different types and brands of eye masks, but I’ve always reverted back to using masks that have at least these four essential features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• It’s constructed of lightweight molded foam covered on the outside with a poly fabric;&lt;br /&gt;• The foam contains large eyecups so my eyelids can blink or move (in REM sleep) without touching any part of the mask;&lt;br /&gt;• The foam contains a cutout for the bridge of my nose so no light can seep in around my nose;&lt;br /&gt;• It has an adjustable approximately three-quarter-inch-wide elastic strap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without these four features, a mask will not work ideally for me to keep the light out and make me (mostly) forget that I’m wearing a sleep mask. Before I discovered that I needed these four features, I’d tried just about all the different type of eye masks there are. I probably have over two-dozen unused eye masks in my bedside table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this Drift To Sleep mask more than the current mask I was using (that one was a Good Night Sleep Mask purchased from Magellan’s, the travel goods company) is that this mask has a slightly thinner profile of foam around the eyecups. The eyecups are the same size on both brands, but the Drift To Sleep mask has a slightly slimmer frame of foam all around. As a result, there is less foam actually resting on my forehead and cheeks. It might seem like a small thing, but it makes a big difference, especially in the hot weather when the eye mask can become a bit too warm and actually cause the skin under the mask to sweat. The Drift To Sleep mask has the same advantage in the bridge-of-the-nose cutout. i.e., it is less bulky than the Magellan’s brand nose cup. Both shut the light out, but the Drift To Sleep mask shuts out the light with less foam touching the skin and therefore is more comfortable in warm weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely the best sleep mask I’ve tried so far! I plan to use it from now on...unless, of course, I find another that I like even better. I’m hoping that some manufacturer will come up with flexible molded-eye-and-nose-pockets product that is lightweight and will allow for air circulation against the skin on hot nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know from past experience with these types of masks can occasionally be washed by hand and reused for at least 12 to 18 months. By then, you’ll probably want to get a new one because the foam will start to get old (and full of dead skin and face oils despite the washing) and the adhesive holding the fabric covering in place may have worn off in spots. Nothing lasts forever under daily use and to get one to two years out of an item like this seems appropriate to me. Silk eye masks can last a long time and they are very cool in summer, but they have no eyecups, which are essential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sleep mask would make a nice small gift for any group holiday gift exchange party. In particular, it’s a nice idea to give the gift of a good night’s sleep; it is a gift that people will remember; and it comes in a lovely box that needs nothing but a bow to make it special.ame advantage in the bridge-of-the-nose cutout. i.e., it is less bulky than the Magellan’s brand nose cup.

    <li> Love, Love, Love it!  Comfortable, adjustable - perfect.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of purchasing this as I have spent a lot of money on failed attempts to have a restful night.  After reading the reviews over and over again and sitting on my decision for a couple of weeks, I finally caved in.  I&#x27;m SO glad I did!  I needed both the mask and the earplugs, and both of them work beyond my expectations.  The mask is so comfortable.  I&#x27;ve never worn one for a full night because I am super uncomfortable with things on my head and eyes.  This mask is lightweight, but secure.  The band doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, and I actually usually sleep with the elastic over my ears-as it is more comfortable for me.  As soon as it goes on, it&#x27;s lights out for my vision.  I understand some other reviewers when they say that light still peeps in.  This only happens to me IF I have the mask placed too high/too low on my nose.  I position it on my face by grabbing it by the notch that goes on the bridge of my nose, and find the placement that is just right for me.  When I do this, I cannot see any light while looking up or down, side to side.  Everything is black, yet I do not feel restricted with something covering my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the earplugs, I thought they were just going to be a gimmicky &amp;#34;add in&amp;#34;.  I almost threw them away straight from the box.  I&#x27;m so thankful I didn&#x27;t.  A little background about my needs.... My husband is a Navy helicopter mechanic, and let&#x27;s just say his hearing absolutely awful.  As an example, my comfortable tv volume is a 7, where his &amp;#34;compromise&amp;#34; volume is a 21.  And he cannot fall asleep without the tv on.  He also has sleep apnea and at times his snoring is unbearable.  I&#x27;ve tried hardcore, best of the best earplugs of all shapes and sizes.  The most I&#x27;ve ever gotten out of them was a muffled snore or tv show, none actually gave me relief.  My ears are also sensitive, with small openings.  After using these earplugs he has either magically stopped snoring and kept the tv off..... or......  I found some miracle earplugs.  I just wish I knew how to purchase more because I have a tendency to lose things-or my dogs make them disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only concern I have (which is by no means a gripe about the product or a complaint on it&#x27;s design effectiveness) is I can actually sleep now.  With no noise or lights, it&#x27;s very easy for me to sleep in.  They also make it difficult for me to want to get out of bed for the day!  I love, love LOVE my purchase and would have expected (and paid) a much higher price for the quality and value.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter and she loves it!</li>
    <li> June 9 is when I got this item..The fabric on top... the thread is peeling off..soon it isn&#x27;t even going to have the picture on it and that&#x27;s what I paid for was the picture...the girly thing.... So I&#x27;m super disappointed... it does keep the light out for most part... the nose area shines in some...&lt;br /&gt;The headband that keeps it on, rubs the top of your ear raw..</li>
    <li> I wish you would use real images like Bedtime Bliss does. The design on this makes me dizzy just looking at it and does not give a realistic view of what the mask actually fits like.</li>
    <li> I love it. Very comfortable and effective. I would recommend this</li>
    <li> This is the second mask I have gotten.  I loved the first one so when I needed a second I re-ordered.  Great eye mask!</li>
    <li> I cannot keep this on my head.  I go to sleep with it on and wake up with it off when I need it the most from the morning sun!  I have it set to the tightest level and still it won&#x27;t stay on.  I also sleep mostly on my left side and I find around the side of my eye hurts when I wake up in the middle of the night so I pull it back on but try to adjust it.  It did work fine on the airplane, which is why I bought it in the first place.  My makeup still got a little smudged but not too bad.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot. Good fit at the nose and the buckle closure is easier to adjust than velcro. Convenient carrying case for the earplugs too.</li>
    <li> this is a comfortable mask, and nice bonus of the ear plugs, was sleeping in a group retreat situation and needed both,&lt;br /&gt;like the room for eyelashes inside, one can blink comfortably without removing mask, it keeps all the light out and the&lt;br /&gt;adjustable strap made for comfort and didn&#x27;t destroy my hair</li>
    <li> Should have bought this sleep-mask years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable how effective this is.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I work shift work and need a good sleep-make to help me sleep during the day time. This mask is great! It is very comfortable if you are used to contoured masks. It does let a little light in around the nose but that doesn&#x27;t bother me much as I also have black out shades. I will definitely use this company again when I purchase another sleep mask.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is very cushiony and comfortable around the nose and eye area. It seems to help me fall asleep more easily; however, for some reason it ALWAYS ends up coming off at some point while I am sleeping. I have tried adjusting it but it never stays on the whole night, like I ripped it off during my sleep. I would like this more if it actually stayed on the whole time.</li>
    <li> I work night shift and this works awesome!!! I love love this mask! Will order more for my hubby and kids.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both work nights. We have black-out curtains AND blankets over both windows in the bedroom, however sometimes the morning sun finds its way in. My husband isn&#x27;t as sensitive to the light as I am but when I get up to plug the cracks, I end up waking him. I got these hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to get up. First couple of times took a bit of getting used to and I wasn&#x27;t sure I could sleep with them. Now I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t think of getting these sooner. Very comfortable. They don&#x27;t shift around when I move and the adjustable band doesn&#x27;t get tangled in my long hair or feel tight on my head. Now, if I can just get my retired neighbor to not mow his yard or use his power tools at 8am........</li>
    <li> Helps but on the heavy side for me</li>
    <li> Pretty mask and it completely blocks out the light. Perfect for a restful sleep.  Would make a great gift for someone who travels frequently.</li>
    <li> Let me start by explaining the reason for giving 4 starts instead of 5, this mask does not block 100% of the light.  Now for me, I like that.  I think that that level of darkness would freak me out a bit, and it would not allow a bit of light creep to help wake me up in the morning.  The company could save this issue if they would add just a bit of some sort of flexible wire in the bridge section so that it could be molded to each individual nose shape.&lt;br /&gt;I use this at night in a room that I cannot get dark enough for it to feel like nighttime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take some getting used to, this sleeping with something strapped to your face, but this mask is flexible and comfortable, I have not pulled it off in my sleep and it has not disturbed my sleep, for the first few days though it did not improve my sleep.  On about my 3rd night of sleeping in the mask, it did start to significantly improve my sleep quality, and I am very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The act of actually purchasing it and receiving it was painless and quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very comfy&amp; doesnt pull hair.stays put &amp; light stays out and love that it has indentions in eye holes. Pretty design&lt;br /&gt;Wud recomend it.</li>
    <li> I bought the black one, with the velcro strap, and liked it.  I then got this one -- both are comfortable, block the light very well, don&#x27;t shift when I spin around in the bed, and don&#x27;t make the makeup I unwisely sleep in look any wilder than it did when I climbed into bed.  I do prefer the strap design on this model, as it doesn&#x27;t catch my hair like the velcro one can, and I think it&#x27;s also a bit lower profile than the velcro (which is hooks, loops, and two layers of the substantial elastic).  Once I pair these with the earplugs, plane patrons will have to actually spill things on me to disturb my travel.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier now that i&#x27;ve found the perfect sleep mask. The fabric is comfortable and lightweight so you don&#x27;t really feel it on your face, plus it provides a complete blockage of light. The slightly raised contours take all the pressure off your eyes so you don&#x27;t get the irritation of traditional masks that lay flat against your eyes. There&#x27;s also an adjustable strap for the perfect fit. I&#x27;m a frequent traveler as well as a very light sleeper and I&#x27;ve finally found the best mask for comfortable sleep. Another bonus is that the unique design won&#x27;t interfere with eye makeup or creams. Great value for the price too.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable fit. Mask stays on all night and blocks any light.</li>
