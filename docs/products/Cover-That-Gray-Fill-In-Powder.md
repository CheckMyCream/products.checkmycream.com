### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great !!</li>
      <li>excellent product.</li>
      <li>This is a great product.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great -</li>
      <li>Does not stain, wash off easily and best of all, undetectable.</li>
      <li>It lasts well, and the lower price also makes it more attractive.</li>
      <li>very pleased.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
      <li>which is why some people don&#x27;t find it to be that effective in covering the gray.</li>
      <li>Very easy to touch up &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; spots in hair do.</li>
      <li>It works ok..</li>
      <li>You have to use more product.  </li>
      <li>When applied it looks more like DUST than hair coloring.</li>
      <li>A great product that is reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>I love it and will be purchasing again soon.  </li>
      <li>It is more of a light charcoal gray.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and stay in until you wash your hair.  </li>
      <li>Just okay, nothing special.</li>
      <li>When I received the package it looked fine.</li>
      <li>You will have the appearance of a full head of hair.  </li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with this product and it only costs a quarter of what GHD does.</li>
      <li>this makes me feel so much more confident i have fine black hair and in the winter</li>
      <li>I had been using Wow, which costs much more than this product.</li>
      <li>and I can honestly say that Claudia Stevens product is easier to use and the coverage is the same.  </li>
      <li>I just sort of combine it and the result is the right color.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and no mess.  </li>
      <li>I did not have to use very much.</li>
      <li>I really like it - it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do - cover my gray!  </li>
      <li>I am 38 year female with thinning hair at the top.</li>
      <li>I actually like this product better.</li>
      <li>who knows how many were left in my hair.</li>
      <li>Stays on fine until my next washing.</li>
      <li>hahaha  </li>
      <li>Thanks AAA+++</li>
      <li>I have so much confidence now.  </li>
      <li>Very displeased.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as GHD, but its better than nothing!</li>
      <li>I usually used Joan Rivers Great Hair day, but it always seems to be out of stock, especially the brunette.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;re actually better off getting black eyeshadow to use as a cover.</li>
      <li>The photo is misleading, and perhaps of an older version.</li>
      <li>it looks and feels like high quality eye powder, and the brush that comes with it works well to push the product into my scalp and roots.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but with this it makes me look and feel like i have nice thick hair its a must have in my book</li>
      <li>I ordered the color black and when I applied it too the area that needed  too be filled in which was near the Tempe area</li>
      <li>The dual color palette surprised me as there was no instruction on how to use it.</li>
      <li>It appeared to be old.</li>
      <li>My hair had the appearance of fullness; and it looked so natural even up close.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more expensive, but worth it.</li>
      <li>charcoal gray NOT BLACK.  </li>
      <li>I only dabbed a little bit to the areas where the light hits my scalp and shows through.</li>
      <li>The powder is fine but the brush is bad because the bristles come off easily</li>
      <li>when applying, it comes right off with a little lotion and a towel.</li>

<li> This product not only covers the grey it also camoflauges the bald areas due to hair  Loss people with lupus may experience.</li>

<li> The dark brown/black filler is only BLACK.</li>

<li> Not worth the money.  </li>

<li> A waste of my money.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve received the product recently, gave it a quick try, it was a bit disappointing, I have a black hair by using the black powder it gave my hair a weird gray-ish black matte look, I do like the fact that it covers my thinning hair spots but up close it looks fake.</li>
<li> I have white roots and color my hair dark black, and desperately needed a fill-in powder that would keep me from looking like Cruella DeVil in between hair colorings.</li>
<li> when I opened it the inside was all broken up it made a mess everywhere.</li>
<li> It look ridiculous on my hair.  </li>
<li> Claudia Stevens must be color blind to not know the difference between charcoal gray and BLACK.  </li>
<li> When I opened the box with the powder it was all cracked, broken and not for use.</li>
<li> False advertising.</li>
<li> It was very frustrating and hard to get cleaned up.</li>
<li> I prefer Joan Rivers GHD, but its getting expensive.  </li>
<li> I was extremely disappointed with this item.</li>
<li> VERY DISAPPOINTED!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The powder is fine but the brush is bad because the bristles come off easily I am not sure it will last till the end of life of the powder.</li>
    <li> I have thinning areas on my scalp and this product is a miracle.  Easy to use and no mess.  Just brush the powder on the scalp and style.  You will have the appearance of a full head of hair.  I have so much confidence now.  A great product that is reasonably priced.  I bought another product that promised the same results for $50.00 and I can honestly say that Claudia Stevens product is easier to use and the coverage is the same.  I will not buy anything else but Claudia Stevens.</li>
    <li> excellent product. very pleased.</li>
    <li> I had been using Wow, which costs much more than this product. I actually like this product better. The dual color palette surprised me as there was no instruction on how to use it. I just sort of combine it and the result is the right color. It lasts well, and the lower price also makes it more attractive.</li>
    <li> Great !! That&#x27;s what I want it !! Thanks AAA+++</li>
    <li> when I opened it the inside was all broken up it made a mess everywhere. It was very frustrating and hard to get cleaned up.</li>
    <li> I really like it - it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do - cover my gray!  The only downside would be the brush, the bristles keep coming out - like half way, then I have to pull them out .... who knows how many were left in my hair. hahaha  But I do like it, and will order again.</li>
    <li> I have white roots and color my hair dark black, and desperately needed a fill-in powder that would keep me from looking like Cruella DeVil in between hair colorings. This stuff is great - it looks and feels like high quality eye powder, and the brush that comes with it works well to push the product into my scalp and roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder stays put, and if I make a mistake an get a little on my forehead when applying, it comes right off with a little lotion and a towel. I have gone 2-3 days without shampooing, and the powder does not rub off on my pillow. It lasts a long time, too. I will order it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This works quite well on my balding spots as a fill-in powder. Stays on fine until my next washing. I don&#x27;t feel self-conscious about going out now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received the product recently, gave it a quick try, it was a bit disappointing, I have a black hair by using the black powder it gave my hair a weird gray-ish black matte look, I do like the fact that it covers my thinning hair spots but up close it looks fake.</li>
    <li> this makes me feel so much more confident i have fine black hair and in the winter my scalp is so white that i look bald but with this it makes me look and feel like i have nice thick hair its a must have in my book</li>
    <li> It had to be blended, two different colors.  It ony covered a tiny area, had to keep putting it on to cover a part.</li>
    <li> NOT as advertised in the photo! The dark brown/black filler is only BLACK. The photo is misleading, and perhaps of an older version.</li>
    <li> The color didn&#x27;t give me coverage.  The color in the case actually was not what I got when I applied it.</li>
    <li> In the picture of the product, it shows two colors that you can blend and mix. When I received the product at my home, it was just a dark black color. False advertising.</li>
    <li> I usually used Joan Rivers Great Hair day, but it always seems to be out of stock, especially the brunette.  Two colors come in the Claudia stevens brand.  It works ok..I blend the two colors together.  It seems to stay in, rubs off on pillow occasionally.  Its seems to stay when I just rinse my hair with water, without shampooing.  I prefer Joan Rivers GHD, but its getting expensive.  This works well, inexpensive. doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as GHD, but its better than nothing!</li>
    <li> Just okay, nothing special.</li>
    <li> Very easy to touch up &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; spots in hair do. Does not stain, wash off easily and best of all, undetectable.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I bought it at my local Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for 8.99. I did not know what to expect, but it did what it states it will do- fill in the thinning areas and makes it appear fuller. I am 38 year female with thinning hair at the top. When I opened the product, it had a dull/matte look to it and it also looked lighter than what one would think a med/dark brown color should look like. But when I began to apply, I was amazed- I only dabbed a little bit to the areas where the light hits my scalp and shows through. I did not have to use very much. My hair had the appearance of fullness; and it looked so natural even up close. I don&#x27;t think this product is meant to hide gray roots as it is to hide thinning areas of the scalp- which is why some people don&#x27;t find it to be that effective in covering the gray. I have never tried Joan Rivers GHD- and as long as they make this product I don&#x27;t I will need to. I am very satisfied with this product and it only costs a quarter of what GHD does.</li>
    <li> I selected BLACK fill in powder it when it arrived it was charcoal gray NOT BLACK.  It look ridiculous on my hair.  Claudia Stevens must be color blind to not know the difference between charcoal gray and BLACK.  A waste of my money. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!</li>
    <li> I will start with the fact that it is not truly BLACK. It is more of a light charcoal gray. When applied it looks more like DUST than hair coloring. I haven&#x27;t tried to mix the powders to get a different result - maybe that&#x27;s the key. Once I try it I will update my review. Currently, I am disenchanted with this product. You&#x27;re actually better off getting black eyeshadow to use as a cover.</li>
    <li> When I received the package it looked fine. When I opened the box with the powder it was all cracked, broken and not for use. It appeared to be old. I will never order this product again.</li>
    <li> This product not only covers the grey it also camoflauges the bald areas due to hair  Loss people with lupus may experience.</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed with this item.I ordered the color black and when I applied it too the area that needed  too be filled in which was near the Tempe area it looked as if I had applied paint to that area. Very displeased. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend!</li>
    <li> Makes too much of a mess.  Not worth the money.  You have to use more product.  Use Joan Rivers instead.  It&#x27;s more expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Easy to use and stay in until you wash your hair.  I love it and will be purchasing again soon.  Thank you</li>
