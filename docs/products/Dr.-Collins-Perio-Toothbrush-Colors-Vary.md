<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was used to using harder brushes so this felt almost too soft at first. But this brush actually did a better job of cleaning my teeth! With almost nothing to floss afterwards. I tried a different toothbrush after using this one and now that feels much too hard and doesn&#x27;t clean nearly as well. I&#x27;m ordering 2 more of these!</li>
    <li> Special little bristles get down under the gum line and in between the teeth and clean out all the deposits and food particles. Perfect for using after eating a big bowl of salad. I recommended this brush to my dental hygienist and my dentist. I use this as well as an electric toothbrush. Currently, Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrush is winning for most often used. I think you will love it!</li>
    <li> The best toothbrush EVER.  It is long standing, perfectly shaped, easy to hold, gentle bristles, yet strangely firm at the same time.  I most highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive teeth, and/or crowns</li>
    <li> The most thoroughly cleaning toothbrushes I have ever used - yes even better then electric.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe my tooth feels loose, and my gums are sore all over.........</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  So soft, and yet firm enough.  Both my mother and I swear that our gums look healthier and seem to have stopped receding.  Amazing that the big brands can&#x27;t manage to make anything this good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a long time now and they do a great job. I brush 3 or more times per day without any irritation at all, yet they clean your teeth.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the Best Toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a better toothbrush!  It is not too hard or too soft! --- It does an excellent job of cleaning your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discontinued using this Toothbrush for a short time, but I couldn&#x27;t find anything else to compare with it.  When I resumed using this toothbrush again, I noticed an immediate difference in cleaning comfort!  There was no scraping on the enamel of my teeth or gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never, never, never use another brush again!  This is my lifetime toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, there is nothing to compare with it!  The Best of the Best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susie</li>
    <li> this brush makes my teeth feel super clean.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what makes this a superior toothbrush, but it is. Im buying one for all members of my family. Immediate only, otherwise it&#x27;s too many people.</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush just the right bristle not too soft and not hard.</li>
    <li> So soft! Using those for 2 years now!</li>
    <li> Just melts into your teeth like whipped cream.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Pulsar used to be my go-to toothbrush, but I switched to this toothbrush because I was looking for something softer. It feels really good on your teeth. Best toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I loved how soft the toothbrush is, but as soon as I opened the package some of the bristles were falling out of the brush.  Once I started brushing my teeth the loose bristles completely fell out. I&#x27;d probably purchase again, but from a different vendor.  My Amazon orders seem to lack quality lately.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I ever owned. I must have tried everything on the market, from the &#x27;natural&#x27; bristles, to the &#x27;gentle&#x27; and &#x27;soft&#x27; stuff available at the local stores. This is absolutely amazing and I find I need to replace brushes every month in order to enjoy the flossing action. If you have sensitive teeth or gums, this is the best brush for you! Give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I really like this toothbrush. I think my gums appreciate it too.</li>
    <li> For hard brushers that really like to get their teeth clean, these are a godsend! The soft bristles are great for getting up underneath the gums, too!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is the only one I will ever use because I have such sensitive teeth and gums. The bristles on these brushes are super soft. Just perfect for my small mouth, too.</li>
    <li> I use only these, and have tried a million toothbrushes.  Perfect size for an adult woman&#x27;s mouth, and soft bristled to perfection.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for a while, and it is so far the best toothbrush I have found, being very gentle on the gums. I guess until I find a softer one (if there is such), I will keep coming back to this one.</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are excellent.  The end of the bristles are so nicely tapered that they clean the gum line area of the tooth with no gum irritation. They are excellent!</li>
    <li> Not at all like my extra soft Sensodyne I was trying to replace. I used it only long enough until I found a new extra-sensitive toothbrush. Try Colgate 360 Sensitive Pro-Relief instead. I have extremely sensitive teeth and this toothbrush just wasn&#x27;t right for me. Would not buy again or recommend!</li>
    <li> Best for those with a small mouth</li>
    <li> For my past 3, 6-month dental cleanings, my dentist has asked if I&#x27;m using a soft toothbrush. I would respond honestly and say yes (that&#x27;s what the package said). I would then be told that I must be brushing too hard. I have 3 teeth that now have a receding gumline yet my teeth and gums are so healthy that my dentist can&#x27;t see any reason for the receding. I finally did some searching and found this toothbrush. It promises and delivers. I was skeptical when I touched the brush with my finger but once I put it in my mouth, wow! It is soft, soft, soft! This is now my forever toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would love a toothbrush as much as I did this one! It&#x27;s a little on the pricier side but this is well worth it! I own a Sonicare Diamond but broke. While I was waiting for a replacement to come in the mail I ordered these from Amazon. I&#x27;ve had my replacement Sonicare for about 2 weeks now but I still won&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still prefer THIS toothbrush over my Sonicare! (I never thought I&#x27;d say that)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a chance, buy this toothbrush, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> If you brush your teeth a few times a day, and if you are a senior citizen or just someone with sensitive gums, this brush is a gem. I still use my \\&quot;soft\\&quot; Oral B in the evening (soft is relative. The Oral B is not soft when compared to this.), but usually use this in the am and midday. As soft as it is, it really does remove plaque etc. I also have the \\&quot;Collis Curve\\&quot; brush but find I don&#x27;t reach for that too often. I don&#x27;t feel like my teeth are as clean after using that one. Plus, as others have noted, it has a really terrible, cheap, unpleasant-to-hold handle. The one on this isn&#x27;t fancy, but it&#x27;s ergonomically balanced. Plus this brush is about half the price of the curve!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/31/13 Update: just came from my 6 month cleaning &amp; mentioned this brush to my hygienist. She showed me a new one that Colgate has just come out with that copies this brush almost exactly, except leave it to Colgate to color the tips of the bristles blue. She said the reason it cleans so well is that the bristle ends are actually very fine and almost feathery, so they really get into crevices. Now I&#x27;ll check out the price differential between this one &amp; Colgate&#x27;s, but all things being equal, I&#x27;d rather get this one and support the company that invented it.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush.  Gentle to the gums and still effective.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t brush with anything else anymore. This is like brushing with velvet. The angle of the brush is also unparalleled, getting to my molars very easily.</li>
    <li> I really like this toothbrush. I have sensitive teeth, and this brush does a very good job without hurting me.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness...it almost tickles your gums! So soft but does get the grime off of your teeth.</li>
    <li> Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrush with fine tapered polyester bristles has been my favorite tool for teeth cleaning for quite some time. Once in a while I give a try to another toothbrush that gets great reviews by the users - but again and again I keep coming back to this one - and reach most often for it.</li>
    <li> whatever it takes to get me motivated to care for teeth.  This is a superior brush that pays for itself in durability and pleasure to use</li>
    <li> It does a better job in brushing. The bristles get in between the teeth better. Will buy my brushes for my family.</li>
    <li> Soft fine bristles allow for brushing into those tiny spots.  I&#x27;ve never liked really soft bristles, but these I don&#x27;t mind. My gums feel like they received more care lately. I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week.  So far, no problems.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive gums and any other toothbrush even with soft bristles makes my gums bleed from time to time. I&#x27;m so glad I found this because it does a good job at cleaning my teeth and it&#x27;s gentle on my gums, I haven&#x27;t had a bleeding issue since I started using this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is a really soft toothbrush but the bristles still feel sturdy, not cheap.  It feels good on my gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it after searching Amazon for the highest rated toothbrush and I concur with previous good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one complaint about the shipping.  This does not have to do with the quality of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I selected a quantity of 3.  The toothbrushes came in separately in gigantic bubble mailer envelopes.  These bubble mailers were probably around 12&amp;#34; x 17&amp;#34;.  Huge and separate!  What a waste of packing materials.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive gums, and I recently got braces. This means I have to brush my teeth more often, but I have to be careful that I don&#x27;t damage my gums. This tooth brush is the softest brush I&#x27;ve ever used. and is delicate enough for frequent use.The only downside is that it isn&#x27;t course enough to get some areas of my teeth that are rougher. What I do is use this brush during the week for the most part, then once or twice I&#x27;ll use my sonicare to get the rougher areas of my teeth.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a different toothbrush and so far I am pleased. I will know better after my next dental check up.</li>
    <li> I was beginning to develop gum pocket problems and tried all sorts of things with no improvement. I read about this Blotting method online and ordered the brush. At my next dental checkup my one 5 pocket had reduced to a 4, some 4&#x27;s to a 3 and some 3&#x27;s to 2&#x27;s. I was additionally using the Soladey Ionic toothbrush along with the Collins Perio  Brush at least twice a day. My hygienist was impressed and I was relieved. There was very little tarter on my teeth as well. The Soladey toothbrush helps with that. So glad to have a simple solution. Now travel is easier; no need to carry a Sonicare electric brush and irrigator.</li>
    <li> I need a very soft toothbrush due to some gum issues I have.  I can never find one that&#x27;s soft enough at the store, so i&#x27;m very happy to have found this on Amazon.  No complainants!</li>
    <li> The bristles are very soft, and are &amp;#34;pointy&amp;#34; so they get farther into gums and between teeth than other toothbrushes. The bristles are definitely softer than typical Soft toothbrushes. The handle is sturdy and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush. I like the very soft bristles. I won&#x27;t go back to regular soft.</li>
    <li> I thought this to be a pretty good toothbrush over all. It gets between teeth well. I have to brush a bit longer to get the results I normally achieve with a regular soft bristle brush but it&#x27;s worth it because it does a better job.</li>
    <li> A welcome change in tooth brushes.  The new material used for the bristles is so soft&lt;br /&gt;and easy on gums while being dense and strong for cleaning and polishing teeth.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great improvement, and way ahead of all the others.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever used. It is soft and does not irritate my gums, which are very sensitive. This toothbrush lasts much longer than others too, so it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
    <li> Probably a little above average and the price is right. About the same as colgate the wave which is a pretty solid toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I think these toothbrushes are just what the dentist wants us to use. They meet my requirements of a toothbrush so well that I have a subscription to them!</li>
    <li> Best soft brush ever used.  These are difficult to find.</li>
    <li> The other reviewers here are right on! This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. Gentle, super-soft bristles that actually clean your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with gentle strokes (&amp;#34;Pretend you&#x27;re polishing a tomato.&amp;#34;), your teeth are literally squeaky-clean in a short time. I&#x27;ve only used it for a month, but it&#x27;s longevity seems similar to other toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have receded gums and try different tools and methods for taking care of them.  This brush is nice and soft, but my teeth get &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; faster after using this brush.  I would definitely recommend if you brush more than twice a day.  I use it after dinner sometimes.</li>
    <li> The bristles are my favorite and I like how they have the angles, if you brush lightly it feels kinda like a massage on your gums, not so abrasive as others can be.</li>
    <li> You HAVE to try this. It really does work SO well. You feel the bristles going between you teeth and sweeping under your gums just like a good brush should. My teeth feel polished each time I brush.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t deduct much for softness because the description is pretty clear that it is &amp;#34;ultra-soft&amp;#34;, but I really question how effective the brush is being overly soft.  Also, one of the bristles was bent out from the rest of them when I received it and needed to be trimmed off. I am not geratly impressed, but I guess if someone needs an &amp;#34;ultra-soft&amp;#34; brush, this one should fit the bill.</li>
    <li> I had been using the Nimbus toothbrush for a couple of months but decided to use the Dr. Collins Perio toothbrush at night. I find it does a better job of really cleaning my teeth at the end of a day of eating and drinking. It is a comfortable toothbrush. I can tell it will last a good while before l need new one.</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes seem to leave my teeth much cleaner than any other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I really like this toothbrush. Fine bristles and very soft. Does a good job of getting in between teeth and around the gumline without scraping away what little enamel I have left. I am absolutely mystified by the bad reviews and am wondering if they got the wrong toothbrush, if manufacturing flaws are relatively common or if they just have extremely sensitive gums. If I don&#x27;t floss for a day or two my gums bleed so I consider them sensitive. My bristles don&#x27;t bend out so much that they poke me in the cheek either.</li>
    <li> With sensible gums, this toothbrush has been a life saver. It fits my small mouth perfectly, cleans the molar as no brush has done before. I am completely satisfied, and I have been waiting for the perfect toothbrush for over 58 years!&lt;br /&gt;Oral care is a breeze from now on...</li>
    <li> I was dubious that this toothbrush would be any different than any other soft bristled toothbrush.  But it is better! The bristles of other toothbrushes, no matter how soft always hurt my gums.  They feel prickly for lack of a better word. This brush uses polyester instead of nylon and I believe this makes the difference.  I use this toothbrush with Dr. Collins toothpaste as well because it doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth.  Highly recommended if you have sensitive teeth &amp; gums.</li>
    <li> I had the same brush in the &amp;#34;soft set&amp;#34; before, but this is even better, because of the softness, my gums are not great and easily irritated --its a pleasure to use the &amp;#34;supersoft&amp;#34; brush without worrying about redness and swelling of the gums later</li>
    <li> Colors vary, yes, but the man or machine who packs my Amazon boxes must have a sense of my preferences. I keep getting the purple and black and green ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, where were we? Oh yeah. These are toothbrushes, like many toothbrushes. They feel insanely soft and yet my teeth feel magically cleaner than when using some mere mortal brand of toothbrush (not as amazing as when I use my SoniCare, but still!). I haven&#x27;t kept track, exactly, but they seem to last longer, too. Are you the sort who changes to a new toothbrush after the bristles on the old one start bending outward? Me too! It&#x27;s going to take a while.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrushes especially if you have sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush and it did what it advertised.  Not much else to tell, but I need six more words for this review.</li>
    <li> I really love this tooth brush very soft to my teeth and they last a very good time, very good tooth brush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great!!! I just used it for the first time this morning and it is super-soft.  Even softer than the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrushes I have bought from the pharmacy.  And it&#x27;s a good price too!  I have gum problems so this really helps.  I recommend it and will buy it again so I think that says a lot.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush because it has the perfect angle to glide across your teeth and gums. The perfect angle allows it to reach your back teeth without feeling forced. The bristles are soft but durable. I will never go back to a different type of manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> We were looking for a new tooth brush and purchased this in addition to others.  This looked  pretty generic but when we tried it we got crazy clean teath and the brush is pretty soft.  I would recommend it. We will be buying this in the future.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and gums.  I tried many different toothbrushes, and found this one to be the softest.  After a couple months of use, the softness remained, and didn&#x27;t harden up like some other brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive gums that  I cannot use any other brush, but electric (sonicare).&lt;br /&gt;However, this is soft enough for me to use when I have not access to my beloved sonicare.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive gums and develop oral ulcers easily. This toothbrush is perfect. It is soo soft and much cheaper than other soft toothbrushes. Don&#x27;t spend more money, buy this toothbrush if you need one with extra soft bristles!!</li>
    <li> I always buy this toothbrush because its firm but does not hurt my gums. It does a great job in cleaning my teeth. Its great for my husband who destroys them cause he brushes so hard</li>
    <li> It says &amp;#34;super soft&amp;#34; ... I get it, that was fine with me though I prefer mine &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;, what I dislike is that the bristles didn&#x27;t achieve soft by being more pliable, they achieved soft by being more narrow gauge.  That&#x27;s even ok but they bristles start taking off in different directions and stay there even after its out of your mouth - I find myself pulling it out of my mouth to get the bristles back to a 90 degree from the head so that they aren&#x27;t annoyingly dragging and prickling my cheeks from the insides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t press hard when i brush and I find that if you don&#x27;t constantly groom your tooth brush (and who in their right mind wants to spend time doing that?, that you&#x27;d end up with tumble weed attached to a finely crafted handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete Junk.  I wouldn&#x27;t own it again if it were given to me free.</li>
    <li> The bristles are very soft.  Great for receding gums.</li>
    <li> I love these. If you need an extra soft toothbrush this is a good choice. I have a hard time finding them. Glad they have these here.</li>
    <li> I am so glad to have discovered these!  They are wonderful for people who have receding gums or who have had gum surgery.  The bristles are not at all harmful to delicate gum tissue but the toothbrush does a great job of cleaning.  &#x27;Best of both worlds!</li>
    <li> I love this brand.  I&#x27;ve been so thrilled i keep ordering.  Soft - perfect - clean, very nice. If you haven&#x27;t tried it - really, step out and try, you will be hooked.</li>
    <li> Nothing else to add, it is just that; nice and soft on my gums! Great for when my Sonicare dies and I am too lazy to change the batteries.</li>
    <li> I look all over for VERY soft tooth brushes and use special tooth paste.  Because of my Ehlers Danlos, my gums are in terrible shape and receding horribly.  I brushed very carefully with this toothbrush.  It looks like it would be super soft, but in actuality it does have pointy plastic type ends to the brush.  I will say the few times I tried to use this, I did not hardly have to use any floss! This brush cleans great in between teeth!  But, it was too harsh for my gums and they swelled up and bled and my gums hardly ever bleed with my other soft tooth brushes.  I also floss several times a day to make sure that my gums are not in bad condition - considering their bad condition.  If you run your finger tip over the top of this after it is wet, you can feel how it feels like plastic and the ends are very pointy.  I&#x27;m sure for most this would be a super toothbrush! But, not for anyone that might have a gum condition such as mine - it only caused pain and problems.  I really wanted to like this brush - it is hard finding one soft enough.</li>
    <li> I think that this is a little too soft to clean effectively. Since I started using it, I got more cavities that usual. Not sure if it is their fault or mine.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt my favorite toothbrush.  Its very soft, lasts a long time and will help reduce wear on your teeth.  I have not been able to find a brush this soft in local stores.  You may need to brush a little bit longer than with a harder brush but its better for your teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Best manual toothbrush I have ever used.  It&#x27;s soft, so I can give my gums a massage, and afterwards they tingle as a result of improved gum circulation.  That will help with overall gum health.  It also removes plaque from my teeth better than any other manual toothbrush I&#x27;ve used.  I wish I had begun using this toothbrush years ago.  Now that I have found it, I hope to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I brush way too hard. Every dentist I&#x27;ve seen has said this. I probably still brush too hard, but as long as I run this toothbrush under hot water before I start brushing, I don&#x27;t have the bleeding issues I used to occasionally get. They feel very soft, even with hard water buildup, as long as I run them under hot water before brushing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting when I ordered this toothbrush, but it&#x27;s like night and day compared to previous cheap toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used in the past. The fine soft bristles feel like they&#x27;re flossing your teeth and reaching under your gumline. The bristles also seem very resistant to bending, and they&#x27;re very fine and soft but but stay firm, if that makes any sense. I&#x27;ve been using one for over three months now and still not even the slightest sign that the brush has warped at all. Cheap toothbrushes always have bristles that start bending and get gross really quickly, but not the perio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried brushing with one of our old Oral-B toothbrushes after having used this for a few months and it felt like I was brushing my teeth with a potato brush in comparison. Using this toothbrush, even brushing without any toothpaste leaves your teeth feeling very polished and refreshed afterwards. As a bonus, it&#x27;s soft on the tongue as well.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush. I usually buy Medium toothbrushes to get the clean feeling but they make my gum line recede some. Most Soft toothbrushes don&#x27;t hurt my gums but my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel as clean. This is a nice option to overcome both problems. I do think it is a  little too soft to clean around metal in the mouth (braces, permanent retainers) so this might not be the best option if you have anything like that in your mouth.</li>
    <li> WOW just WOW. This is the best toothbrush I have ever used. Very easy to things in between teeth out. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Buy these all the time</li>
    <li> The only toothbrush that does not irritate my sensitive gums. I wish we had the option to pick the colours, however.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is velvety soft so as to limit enamel over-abrasion on the bristle end and sturdy, ergonomic, and slip resistant on the handle end. It is clever in it&#x27;s design, beautifully simplistic but perfectly proportioned for a superior mechanical brushing technique.  It absolutely delivers on the promise of being a better brush for improved tooth and gum cleaning. The bristle tips are whisper thin, so thin they pass between the space between one&#x27;s teeth and gums and sweep out caught food debris items that floss may fail to pick up or reach.&lt;br /&gt;A dentist once told me to position the brush at a 45 degree angle then &amp;#34;shimmy&amp;#34; back and forth to lower the bristles on the edge I&#x27;ve just created with the angle under the bit of gum around the front of the tooth.  Finally I can follow this bit of advice because this is the only brush I have found that actual can work its way  inside that incredibly tiny gap.  It is the best toothbrush I have ever used, ever.</li>
    <li> It seems to get in between the teeth better than the cross action OralB toothbrushes I have been using. I am an over zealous brusher so I&#x27;m hoping this will save my gums.</li>
    <li> Not all toothbrushes are created equal. This one is hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  The bristles are tapered, so they are very soft and gentle on the gums, but they get in between your teeth and reach all the hard to reach places.  My mouth feels cleaner longer after brushing with the perio. Also, this brush is much more durable than other toothbrushes.  The bristles maintain their shape for longer, and they don&#x27;t splay out like the others.  Last time I went on vacation and forgot my toothbrush, I had to buy a different brand for the trip.  My mouth was miserable!!! I was so happy to get back home to my PERIO!!!!</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> I really like these toothbrushes. They hold up well, and they do get between my teeth better than any other brush I&#x27;ve tried. I get regular periodonal exams and have had several procedures for gum issues. My last couple of cleanings have been easy after using this brush. Still have to floss, though!</li>
    <li> This is an EXCELLENT flat, soft toothbrush. Thank you Dr. Collins for designing it and thank you Amazon for selling it!</li>
    <li> Awesome if you trying it you never go back to brick and mortar I&#x27;m sure you goin to love it</li>
    <li> this brush  is very soft, non-irritating to gums or tooth enamel (even with my crazy tooth sensitivity). tips of the bristles are tapered so this brush cleans between teeth a lot better than any others I&#x27;ve tried before. gums don&#x27;t bleed with this one either.&lt;br /&gt; highly recommend</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is ultra-soft, but it works! I&#x27;ve used mine during and after having Invisalign and after oral surgery. It&#x27;s much more pleasant to brush with this than with any other soft toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I like the toothbrush and I think it is helping me from brushing too hard but I don&#x27;t think it helps with plaque very well.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it I ended up with a loose bristle in my mouth, but no problem after that.  This brush feels so soft while brushing I was concerned it wasn&#x27;t cleaning my teeth.  However, once I rinse and spit, my teeth feel very clean and my gums are not irritated at all.</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush with soft, densely arranged bristles</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very soft and cleans so well it makes you wonder why all toothbrushes aren&#x27;t made this way. I brush, then floss, then brush again. I noticed that the debris left for flossing is minimal compared to regular drugstore toothbrushes. Doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums either. Just ordered another one when I noticed it went on Add-On status making it a bargain.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive gum. Nowadays I have some problem with it. I tried more  soft toothbrush but most of them weren&#x27;t enough soft. This one feels different and very soft. It doesn&#x27;t bother my gum. First I pushed too hard because it was so soft but finally I learnt less pushing better feeling and it does a good job. Will order again.</li>
    <li> super soft and long bristles.&lt;br /&gt;You can feel them getting in between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I am a little &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; with my brushing so this helps alot.&lt;br /&gt;Makes me wonder if I have just been grinding my teeth down with other toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Very good toothbrush! It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve tried. Bristle are soft while at the same time doing a very good job.</li>
    <li> Someone in a previous review said something about flossing with this fine-bristled toothbrush--that it is that well-designed for cleaning between your teeth. Well, my experience so far with the Perio Toothbrush is on that level; I actually chose not to floss last night because my teeth felt THAT clean. As a first-time user of this particular brand of toothbrush, I am very impressed, and I can see myself ordering some for family members who will likely be very surprised and bemused when they get them in the mail!</li>
    <li> good toothbrush, thank you!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is so soft, and the smaller brush makes it easy to get to the very back. Love the squeaky clean feeling after using this brush.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothbrush ever! I love the precision, and my teeth have never been cleaner or healthier!</li>
    <li> As a dentist of over 15 years this is the first toothbrush I have found that is truly soft enough not to cause recession.  I have no idea why major companies like Colgate and Crest even sell Medium and Hard tooth brushes.  Even their soft tooth brushes are not soft enough.  The plaque that we are trying to remove by brushing is very very delicate.  The Medium and Hard toothbrushes only cause recession of the gums and wear grooves right into the roots.  I see this all the time with my best brushing patients. Hopefully the ADA will step up at some point to regulate this.  I plan to order the Nimbus brush next to try.</li>
    <li> I found this here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://vbvare.blogspot.com/2014/11/dr-collins-perio-toothbrush.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her review is better.</li>
    <li> The Perio toothbrush is by far the best tooth brush I have ever used.  I have tried the electric sensitive bristled ones but did not like it.  The vibrations were too strong and it was not that soft.  This one is supersoft with fine bristles that gently massage the gums and clean teeth. This is a a real find for those with tooth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> It feels great on my gums and teeth, but the bristles started to wither after about a month or so.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It is so so so soft. Very good for the price.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel cleaner in every part of my mouth when using this toothbrush. You can feel the difference immediately. Everyone should try!</li>
    <li> Soft bristles, easy on the enamel and gums</li>
    <li> great for my receding gums from aggressive brushing.  will buy again.</li>
    <li> The best soft flossing toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. My teenage son tried it first and said it&#x27;s the best toothbrush he&#x27;d ever used so I tried it and I&#x27;m so impressed that I&#x27;m sure this is the only toothbrush I&#x27;ll ever buy again. It&#x27;s like a luxurious Swedish massage for my teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Cleans teeth without the over-scrubbing that wears tooth enamel.  I&#x27;m prone to pressing too hard when brushing so the Dr. Collins Perio brush is a good choice for someone with my overzealous habit. Because of this, other commercial brand toothbrushes are too harsh for me, even the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is of good quality. In the past several months since switching to Dr. Collins brushes, none of the bristles have come loose and the brush handles haven&#x27;t broken. These are both issues I&#x27;ve had with other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During my last visit to the dental hygienist two months ago, she said my teeth look good. That was a relief, as I was worried this brush might be too gentle to adequately clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replace it about every 3 months.</li>
    <li> This brush does a decent job of getting the fronts of my teeth clean along with my gum line, but the back of my molars are impossible to reach with this, even with my mouth practically completely closed. I need a brush with an elongated and angled end on the tip of it so I can brush back there. I also don&#x27;t care for the curved handle, it&#x27;s flat and thin which makes maneuvering difficult as the brush spins around in my fist.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH! I have hated brushing my teeth for years now because the typical brushes are far too hard on my gums, even the &#x27;soft&#x27; bristles, scraping them, making them bleed and causing receding because of the harsh bristles, even brushing lightly. I was always taught to brush gently so as not to hurt the gums, but this is impossible to do with most toothbrushes available in stores. This brush has saved me :) My son loves his child sized versions too. He no onger complains that brushing hurts him.   These bristles are soft as kitten whiskers while getting the job done very well. My gums actually feel GOOD after using this brush. The angle of the handle is just perfect. Combined with the Perio Bright toothpaste, this girl is happily looking forward to brushing her teeth every morning and night, and sometimes right after lunch!  **EDIT** a year later and my gums have been MUCH better, my teeth SPARKLY, little to no tartar build up, and even if the bristles don&#x27;t get all the way between my teeth, that&#x27;s what FLOSS is for. I had to briefly return to using a &#x27;regular&#x27; brush and OUCH! It hurt. No wonder my poor gums were bleeding, stinging and hurting.</li>
    <li> The bristles are very soft and it&#x27;s a quality toothbrush, but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s getting in between the teeth like  I expected</li>
    <li> Great Design. Unlike any toothbrush that I have used before, this toothbrush allows me to easily brush the inside surface of my front teeth. My hygienist normally removes some tarter from those surfaces.  After using this brush for several months, she didn&#x27;t even scrape that surface. Great Price. Used for several weeks now, and bristles don&#x27;t look worn and permanently bent. I even signed up for Amazon&#x27;s automatic delivery so that I receive a new one on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I love how soft they are on my sensitive teeth, completely different then any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve tired in a good way. If you are looking for something soft and different then this might be for you.</li>
    <li> I used to use store brand oral care and my gums would always bleed and i noticed my mouth degenerating over time even with a supposed healthy regimen. I began to notice a year ago my gum started to receding! I was horrified I thought i was doing everything i needed to, brushing twice a day and also using a heavy regiment of store brand oral care. NO! i was wrong i started doing a mountain of research about healthy gums and teeth and this also trickled into healthy body. I began to read disturbing facts about fluoride, Sodium laurel sulfate, parabens and Aluminum Zirconium. These are just some of the ingredients that are harmful and in many hygiene products, I realized that i wanted a more Organic/Natural way of life. I found these toothbrushes! They had such wonderful reviews and they are TRULY soft, Store brand soft does not compare to these toothbrushes! Needless to say i changed my WHOLE oral regiment i use this toothbrush with Organic toothpaste and Organic mouthwash. I am happy to say my gums do not bleed anymore and my gums are slowly making a comeback! my mouth feels healthy and is actually looking healthy now I am so happy i found Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrushs, They go perfectly with Nature&#x27;s Answer Perio Wash and Himalaya Herbal Healthcare Neem &amp; Pomegranate Toothpaste. So this is my regiment i hope this was helpful to you. If i had read this review a year ago i probably would not have encountered my previous mouth deterioration.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness I found this amazing perio toothbrush!  I am 55 years old, and every 6 mo I go for my dental cleaning - but there was always some bleeding and soreness after.  I started using this brush with the very thin tapered bristles and taking the time to brush up under my gums - and the next cleaning appt my hygienist said - &amp;#34;what have you been using to clean your teeth&amp;#34; it was the best cleaning report I have every had - there was no bleeding of the gums - they were pink and healthy.  I used to use an electric tooth brush - but I will never go back or use another brush now!</li>
    <li> I have to use a soft toothbrush because of sensitive gums. What I&#x27;ve found is that even the brand name soft bristle brushes are too harsh for me.  I found an extra soft sold under the CVS brand but after a few weeks the bristles collapsed and no longer cleaned my teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this one in hopes that it might work for me. Wow! This is absolutely the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles, although very soft, do not collapse and splay out.  I&#x27;ve not experienced any gum irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are quite thin so they do a good job of cleaning between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is deceptively ergonomic. In other words no overly padded handle or other silliness that makes it look more like a tennis shoe than a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the bristle head is pretty small. That works great for me because it gets to all those hard to reach spots.  Just don&#x27;t expect one of those hair brush sized bristle heads.&lt;br /&gt;The price is certainly competitive with the name brands that are of lesser quality.</li>
    <li> When using this brush, one shall not use a lot of force.  And one needs not use force when brushing teeth, a mistake I made for the first 25 years of my life.  It&#x27;s obviously more important to get them bristles into the spaces between the teeth; that&#x27;s where stuff get stuck and needs to be cleaned.  The fine bristles of this brush can get in there and do the job probably better than hard-bristled brushes.  Nevertheless I now use electric brush.  Doctor says even though I can get them bristles in there, the vibrating and circular movements are difficult to do with a manual brush.</li>
    <li> I use an electric toothbrush regularly at home and a manual brush when I travel (or if I&#x27;m in a hurry...don&#x27;t tell my dentist!).  My dental care providers have long recommended soft toothbrushes and I was delighted to find these at Amazon.  I change this manual toothbrush (and my electric toothbrush) every 3 months per dental professionals.  They are very soft.  And it&#x27;s easy to rinse toothpaste out of them and keep them clean!</li>
    <li> These are soft, great, comfortable brushes!</li>
    <li> These are great toothbrushes &amp; so cheap!! The don&#x27;t hold bacteria like normal ones &amp; the way the bristles are, they actually give a flossing action WHILE brushing. We tried these a few months ago &amp; we are sticking with them.&lt;br /&gt;Jenni</li>
    <li> This is an excellent toothbrush!  There aren&#x27;t many extra soft options out there that are actually.. soft.  It is very comfortable on sensitive gums.  The handle is simple and comfortable to hold, not one of those big bulky ones with 6 different types of grip.  My only gripe is the size of the head... I wish it were slightly larger.  Best of all, this toothbrush is twice the quality of brushes that are triple the cost!</li>
    <li> Oh my god. This toothbrush feels like brushing with a tiny, sleeping kitten. My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just left the dentist. I need one for every room of my house.</li>
    <li> I just got it today and used it and I must say I really like it. My mouth is sensitive cuz I&#x27;m pregnant and I really wanted to try something different. This is the tooth brush I&#x27;m buying from now on. It was form enoughf to give a good clean but still really soft.</li>
    <li> I understand that some people may need to use an extremely soft toothbrush for dental health conditions, but this toothbrush does nothing to remove plaque.  Even after brushing vigorously for minutes with this brush there are still visible food particles between teeth, and after a few days plaque was actually building.</li>
    <li> These have been my favorite for years now since I have originally tried them out, I recommend these over all the others.</li>
    <li> Great brush to keeping gums stimulated and gums and teeth cleaned. I use 2 regularly to let them dry properly between use.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive teeth, this is a great toothbrush. Very soft but cleans well</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. It&#x27;s very soft yet effective in cleaning my teeth.  Good for sensitive teeth and gums. Leaves my teeth feeling nice and clean.</li>
    <li> Not much I can say--it is a toothbrush, after all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two outstanding factors about this brush are: it has a thin, flat handle which fits most of the tooth-brush holders without any difficulty.  Second, the bristles are soft, so you don&#x27;t have the bleeding gum issues that some harder brushes may cause.</li>
    <li> Just as the toothbrush I get FREE at my dentist office...</li>
    <li> I love how soft this toothbrush is and how well it cleans.  It is good quality and holds up well.  Not sure how I stumbled across it, but it will definitely be my toothbrush of choice from now on.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this wonderfully soft toothbrush so much that I keep buying them and giving them away…I tell everyone they will be the last toothbrush they ever try. They are so soft that the first time I tried one I wanted to massage my gums for hours…it felt soooo good. It makes you want to brush your teeth. It requires no plug or batteries…it is a manual toothbrush but it is perfect for those of us who tend to scrub our teeth and gums like we clean our kitchen floors. I have tried them all and in my opinion, Dr Collins Perio is the best soft toothbrush you can buy!</li>
    <li> Works really good.  One of the best.</li>
    <li> The best one on the market.</li>
    <li> I recently had to have gum restoration surgery and needed to find a really soft brush to use since the affected areas were still incredibly sensitive even after a month. I first tried to use the brush my dentist gives me after each cleaning but found that even though it was marked &amp;#34;Soft&amp;#34; it now felt like I was running steel wool over the newly healed area.&lt;br /&gt;I did some research and came up with two choices, either Dr. Collins Perio or the Nimbus Microfine. I decided to try both.&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I liked Dr. Collins better.  The bristles had a better feel and were more uniform. The Nimbus had some stray bristles that were quite a bit longer and would catch in between the teeth or feel a bit pokey on the gums. Its possible that the brush I had was defective but since the Dr. Collins was great out of the package, I&#x27;ll decided to stick with that one.&lt;br /&gt;Being softer and less aggressive, I don&#x27;t think the Dr. Collins brush cleans as quickly as my older brush but I find that if I brush a little bit longer and use a lighter touch I can get my teeth just as clean without ruining my gums in the process. Very happy I found this brush. I am a convert.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush. I have very sensitive gums; Sjogrens syndrome. This brush is very soft and gets into between my teeth to help keep teeth and gums heatlthy. I have this on repeat order.</li>
    <li> I have the MOST sensitive gums. Over the years I have been sadly watching (and feeling!) them recede from brushing, and each year older I get I am in search of a newer, softer toothbrush. I used to only use the Colgate 360 extra soft brushes, but then this one came. Wow, it is completely full but it&#x27;s like those bristles are made of super strong, silky hair, instead of plastic. The bristles are all different lengths, and I love that they are white, because I always walk away from brushing my teeth feeling super clean. If you&#x27;re looking for a switch, or just willing to try something different, this may be your solution.</li>
    <li> Bristles are NOT an softer than the sort you find in toothbrushes in any grocery/drug store.</li>
    <li> These are the best toothbrushes I have ever used.  I have problems with bone spurs, and gums can get injured easily.  These are great, very soft, but very good at cleaning.  Get good reports when I go get my teeth cleaned.</li>
    <li> One of the softest toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these toothbrushes. They&#x27;re the best I&#x27;ve ever used. They&#x27;re super soft but still get your teeth really clean. They&#x27;re the only kind I use now.</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve tried of the ultra-sensitive-non-gum-destroying toothbrushes.  No irritation, yet leaves teeth and gums feeling very clean.</li>
    <li> I really like this toothbrush...it really does help with the gum area of the mouth...gentle but very cleansing,  I will continue to use this one...</li>
    <li> Quite soft. Feels like I&#x27;m rubbing a cleaning plushy on the inside of my mouth.</li>
    <li> This the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve been looking for. I bought a G.U.M brand toothbrush that is very similar to this one and it felt great, but the bristles were too tapered on the edges and they dug so deep under my gum line that it hurt. The bristles on this brush aren&#x27;t as pointy, but it still gives me that squeaky clean feel. We&#x27;re taught to think that more is always better and it&#x27;s hard to believe that such a soft brush can clean so well. My oral b &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrush would beat up my gums and I put up with it for so long, thinking that I had no other choice. My oral b would leave my teeth feeling rough in the front, but with this toothbrush, they feel smooth and polished like they do after I get a cleaning. I have attachments on my teeth for invisalign and even though this toothbrush doesn&#x27;t have all the fancy curves and patterns, it still got my teeth perfectly clean. I&#x27;m a believer now, and my gums and teeth are thanking me.</li>
    <li> Initially, I thought this toothbrush out-shined all other brushes on the market. I needed a gentle brush that cleaned thoroughly between the teeth and gum line, without additional wear on my already receding gums. This was a temporary solution, but it still had a slight plastic feel to it. It is pretty soft and gentle, however after continuing the search for an even better brush (without being too weak for adult brushing) I discovered another brush that fit the criteria over and above the Perio, made by abcOralCare, the Yorum 5 model. That brush really worked better at cleaning for those of us with receding gums. This is a great alternative to all other drugstore or dentist-provided models and a good value. But for me, the Yorum 5 will remain THE toothbrush I use on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> best toothbrush i&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are extra soft very pleasant to use.</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrushes. It lasts so long, cleans so well and so soft, I have reseeding gums so I shouldn&#x60;t apply a lot of pressure. These toothbrush is also great for sensitive teeth. It cleans better even though it&#x60;s so soft.</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying a toothbrush specifically designed for people with periodontal issues. This brush is perfect, it feels great in the mouth and  really does a great job of getting into the nooks and crannies. I use this in conjunction with my SonicCare diamond head toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I feel like the soft but many-filamented surface has a better texture for cleaning off the plaque even while it is soft enough not to damage my gums or the tooth surface.</li>
