      <li>LOL I NEVER wear wigs because I thought I wouldn&#x27;t look right</li>
      <li>On the positive side it is a beautiful wig.</li>

      <li>I am a satisfied customer, also would recommend this product to friends and family...</li>
      <li>I just got this wig and I am in love with it. :-)</li>
      <li>I will purchase another one for sure.</li>
      <li>Sure there&#x27;s a precut smidge of lace but for the most part this thing is horrendous.</li>
      <li>(but there so many too choose from I am tempted).</li>
      <li>I bought color OP430 and love this color.</li>
      <li>and it was fine.</li>
      <li>Thanks Hair Closet ..... would I buy another for sure would its a must have!</li>
      <li>The wig doesn&#x27;t fit every head.</li>
      <li>You can do better ladies, unless you need to see for yourself then go right ahead.</li>
      <li>/&gt;honestly after wearing it in an up-do to a wedding, which went ok once I styled it with pins and my hot buns roller.</li>
      <li>So soft and nice.</li>
      <li>The wig is soft and nice tho</li>
      <li>She is gorgeous and look forward to buying another when I need to from this same seller.</li>
      <li>the shipping was quick.  </li>
      <li>I brushed it out a bit too much and tried to re-curl it on my own</li>
      <li>I like them both very much.  </li>
      <li>This is my first time posting a review</li>
      <li>The only reason I rated it four stars (like) although I love the unit is it did not hold a curl at all.</li>
      <li>I read all the reviews and got a fairly warm fuzzy feeling about it, but it was not what I expected at all.  </li>
      <li>but it was a blessing in disguise because when I was forced to do nothing but straighten it, I ended up loving her straight more than I did with curls.</li>
      <li>but I really want viewers to know that this product is well worth the moneyand</li>
      <li>made it look very wiggy.  </li>
      <li>I like the curly wigs because you can&#x27;t tell they are wigs as easily as straight hair wigs.  </li>
      <li>It was very puffy when I tried it on, like a another review</li>
      <li>Just Love this wig so much I have brought 2 , on my way for my 3rd one, so natural.</li>
      <li>I did not get the model wig shown but a #30 kind of color (too lazy to go check).</li>
      <li>But truthfully this was a waste of money, never again!</li>
      <li>I def would recommend ((Going to try Milly next ;D))</li>
      <li>you can&#x27;t comb it once it get old</li>
      <li>Get it while it last because this one goes fast.</li>
      <li>These look especialy natural.</li>
      <li>I love this, I trimmed it a little, this arrived promptly before expected date, I will order again from this seller yes.</li>
      <li>Looks realistic not too big and bulky would definitely buy again!</li>
      <li>I love the unit, it didn&#x27;t frazzle when heat touched it except a tiny bit on the ends but with this type of fiber that is to be expected, a little clipping</li>
      <li>Thanks, but no thanks.</li>
      <li>But after about 2nd time wearing it in its natural state, I decided I had to straighten it to try and make it work for me...</li>
      <li>I was unable to find it anywhere else because it was so popular.  </li>
      <li>If you usually wear Lacefront wigs, you will not enjoy this one as I am sure you are used to a natural looking part.  </li>
      <li>but I made my own the part looks so real its crazy!</li>

<li> but I made my own the part looks so real its crazy!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s possibly about 16-18 inches long</li>
<li> and I went back for the jet black</li>
<li> the only thing I&#x27;m upset about is that when I got it, it was black</li>
<li> Ordered this wig twice because the first time they sent the wrong color</li>
<li> It had the tendency to move around and go back to my hairline which annoyed me to the point that I thought it would slip off and embarrass the heck out of me in public.</li>
<li> it was overprice not worth ordering again</li>
<li> said \\&quot;like a lion\\&quot; the cap is really small, I always thought I had an average head size not too big, no too small</li>
<li> iT IS BLACK.</li>
<li> I got my unit in a #1 (Jet Black) because I am too frightened to try the colors</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had this wig for a few months now AND..</li>
<li> WELL I must say the hair is very thin, but a pro is that it is soft.</li>
<li> :/</li>
<li> I only got as far as trying it on, the \\&quot;invisible part\\&quot; looked TERRIBLE...</li>
<li> could not style it was ridiculous  </li>
<li> i will not order anything else from this site and they kept sending me the wrong color  </li>
<li> The part was too fake.</li>
<li> The clips are in the wrong place.  </li>
<li> WRONG COLOR SENT.</li>
<li> that in 4-5 days it get tangle together difficult to comb out when you try it combs out the curls</li>
<li> I just plan on keeping it under my bed for a few months before throwing it out, so I wont feel too bad :(.</li>
<li> Very uncomfortable wig.</li>
<li> If you are not into lacefronts, this wig probably wouldnt be too bad.  </li>
<li> This wig was HORRIBLE to me.  </li>
<li> the wig is awful does not even come close to the picture</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> the wig is awful does not even come close to the picture could not style it was ridiculous  i will not order anything else from this site and they kept sending me the wrong color  but i will tell all my friends not to order from this site because it is untruthful</li>
    <li> I personally didn&#x27;t like this wig.  I thought it was a lace front wig and it wasn&#x27;t. The part was too fake. But the price&lt;br /&gt;was good and the shipping was quick.  Nothing on the seller, but I just didn&#x27;t like the part on the wig.</li>
    <li> WRONG COLOR SENT. iT IS BLACK. i ordered brown.The wig is soft and nice tho</li>
    <li> I really loved this hair.  I was unable to find it anywhere else because it was so popular.  But of course Amazon had it.  It is beautiful and there are many colors to fit many taste.  Get it while it last because this one goes fast.</li>
    <li> This wig was HORRIBLE to me.  I read all the reviews and got a fairly warm fuzzy feeling about it, but it was not what I expected at all.  I only got as far as trying it on, the \\&quot;invisible part\\&quot; looked TERRIBLE...made it look very wiggy.  If you usually wear Lacefront wigs, you will not enjoy this one as I am sure you are used to a natural looking part.  If you are not into lacefronts, this wig probably wouldnt be too bad.  If I had got this wig a couple years ago before Lacefronts became popular, I probably would have been a satisfied customer.  Im sending mine back!  Thanks, but no thanks.</li>
    <li> With concealer this is perfect! Looks realistic not too big and bulky would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I just got this wig and I am in love with it. :-) I ordered the OMFIRED and I must say the blending is beautiful the curls r yummy... tho it says its lace front its not but no biggie also no bby hairs but I made my own the part looks so real its crazy! Thanks Hair Closet ..... would I buy another for sure would its a must have!</li>
    <li> This is my first time posting a review but I really want viewers to know that this product is well worth the moneyand I am a satisfied customer, also would recommend this product to friends and family...</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wig!! So soft and nice. I&#x27;ve worn mine for over a month (no shedding) and it still looks great! I bought color OP430 and love this color. I&#x27;m going to try another color next time. This wig get a 2 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> The wig is beautiful and with the invisible part it makes it look more realistic everyone thought it was a weave in my hair instead of a wig LOL I NEVER wear wigs because I thought I wouldn&#x27;t look right but trying this one I am now open up to them LOL u can wear the part in the middle or the side the only thing I&#x27;m upset about is that when I got it, it was black I thought I ordered the same color one that&#x27;s on the model in this pic :/ but otherwise the wig is GREAT!!! I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful wig. I have bought many of synthetic wigs and they tangle after three wears. I read Equal has the best synthetic wigs. I will purchase another one for sure.</li>
    <li> The wig doesn&#x27;t fit every head. The clips are in the wrong place.  Very uncomfortable wig. On the positive side it is a beautiful wig.</li>
    <li> This by no means is a lace front. Sure there&#x27;s a precut smidge of lace but for the most part this thing is horrendous. There&#x27;s no front comb, only one in the back and two on the sides. The tightening hooks in the back always fall out of the slots and one of the slots broke. Boo on you shake n go. Shake n throw....throw away or put it on your dog for Halloween.</li>
    <li> Love love love this wig this wig is beautiful and so real looking I got the the color shown and I went back for the jet black</li>
    <li> I love this, I trimmed it a little, this arrived promptly before expected date, I will order again from this seller yes. fits great and looks great on me.</li>
    <li> THIS WIG LOOKED TOO WIGGY</li>
    <li> Ordered this wig twice because the first time they sent the wrong color but I kept it and ordered another.  I like them both very much.  I like the curly wigs because you can&#x27;t tell they are wigs as easily as straight hair wigs.  These look especialy natural.</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t comb it once it get old that in 4-5 days it get tangle together difficult to comb out when you try it combs out the curls it was overprice not worth ordering again</li>
    <li> This wig is great i have 3 of them and would recomend it to anyone great part realistic over all cool!!</li>
    <li> Just Love this wig so much I have brought 2 , on my way for my 3rd one, so natural.</li>
    <li> Got it in record time and communication with the seller was swift. Came in pristine packaging. I got my unit in a #1 (Jet Black) because I am too frightened to try the colors (but there so many too choose from I am tempted). I love the unit, it didn&#x27;t frazzle when heat touched it except a tiny bit on the ends but with this type of fiber that is to be expected, a little clipping and it was fine. The only reason I rated it four stars (like) although I love the unit is it did not hold a curl at all. I brushed it out a bit too much and tried to re-curl it on my own and it refused to hold a curl but it was a blessing in disguise because when I was forced to do nothing but straighten it, I ended up loving her straight more than I did with curls. She is gorgeous and look forward to buying another when I need to from this same seller. I def would recommend ((Going to try Milly next ;D))</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this wig for a few months now AND.. the only reason I am doing this review is because I believe different opinions matter, and I rely on research and reviews before I purchase off line, especially on wigs I can&#x27;t see physically or try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I did not get the model wig shown but a #30 kind of color (too lazy to go check). It was very puffy when I tried it on, like a another review said \\&quot;like a lion\\&quot; the cap is really small, I always thought I had an average head size not too big, no too small but after this cap I must reconsider that. It had the tendency to move around and go back to my hairline which annoyed me to the point that I thought it would slip off and embarrass the heck out of me in public. But after about 2nd time wearing it in its natural state, I decided I had to straighten it to try and make it work for me... WELL I must say the hair is very thin, but a pro is that it is soft. It&#x27;s possibly about 16-18 inches long but it gets knotted fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;honestly after wearing it in an up-do to a wedding, which went ok once I styled it with pins and my hot buns roller. But truthfully this was a waste of money, never again! I doubt I will wear it again either. I just plan on keeping it under my bed for a few months before throwing it out, so I wont feel too bad :(. You can do better ladies, unless you need to see for yourself then go right ahead.</li>
