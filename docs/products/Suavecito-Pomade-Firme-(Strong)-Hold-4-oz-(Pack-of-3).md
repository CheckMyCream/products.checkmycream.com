<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> holds great ,smells great</li>
    <li> Great product. I only use this one.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff,holds really well without flaking like gel.</li>
    <li> great product to hold hair for all these new and funky styles leaves no flaking great product</li>
    <li> I bought this gel for my son. The barber where he goes was out of it. Much better price here!!!!!</li>
    <li> Got it gor my brother and he loved it</li>
    <li> This is a quality hairgel.  It goes on your hair without mess and it hold your hair perfectly without flakes.&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty strong straight hair, but the gel holds up the style all through out the day.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product. Color is a brownish beige, but the scent and hold make up for the lack of &amp;#34;prettiness.&amp;#34; Works well and comes in a large 4 oz jar. Ordered this after a barber used it on my hair at the barber shop. I like that it does not leave a sticky residue that is difficult to shampoo out.</li>
    <li> fair price for a good product.</li>
    <li> Has a nice smell. Solid hold. As a barber, my customers seem to like it.</li>
    <li> Application - 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is very easy. Afterall, it&#x27;s a water based pomade. Thus, should not have an issue in terms of application. Easily comb through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold - 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a good hold to it. Can last throughout the day with no problem. But over time, it will lose it&#x27;s strength abit but it will still hold it through. Can restyle back easily with a little bit of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shine - 4/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pomade adds a good shine to your hair. Not too shiny. Personally, i feel it&#x27;s just nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washable - 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is a water based pomade, it shouldn&#x27;t have any issue for removing it. Simply gone in one wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent - 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By far, this has got to be one of my favourites. It has a strong musky cologne smell to it. Smell can last throughout the day and it makes your hair smell great!</li>
    <li> yes i like it and it meet my spectations.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> My son had me order these for him , he says they are great . It isnt hard to get out of hair like the other ethnic oils he was using . came fast and neat</li>
    <li> This is the best pomade I ever have.  I will recommend this product to anyone that like to use nothing but the best. It smells good and work exactly what it say on the label.  You won&#x27;t regret it and your money is worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Suavecito before and had always been the best pomade I had used. This batch seems to hold for not as long some how? Its still the best, just... strange.</li>
    <li> Love this product and would recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> Best if used on damp/almost dry hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a LONG time. I first found it when I had my hair cut by a barber, and he was using it. The first time I bought Suavecito was through him. I can get a wet look, AND a dry look with my hair, and as everyone says, it holds all day, and washes out really easy. Because this stuff is so thick, it might be harder to comb your hair while using it, but I just use a towel and my hands, so it&#x27;s perfect. The smell of the gel itself is pretty strong, but with good reason, when you put it in your hair, throughout the day you&#x27;ll only smell it occasionally, and so will other people. I absolutely love the smell though, so that&#x27;s good with me. According to some other review, this stuff is bad for your hair, but I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a really long time (like I said before) and I have thick hair. I&#x27;ve had multiple hair stylists tell me my hair is really heathy, so it doesn&#x27;t seem to be bad for MY hair, but others may have sensitive hair.</li>
    <li> The hold is great the smell is a bit strong for my liking. Washes out great and has great hold. If they would tone down the smell this would be the perfect pomade.</li>
    <li> Great combo! Great price! Great quality product!</li>
    <li> It holds my hair all day long</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a barber and I swear by this stuff.. use it myself. All of my clients LOVE it. Even the regular hold, holds really well. I swear if they had this scent in cologne I&#x27;d go get it..</li>
    <li> This is THE pomade you need to be using for your current tight fade, big pomp hairstyles.&lt;br /&gt;Great hold all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great too!</li>
    <li> Great price vs the barber shop. My guy has natural waves and currently has the classic WWII soldier part and to keep his hair in place he swears by Suavecito. Love it! Made the perfect little stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> Suavecito pomade, get it</li>
    <li> I order this all the time.  Washes out easily after every use and holds your hair the way you want it to.</li>
    <li> I think the best Pomade out there.  I keep going back and forth between this stuff and Johnny B.  The trick to applying and using is dampen your hair slightly then apply the Suavecito.  I love how it washes out very easily, I just don&#x27;t know if I will keep using it...</li>
    <li> Smell is a bit too strong for my taste but good pomade.</li>
    <li> I tried to use other product and they were all substandard compared to Suavecito. I am accustomed to using the regular hold pomade and the extra firm is indeed stronger. It doesn&#x27;t have a conspicuous smell and works really well all day long. I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love Suavecito it&#x27;s the best pomade on the market hands down nothing is better. I have tried atleast 20 different products nothing matches the smell and hold of this product. It is the best ever!!! I am a lifer!!!</li>
    <li> Bought for my boyfriend smells great love how his hair has that slick back Fraser look and his curls look so cute</li>
    <li> I tried it and it is better than any other product i used its easy to wash out and great product</li>
    <li> My husband loves this hair product, and we love how much cheaper it is on Amazon versus at the barber where he gets his hair cut.</li>
    <li> Best prices around the web!!!</li>
    <li> I prefer the original hold over this the firme</li>
    <li> great product fast delivery</li>
    <li> I really did. I used it for around 3 months so I&#x27;m confident that I gave it a fair trial but unfortunately, the hold is subpar and leaves hair feeling clumpy and waxy even after spreading through my hands and thoroughly spreading through my hair. I noticed that I had lots of rogue hairs that wouldn&#x27;t work with me while using this pomade. I&#x27;ve since switched to imperial pomade and I have fallen in love with the hold and natural look. I&#x27;m not saying that this product doesn&#x27;t work for other people and the price is good but for me it just wasn&#x27;t a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff awesome price</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Always very quick service when I place this order. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I decided after tons of research that this was the pomade i wanted, both by rating and by statistics and such. Its water soluble; washes out easily and its given me the best results yet, exactly what i aspired for. I got my haircut, i have really thick curly hair with frizz-- my cursed curly hair ugh --and you HAVE to use this product completely dry cause even slightly damp messes up the outcome. I worked it in until it was near impossible to grease my hair further, and combed it all back, and it was perfectly slicked back, and i made the front and for the first time my hair actually stood up straight and i could accomplish a perfect pompadour. I put it in at 6 and by 6 it was still exactly how i left it, but when i tried to wash it out it was ROCK hard. I could blab about Suavecito all day, but all i can say its a must-have for pomade users, and i will DEFINITELY be buying again.</li>
    <li> It leaves your hair smelling so good and when you wash the product off your it dose not sticky and sits/stays like others and no flakes if you leave it on over night.</li>
    <li> First about me: I have stick straight thick Asian hair that looks unruly without product.  I have had problems taming my cowlick for as long as I can remember.  I now sport a classic cut that is very short on the sides (a tight fade, if you will) and a bit longer on top with a very defined side part.  On some days, it looks like a quasi-pomp.  It&#x27;s one of those styles that if even one hair is out of place, you can usually tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, I used garden-variety drugstore brand hair products yielding very mixed results.  Some would flake, others made my hair hard as a rock, and most were simply not strong enough to keep things in line.  I tried upgrading to more high quality pomades like American Crew, but I always found it lacking.  Finally, my barber introduced me to Layrite.  While I think it&#x27;s a decent product, I am not a huge fan of its distinct smell.  I know some folks out there love it, but I just could not get past it.  As well, I found that it did not wash out as easily as I would have liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comes Suavecito.  When I mentioned that I did not like the smell of Layrite, he gave me a whiff of the Suavecito, and I immediately thought it was an upgrade.  It has a very clean smell ... again, it may not be for everyone, but I really like it.  At first, I used the standard formula, and it didn&#x27;t quite keep all of my hair in place throughout the day without having to use a significant amount.  When I found out there was a \\&quot;Firme/Strong\\&quot; hold option, I genuinely got excited.  Could this really be the product I have been searching for all of my life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, yes.  A single tub lasts me about 2-3 months, and I use the product daily.  I find that it gets incorporated better when my hair is slightly damp.  It does cause a little stiffness after it dries and left untouched, but for my hair, that&#x27;s the only way to keep it from getting messy throughout the day.  If I do run my hands through my hair after it is dry, the product softens usnicely as well.  I love that there is no greasy residue, and the product washes out pretty easily.  Admittedly, I usually go to bed each night with the product still in my hair, and I have had no issues with it causing any kind of breakouts on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the size of the tub, it can be risky to travel without transferring some of the product to a smaller container.  I have gotten through security at the airport dozens of times without getting it confiscated, but the last time I traveled, the security guard at Heathrow made my toss it given that the size of the tub was just a hair (pun intended) over what is allowed for liquids/gels.  I was forced to buy a substitute \\&quot;styling paste\\&quot; that was greasier, had less hold, and was harder to wash out. My allegiance to Suavecito was only reinforced from this experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite that unfortunate episode, I am still grateful that my lifelong search for the ideal hair product is finally over.  I can finally move on with my life.</li>
    <li> They have a pretty strong scent to them but it smells good.  This stuff is a little bit softer than other that I have tried but I like it better because of the smell and it is not quite and thick, and its cheaper.  Glad I bought the three pack right off the bat!</li>
    <li> Its okay.. Through out the day if you tend to sweat, the pomade get weak..And I have the strong hold</li>
    <li> Excellent product outta Santa Ana Califas. Highly  recommended if u want a product to hold firme in the rain but come off easy in the shower.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome, has a good hold for the day. Learned about this from my barber when he tries different products on his clients.</li>
    <li> Provides helpful and fast reply and fast delivery couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.. Would definitely recommend this</li>
    <li> The best thing about this pomade is the it is water based and will wash out in the shower. It has great holding power. Only negative is the smell in which I get used to.</li>
    <li> Amazing pomade for a good price. I really like the smell of the product and the look it gives when styled to my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product that keeps my hair style in place 24/7👦🏽</li>
    <li> Here is the deal, I have not grown my hair out in about twenty years. I have been cutting it really shot so I did not have to mess with it. Well i decided to grow it out ( not a mid life crisis). I was very out of touch with hair products or what to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran across this as an Amazon suggestion on the bottom of the page. I filed it away in my mind palace and looked into it about a week later. I ordered the three pack and gave two away as gifts. One I gave to my neighbor who is also my stylist. He loved it and went on and on about what a great product it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not apply it dry because it feels like rubbing tree sap into my hair. Please do not take that as a negative I have just found I need to use some water to get it mixed in well, but that may just be me. I love the smell and they definitely give you an ample supply. People around me have also smelled it and really enjoy the pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend trying this product, i have thoroughly enjoyed it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> It blow drys pretty good it washes out really easy the only minor I mean minor thing I would like to see if suavecito threw a little more shine in the product with that being said I would recommend this product to Serious pomanders anyway thanks oh yeah I forgot to mentioned the three pack is the way to go thanks again Pete rodriguez.</li>
    <li> This product is great, it falls into the little dab&#x27;ll do ya category, using this product every day each jar lasts me about 3 months.</li>
    <li> The best wax in the market</li>
    <li> I have thick pin straight hair and for years I defaulted to short spiked or messy hairstyles because there was no product that could control and style my hair. I wanted to grow my hair out for the longest time, and even the &amp;#34;stylist&amp;#34; I went to see told me I should just stick to short hair because my hair type was too difficult to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched like crazy - all kinds of gels, waxes, and pomades and finally found something people were raving about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter SUAVECITO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was it just hype, or does it really work? I was blown away how ridiculous the hold is... No stay hairs, no hair sticking up anywhere! Just smooth and slick. I applied to totally dry hair and it worked great.. was not too glossy or shiny but did have a kinda matte sheen to it. If you want a shiny or really slick look apply to damp hair or comb with a wet comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells really nice also which is a plus, not an overpowering scent - just clean. I expected my hair to feel slimey but it actually feels slightly sticky. Some people complained it made their hair feel crunchy, but this was not the case for me. I would imagine this is totally dependent on what kind of hair you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I was expecting to have to wash my hair multiple times for this stuff to come out. NOPE. In the shower warm water will take it out no problem if you rinse well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this stuff exceeded my expectations will buy again.</li>
    <li> Suavacito firme has been my go to can since I switched from Murrays.  It withstands swamp humidity better than anything else I&#x27;ve found and still comes out with just water.  If you want to reposition your hair, just wet your comb, pick through your hair and it&#x27;ll re-harden.  If you&#x27;re looking for support for a big pomp or really trying to slick down a tight side part, this is probably what you&#x27;re looking for.  It has the texture and goes in like Lay Rite, but with the look and faster hold (and fraction of the price) of J. Sloan.  I&#x27;m still on the look out for something, better--but I haven&#x27;t really found it.  One 4 oz. can usually lasts me between 3-4 weeks and I would describe myself as an over-zealous user.</li>
    <li> great stuff. It takes alot to tame my hair and keep it in place all day. Washes out with ease.  My new go-to product.</li>
    <li> My husband has tried a lot of pomades, gels and mousse over the years and he says this stuff has the best hold!</li>
    <li> On our 6th jar of Suavecito now..... We actually started using this on the advice of a very stylish gay man who recommended it to us. While I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the way pomade looks and feels in the jar, I do have to say that this one actually gets the job done. It does not flake up your hair, does NOT feel heavy, combs out easily and even reactivates with water, and holds all day without budging. It also doesn&#x27;t cake up into a thick hard mess in your hair (not clumping your hair together). So your hair looks more natural and less obvious that you have product in it. My only gripe is the fragrance...which smells exactly like men&#x27;s cologne. Great for the hubby but a little strong for me.</li>
    <li> Great product,  I use it daily, and have been for about 6 months now....best I&#x27;ve used. Excellent fast shipping. Will use this seller again</li>
    <li> not bad at all, for the price. there is enough for me, my son, and my grandson&#x27;s,it&#x27;s outstanding.Recommend to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this pomade for my husband. He finds it is the best pomade he ever tried. It keeps his hair in place</li>
    <li> Strong hold. Smell is pretty strong at first, but then it seems to fade away. It does harden up a little like gel. It&#x27;s the second pomade I try so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to. It&#x27;s better than crew though.</li>
    <li> Great deal and the pomade is perfect my styling your hair. Also if you want to restlye your hair just wet the comb just a little and do it again.</li>
    <li> I had used the regular Suavecito pomade for awhile. I wanted to buy a few at a time to stock up and decided I would try the Firme/Strong Hold. It&#x27;s a little thicker when applying and helps make it easier for styling. Same nice smell and washes out easy. When dry it does have a harder hold so less chance for getting messed up.</li>
    <li> Great product, one of my favorite pomades</li>
    <li> This product is great, I prefer to use it over all other pomades.</li>
    <li> I use nothing else!  Holds my hairs in place with the windows down.  The best</li>
    <li> Holds like it needs to and dries almost like gel.  All it takes is a little bit of water and becomes workable again.  Washes right out without any issues.</li>
    <li> This product has great hold, though it is water soluble so it does harden up. Add some water and you&#x27;re good to go again.</li>
    <li> Best pomade on the market. Nice job 714!</li>
    <li> The best pomade out there - buy with confidence!!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Non greasy, hold the hair all day and has a subtle sweet smell to it; it&#x27;s a wonderful product that I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time. I really love this Suavecito Pomade.</li>
    <li> Best pomade for curly and/or thick hair</li>
    <li> By far the best hair pomade. Firm and when you wash your hair comes right off</li>
    <li> Awesome product and great service!!</li>
    <li> Best Pomade on the market</li>
    <li> awesome stuff, and smells good as well. The price is on the high side, but worth it. my barber shop turned me on to this.</li>
    <li> Love the product. It keeps the right amount of gold without crusting hard like other hair products.</li>
    <li> Great gift, great price....</li>
    <li> Received these a couple days earlier than expected. Will definitely being ordering again.</li>
    <li> good produce and price .. same as crewpomade... and hold well</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, great product. Works more like a medium hold.</li>
    <li> Great hold but I do not like the smell. Sad because it is the best hold of any product I have found, and at a reasonable price. But, I find I will only use it under certain conditions depending on where I am going to be because the smell is so strong. Plus it reminds me of my grandpa, and the smell of his hair. I sooooo wish the company had the same product with a different smell! That would be awesome.</li>
    <li> Its the best pomande in the world!</li>
    <li> The strong/firme hold is perfect for me! I have thick, straight hair that has volume and I previously got sent the wrong item from another, different seller. The regular Suavecito does hold well, but for those who live in humid areas and such I&#x27;d find that my hair would start to get soft and some hairs would get out of place by the end of the day. With the Strong/Firme hold my hair stays all day and washes out in a breeze since it&#x27;s water based. Same, awesome smell as well. When applying I find that the strong hold takes a bit more effort to work in than the regular hold. If you have hair like mine that will not stay in place due to hair type then I&#x27;d suggest you try this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tapered sides that comb back and on top is a side comb pompadour for reference.</li>
    <li> because sometimes you just cant have enough, lol got it to me fast great condition</li>
    <li> Best pomade I&#x27;ve ever used. Washes out easy and holds my super curly hair straight back. I&#x27;ve tried them all but Suavecito is superior.</li>
    <li> Great Product and Delivered on Time</li>
    <li> Suavecito has a great strong hold. Im very surprised as I put it to the test. I play softball and I usually dont wear a hat. I play double headers and even after the game I can pull out my comb, style my hair and within a few minutes my hair will be combed AND STAY IN PLACE! Now after a few hours of sweating and running around and can finish the night in style. My hair is super thick, wavy and Suavecito trains it, keeps it slicked back and with a little bit of water and a comb or brush you can restyle your hair. one time use for a full days Style..  Stop buying junk 99cent gels or other pomades. This product is legit and YES I always refer my friends to it. After all Gentleman, we have to look good for the ladies..</li>
    <li> This is really bad for your hair, really ruins it</li>
    <li> One of best Pomade in the market. I tried many, perhaps 10 or more in past years and this so far is the best. I would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Best pomade out there.</li>
    <li> Great hold, easy to use and looks great. Pleasant smell. Washes out easily.</li>
    <li> More bang for my buck!</li>
    <li> The best hairstyling product for men ever. I mean EVERRR! Honestly, everything g about this stuff is great. I will use it until it is discontinued.</li>
    <li> Amazing product at a great price. Why did it take me so long to find this stuff?</li>
    <li> Strong hold. Smells good. Washes out easy.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying suavecito. When I first bought it I immediately fell in love with it. This is my first time buying the three-pack. I would have bought the larger size but was not in my budget. I would suggest if you are buying this for the first time then buy the small size but since you will love it might as well get the large size.&lt;br /&gt;It is a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;Smell: awesome&lt;br /&gt;Hold: all day&lt;br /&gt;Solubility: washes out easily with water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Best pomade hands down</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this pomade for my man, and he loves the way it makes his hair just right !!! Can not say enough good stuff about this pomade. If you have a short, kept close hair style, You should not go another day without getting this in your hair!</li>
    <li> Great hold for a great price!</li>
    <li> Best hair product ever. Holds everything and wash easily!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best men&#x27;s styling product out. This product will straighten your hair if you have thick wavy/curly hair, like myself. Keeps an awesome hold all day, and if you feel like restyling, just put some water in your hair, restyle, and you&#x27;re good to go! It will go back to the same hold. Lastly, I need to say that the scent is very cool, doesn&#x27;t smell like melted plastic or a pi&amp;ntilde;a colada! It has almost a light coca cola thing going on. I have tried many products my friends, this is awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long term user of American Crew pomade before switching to this product and I am glad to say I am very pleased with this product and happy that I gave it a try because this has replaced American Crew now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a water based pomade so no messy or greasy residue and easy to wash off.  The hold is great and the fragrance very pleasing as well, for me ( fragrance is a matter of personal preference so I am not going to speak for everyone here).  The price is fantastic and you get more pomade than American Crew in each box for much lesser price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this pomade as well as the Layrite Pomade in Strong hold and I equally like both and they are more or less similar in performance and quality except the price factor where Suavecito wins clearly (I believe Layrite runs about $43 for a 3 pack, almost the same as American Crew but 4oz vs 3oz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a fantastic pomade and will replace American crew for me.  Suavecito wins in the price/performance or the value factor for me over Layrite (I might try out Layrite now and then too since I like it equally and it has a different fragrance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bye bye American Crew.  And hello Suavecito.</li>
    <li> I ordered both the original and the strong hold and i was happier with the strong hold as it would hold it longer and it was stiffer so my hair would not move around at all once the pomade dried! but with a bit of water it would be workable again! great smell!</li>
    <li> Great product, the best I&#x27;ve used so far</li>
    <li> Best pomade for a pompadour hairstyle, have tried many pomades and this one is the best so far, it has a great hold and smells really good...</li>
    <li> This is The best hair  pomade out there!! I&#x27;m a biker , so i need something that will hold my hair just the way it looked when I leave home , and this pomade does the job ! Plus it smells good ! My girl likes it. The only problem is , she can&#x27;t run her fingers between my hair, but nobody messes with a greasers  hair period!!.</li>
    <li> This is the best pomade I have ever used in my hair!!! It goes on easy &amp; dries firm but does not flake!!  Delivery was sooner than promised. I highly recommend the product &amp; seller!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, very good quality! Recommended!</li>
    <li> Definitely will order again!!! 👌🏼</li>
    <li> if you want it to hold and stay... this is the product for you ...and the good news .... water soluble .... that is all</li>
    <li> Love the suavecito line! It works for my hair and the style that i want to put it.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping, great price. This pomade is especially great for those who are just starting to use product in their hair. It has a nice hold and smell. Purchase the 3-pack for the value.</li>
    <li> I love this product and would recommend to everyone. Gives me that 40 and 50 th century look which i am looking for.Thank You !!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great it has a musky cologne smell that most people find pleasing. May be a little much for some people but I love it. This pomade holds well and rinses out nicely. I find myself going through this stuff pretty quickly and at $12 a pop it adds up but the product works well. Holds best when used on towel dried hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! My clients can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
    <li> When you wanna slick back your hair, this is an excellent product!!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Great product, it&#x27;s a water-based product, so it washes out easy. Has a great hold &amp; a great smell.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t bother going through what has already been said about Suavecito but will give a side by side comparison of Original vs. Strong Hold based on my impressions. I&#x27;ve used both but prefer the Strong Hold version. Reference point, I have long straight hair on top with skin fades on sides and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Hold: I&#x27;ve noticed this works well when applied to dry hair and the same amount of hold can be achieved similar to Strong Hold if more pomade is used. Exceptional hold, more shine, and washes out easily with shampoo with no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strong Hold: This version tends to style easier with slightly damp hair. I&#x27;ve tried using this with dry hair and noticed more &amp;#34;resistance&amp;#34; when trying to style my hair. With Strong Hold, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of pomade to get the hold needed. This version has slightly less shine compared to Original and also washes out easily. Between the two I prefer Strong hold because I don&#x27;t have to use as much and has less shine.</li>
    <li> Strong hold, easy to wash out. Best water- based pomade out there!</li>
    <li> Great product.! Like the fast shipping and will be buying more I&#x27;m a couple weeks;)</li>
    <li> great smell good hold, save even more with the value pack</li>
    <li> Love this.... Amazing i love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t flake doesnt clump... And they days i dont wanna wash my hair i just wet my comb and re activate it... As a cosmetologist i recommend this</li>
    <li> Great product. This holds up all day or night. If it rains and gets wet it will continue to hold, beats gel, moose, hair spray any day. Highly Reccomend.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product repeatedly.  It is my go-to pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.  I received the shipment in a timely fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the product, and have been purchasing it for about two years now.</li>
    <li> This is more like a reduced hair gel than a pomade. It sticks like cement, and if you run your fingers through your hair after it has set, you break the bonds and your hair falls flat again. And even worse, it has this awful musky smell that was stuck in my hair for days. I woke up in the middle of the night because of the smell. Its literally like thickened hair gel.</li>
