<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Work great - great price!</li>
    <li> Came exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered replacement brushheads from Amazon (sold by Amazon) before with no issues, this order was different.  While I do like these for the first use, I&#x27;ve noticed that they do not fade after use as my previous ones and, even though I clean it thoroughly after each use and use the same Crest toothpaste, they are very stiff upon next use.  Not sure if I&#x27;ve just received a bad order.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted... I was not sure if it would be the right heads or not... Very happy they were.</li>
    <li> Product was received in a timely manner and ss described.  Worked well.</li>
    <li> I have had difficulty locating the Oral-B Dual Clean Replacement Heads at an affordable price. I was pleasantly pleased with both the price and the number of head included. I would definitely order this item again in the future.</li>
    <li> Love these brush heads and have been using them for several years.  We have been unable to find them in our local stores, so will be ordering more of them from Amazon in the future.</li>
    <li> These really clean my teeth well.</li>
    <li> great price and love the brushes.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing like original equipment.  These fit.</li>
    <li> We don&#x27;t like it as much because of its larger size, but it does an excellent job cleaning your teeth.</li>
    <li> Great replacement heads for our electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Secondary (lower) brush always falls off after few weeks usage. Don&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used these before and they work well.  The price was right for 6 brushes.</li>
    <li> I ordered a couple of packages of 6. Now I am set for the year. I replace the brushes on my electric toothbrush monthly. This is way more convenient than picking them up at the supermarket a couple at a time all year long, and the price is better. What did we ever do before we had Amazon?</li>
    <li> The replacement heads fit my toothbrush exactly. I have the Brauch electric brush that I&#x27;ve had for 8 years. Will buy them again.</li>
    <li> Repeat purchase. There are very hard to find in stores for our chargeable toothbrushes. So these work perfectly and aren&#x27;t the cheap ones that everyone say that fall apart.</li>
    <li> Had a hard time finding these with the dual clean.  So happy I did and a good price too.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with Oral B dual brush replacement.  Mouth feels clean and fresh&lt;br /&gt;like I have been to the dentist every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I have used the Oral-B toothbrushes for years and have determined that the dual-clean brushes are the best for me.  As with all commercial products, it is a chore to open the packaging.  I would recommend this replacement product.</li>
    <li> Actually, I was desperate and finally tried Amazon.  Bought my toothbrush in Arizona and quickly found&lt;br /&gt;NO PLACE here in Seattle/Bellevue/Kirkland area caries it.  I suspect Oral-B makes them differently&lt;br /&gt;in each state.  NEVER again will I buy anything in any other state that I can&#x27;t get replaced here.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your help.  When these wear out, I&#x27;ll buy a new powered brush either from you or&lt;br /&gt;Costco.  Vandla Julnes</li>
    <li> they work! that&#x27;s ALL they need to do. One order of this type of material previously was a sham, total waste of my money for 12 useless units that I ended up throwing out!! have never heard or seen anything about that item since.</li>
    <li> Much better than the standard units that ship with the Oral-B electric &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Fits my Braun electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> not my favorite heads.  large</li>
    <li> A good refill for my Electric Toothbrush.  I couldn&#x27;t find the refills where I bought my toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
    <li> Worked perfrct like an original</li>
    <li> After searching all the drug stores in my area and the Walmarts where I bought the Brush for replacement heads, I went to amazon.  Not only did they have it, but it was cheaper than the one that I bought when I first bought the electric toothbrush.  So I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
    <li> I received this product within the expected time frame and it was exactly what I wanted. This type of brush head is a great product, which does a very good job and is durable enough to last. It&#x27;s only draw back being that it is quite pricey if bought by the individual head or dual package. So when I saw that it was available in a six pack at quite a large savings verses the smaller quantity packages, I opted for its purchase.</li>
    <li> If you can&#x27;t find the replacements, you can&#x27;t use the toothbrush!! Thanks for carrying this particular brush. You can sometimes find them, however, have to really look for them.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly, I and my wife feel like our teeth are cleaner using this new style tip which has two moving brush heads  (rather than the single circular head we&#x27;ve been used to).  The added bulk of the extra brushing head took a few days to accept but the results were worth it.</li>
    <li> They are really great! Much better than the small circle ones!!! Highly recommend this Oral B dual clean brush heads!!</li>
    <li> these brushes clean better than the regular round brushes,at least in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Brush works as expected. Yes it is definitely bigger than the original one but I like it. It would not be the right size for a child, but for an adult it is perfect.</li>
    <li> Best price hands down</li>
    <li> was pleasantly surprised with the quality. These are german made. Perfect fit and appear very well made. Will keep buying.</li>
    <li> Do a great job - much better than the standard Oral-B brush.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these toothbrush heads in the store any longer, so I ordered this package of 6.  Love the dual heads, make my teeth feel super clean.</li>
    <li> Just like the original that came with my Oral-B. Perfect.</li>
    <li> I now have a years supply at a great price!</li>
    <li> When I could not find these brush heads in our local stores, I was pleased to find them at Amazon and the price is great.  These brush heads fit perfect, stay on, and last a long time.  We are now stocked up for the year!</li>
    <li> I have used Oral-B for years and need a bigger brush!&lt;br /&gt;So glad I found them at such a great price!</li>
    <li> After my 8-month old Phillips electric toothbrush died,  I decided to go back to the old reliable craftsmanship of Oral-B.  We have had all the iterations of an Oral-B electric toothbrush since 1995, and I still have those and they still work but my family tend to like to shift to a newer and better product each time, so yes we have upgraded several times since and never looked back.  Until I enticed myself to try the Phillips Sonicaire which people swore to.  Well, I did swear, to NEVER BUY PHILLIPS SONICAIRE ever again, but that is another story.  Oral-B, best bang for the buck,  and your pearly whites will be sustained, for the rest of your life if you let it.  Just a note:  I now have grandchildren who are aged 5 yrs and under.  I do not recommend introducing them to an electric toothbrush of this caliber at that age, as my grandson said &amp;#34;it&#x27;s rough Grandma&amp;#34;.  So try the battery operated one with the small round brush handle for those wee teeth to get them used to the sensation.</li>
    <li> Excellent deal for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried generic heads, from CVS, but the spring fails before the heads need to be replaced.  These OEM heads are better built and the bristles are a bit stiffer, resulting in a more thorough cleaning.  They are worth the slightly higher cost.</li>
    <li> Great buy and shipping reasonable. Just what I ordered.</li>
    <li> These were exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;The original thing. Not imitation.&lt;br /&gt;A good value.</li>
    <li> Been buying these from Amazon for years. Never had a problem.  Price is right.&lt;br /&gt;These last if you dont press hard against your teeth.</li>
    <li> The best of all the different types of Oral B brushes.  I&#x27;ve tried both generic and OEM brushes and these do the best job on cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> I have used these brushes for years and love them</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and excellent Electric Tooth Brush Heads. I would suggest this product for purchase and the quantity is great.</li>
    <li> Is there anything better than a new toothbrush head?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, yes there is, lots and lots of things, but toothbrush heads are pretty darn nice anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Oral-B Braun rechargeable toothbrush. It&#x27;s probably a Vitality but there&#x27;s no markings ANYWHERE that tells me what it is. It came with the Deep Sweep head and it&#x27;s ok, but I prefer these. Happily, they worked just great and today my mouth is happy. I haven&#x27;t even cursed today.</li>
    <li> Great Value and Offer!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product. I love my oral b toothbrush and these heads offer a great clean brushing!</li>
    <li> I like the dual brush heads.  They are the best.  Amazon is the cheapest place to buy these according to my research.  I will buy these again.  Great deal.</li>
    <li> I have the precision clean toothbrush, and these fit my brush perfectly. The dual action brush head works marvelously. I highly recommend getting these if you need a replacement head!</li>
    <li> Had them before that&#x27;s why I bought them, which means, if I had not been pleased, I would not have purchased them again. They do a good job.</li>
    <li> The oral b toothbrush is a good value aid to dental hygiene.  The six pack  of replacement brushes is the most economical way to maintain the effectiveness of the equipment.  They work well they came quickly and they cost much less than the individual replacements available locally</li>
    <li> Awesome deal, better than at the local stores thats for sure! The price was lower and I recieved them fast!</li>
    <li> I bought an off brand because I hate paying for these refills and they didn&#x27;t work well. These are the real thing at the best price I&#x27;ve found anywhere. No cavities in my family since we stayed using the oral b power brushes.  Mine is an older model but these work great. Will buy more. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than similar products in the brick-and-morter stores, and more convenient. Fits the Braun plak control ultra well. The color indicator that lets you know when to change brushes is helpful.</li>
    <li> These seem to affect the main unit.  My unit&#x27;s battery would wind down far quicker than before.  Eventually, I threw them out since they were affecting the life of the charge.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are durable and well worth the extra money compared to the generic brands. You can be assured of at least 3 months of good cleaning per brush. Also these particular ones work better at cleaning the back teeth since they have a second bristle head that works just as the first. I would recommend getting these for you general tooth brushing and the flossing head for getting in the areas between teeth. I made this a four star rating hoping you would read it.</li>
    <li> Great price for these brush heads. I have ordered them several times and I am pleased with the quality.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Love the way these make my mouth feel after brushing. They have 2 brushes, 1 spins and the other doesn&#x27;t. They work together to give the teeth and gums a good cleaning. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> So far, so good,  Does a good job of cleaning my teeth</li>
    <li> Its a replacement brush from Oral B and not from some generic brand. Works exactly as expected. No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> This is the way to go; get twice the brushing action for the same time.</li>
    <li> Original replacement parts. These heads are a little bit cheaper than what you can find at a store. Good quality</li>
    <li> Really beats a single brush on the tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great buy much better price then in stores</li>
    <li> I love that I can buy these in packages online because in the store they are so much more expensive. These are at a great price and they work great too.</li>
    <li> Great price for this product</li>
    <li> I need it so much&lt;br /&gt;I love it&lt;br /&gt;thank you&lt;br /&gt;so much for every things&lt;br /&gt;you did for me&lt;br /&gt;I am glad to work with you</li>
    <li> I like the way these get my teeth clean.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, it takes much less time to do better brushing, love them. I wish they will become more affordable!</li>
    <li> My wife and I use a Braun Professional Care toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Dual Clean she uses the Floss Action (due to size).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are great at giving a superlative cleaning!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous find.  I couldn&#x27;t find dual head replacement brushes in the stores and was delighted to be able to get them on line.</li>
    <li> It better than the on I have3 before</li>
    <li> Best price ever for these replacement heads.  I gave them 4 stars because I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll have the same issue others have experienced with the bottom brush coming off.  I have NEVER had this happen with any heads I&#x27;ve bought in a store.  Time will tell if that happens with any of these.  Maybe I just know how to use them correctly.  Two weeks of use &amp; no issues so far.</li>
    <li> these are my 5th order.</li>
    <li> These dual clean brush heads are much better than the single type. They last a very long time, &amp; get your teeth really clean. Very good product.</li>
    <li> These work great with my Oral-B professional electric toothbrush. I don&#x27;t have any issues with the performance. They also are a great value. My main issue was the fact that the heads are bigger than most I have used previously. They&#x27;re almost twice as big it seems. Next time I&#x27;ll make sure that I get some heads that I&#x27;ve used in the past and am more comfortable with. If you don&#x27;t mind the size of the heads, then the performance and value make these a good purchase.</li>
    <li> We have several electric toothbrushes and had been using the single-function heads like the ones that came with them. I decided to try new styles of heads before buying new bases and am glad I did! These totally changed the tooth brushes. They act just like much more expensive models now and the whole family is using them. I&#x27;ll continue buying these as long as the bases hold out.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I really like the dual brushes--they seem to clean better. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product online as I was unable to easily find the dual replacement brush heads in the store. I have always used the twin-head brushes on my Oral B toothbrush and been impressed with the level of cleanliness of my teeth. At my last oral hygiene checkup the hygenist commented that it was evident from my excellent gums and teeth that I did brush with an electric toothbrush with deep cleaning penetration.</li>
    <li> As long as it was an official Oral-B product and not opened or anything, nothing bad to say here, and I got it for a great price!</li>
    <li> Be careful there are some that are not genuine Oral-B parts. These worked fine. Color assortment of rings to keep everyone&#x27;s identified.</li>
    <li> These dual brush heads do a very thorough job of cleaning in all areas of your teeth.  Messages your gum line and teeth sparkling. Great product.</li>
    <li> I really like the dual heads the best of all the Oral-B heads, and this was definitely was the best price.</li>
    <li> We love this brush head and the price is great compared to buying in them in a store. Great buy!</li>
    <li> These bigger brushes work better than the smaller ones.  More friction and surface area.  My teeth feel cleaner after brushing.</li>
    <li> Good price, work great.</li>
    <li> Perfect product. Was not a knock off product like many advertised. They last a long time if you alternate between heads also.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product at great price</li>
    <li> Best to get original brand then the third party, you get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  Works great  just like the heads I used to be able to get at Walmart but cannot anymore.</li>
    <li> I order these all the time from Amazon. The price is great and work fantastic with my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Replaced heads were too expensive</li>
    <li> These are very hard to find.......well impossible in my area. My wife and I like the dual cleaning this brush provides. I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon. BTW: These are ACTUAL Oral-B not fakes.</li>
    <li> These things are great, don&#x27;t ever go off and buy the cheap generic brand, unless you want it to break after the 4th or 5th wash.  With these brushes I get about a good 3 month worth of brushing before having to replace them</li>
    <li> These are genuine Braun heads, the same heads that come on a new toothbrush.  For the difference in price between these genuine heads and the cheaper knockoffs, you get better quality and longer life.  I usually look for a lower price option when ordering a product, and sometimes it pays off.  But not always, and this is one of those times.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery! Exactly the correct product... I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
    <li> Very good product very good investment for my prodject. Im very happy i found and bought this item. Good item for my project makes me proud to have found this</li>
    <li> I have had my electric toothbrush for years and only in the last few noticed they made heads that are different styles other than the one round circle that I had been using for ages.  These are a great design - I feel like I am getting more coverage as I brush than I do on those small round hears - and yet these heads are small enough so they don&#x27;t feel too large when you are brushing - this item was also much less expensive than I have seen them selling for elsewhere and you can be assured they are made by Oral B.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Oral-B replacement brushes from this vendor are as good as the ones that came with the toothbrush, and the price is much better than what you&#x27;d find at your local pharmacy. even for a multi-pack.</li>
    <li> price was appropriate. arrived as promised.  good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Generic brushes claimed to be soft bristle but they are hard and I can&#x27;t use them.  Tore my gums up!  I will be returning these.</li>
    <li> I really like these dual brush heads.  I couldn&#x27;t find them in the store and I&#x27;ve been looking for a year and decided to try Amazon.  When i saw them on the site I immediately ordered them and they arrived in a few days.  I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> i finally found a replacement brush, whew! I&#x27;ve looked all over and no luck. thank you for stocking it here, now i have 5 extra and price is not too bad.</li>
    <li> I love the double heads...it makes my mouth feel &amp;#34;dentist-office&amp;#34; clean every time I use it.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> there good  I would recomend</li>
    <li> First time I tried this particular product compared to the other smaller round head only version. In comparison, this one cleans ok, but revolutions seem slower, probable because two heads need to be operated. I will probably go back to the smaller version with the round head only next time</li>
    <li> Excellent!  The brand was a better choice for me. After reading about the generic brands I didn&#x27;t want to take a chance on the item breaking on me. So I knew the brand would be best and also I only used the brand  new in the beginning.</li>
    <li> I have been using these brush head for over five years and has never been disappointed.  Even though I live in HK I still get them from across the miles; or when traveling back home to the US.</li>
    <li> This product is great. The dual head makes brushing more thorough. The price was the best I could find anywhere. My order was received in a timely manner and in good condition. I will be ordering these again.</li>
    <li> Amazon.com is the Earth&#x27;s Most Customer-Centric Company.Best!!!!!</li>
    <li> A little small for polishing my shoes but they get the job done.....................eventually.</li>
    <li> I have been using them for a month. They work great cleaning and massaging my gums. It is so important for your gums to be massaged more blood flow to the gums less problems in the future.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t abuse the brush head since I brush lightly two times for two minutes a day. My routine involves a balance regime of mouth rinse and floss in addition to brushing.  100% of the time, the bottom half of the brush will break off leaving you with a regular top half brush which I could have purchased elsewhere for much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the time, when the bottom half breaks off, my brush head is still new- meaning no discoloring of the bristles or bending of it (just to show that I&#x27;m not using these brushes for more then 4-6 months).</li>
    <li> These heads fit perfect. These Particular replacement heads are hard to find so its nice to get six at a time.</li>
    <li> I love the dual head which I can&#x27;t seem to find in any of my retail outlets. Plus this is a great price!</li>
    <li> This was a good idea. I got the same brushes that I would get at my local pharmacy but I got them a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> Fast service from the seller.  A++++  Would definitely purchase from them again.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I use these and are quite pleased with them.  These toothbrush heads have two heads of bristles instead of just the one that comes with the toothbrush.  We have both had good check ups at the dentist, so we will keep on using these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using these brushes on my Vitality toothbrush.  My wife doesn&#x27;t think they are as good as the Oral B replacement brushes and I had to get the Oral B&#x27;s for her.  These are &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  She claims these brushes are not gentle enough on her mouth.  Go figure.  They sure are a bargain</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a fraction of the cost of one purchaed from a retail store. Fit well and worked great, just as expected.</li>
    <li> i have ordered before and really like it. i like to keep a few spare.</li>
    <li> Cleans so much better than the small basic brush!</li>
    <li> The real thing! Work great!&lt;br /&gt;Of course there are cheaper options, but does it hold as long as the brand?</li>
    <li> Delivery could have been a little faster, but very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> Was afraid to try the generic.  Stuck with the Brand Name Oral-B that I know works well with the Oral-B electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;They do a good job and last a long time.</li>
    <li> We have used Oral B products since the early 70s and have always thought the items bought over the years were the best in this industry.</li>
    <li> I personally find these to be the best model/style of Oral B electric toothbrush heads as they cover a lot more area and have a better feel to them. This is the second batch of this type of head I have purchased and I don&#x27;t intend to change to a different one at this point! The five pack is a good deal, even when compared to the prices of similar packs at wholesale clubs.</li>
    <li> I love the Oral B professional Dual clean replacement heads...I only use this one I have try just the single head ones but I really like this one cause it feels like a manual toothbrush but wayyyyy better.  I will definitely purchase from amazon again when I need more replacements.  This is way cheaper than buying from the local Target, Walmart or CVS</li>
    <li> its original and perfect. i haen&#x27;t use any of them yet. thet are exactly what i expected, exactly ehat the picture shows.</li>
    <li> They work perfectly.  I am very satisfied with the product and the quick service.</li>
    <li> Most economical I could find online.</li>
    <li> Great product. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love these brush heads, a good buy for sure.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I was using the Oral-B pro white head replacements until now and decided to go for something similar to a manual toothbrush as the circle heads where irritating my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not so big, feels like a normal toothbrush and cleans way better that other Oral-B replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had with it is that it won&#x27;t fit my toothbrush case anymore as it was designed for the circled heads, but not an issue.</li>
    <li> I like the dual headed brush because it cleans more teeth at one time.  Feels like a regular toothbrush size.  The vibrating action is excellent.</li>
    <li> Replacement brushes are just what I needed and they work great. Price was right and as always packaging was perfect and shipping was fat.</li>
    <li> Works just like the brand named kind.  They are less expensive too! I would by them again for my OralB Vitality.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy the cheap imitation off bread replacement brushes as the brissles fall out.  These don&#x27;t and they have worked perfectly thus far.</li>
    <li> My Oral B is going on four years old and this is the brush head I have found most useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one that promises to polish...OK but it really didn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything  I could see as an improvement--and that was trying with something like a 5 power magnifying mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small head that was the regular go to guy, just seemed to work in a really small area before it could be moved on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Oral B came out with this bad boy. Covers a big area, seems to do a lot of stuff, makes me feel each tooth is getting more attention in its 30 second a side block of time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a good idea; I&#x27;m kind of surprised that they didn&#x27;t offer it from the get go.</li>
    <li> It pays to buy in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;Someone wrote, &amp;#34;don&#x27;t buy these it is cheaper just to buy a new toothbrush.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;HOGWASH!&lt;br /&gt;Whoever wrote that either does not own a calculator - OR - is VERY poor in simple mathematics.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE WAY TO GO!  BELIEVE ME.</li>
    <li> It fit the Vitality model that I have and I really like the dual action works great to get at all surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;Price is good, I have seen them for 19.95 for just two.&lt;br /&gt;All around a good deal for a great brush.&lt;br /&gt; I wish they would make it clearer that these do fit my plain model Vitality from Oral B made by Braun, as it only states it does not fit the other Vitality model that I don&#x27;t have and makes you feel like there is a big doubt that it will fit any Vitality model at all.</li>
    <li> I love Oral B electrics - my dentist does, too. Getting 6 heads at a shot is a huge bargain. My wife and I are set for two years!</li>
    <li> I received the repleacement brush heads in the mail after two days, just as expected.  They were absolutely perfect in quality, only they happened to be half the price of what was being sold at my local convenience store.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> you gotta get Oral be replacements........... there is no other option........ the others do not work.......</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these in the retail stores around our area anymore so was so glad to find them available on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve tried the generic brands but they are inferior to the real thing.  Generics don&#x27;t last very long, the rotating head stops working after about a month.  So glad to be reunited with Oral-B!!</li>
    <li> I only buy these online. Wayyyyy bettter price than in store. I can get 6 of these for the price of 2 in a store. Great quality product!</li>
    <li> Oral B Professional replacement brushes are hard to come by - if you are looking for a decent deal.  Purchased them on Amazon at what I thought was a great price.</li>
    <li> These dual clean brush heads are impossible to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully they are available online in bulk. And at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Best Price I could find. I did not need anything else at this time. I will search this site for any other purchases I need.</li>
    <li> Original replacements at a decent price.  What more is there to say?!!!</li>
    <li> These work nicely, and they clean my teeth better than the ones with just the circular top portion. I can still maneuver the toothbrush around each tooth, as it isn&#x27;t too bulky, but I can clean more surface area in the same amount of time.</li>
    <li> i like how this brush head covers more surface area than the ones that come default with the oral-b 1000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so far so good, 6 should last a pretty long time so i find this value for money.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product priced right</li>
    <li> Good replacement heads, works fine, a little tough to get on.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my order!</li>
    <li> Worth buying....good replacements.</li>
    <li> The 6 pack works well, fits my tooth brush and is a better deal than the  3 pack. I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush forever, very pleased.</li>
    <li> These are great! what more could I say for a brush head, other than that you get the best price here on Amazon! We have been buying these for 2-3 yrs now, and yet to have any issue, it comes on time, the quality is consistent, and never break on us.</li>
    <li> These are hard to find in stores.  Got it on Amazon for a good price. Work as expected.</li>
    <li> Cool stuff at cool price.</li>
    <li> As Advertised ... would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> cheap and work just fine.</li>
    <li> I have been using Oral B rechargeable toothbrushes  for 20+ years now.  I was told by my  dentist that I needed to make my gum care VERY important.  I saw some commercials about the Oral B rechargable toothbrush and figured that I would try one out.  They give very consistent rotation so you can maintain constant pressure, you don&#x27;t have to worry about how fast you move because as long as you charge the brush 1-2 times a week you will keep good battery life.  I&#x27;ll admit that I THOUGHT that the price was high, but refills don&#x27;t cost much more than a lot of the better brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a great difference between the single rotating head and the dual action head with up and down vertical motion.  All you have to do is rotate the head from front, over the top to the rear, as I said before no need to worry about anything about pressure, and where you want the brush to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just tried the Oral B Hummingbird, not too bad (I HATE FLOSSING) so lets see how much more I will do that.</li>
    <li> Great brushes and value!!  Will buy them again!  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> The dual clean is the brush I&#x27;ve used for years and much prefer.  I just wish they were much more inexpensive and seem pricey for what they are.</li>
    <li> I love this item and it availability. This is the kind of item that comes handy and is a must have, if you own the prescribed toothbrush that it&#x27;s intended for.</li>
    <li> These will clean your teeth.  Good thing &#x27;cause that&#x27;s why I bought &#x27;em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using this product for years but is seems to have gone off the retail selves, so I&#x27;m buyin&#x27; &#x27;em online.</li>
    <li> Good Provider, just as advertised</li>
    <li> Been ordering these from Amazon for a few years.  It&#x27;s the same brand I&#x27;ve been using.  Much cheaper than buying in singles or threes.</li>
    <li> They were a replacement and prolong the life of my electric toothbrush. i.</li>
    <li> what can I say,  this is the best system available</li>
    <li> The dual action of these brushes is the best of all Oral-B type brushes.  I&#x27;ve tried the others, but prefer the dual action.</li>
    <li> We had never tried the dual before. Even in the first brushing, I could tell they were going to make my teeth whiter. They feel cleaner and look whiter after about a week. I will use this brush head from now on. (It&#x27;s a bit bigger than I was used to, but worth it. I don&#x27;t know, though, if it might be too big for a child.) Great price for the larger quantity too!</li>
    <li> Arrived within the estimated shipping time and I was very pleased since I was having to use one of the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; size, small heads on my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Good quality for a good price</li>
    <li> I believe these are original. Not like the other cheap versions of it</li>
    <li> Love my Oral-B and this brush in particular.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time as promised..happy brushing..item is in perfect condition and Imwill be back to order more when needed</li>
    <li> Brought back two electric toothbrushes now that I found these.</li>
    <li> Looks to be genuine Oral-B brush heads, (amazon was the seller) seems they are only sending one color ring now.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, they clean better compared to the smaller Floss Action ones so no complaints.</li>
    <li> Using the two heads works great.  Far better than the one movement.  Really cleans your teeth and leaves your mouth refreshed.</li>
