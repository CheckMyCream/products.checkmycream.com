      <li>this is the most amazing moisturizer i have tried.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s one of my favorite products ever.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite all season moisturizers.</li>
      <li>I love the texture of this cream--it glides over the skin without pulling.</li>
      <li>but I use more at night</li>
      <li>THis stuff is OK.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is really lovely moisturizer, but the real key is: it&#x27;s a superb no-wash eye-makeup remover too!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend it and if you get it and don&#x27;t like using it on your face, I find that it&#x27;s great for arms and elbows!</li>
      <li>Love this moisterizer</li>
      <li>love it its so moisturizing</li>
      <li>Super easy and good for your skin to boot.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s that magical blend of intense moisturizing without being greasy.</li>

      <li>A bit on the heavier side, but great for everyday use</li>
      <li>I have tried many types of moisturizers throughout my years and this is the one that I&#x27;ll be sticking with as long as they keep making it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and its one of my faves; What I particularly like is having the option to purchase a &#x27;two-pack&#x27; at a better price which allows me to stockpile for future use.</li>
      <li>This embryolisse does the trick and has not broken me out once.</li>
      <li>and I really like how my skin feels after.</li>
      <li>They arrive quickly and were the exact same cream I usually pay more for.  </li>
      <li>The french certainly know their stuff.</li>
      <li>My concern was completely unwarranted.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still a vital part of my daily routine.</li>
      <li>Put a little on a soft flat cotton pad, and wipe your eye makeup right off.</li>
      <li>Would recommend to anyone with normal to severely dry</li>
      <li>I had not seen it offered this way in previous years; Thanks for offering this in the 2Pack!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s back to the old CLinique yellow lotion for me!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to do that with this tube and because the product is on the expensive side (for me), I&#x27;d like to get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>I have normal skin with an oily T-zone and this gives me a good base for makeup without making my skin look oily.</li>

    <li> I have severely dry and dehydrated skin. This is great second layer of moisture in the morning. (Moisturizer, sunscreen and then embryollise). I use in place of a primer and it does a great job of priming my face and adding an extra layer of moisture. Would recommend to anyone with normal to severely dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that bugs me - I wish the packaging was different. The metal tube is annoying as I usually cut open my bottles to use every last drop. It&#x27;s kind of hard to do that with this tube and because the product is on the expensive side (for me), I&#x27;d like to get my money&#x27;s worth.I did manage to get one open today and I have at least three more days of product that otherwise would have been thrown away. :(</li>
    <li> love it its so moisturizing</li>
    <li> Purchased this in Paris and so happy I can order it here when I&#x27;m in USA.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
    <li> THis stuff is OK.  It does have a greasy feel &#x3D; wait an hour to put your make-up on.  It&#x27;s back to the old CLinique yellow lotion for me!</li>
    <li> This has become a staple in my daily/nightly skincare routine. I live in a cold climate and even tho my skin tends to occasionally break out in my T-zone, it&#x27;s really dry in the winter. This embryolisse does the trick and has not broken me out once. I use less during the day if I am putting makeup on because it can look a little greasy but I use more at night and I really like how my skin feels after. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now and it&#x27;s one of my favorite products ever. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it and if you get it and don&#x27;t like using it on your face, I find that it&#x27;s great for arms and elbows!</li>
    <li> I have tried many types of moisturizers throughout my years and this is the one that I&#x27;ll be sticking with as long as they keep making it. It&#x27;s that magical blend of intense moisturizing without being greasy. In the winter it&#x27;s about the only thing I&#x27;ve found that keeps my skin from flaking. In the summer I use less of the product but it&#x27;s still a vital part of my daily routine. 5 stars all the way across the board.</li>
    <li> Great product! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I love this cream!! When I ordered it on Amazon I was skeptical that it would be the same product I normally buy in speciality stores.  My concern was completely unwarranted.  They arrive quickly and were the exact same cream I usually pay more for.  I was very pleased with this product and this seller.  I would order again but they last so long it will be a while.</li>
    <li> I have normal skin with an oily T-zone and this gives me a good base for makeup without making my skin look oily. Great product! I also use this combined with a Vitamin E capsule at night as a skin treatment, it works wonders.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really lovely moisturizer, but the real key is: it&#x27;s a superb no-wash eye-makeup remover too! Put a little on a soft flat cotton pad, and wipe your eye makeup right off. Super easy and good for your skin to boot.</li>
    <li> Love this moisterizer</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite all season moisturizers. The french certainly know their stuff. Its work the $20 per bottle-it will last a couple months!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and great price point. Never let&#x27;s me down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and its one of my faves; What I particularly like is having the option to purchase a &#x27;two-pack&#x27; at a better price which allows me to stockpile for future use. I had not seen it offered this way in previous years; Thanks for offering this in the 2Pack!</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this product for me a year ago and I have run out. So when I found it online I bought 2. My daughter is a part-time make-up artist and said this would help my make-up to stay on and last all day. She wasn&#x27;t kidding. it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> Very good for my skin. My skin is dry, and usually creams not solve my problem. This one is great! I like it.</li>
    <li> this is the most amazing moisturizer i have tried. Smells fresh and light. A bit on the heavier side, but great for everyday use</li>
    <li> Wonderful lotion, very gentle</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some time.  Love it most in the winter when the skin on my face has a tendency to be dry.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this cream--it glides over the skin without pulling.</li>
