      <li>LOVE THEM!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with the quality of these scissors, and while the listing doesn&#x27;t mention it, they are the top of three quality tiers offered by this Solingen, Germany-based manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>Everything is great about this pair of super scissors.</li>
      <li>in all, these scissors were an inexpensive way for me to see if Solingen steel its praise and premium prices; so far, I&#x27;m happy with them!</li>
      <li>This is a nice strong pair of nail scissors.  </li>
      <li>It would be a lot easier to compare their products if the manufacturer included the quality tier in the product information; I doubt many or any of the sets are \\&quot;F\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased.</li>
      <li>Since they are nickel plated they are not a shiny silver but a nice light silver color.  </li>
      <li>Quality looks ok.</li>
      <li>I have better control and can do a better clip job.  </li>
      <li>I have since bought this one and LOVE it.</li>
      <li>They cut well -- much better than what you would get at a drug store or Target.  </li>
      <li>Three Swords pair is handsome in unpolished metal (a matte finish).  </li>
      <li>The build quality is simply the best I have had</li>
      <li>am from Germany, and I have always been satisfied with products made in Solingen.</li>
      <li>Good quality, large eyelets and sturdy construction.  </li>
      <li>Been working great so far.</li>
      <li>They are sharp and line up perfectly and work smoothly.</li>
      <li>Good quality and the best part of these scissors is that the finger holes are large enough for my large fingers to fit into.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care what others may say but in the end, they simply can&#x27;t compete with a great instrument like this.</li>
      <li>Since I can fit my fingers</li>
      <li>I expect this from a cheap product made somewhere in Asia from lower quality materials.</li>
      <li>The size offers good control(while</li>
      <li>Good German engineering.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it still works great.</li>
      <li>The finger holes are much larger than the normal size scissors which is very nice.  </li>
      <li>These are great little scissors.</li>
      <li>Worth the moulah.</li>
      <li>I had expected a really good scissors, but got one that doesn&#x27;t cut well at all.  </li>
      <li>They are scissors right  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m tired of buying cheap junk from China, so I was happy to find this on Amazon.</li>
      <li>If I lose it (which will happen eventually ;))</li>
      <li>These are German engineered and much better.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m expecting too much given the previous great experience from a &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; scissor.</li>
      <li>Swords\\&quot; scissors and easily cut through my toenails(that other cheap scissors could not cut).</li>
      <li>Great for cutting your finger nails :)</li>
      <li>I had a great pair a long time ago and it was taken away at an airport by the mindless buffoons that think it posed a security risk while dozens of easily accessible metal objects can be found on planes, but no matter.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Strong enough for toe nails.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I don&#x27;t really like this one that much.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>At the price that these scissors were sold you would expect that besides nickel plating these would also be made from stainless steel.    </li>
      <li>Revlon&#x27;s are now cheaply made, though it wasn&#x27;t that long ago that they were well made.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Super hero applications possible!</li>
      <li>These are high quality scissors.  </li>
      <li>High quality.</li>
      <li>This should not happen to a supposedly high quality product that is made in Germany.</li>
      <li>Sharp, sturdy, easy to use.  </li>
      <li>so perhaps it hasn&#x27;t been long enough for many reviews.  </li>
      <li>Their website has a link to \\&quot;our new store on Amazon,\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Easy to hold, very sharp.</li>
      <li>These scissors are very sharp and easy to hold.</li>
      <li>A pair of scissors that actually cuts and doesn&#x27;t feel wobbly after the first use.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to go back and forth to make a cut, they cut the first time.</li>
      <li>Holes are large enough for aged-hands.</li>
      <li>not flat - this is to help cut in a rounded shape, not in straight edges that would require filing.</li>
      <li>And on top of that, they are dull.  </li>
      <li>Wow --</li>
      <li>It is sharp, made out of brushed steel/nickel (it looks, and is of very high quality), and you can even cut the nails on your right hand (I am right-handed) with ease, without bending your nails, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I do value German products for high quality, so it made it easier.</li>
      <li>I bought a pair of Japanese \\&quot;Seki Acrylic Nail Scissors\\&quot;, the blades are actually made from stainless steel.</li>
      <li>Use it for my toenails - nice and sturdy but thin enough to get under the nails.</li>
      <li>The scissors are not sharp.</li>
      <li>but I went back to tighten the old scissor again.</li>
      <li>I expected straight but probably misread the picture on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Does not do a good job of cutting my nails.  </li>
      <li>I am not able to cut my nails without significant sideways force holding the blades from slipping off my fingernails.</li>

<li> so well-constructed, solid and beautifully sharp.</li>
<li> They were extremely rusty the second time I went to use them.</li>

<li> This is undoubtedly the worst manicure scissor I have ever had, which is surprising for a German made product.</li>
<li> These scissors are sharp and cut well.  </li>
<li> Otherwise it&#x27;s sharp and does the job.</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s not as sharp.</li>
<li> However, they&#x27;re quite a bit less sharp than the INOX nail scissors.  </li>
<li> This one does the job for all of my nails without slowing down.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s so difficult to find a decent pair of nail scissors these days.  </li>
<li> I used them for the first time cutting silk wraps.</li>
<li> /&gt;(I was a little concerned by the dozens and dozens of inexpensive sets 3 Swords has listed on Amazon, all with no reviews.  </li>
<li> Just got tired of tightening the screw, so I figured I would give this a try, given that it&#x27;s also made in Germany... same town as wustof?</li>
<li> I was looking for a quality pair of nail scissors (not cuticle) to replace my missing Revlon scissors.  </li>
<li> These nail scissors help round the edges of my toenails as to keep from ingrown nails.</li>

    <li> Poor quality, I thought they were stainless steel, they are &amp;#34;nickel plated mat&amp;#34; finish. They were extremely rusty the second time I went to use them.</li>
    <li> Great! Use it for my toenails - nice and sturdy but thin enough to get under the nails.</li>
    <li> I was searching for Nail Scissors in the US for MONTHS, until I discovered this gem! It is sharp, made out of brushed steel/nickel (it looks, and is of very high quality), and you can even cut the nails on your right hand (I am right-handed) with ease, without bending your nails, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I am from Germany, and I have always been satisfied with products made in Solingen. If I lose it (which will happen eventually ;)) I will buy them again in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> They are scissors right  Seem to be good for the price.  Made in Germany</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I wanted but I didn&#x27;t realize the blades were curved. I expected straight but probably misread the picture on Amazon.  Otherwise it&#x27;s sharp and does the job.</li>
    <li> Been working great so far. No complaints.</li>
    <li> The best scissors I have ever used! Stay away from the junk that drugstores sell. These are German engineered and much better.</li>
    <li> Wow -- so well-constructed, solid and beautifully sharp. You can see tell the precision craftsmanship. Bet I&#x27;ll never have to replace these.</li>
    <li> This is a nice strong pair of nail scissors.  It feels solidly built, yet the blades are not too thick to get under and behind the nails.</li>
    <li> And on top of that, they are dull.  This is undoubtedly the worst manicure scissor I have ever had, which is surprising for a German made product.</li>
    <li> This product is for cutting nails. I am not able to cut my nails without significant sideways force holding the blades from slipping off my fingernails. I don&#x27;t have thick or hard nails. I&#x27;m going back to standard clippers.</li>
    <li> At the price that these scissors were sold you would expect that besides nickel plating these would also be made from stainless steel.    Having used them several times here is what I found:    The Good:    1. These scissors are sharp and cut well.  2. The size offers good control(while I believe the blades could be a bit smaller).  3. Ergonomic - I do not feel any discomfort when using them.    The Not So Good:    While using them I got some dirt on them and had to wash them using regular tap water. The next day after they had dried I noticed that noticeable orange colored water stains had developed on the blades and screw. This should not happen to a supposedly high quality product that is made in Germany. I expect this from a cheap product made somewhere in Asia from lower quality materials. This is the reason I must give this product a 3 star rating.    Update October 2014:    I bought a pair of Japanese \\&quot;Seki Acrylic Nail Scissors\\&quot;, the blades are actually made from stainless steel. They seem to be sharper than these \\&quot;3 Swords\\&quot; scissors and easily cut through my toenails(that other cheap scissors could not cut). The Seki scissors are now my \\&quot;main\\&quot; nail scissors and the \\&quot;3 Swords\\&quot; are now \\&quot;back up\\&quot; scissors.</li>
    <li> Sharp, sturdy, easy to use.  High quality.</li>
    <li> Great for cutting your finger nails :)</li>
    <li> Good German engineering. Worth the moulah. I see no reason to blather on beyond that, so I shall end here.</li>
    <li> I had expected a really good scissors, but got one that doesn&#x27;t cut well at all.  When I press to cut a fingernail, the scissors pushes back away from where I need to trim it shorter. Never had one like this before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m tired of buying cheap junk from China, so I was happy to find this on Amazon. What a difference! A pair of scissors that actually cuts and doesn&#x27;t feel wobbly after the first use. Definitely a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Easy to hold, very sharp. I should have bought this sooner, old one was dull and fought with it.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. The scissors are not sharp. Worst yet, they are rusting already with normal use (no, I am not putting them in water).</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that these are not sharper.  They seem to be sturdy, though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to find a decent pair of nail scissors these days.  Revlon&#x27;s are now cheaply made, though it wasn&#x27;t that long ago that they were well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I purchased two pair on Amazon, this Three Swords scissor and also the INOX Sonnenschein premium nail scissors (at twice the price of the Three Swords).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Three Swords pair is handsome in unpolished metal (a matte finish).  They cut well -- much better than what you would get at a drug store or Target.  However, they&#x27;re quite a bit less sharp than the INOX nail scissors.  But for under $12, you can&#x27;t beat Three Swords.</li>
    <li> Good quality and the best part of these scissors is that the finger holes are large enough for my large fingers to fit into.  Since I can fit my fingers I have better control and can do a better clip job.  A godo choice and very solid product</li>
    <li> Very good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> This would have gotten five starts except for the egregious error in &amp;#34;nail scissor.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s SCISSORS. Not Scissor. SCISSORS!!!  Please fix this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good scissors, otherwise. Your nails, your cuticles, and your heart will be happy you bought these scissors (with an S!!!!!).</li>
    <li> These are high quality scissors.  The finger holes are much larger than the normal size scissors which is very nice.  Since they are nickel plated they are not a shiny silver but a nice light silver color.  They are sharp and line up perfectly and work smoothly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the quality of these scissors, and while the listing doesn&#x27;t mention it, they are the top of three quality tiers offered by this Solingen, Germany-based manufacturer.  You can find their website under their parent company&#x27;s name--Kellermann-- in the German .de domain; the \\&quot;Case Designs\\&quot; page explains their three quality tiers:  low-end MC, mid-range P, and top-tier F.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I was a little concerned by the dozens and dozens of inexpensive sets 3 Swords has listed on Amazon, all with no reviews.  Their website has a link to \\&quot;our new store on Amazon,\\&quot; so perhaps it hasn&#x27;t been long enough for many reviews.  It would be a lot easier to compare their products if the manufacturer included the quality tier in the product information; I doubt many or any of the sets are \\&quot;F\\&quot; quality.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, these scissors were an inexpensive way for me to see if Solingen steel its praise and premium prices; so far, I&#x27;m happy with them!</li>
    <li> These scissors are very sharp and easy to hold.</li>
    <li> Great quality. These nail scissors help round the edges of my toenails as to keep from ingrown nails. Although I at first felt awkward using these and a bit intimidated by &amp;#34;cutting&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;clipping&amp;#34;, I am a complete convert and will never go back to clippers again.&lt;br /&gt;Please note that the tip of the blades are curved and not flat - this is to help cut in a rounded shape, not in straight edges that would require filing.</li>
    <li> I have used a wustof nail scissor for over 15 years and the screw starts to get loose and had to tighten it every time. Other than that, it still works great. Just got tired of tightening the screw, so I figured I would give this a try, given that it&#x27;s also made in Germany... same town as wustof? To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m expecting too much given the previous great experience from a &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; scissor. Anyway, I don&#x27;t really like this one that much. Quality looks ok. But it&#x27;s not as sharp. Feels a little awkward when in use. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s horrible but I went back to tighten the old scissor again.</li>
    <li> Does not do a good job of cutting my nails.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good quality, large eyelets and sturdy construction.  Strong enough for toe nails.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE EXCATLY LIKE THE ONES I LOST. I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR SOME JUST LIKE THESE IN STORES FOR A LONG TIME. LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Best bang for the buck! German quality! Everything is great about this pair of super scissors. Super hero applications possible!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a quality pair of nail scissors (not cuticle) to replace my missing Revlon scissors.  These are so dull that I cannot cut my nails with them.  And the seller will not allow me to return them.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Holes are large enough for aged-hands. Thanks</li>
    <li> Nail clippers just simply suck. I don&#x27;t care what others may say but in the end, they simply can&#x27;t compete with a great instrument like this. I had a great pair a long time ago and it was taken away at an airport by the mindless buffoons that think it posed a security risk while dozens of easily accessible metal objects can be found on planes, but no matter.&lt;br /&gt;Since then, every once in a while I would buy a pair of nail scissors, only to be either quickly disappointed or disappointed over a short period. I am very glad I chose to chance on these pairs. I do value German products for high quality, so it made it easier. These scissors are truly precision cutting instruments. I can clip my nails in about one minute. I even used them on my son with superb results. The build quality is simply the best I have had so I assume these will last and last.</li>
    <li> I had a pair of cheaper nail scissors and it was not holding up well to me trying to use it to trim my nail wraps. I have since bought this one and LOVE it. I could never get through all my nails with the prior pair. This one does the job for all of my nails without slowing down.</li>
    <li> These are great little scissors. I used them for the first time cutting silk wraps. You don&#x27;t have to go back and forth to make a cut, they cut the first time. I&#x27;m extremely pleased.</li>
