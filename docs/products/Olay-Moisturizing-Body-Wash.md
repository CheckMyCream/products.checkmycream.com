      <li>It made the entire bathroom smell great!</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Will buy again for sure</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ll take what I can get :)</li>
      <li>I LOVE the smell of it.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>Nice clean lightly fragranced moisturizing body wash.</li>
      <li>SILKY SMOOTH AND REFRESHING SCENT.  </li>
      <li>Smells great leaves skin soft.  </li>
      <li>Does not leave you smelling like some flower, instead it gives you a nice fresh scent.</li>
      <li>It also does not have an overwhelming perfume scent, but more of a fresh light scent.</li>
      <li>I had about 5 pimples on my face when my skin was pretty nice</li>
      <li>Pretty awesome for dry skin.</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin clean and smooth</li>
      <li>This product is really moisturizing and soaps up very easily.</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin feeling clean and cool.  </li>
      <li>I do not notice much of a scent, which is good for me, since I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells.  </li>
      <li>It makes your skin so soft and it smells really clean and refreshing.</li>
      <li>I appreciate that so much because I do not like super strong smells.</li>
      <li>This is probably my new favorite body wash!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is thick and rich and smells great.</li>
      <li>Smooth soft skin and rinses off well.</li>
      <li>I love this scent and can only find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>They smell nice (although my boyfriend complains they&#x27;re a little too girly) and are very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Olay does a couple of body washes really well, and this is one of them.</li>
      <li>love Oil of Olay products already, but didn&#x27;t care much for their other Ribbons scents.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>the ones I normally see at the store are 18 oz...</li>
      <li>The only downside is that the bottles are kind of small, but if you use a bath puff or a loofah, it suds up very nicely and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>and I used the purple Olay body wash and had no problems, but I just wanted to try something new</li>
      <li>My son has eczema and can only use certain body washes.</li>
      <li>This specific body wash really helps moisturize his skin and doesn&#x27;t hurt him when his eczema is visible.</li>
      <li>and once I stopped using my skin went back to normal.</li>
      <li>There are other moisturizing bodywashes out there that work better for less money.</li>
      <li>Only takes a little dot to complete a full wash.</li>
      <li>All was described accurately, but I thought these were the larger ones that I usually buy from target or Walmart.  </li>
      <li>OVerall it makes my skin soft and cleans well.</li>

<li> If you have horribly dry skin, you need a separate body moisturizer..</li>
<li> You only need a little bit, goes a long ways.</li>
<li> I have very dry skin and this moisturizes and does not leave my skin feeling filmy.</li>
<li> only slightly negative note is that these bottles were much smaller than I expected.</li>
<li> Olay usually wows me, but I was left nonplussed with this product.</li>
<li> I like the smell of this bodywash, but it seems I have to use quite a bit of it compared to other moisturizing bodywashes in order to get a moisturizing effect.</li>
<li> Works alright, but doesn&#x27;t meet the usual standard I&#x27;ve come to expect from Olay.</li>
<li> These can surly be found for less money at this size.</li>
<li> showers are already a little bit drying.</li>
<li> saw some other negative remarks in regards to this &amp;#34;not being moisturizing enough&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
<li> Only problem: THE CAP BREAKS REALLY EASILY SO BE CAREFUL!!!!!!!</li>
<li> Small bottle</li>
<li> It is unrealistic to think that soap will cure dry</li>
<li> It is sometimes hard to visualize liquid ounces.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t want to feel greasy or slick when I get out of the shower!  </li>
<li> This body scrub is very thick and leaves my skin feeling silky and moisturized.  </li>
<li> and I broke out like crazy.</li>

    <li> This helped my skin. I was using Softsoap Mango pomegranate moisturizing body wash, bc/ I LOVE the smell of it. It was drying my skin out though. I didn&#x27;t notice til this winter, and I began itching my skin. I switched to this, and I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I haven&#x27;t itched at all. Nice clean lightly fragranced moisturizing body wash.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and can only find it on Amazon.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t just an add on but I&#x27;ll take what I can get :)</li>

    <li> Smells great leaves skin soft.  Love it</li>
    <li> I love the smell. Such an invigorating wash. Wish it comes in 18oz bottles as well. Will buy again for sure</li>
    <li> loved the body soap would buy again from seller</li>
    <li> Been using Olay essential oils body wash for years.  They&#x27;re great!  They smell nice (although my boyfriend complains they&#x27;re a little too girly) and are very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Great smell and feel. Smooth soft skin and rinses off well. Only takes a little dot to complete a full wash.</li>
    <li> Wonderful body wash, it smells great and lathers so nicely. I loved it!</li>
    <li> SILKY SMOOTH AND REFRESHING SCENT.  GREAT BODY WASH.  I LOVE OLAY!</li>
    <li> This body scrub is very thick and leaves my skin feeling silky and moisturized.  I do not notice much of a scent, which is good for me, since I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells.  I will buy this item again.</li>

    <li> makes nothing but great soap products. Leaves my skin moisturized. And, yes, I am a man. But, this body wash is great.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> Small bottle but last longer then you would think. You only need a little bit, goes a long ways. Leaves your skin clean and smooth</li>
    <li> Love it. Wish I could find it in stores</li>
    <li> This is probably my new favorite body wash!&lt;br /&gt;I love Oil of Olay products already, but didn&#x27;t care much for their other Ribbons scents.&lt;br /&gt;This one has a great fresh scent.

I don&#x27;t want to feel greasy or slick when I get out of the shower!  If you have horribly dry skin, you need a separate body moisturizer.. showers are already a little bit drying. It is unrealistic to think that soap will cure dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only slightly negative note is that these bottles were much smaller than I expected. It is sometimes hard to visualize liquid ounces. But now I know... the ones I normally see at the store are 18 oz... these are only TEN ounces, so be aware they are small.  I probably would not buy them again, but I will DEFINITELY buy this scent again.  It made the entire bathroom smell great!</li>
    <li> I bought this item because it smelt really nice and sounded good for your skin but once I used it made me breakout. I always use body wash for not only my body but my face and I used the purple Olay body wash and had no problems, but I just wanted to try something new and I broke out like crazy. I had about 5 pimples on my face when my skin was pretty nice and once I stopped using my skin went back to normal. And yeah maybe your not supposed to use on the face but even when I used it on my back I got gross pimples as well.</li>
