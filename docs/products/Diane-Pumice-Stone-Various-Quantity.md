      <li>Great Price.</li>
      <li>work great &amp; holds up well.  </li>
      <li>Effective, came on time.</li>
      <li>; by Fromm (# D967) arrived nicely packed and all were unbroken.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
      <li>Love these stones.</li>
      <li>Makes skin nice &amp; smooth.</li>
      <li>but once they got going they&#x27;re ok.</li>
      <li>Good transaction and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I find this size is easy to grab and use on my gnarly callused summer heels while I&#x27;m taking a shower.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Not as strong as I hoped it would be.</li>
      <li>Product texture is too fine.</li>
      <li>Works fine, I don&#x27;t like how it comes apart as you use it.</li>
      <li>Corners and edges are great for focusing on rough areas</li>
      <li>Luckily, there are 3 in the pack.</li>

      <li>Works fine for what it is, but it is quite fragile.  </li>
      <li>These little guys are awesome, Not only do they come individually wrapped but its nice to have that little rope so its not on the ground or counter.</li>
      <li>Need a courser stone to really re remove skin.</li>
      <li>However, she hasn&#x27;t touched it much.</li>
      <li>Its just big enough to fit in the  palm of my hand</li>
      <li>; daily use on wet feet maintains my heels for sandle season better than anything else I&#x27;ve found</li>
      <li>WOW.</li>
      <li>There was clear plastic wrap around all four together and once inside each pumice stone was individually wrapped.</li>
      <li>Not rough enough for my taste.</li>

<li> Use them to get hard water stains off porcelain toilet &amp; sinks.</li>
<li> and it doesn&#x27;t feel like its going to snap in half.</li>
<li> I will say that if you have some bad skin that it could be to soft for you.</li>

    <li> great value. Corners and edges are great for focusing on rough areas</li>
    <li> This item works as expected. I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Works fine for what it is, but it is quite fragile.  I dropped it and it shattered.  Luckily, there are 3 in the pack.</li>
    <li> I got this for my Rosie Bunny to chew on. Rabbits like chewing on pumice for their teeth. However, she hasn&#x27;t touched it much. :/&lt;br /&gt;I know this might not help you, as you&#x27;re probably looking for ones for your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say it is a good size! It fits in your hand well, but is large enough to work a good area on your feet. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to be doing with them this summer. It&#x27;s a pack of 4... and Bun Bun isn&#x27;t using them! Haha!&lt;br /&gt;Update: once she realized what it was for, she went to town on it! This worked great for a rabbit pumice chew, and the price can&#x27;t be beat! They lasted a long time too.</li>
    <li> Love these stones. My friend supplied me with lots of homemade soaps and I use this stone to wash up while exfoliating.</li>
    <li> Not rough enough for my taste.</li>
    <li> I used these to clean my toilet because they are cheap. They did a wonderful job!</li>
    <li> work great &amp; holds up well.  Makes skin nice &amp; smooth.</li>
    <li> The four pack of &amp;#34;Diane Pumice Stones&amp;#34; by Fromm (# D967) arrived nicely packed and all were unbroken. There was clear plastic wrap around all four together and once inside each pumice stone was individually wrapped. (Just what I wanted as I planned to store the other three until needed later.) The rectangular shaped stone is about 5 inches long by 1 1/2 inches wide with a cotton hanging string threaded through one end. I find this size is easy to grab and use on my gnarly callused summer heels while I&#x27;m taking a shower.</li>
    <li> WOW. Great Price. I was online doing my refills for all my house hold items and my GF wanted to find some stones for her feet. These little guys are awesome, Not only do they come individually wrapped but its nice to have that little rope so its not on the ground or counter. Its just big enough to fit in the  palm of my hand and it doesn&#x27;t feel like its going to snap in half. I will say that if you have some bad skin that it could be to soft for you. It is rough enough to use on feet but I actually find myself using it for the skin on my hand when I lift.</li>
    <li> Just like the one I had years ago. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Results in soft, pleasant feeling on your feet !!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> Could be more of an abrasive for skin exfoliation</li>
    <li> Great price. Use them to get hard water stains off porcelain toilet &amp; sinks.</li>
    <li> I use these to take calcium stains off the walls of my cement pool.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> cheaper pumice than what I could find in a brick &amp; mortar store; daily use on wet feet maintains my heels for sandle season better than anything else I&#x27;ve found</li>
    <li> Works fine, I don&#x27;t like how it comes apart as you use it.</li>
    <li> Broke as soon as I opened it :( took more than 2 weeks to deliver. Not as strong as I hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> Good transaction and fast shipping. Product texture is too fine. Need a courser stone to really re remove skin.</li>
    <li> the act of opening the packaging broke one of the stones. they&#x27;re a bit crumbly but once they got going they&#x27;re ok.</li>
    <li> Effective, came on time.</li>
