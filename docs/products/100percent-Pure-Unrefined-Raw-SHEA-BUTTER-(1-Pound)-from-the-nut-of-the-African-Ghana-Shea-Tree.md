    <li> I am disappointed. The price was wonderful. The item took 4 days longer than expected. The product was delivered in a plastic container as shown, however half of it was cracked and shards of sharp plastic is embedded in the shea butter. I used it for body butter and it mixed well with coconut oil and almond oil. The product itself is good quality but the packaging really disappointed me.</li>
    <li> Other than the container that the butter came in being busted and cracked,  this is good quality shea butter and I&#x27;ve used it to make many natural homemade care products.  Deodorant,  lotion,  etc. Works great!</li>
    <li> Great quality shea butter, packaging a bit brittle - if it gets dropped it breaks.</li>
    <li> It was everything I expected.</li>
    <li> Great Item-Great Seller</li>
    <li> Container is cracked.</li>
    <li> The best shea butter ever..</li>
    <li> the posting was so fast and the shea butter was Soft and lovely.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It keeps the wholes families skin healthy and soft.</li>
    <li> I hated it ... it ruin my product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fast service. Very satisfied!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I received this with the container cracked and broken at the lid.  It was wrapped in plastic for this reason.  When I opened it, it smelled awful. This was a different type of shea butter than I usually buy - it was yellow instead of white that I usually get.  My white shea butter has no scent at all.  I thought that the smell was because it was a different kind.  I made body butter for gifts (a lot of it) and added essential oils that are really potent and I could barely smell through the nasty smell of the shea butter.  I did some research and found that shad butter can go rancid and that if is smells, you should not use.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The butter is nice, but the packaging was HORRIBLE!!!! I had to pry the lid off and then it crumbled into pieces. The container also cracked. Poor packaging!</li>
    <li> My wife and kids are so happy to use that product that good discovery.</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Love it! Will probably buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not convinced that this is 100% pure shea butter.  It works nicely as a moisturizer for my legs which I use nightly.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to fully soak into my skin.  But, I&#x27;m thinking that this might just be Kpangnan butter from the African Butter Tree NOT the African Shea Tree.  It was just too yellow in color and too easy to work with as compared to Shea Butter which I have to really work into my hands to melt it into the consistency where I can rub it on my legs, feet, or on my face as a moisturizer.  It was a great price though.</li>
    <li> I used the Shea Butter and made my own lotion. Not only is there enough quantity to last me the whole year but the quality is fantastic. The only negative is when I opened the package the package container was completely cracked and shredded.</li>
    <li> Love the way the shea butter made my skin feels.</li>
    <li> Not at all like the other raw shea butter orders from other Sellers.  This product was grainy and didn&#x27;t feel like pure raw shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;Will not order again from this Seller.</li>
    <li> Fast service. Great product. Ordered a second container.</li>
