      <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate, smells good.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve loved this product for years.</li>

      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
      <li>But, I still smell better when I use this than when I don&#x27;t!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the scents offered and although I don&#x27;t mind it, the Cucumber Tea is not my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I also like the roll on better than the stick.</li>
      <li>do love the smell</li>
      <li>It works and is safe.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love the way this deodorant smells.  </li>
      <li>Love this deodorant.</li>
      <li>I am happy to use a natural deodorant.  </li>
      <li>this is working great so far.  </li>
      <li>Worked great for me and pretty good for my young adult daughter who liked the smell too!</li>
      <li>Smells Good, but doesn&#x27;t really work</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a sweaty person, so this is not an easy task.</li>
      <li>This is very good and lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how to describe the liquid roll-on scent, but it&#x27;s far from pleasant.  </li>
      <li>This natural deodorant works pretty good!</li>
      <li>Best natural deodorant product I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy these Kiss</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m used to wearing powder scented chemical filled deodorants.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m much happier (and less-stinky) making my own deodorant with coconut oil and baking soda.</li>
      <li>but I am so happy that I&#x27;ve found a non-animal tested product that actually works for me.</li>
      <li>This gets the job done on light days.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it has SAFELY kept me smelling fresh.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic product.</li>
      <li>pretty okay.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time trying a natural deodorant and so far so good!!  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s very cucumber-y and refreshing -</li>
      <li>The price is the most reasonable I&#x27;ve found anywhere.</li>
      <li>For every day activity, from someone who doesn&#x27;t sweat a whole lot normally, I love this deodorant.</li>
      <li>I chose the five star rating because this product has a clean fresh scent and it drys quickly.  </li>
      <li>When I very first began wearing deodorant, mine were all aluminum-free because my mom was against antiperspirants, but I always felt stinky, so I started using antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>Its mild and fresh.</li>
      <li>, I wore it for about 15 hours without any BO, and woke up this morning still smelling fresh.  </li>
      <li>The scent smelled like body odor instead of the fresh scent I was expecting.</li>
      <li>I wanted to use a more natural deodorant and also a product that wasn&#x27;t tested on animals</li>
      <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze, it is cool and crisp.</li>
      <li>I just bought some Lavilin also, so hopefully the combo is just right for me.</li>
      <li>It smells light and fresh and unlike most natural deodorants, this doesn&#x27;t irritate the sensitive skin on my underarms.  </li>
      <li>it has kept me fresh each time I have used it, even after workouts and hot days.  </li>
      <li>No alumininum absorbing directly into my lymphatic system, which is a huge win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
      <li>so no need to stress over white stains on clothes, and the cucumber tea tree scent made me feel even more fresh.</li>
      <li>and I am using Certain Dri...between the 3 options I&#x27;m feeling fresh with no odors.</li>
      <li>and I tried it out, though I was pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t going to work since it&#x27;s not labeled &amp;#34;antiperspirant&amp;#34; and those seem to be the only products that work for me.</li>
      <li>The first day I tried it I worked from home and did a grocery store run.  </li>
      <li>Ever tried those all natural deodorants that just don&#x27;t measure up to the deos filled with supposed cancer causing agents?</li>
      <li>This is the first aluminum-free deodorant that I have found that I can go all day without worrying about how I smell.</li>
      <li>After reading so many positive reviews on this deodorant&#x27;s superb odor fighting abilities, I was thoroughly disappointed in the product.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite, by far, natural deodorant.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as described and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Most roll on deodorants for me need a pat of powder to encourage it to dry but not this product.  </li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t put this in the circular file just yet, but I certainly won&#x27;t be using it before I exercise.  </li>
      <li>It works better than Tom&#x27;s of Main, but that&#x27;s not a very high bar.</li>
      <li>I really work out, it kinda forgets what it&#x27;s trying to do.  </li>
      <li>However yesterday, I picked this stuff up and it works very well</li>
      <li>I expected a bit more since it got rave reviews on a blog I read sometimes.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really work and broke out my skin...</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, and this is an effective way to keep odor free.  </li>
      <li>By the end of a low-activity work day, I&#x27;m not really able to smell it, but my barely discernable body odor smells pretty good.  </li>
      <li>Like most natural deodorants, it does start to fade after several hours, but by the time it did, it was when I was already home and not too worried about my natural odor.</li>
      <li>Because I try to avoid traditional deodorants which contain aluminum, I was delighted to find Kiss My Face&#x27;s Liquid Rock deodorant in Cucumber Green Tea.  </li>
      <li>And it works - for a normal day.  </li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m giving it two stars because when I bought a new bottle of this deodorant, my underarms started itching and burning.</li>
      <li>, it kept me dry and smelly free for the entire day.</li>
      <li>I have generally sensitive skin, so perhaps they changed up the formula to include something that irritates my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent itself, but it pretty much goes away when it dries.</li>
      <li>I gave it the ultimate test: 60 minutes of high intensity kickboxing.  </li>
      <li>Not only did the product smell very earthy and dank itself, but only after an hour or so wearing it, so did I.</li>
      <li>I literally tried just about every single brand you could find at Whole Foods and none of them worked.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m pretty active, so it needed to be done.  </li>
      <li>I am slightly overweight, excercise moderately, move around a lot and am a pretty normal sweat-er.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not keen on anti-perspirents and have tried salt rocks and Jason and several other deodorants without finding they managed smell very well.</li>
      <li>Not only were my underarms noticeably sweaty (more so than usual during a workout), they omitted an odd sweat like odor.  </li>
      <li>I do wish they had some other scents to choose from, but this one is decent.</li>
      <li>It works hard and dries quickly -</li>

<li> First off, the liquid roll on version of the Cucumber Green Tea scent smells nothing like the solid version, which actually smells like cucumber and green tea (I smelled both at the store).  </li>
<li> In the applicator, it was fine, but on a few different people ( who rubbed it on their forearms to test), the scent was not a good one.</li>
<li> I would highly recommend it if you want a natural deodorant without unnecessary ingredients.</li>
<li> Although, I&#x27;ve only used this deodorant for two days, I&#x27;m not really a fan.  </li>
<li> My skin is not particularly sensitive</li>
<li> My Face is doing differently from the other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is going to be true for everyone, but this product gave me a horrible rash. My skin is not particularly sensitive and I didn&#x27;t apply it immediately after shaving so I&#x27;m not sure why I reacted so badly to it.</li>
    <li> Worked great for me and pretty good for my young adult daughter who liked the smell too!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s all I use.</li>
    <li> A little sticky but I like it.</li>
    <li> I gave this product two stars because it did seem to keep unpleasant odors at bay. However, the actual scent of this deodorant was unpleasant itself. It was just an odd smell on the skin. In the applicator, it was fine, but on a few different people ( who rubbed it on their forearms to test), the scent was not a good one. I did not like the way it reacted with me. It also gave me an itchy rash so I had to give up on it. One person said it smelled like urine,not good at all! But I didn&#x27;t give it one star only because it seemed to do its job by keeping away the BO, I think.</li>
    <li> Just a wonderful fragrance and I&#x27;ve loved this product for years. The price is the most reasonable I&#x27;ve found anywhere.</li>
    <li> This is very good and lasts a long time.  I like the unscented the best.</li>
    <li> It works better than Tom&#x27;s of Main, but that&#x27;s not a very high bar. Doesn&#x27;t irritate, smells good. Works so so.</li>
    <li> For about a year I&#x27;ve been trying to find a nontoxic deodorant that actually works.  I&#x27;m a sweaty person, so this is not an easy task. However yesterday, I picked this stuff up and it works very well, I wore it for about 15 hours without any BO, and woke up this morning still smelling fresh.  This one actually works!</li>
    <li> Best natural product I&#x27;ve bought yet. It works all day - no need to reapply. Smells nice, too. I&#x27;d definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite, by far, natural deodorant.  It has a very pleasant mild smell and doesn&#x27;t burn or sting.  Works all day for me.  Even when I work out.</li>
    <li> I chose the five star rating because this product has a clean fresh scent and it drys quickly.  Most roll on deodorants for me need a pat of powder to encourage it to dry but not this product.  I would highly recommend it if you want a natural deodorant without unnecessary ingredients.</li>
    <li> Ever tried those all natural deodorants that just don&#x27;t measure up to the deos filled with supposed cancer causing agents? Well this one surpassed my expectations, it kept me dry and smelly free for the entire day. I especially love that it&#x27;s liquid so no need to stress over white stains on clothes, and the cucumber tea tree scent made me feel even more fresh. Kiss my face, not my ass.</li>
    <li> I love the way this deodorant smells.  And it works - for a normal day.  But if you&#x27;re planning to work a 14 hour serving shift, don&#x27;t bet on it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use a more natural deodorant and also a product that wasn&#x27;t tested on animals so I switched from using name brand antiperspirants to &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants a few years. I literally tried just about every single brand you could find at Whole Foods and none of them worked. Even when I wasn&#x27;t being very active, just sitting down at work, I&#x27;d find myself sweating and the deodorant wasn&#x27;t working. I gave up and went back to using the name brand antiperspirants. Then someone gave me this product and I tried it out, though I was pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t going to work since it&#x27;s not labeled &amp;#34;antiperspirant&amp;#34; and those seem to be the only products that work for me. I was really shocked when it actually worked. Not sure what Kiss My Face is doing differently from the other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant makers but I am so happy that I&#x27;ve found a non-animal tested product that actually works for me.</li>
    <li> This natural deodorant works pretty good! None have the staying power of antiperspirant, but I like this smell. Its mild and fresh. I also like the roll on better than the stick. I&#x27;ve tried both.</li>
    <li> With all of the chemicals that are in everything, I&#x27;ve recently started trying to eliminate unnecessary toxins. When I very first began wearing deodorant, mine were all aluminum-free because my mom was against antiperspirants, but I always felt stinky, so I started using antiperspirant. This is the first aluminum-free deodorant that I have found that I can go all day without worrying about how I smell. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent itself, but it pretty much goes away when it dries.</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised.  Best natural deodorant product I&#x27;ve found so far.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I do wish they had some other scents to choose from, but this one is decent.</li>
    <li> After reading so many positive reviews on this deodorant&#x27;s superb odor fighting abilities, I was thoroughly disappointed in the product. Not only did the product smell very earthy and dank itself, but only after an hour or so wearing it, so did I. I would not recommend this product to those who tend to sweat often and have a tendency to stronger body odor.</li>
    <li> Great product, will buy again soon. From this seller.</li>
    <li> Im in southeast Texas so while this may work in a colder climate...it is not for Texans in summer.</li>
    <li> I am slightly overweight, excercise moderately, move around a lot and am a pretty normal sweat-er.  I love Kiss My Face products, and this one didn&#x27;t reeeeeally disappoint, but it&#x27;s not as fabulous as I hoped when I&#x27;m working out :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the smell, it&#x27;s very cucumber-y and refreshing - but it doesn&#x27;t last forever.  By the end of a low-activity work day, I&#x27;m not really able to smell it, but my barely discernable body odor smells pretty good.  It doesn&#x27;t quite smell like the smell is when I put it on, but it&#x27;s a good smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I work out, or am moderately active, it seems to work pretty okay.  It definitely loses it&#x27;s smell when I put it to work, but I still don&#x27;t stink.  I just don&#x27;t smell great (just okay).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I really work out, it kinda forgets what it&#x27;s trying to do.  But, I still smell better when I use this than when I don&#x27;t!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did start to put it on at night before bed as well as in the morning, and that seems to help.  I just bought some Lavilin also, so hopefully the combo is just right for me.</li>
    <li> I am happy to use a natural deodorant.  Especially one that does it&#x27;s job.  I don&#x27;t like the cucumber green tea smell.  I can&#x27;t take away stars because this deodorant smells like it is advertised.  I will go with a deodorant that is not liquid next time.  I don&#x27;t like to wait for it to dry and it can be cold in the winter months to apply.  Also, the roller doesn&#x27;t work upside down too well.</li>
    <li> As expected. Thumb up</li>
    <li> Smells Good, but doesn&#x27;t really work</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant. Finally a deodorant that works. I tried all kinds of regular deodorant....this is working great so far.  I also ordered Kiehl&#x27;s (From Nordstrom&#x27;s) which works great and I am using Certain Dri...between the 3 options I&#x27;m feeling fresh with no odors.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these Kiss My Face Liquid Rock Deodorants.  I&#x27;ve tried all the scents offered and although I don&#x27;t mind it, the Cucumber Tea is not my favorite.  The only time this deodorant hasn&#x27;t worked for me was when I was doing yard work in 80% humidity and 90+ temps.  Otherwise, it has SAFELY kept me smelling fresh.  No alumininum absorbing directly into my lymphatic system, which is a huge win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of the cucumber scent.  Works well for a short time.</li>
    <li> Although, I&#x27;ve only used this deodorant for two days, I&#x27;m not really a fan.  First off, the liquid roll on version of the Cucumber Green Tea scent smells nothing like the solid version, which actually smells like cucumber and green tea (I smelled both at the store).  I don&#x27;t know how to describe the liquid roll-on scent, but it&#x27;s far from pleasant.  The first day I tried it I worked from home and did a grocery store run.  It seemed to do its job that day.  The second day was a different story.  I gave it the ultimate test: 60 minutes of high intensity kickboxing.  Probably not a fair test, but I&#x27;m pretty active, so it needed to be done.  Let&#x27;s just say, I felt sorry for those around me.  Not only were my underarms noticeably sweaty (more so than usual during a workout), they omitted an odd sweat like odor.  Not body odor, but unpleasant.  I won&#x27;t put this in the circular file just yet, but I certainly won&#x27;t be using it before I exercise.  Like I said, if you lead a relatively sedentary lifestyle, this may be the deodorant for you.</li>
    <li> It works and is safe. Love it. The scent doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze, it is cool and crisp. Really smells like cucumber and green tea.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work and broke out my skin...</li>
    <li> The scent smelled like body odor instead of the fresh scent I was expecting. The smell does not go away after it dries.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant. No itching even after shaving. Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not keen on anti-perspirents and have tried salt rocks and Jason and several other deodorants without finding they managed smell very well. For every day activity, from someone who doesn&#x27;t sweat a whole lot normally, I love this deodorant. Sometimes I re-apply it in the evening if I&#x27;m going out.</li>
    <li> This gets the job done on light days. Not a good work out option.</li>
    <li> Kinda works. I expected a bit more since it got rave reviews on a blog I read sometimes. I guess it&#x27;s to be expected of an &amp;#34;alternative&amp;#34; deodorant. I&#x27;m much happier (and less-stinky) making my own deodorant with coconut oil and baking soda.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; price.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Because I try to avoid traditional deodorants which contain aluminum, I was delighted to find Kiss My Face&#x27;s Liquid Rock deodorant in Cucumber Green Tea.  It smells light and fresh and unlike most natural deodorants, this doesn&#x27;t irritate the sensitive skin on my underarms.  It works hard and dries quickly - it has kept me fresh each time I have used it, even after workouts and hot days.  A little goes a long way, and this is an effective way to keep odor free.  Plus, just like other Kiss My Face products, it doesn&#x27;t have parabens or other yucky ingredients.</li>
    <li> I was using the Cucumber Green Tea roll-on for almost 9 months and it worked very well. Like most natural deodorants, it does start to fade after several hours, but by the time it did, it was when I was already home and not too worried about my natural odor. However, I&#x27;m giving it two stars because when I bought a new bottle of this deodorant, my underarms started itching and burning. I have generally sensitive skin, so perhaps they changed up the formula to include something that irritates my skin. Needless to say, I have stopped using it completely and I&#x27;m now experimenting with other brands.</li>
    <li> This is the first time trying a natural deodorant and so far so good!!  It lasts all day and, unlike others, I think the scent is pleasant, light, and refreshing.  I smelled the others at the store and this one was the best in my opinion.  I&#x27;m used to wearing powder scented chemical filled deodorants. Glad I found something healthier!</li>
    <li> Wound up tossing this.  I didn&#x27;t like it at all.  It didn&#x27;t work and went on thick and wet and gross.</li>
