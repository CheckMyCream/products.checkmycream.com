      <li>Slightly more liquid consistency but</li>
      <li>Still looking for a better product.</li>
      <li>I bought this in Target for $12.99 in since I didn&#x27;t want to pay more than $30 for the Smash box photo finish primer again and</li>
      <li>and I love the way it feels and looks.</li>
      <li>This face primer is ok.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>it is clear and makes your face smooth so that foundation and concealer can go on flawlessly!</li>
      <li>I love this primer.</li>
      <li>It instantly smooths my face and keeps my foundation flawless for hours!!!</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>Best money that I ever spent.</li>
      <li>All those reviews online about this product are true!</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recomend it if you break out easily .</li>
      <li>But for half the price, this stuff is great!</li>
      <li>I like how it gives me a smooth look</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t apply on my face as smoothly as the one from ulta.</li>
      <li>Leaves my face looking smooth, even my boyfriend has said something.</li>
      <li>I give this product 5 stars for the duration and smooth finish.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really seem to be effective in helping to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>If you care about animal cruelty free, this product  is made in China or Taiwan,  which means that has been tested on animals.</li>
      <li>I love the way it gives me almost a fresh look after everything else is applied.</li>
      <li>It makes my face feel silky smooth.</li>
      <li>It really does leave my face with a photo loving finish.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>this creates a smooth gliding surface for under your makeup.</li>
      <li>It feels great and keeps my makeup in place all day long.</li>
      <li>Defiantly worth your money for a product like this!</li>
      <li>It makes my skin is super smooth and my makeup won&#x27;t budge.</li>
      <li>I have naturally flushed skin and while this doesn&#x27;t do much for the redness, it&#x27;s a great primer.</li>
      <li>After I apply my makeup my face looked fresh and smooth.</li>
      <li>I love this product because it goes on smooth and clear.</li>
      <li>but it does last for a very long time, and makeup applies excellently on this.</li>
      <li>I purchased this primer in clear, and love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>but I used it on 2 clients, one more mature woman of colour, and as a finished product-</li>
      <li>though right?</li>
      <li>If you want to correct major redness, I&#x27;d suggest Smashbox&#x27;s color correcting primer as that does a much better job.</li>
      <li>but  then I went to do my Latina college friend, who I might add has gorgeous, young, taught skin, and it did the SAME EXACT THING!</li>
      <li>Must have to prime fine lines, smooth out creases and provides an overall finish for make application to be perfecto!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little smaller than I thought it would be but still works great!</li>
      <li>Goes on really smooth to the face and makes it feel so soft.</li>
      <li>I apply it with my hands all over my face after my daily moisturizer has set in, and then apply my makeup on top of it.</li>
      <li>I shake it up every time I use it and the consistency is thicker than when I first used it.</li>
      <li>At first I thought I was not going to like it because it seemed so oily</li>
      <li>Overall I do love this primer and to set my makeup</li>
      <li>This is the first primer I&#x27;ve try</li>
      <li>This comes in a gel form (as most face primers do) and it feels a little greasy at first but goes on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and feels as if it&#x27;s barely there!</li>
      <li>It does feel really greasy when you first put it on</li>
      <li>It feels VERY greasy when I first put it on.</li>
      <li>It really keeps my makeup in place all day and gives my skin</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like how greasy it feels</li>
      <li>This primer is so silky and really absorbs into the skin well.</li>
      <li>but I just shake it every time before using, and that really helped the consistency Of the formula.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Oily and doesn&#x27;t really seem to do anything compared to my old primer.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wears makeup all day or if you want your makeup to stay looking and lasting fresh longer.</li>
      <li>I bought this along with a NYX eyeshadow primer, since both items had good reviews, but I was not happy with either product.  </li>
      <li>Allows me to use less foundation because it helps it to spread so easily.</li>
      <li>but I ultimately managed it with an HD powder and  setting spray ;)...</li>
      <li>My make up,upon using it makes foundation easier to apply and  last much much longer</li>
      <li>yes it can be managed or rectified at the end of the total application, but should we really have to do &amp;</li>
      <li>I do have extremely sensitive skin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have naturally flushed skin and while this doesn&#x27;t do much for the redness, it&#x27;s a great primer. It feels great and keeps my makeup in place all day long. I have no shine at the end of the work day. If you want to correct major redness, I&#x27;d suggest Smashbox&#x27;s color correcting primer as that does a much better job. But for half the price, this stuff is great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! Goes on smooth and feels as if it&#x27;s barely there!</li>
    <li> Make your face full of acne really  bad product</li>
    <li> Good for the price. Not a hydrating primer though which would have been nice.</li>
    <li> I use it daily and it helps minimize my shine. I still get a little shiny after a few hours but it&#x27;s nothing an oil blotting sheet cannot fix.</li>
    <li> This product was not what I expected. I was not happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with a NYX eyeshadow primer, since both items had good reviews, but I was not happy with either product.  This comes in a gel form (as most face primers do) and it feels a little greasy at first but goes on smoothly.  Unfortunately, once I started applying make up, it balls up and I ended up with little \\&quot;pills\\&quot; of foundation and primer all over, not a good sight!  I waited plenty of time for it to dry up and it still happened.  I used it for a week along with the eyeshadow primer, and both products performed miserably.  It made for a bad makeup week, and not many vacation pictures, I can tell you that.  Save your money for something else.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality primer. I use it with and without foundation. It makes my face feel silky smooth. It&#x27;s not oily and leaves a matte finish.</li>
    <li> I like how it gives me a smooth look</li>
    <li> This primer is so silky and really absorbs into the skin well. I apply it with my hands all over my face after my daily moisturizer has set in, and then apply my makeup on top of it. It really keeps my makeup in place all day and gives my skin a flawless look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I little bit goes a long way so it has lasted me quite a while now. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, i hate when I run out because it makes it so much more difficult to put on my face make up. this creates a smooth gliding surface for under your makeup. Lasts all day, and my makeup stays put!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like how greasy it feels but I did notice my make up lasts longer and my skin doesn&#x27;t get as oily during the day. Would I buy this product again? I&#x27;m not sure. May switch to a different brand.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say I see a difference in my own makeup application but my super great MUA uses this product so I can still say I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product it really works well with my combination type skin. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face looking smooth, even my boyfriend has said something. I love the way it gives me almost a fresh look after everything else is applied. Defiantly worth your money for a product like this!</li>
    <li> I purchased this primer in clear, and love it. It makes my skin is super smooth and my makeup won&#x27;t budge. For those of you who thought it was too oily, on the back it says &amp;#34;a separation of the formula is natural&amp;#34; therefore you must shake it to thicken it back up. I shake it up every time I use it and the consistency is thicker than when I first used it. At first I thought I was not going to like it because it seemed so oily but I just shake it every time before using, and that really helped the consistency Of the formula. I do have extremely sensitive skin and it does not irritate me at all. Overall I do love this primer and to set my makeup I use the nyx setting spray in either matte or dewy they&#x27;re both great and also do not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Good dupe for Smashbox. Works well if your skin likes silicone primers.</li>
    <li> This product is great! Goes on really smooth to the face and makes it feel so soft. It does help makeup stay on a little bit longer but not as much as I would like it to.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it goes on smooth and clear. This is the first primer I&#x27;ve try and I love the way it feels and looks. After I apply my makeup my face looked fresh and smooth. You can barely tell I had makeup on, it just makes the makeup covers so well on your skin. I have dark skin so at first I was reluctant but I&#x27;m glad I tried it. I give this product 5 stars for the duration and smooth finish. I recommend this product to anyone who wears makeup all day or if you want your makeup to stay looking and lasting fresh longer.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My make up,upon using it makes foundation easier to apply and  last much much longer</li>
    <li> Allows me to use less foundation because it helps it to spread so easily.</li>
    <li> Love this. Must buy. Face does not feel greesy and keeps my make up on all day. Very happy! Great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> It peels off and leaves residue on your face after putting it on.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it ,mI got the clear one and it just caused me to break out. I wouldn&#x27;t recomend it if you break out easily .</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!! THIS PROUDUCT IS HORRIBLE. ..now I don&#x27;t know if it is JUST the primer or the combination of the NYX pore filler AND NYX primer together...but I used it on 2 clients, one more mature woman of colour, and as a finished product- Or my blank canvas for my makeup,  it came out very dry and flakey. ..(which I initially thought was just her skin type because she had told me she struggled with very dry skin),  but I ultimately managed it with an HD powder and  setting spray ;)...but  then I went to do my Latina college friend, who I might add has gorgeous, young, taught skin, and it did the SAME EXACT THING! I guess thats what I get for trying to save a couple bucks though right? So now I know it is the product...yes it can be managed or rectified at the end of the total application, but should we really have to do &amp;#34;damage control&amp;#34; on our clients faces through applications due to a poor priming product?! I think not...but this is just MY opinion...just letting people know my experience. ..hope it helps :)</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. Very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I usually purchase this from ulta and I love it. But for some reason, the one that I purchased on here has a different texture. It doesn&#x27;t apply on my face as smoothly as the one from ulta. So I&#x27;ll just probably buy mine from the store instead. But otherwise, a good product.....maybe just not from here.</li>
    <li> Two words: MUST HAVE! Must have to prime fine lines, smooth out creases and provides an overall finish for make application to be perfecto! Love love love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite watery and thin, not what I&#x27;d like in a primer. Doesn&#x27;t really seem to be effective in helping to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; your foundation. I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months, never really noticed any positive difference. I won&#x27;t purchase again, I prefer to stick with Sephora&#x27;s brand of primer.</li>
    <li> Oily and doesn&#x27;t really seem to do anything compared to my old primer. Disappointed I paid the $13 in stores. Not a good choice if you have acne or oily skin. And like people said, feels runny.</li>
    <li> The product came in as beautiful as it was depicted online. Best money that I ever spent. Absolutely loved it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this from the NYX website but I saw it had no reviews on here. When you squeeze it out it comes out like a gel. I put a small amount on the back of my hand and use a foundation brush to apply all over my face.     It feels VERY greasy when I first put it on. However, the rule with primers is to let it sit a few minutes before applying makeup. Once it soaks in a bit it feels fine and does a great job.     Four stars because of the alarming feel of it when first applying. Overall, I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly. A little greasy at first but holds up during the summer! Doesn&#x27;t break me out!</li>
    <li> I bought this in Target for $12.99 in since I didn&#x27;t want to pay more than $30 for the Smash box photo finish primer again and this works perfect! Slightly more liquid consistency but on my skin, this worked just as well and was half the price! All you need is a pea sized amount for you entire face so even with daily use, it lasts a long time. Will definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I am quite underwhelmed because I heard some many raves and praises for this product. I do love NYX cosemetics but I&#x27;m not a fan of this primer at all. Will not be re-purchasing.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was trying to find something similar to smashbox primer. I would say I will definitely be buying this brand from now on. Cheaper product with the same results. So glad I found it.</li>
    <li> Love this!! It instantly smooths my face and keeps my foundation flawless for hours!!! Definitely will buy again!</li>
    <li> makes my face extremely dry i guess its just not for my skin type or something but it absoutely was not for me. cakey/flakey/powdery feel</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s a little smaller than I thought it would be but still works great!</li>
    <li> If you care about animal cruelty free, this product  is made in China or Taiwan,  which means that has been tested on animals.</li>
    <li> Good product. Do not expect 24-hours wear on this one but it does last for a very long time, and makeup applies excellently on this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite new to makeup, but this primer is so awesome. It works so well. It really does leave my face with a photo loving finish.</li>
    <li> This primer is awesome! it is clear and makes your face smooth so that foundation and concealer can go on flawlessly! I will definitely be buying this product again!!</li>
    <li> This face primer is ok. This one did not seem to help my foundation last any longer then normal.  Still looking for a better product.</li>
    <li> I use this every single day. I can&#x27;t go without it. I have super dry skin that looks horrible with foundation alone, but this fixes that right up</li>
    <li> OMG! All those reviews online about this product are true! This is the most awesome thing ever! Works perfectly, has a great price and it comes in a very long lasting quantity. I&#x27;m sooo glad I bought 2 of these.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this primer it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> AMAZING is all i can say!</li>
    <li> I love this primer. It makes my foundation look amazing. It does feel really greasy when you first put it on but I personally like it because my face is very dry.</li>
    <li> Definitely not for oily skin</li>
    <li> I love the consistency of this primer.  I still shine really bad in my T-zone.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!</li>
