      <li>Love it.....</li>
      <li>This may just be a placebo effect from me telling my brain that the toothpaste is helping me so results may vary &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>I bought this mostly because it doesn&#x27;t have Fluoride and Fluoride</li>
      <li>love this item.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a fluoride-free toothpaste since I&#x27;m trying to avoid that chemical, and this one is perfect, it taste&#x27;s good and seems to work on deeply on my teeth, and the pack of 4 is affordable and reasonable considering the quality and amount of product.</li>
      <li>Feels good knowing I&#x27;m not putting harmful substances in my mouth and on my teeth; the more natural, the better.</li>
      <li>It is SLS free, but contains coco sulfate in its place.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fluoride free.</li>
      <li>Very cost effective.  </li>
      <li>Overall a great product.</li>
      <li>Free of all of that poison that has laced our toothpastes over the year.  </li>
      <li>There are other toothpastes out there, but this tastes the best, and it&#x27;s at a reasonable price point :)</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is ok at first, but after about a minute it feels like you&#x27;re brushing your teeth with water.</li>
      <li>My teeth are super clean.</li>
      <li>it really whitens plus with my sonicare it works even better.</li>
      <li>Mint taste a tad strong at first</li>
      <li>Leaves mouth clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>but you get use to it quickly.  </li>
      <li>quick service, came as described</li>
      <li>My mother is a dental professional and learned that among the other wonderful attributes of xylitol it prevents plaque buildup and cavities</li>
      <li>Leaves mouth with a very mild mint flavor afterwards, less than name brands, but still good.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth and always used Sensodyne, this works better.</li>
      <li>i love this toothpaste for two reasons: it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful chemicals, 2</li>
      <li>so far my favorite non fluoride toothpaste</li>
      <li>/&gt;Shipping was pretty quick too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Xylitol</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad just to get a little more of the floride out of my life.</li>
      <li>After brushing my mouth actually feels clean with a nice fresh mint taste that last for awhile.</li>
      <li>One week in using this and while not as foamy as Crest or Colgate, I suppose that&#x27;s not why I bought this in the first place.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I was put off by the texture.</li>
      <li>I also really like that its fluoride free and all natural.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste provides fresh breath and whiter teeth for a decent price.</li>
      <li>Kids like it too and are used to charcoal toothpaste so happy with a less messy option though we love the cleaning and whitening affects of charcoal.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t alter the taste of food as much as crest after using this product within 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about swallowing too much toothpaste while brushing because the toothpaste isn&#x27;t poisonous.</li>
      <li>Feel like I ingest enough fluoride now (with city water supply), wanted to go more natural with this.</li>
      <li>Good stuff...use it daily plus a lot of other NOW products</li>
      <li>Fluoride may cause problems with the brain in high doses, for me I&#x27;ve actually been having better memory since I&#x27;ve stopped brushing with regular toothpaste I have ADD</li>
      <li>so much fresher than any other Flouride Free brand and flavor.</li>
      <li>so it works better than ordinary toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I read online that it naturally will harden enamel and remineralizes enamel.</li>
      <li>Since nearly all drinking water has Fluoride</li>
      <li>If they will completely rid it of sulfates, I will be a repeat customer.</li>
      <li>I also like the natural side and no fluoride.</li>
      <li>Now, finally, she has found relief thanks to Xyliwhite, which is SLS-free.</li>
      <li>is something that in high concentrations can cause medical problems.</li>
      <li>, strange I always used sensitive type (floride) paste, vut</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a few years and really like it. It&#x27;s fluoride free.</li>
    <li> After brushing my mouth actually feels clean with a nice fresh mint taste that last for awhile. I don&#x27;t have to worry about swallowing too much toothpaste while brushing because the toothpaste isn&#x27;t poisonous. I bought this mostly because it doesn&#x27;t have Fluoride and Fluoride is something that in high concentrations can cause medical problems. Since nearly all drinking water has Fluoride I&#x27;d rather cut my intake anyway I can. You won&#x27;t be disappointed give it a try. Fluoride may cause problems with the brain in high doses, for me I&#x27;ve actually been having better memory since I&#x27;ve stopped brushing with regular toothpaste I have ADD I can&#x27;t pay attention to anything usually I have bad memory but for about 6 months after buying a 4 month supply (just me and my wife use the toothpaste so that&#x27;s why it last so long) I&#x27;ve been able to keep track of my memory and my attention span seems to be getting better. This may just be a placebo effect from me telling my brain that the toothpaste is helping me so results may vary &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> quick service, came as described</li>
    <li> Toothpaste is working. I use twice a day as stated and have noticed my teeth are cleaner and whiter.  You don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
    <li> Fluoride free and help rebuild enamel!  Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and always used Sensodyne, this works better.</li>
    <li> love this item.  i only use this now.</li>
    <li> One of the best sodium laurel sulfate free toothpastes out there!</li>
    <li> Great product,  Great price!  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> My wife suffered from canker sores all her life without knowing what the cause was. Now, finally, she has found relief thanks to Xyliwhite, which is SLS-free. There are other toothpastes out there, but this tastes the best, and it&#x27;s at a reasonable price point :)</li>
    <li> i love this toothpaste for two reasons: it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful chemicals, 2 it really whitens plus with my sonicare it works even better.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Feels good knowing I&#x27;m not putting harmful substances in my mouth and on my teeth; the more natural, the better.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is good. I was disappointed when I realized it is not sulfate free.  It is SLS free, but contains coco sulfate in its place. The toothpaste is a good value, and I like it. If they will completely rid it of sulfates, I will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the toothpaste. I was looking for a fluoride-free toothpaste since I&#x27;m trying to avoid that chemical, and this one is perfect, it taste&#x27;s good and seems to work on deeply on my teeth, and the pack of 4 is affordable and reasonable considering the quality and amount of product.</li>
    <li> The only toothe paste I will use.</li>
    <li> I loved this toothpaste! Substituting with something healthy for a while is always a good option for anyone though. My teeth appeared noticeably whiter as well! This toothpaste provides fresh breath and whiter teeth for a decent price. I was literally blinding people after continued use. I even started generating my own light from my teeth too!!</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste!!!!  Leaves mouth clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> xylitol is by far the best choice for teeth at today&#x27;s date compared to any fluorides. I read online that it naturally will harden enamel and remineralizes enamel.Xylitol has a long lasting effect at discouraging bad bacterias in your mouth that cause bad breath and unlike most toothpastes Xylitol is completely safe health-wise if swallowed. Xyliwhite is the healthiest choice for toothpaste, as for sweeteners Stevia, Xylital, and Truvia are the safest decisions to make.</li>
    <li> Great healthy toothpaste, good crisp clean feeling!</li>
    <li> Teeth feel great and love it very much and my Dentist is happy I am using it too.&lt;br /&gt;I see him next week.</li>
    <li> Whitens my teeth! Tastes good. It doesn&#x27;t alter the taste of food as much as crest after using this product within 30 minutes. I also like the natural side and no fluoride. I get plenty of fluoride from other sources.</li>
    <li> Best non fluoride tooth paste made, love it I buy it in a case of 6 . Tate good, and replaced arm and hammer baking soda toothpaste with this for better health.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste sold as a package of four.  Two of the tubes are not sealed at the bottom and the toothpaste has dried out.  I did not discover this defect until I used up one tube and opened another box and found the tube was open at the bottom. After that I opened the other boxes and found another tube unsealed.  Attempting to return, I learned the return date has passed.  Bottom line, if you buy the package of four, inspect them all before return time runs out.</li>
    <li> Excellent. But see my review of the Cinnafresh version. We&#x27;ve been using this for years with great results.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that uses xylitol. My mother is a dental professional and learned that among the other wonderful attributes of xylitol it prevents plaque buildup and cavities so it works better than ordinary toothpaste. I use xylitol products for everyone in the family, including the baby and toddler. This brand is great and I love how I can buy in bulk online and not drive across town to the health store.</li>
    <li> Good stuff...use it daily plus a lot of other NOW products</li>
    <li> And up with XyliWhite 4 pack!  Free of all of that poison that has laced our toothpastes over the year.  I intend on being a customer for years to come.  It wasn&#x27;t as expensive as I thought.  Very cost effective.  I WOULD RECOMMEND this vendor.  Order arrived promptly and well packaged.</li>
    <li> No flouride, no flouride, no flouride!  Mint taste a tad strong at first but you get use to it quickly.  Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, I was put off by the texture. But its actually great for cleaning teeth and refreshing your breath. I also really like that its fluoride free and all natural.</li>
    <li> Good value 4 pack. One week in using this and while not as foamy as Crest or Colgate, I suppose that&#x27;s not why I bought this in the first place. Feel like I ingest enough fluoride now (with city water supply), wanted to go more natural with this. Leaves mouth with a very mild mint flavor afterwards, less than name brands, but still good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad just to get a little more of the floride out of my life. Toothpaste works well, strange I always used sensitive type (floride) paste, vut I&#x27;ve had no problem with Xyliwhite and teeth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Love it.....so much fresher than any other Flouride Free brand and flavor.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is ok at first, but after about a minute it feels like you&#x27;re brushing your teeth with water.</li>
    <li> Why do these companies tout their products as healthful, when they contain ingredients that are not. This toothpaste contains glycerin, which coats the teeth and prevents re-mineralization. Not good!</li>
    <li> Awesome. Its spicy. It hurts my lip and my chin. I hope I am able to get use to it. My teeth are super clean.</li>
    <li> so far my favorite non fluoride toothpaste</li>
    <li> Loved it sinced the very first time i saw it great product with.a pleasant taste</li>
