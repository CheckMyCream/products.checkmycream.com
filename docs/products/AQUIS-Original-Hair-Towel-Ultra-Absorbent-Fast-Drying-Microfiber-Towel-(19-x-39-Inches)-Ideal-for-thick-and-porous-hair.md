<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Dries quickly.  We&#x27;ll have to wait a few months to see if it does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do as far as preventing breakage.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It is soft and gentle and helps dry my hair super fast.  I like the fact that is large enough to wrap my head turban style, BUT is not a turban.</li>
    <li> It is absorbent, and that&#x27;s a plus. It also dries super fast after using it. But I can&#x27;t get used to the thin waffle texture. I prefer more volume in a towel. They recommend that you not use fabric softener when laundering, which means a separate washing - way too much trouble! Might make sense if such towels were the only ones used in your household - enough to comprise a separate load. But certainly not for one towel. Good product, just not for me.</li>
    <li> I love how quickly it dries my hair.</li>
    <li> My old Aquis towel has some mold on it..so time to order more. These weren&#x27;t quite as heavy as my old ones but still a great way to keep my wet hair off my face and gets it drier than a regular towel.</li>
    <li> This towel is great. I received it as a gift, and love it. It really does dry my hair quicker than a traditional towel, and as a result, means much less blow drying time. Not only do I get ready faster, but my hair is starting to look healthier due to less blow-drying. My only complaint would be that it doesn&#x27;t hold in a turban very well. But it is definitely worth the purchase, regardless!</li>
    <li> I have been using this towel for a few weeks now. It is incredibly absorbent and soft.  I think my hair feels softer and healthier already.  I bought two extra towels to give as Christmas gifts. I am quite happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love these...I had to throw my other one out as it started getting mildew-y and I couldn&#x27;t get the stains out no matter what I did!</li>
    <li> My daughter had this towel and I liked it so much I searched for one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a wonderful hair towel- light weight and absorbent. Not sure I&#x27;d want it for anything else as it&#x27;s small.&lt;br /&gt;My only objection was the cost.  Seemed overpriced but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Nice towel.  Dries fast.  Avoid fabric softener.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t buy these in England, but they are such good towels that I sent to the USA for this and another when I lost my previous one. It is just the right size to wrap around my head, and a very nice soft texture. I have very fine hair, and this towel leaves my hair smooth, and dry enough to finish with a hair dryer almost at once.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite towel for drying my curly hair.  It is lightweight, very absorbent, and dries quickly.  It is has a great texture, too.  I much prefer this towel to the similarily priced non-waffle aquis microfiber towel.</li>
    <li> I purchased two Aquis Microfiber, Waffle, White (19 x 39 inches) Towels.  Although&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they are quite expensive, the positive reviews made them sound great.  Well, they&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;are not.  The towels are quite thin, and do not rub/slide well on the skin.  They give&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the feeling of having a rubbery coating of some kind which makes them wad up when&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you rub your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are the same thickness as a dish towel, so we are using them to blot the dishes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when they come out of the dishwasher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money on this one!</li>
    <li> I love these hair towels!  I&#x27;ve used Aquis for years and really like this waffle design.  This one seems a bit larger than I&#x27;ve purchased in the past and I have a lot of hair so appreciate that!</li>
    <li> A miracle in cloth form. Super lightweight, absorbs water better than a normal towel, and is smooth so it&#x27;s gentle for hair.</li>
    <li> Discovering microfiber towels was a great joy!  I hate heavy, \\&quot;dense\\&quot; towels that take forever to dry and are too weighty to take on trips. These Aquis towels are light, extremely thirsty, fast drying and a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> These towels are great to wrap your wet head.  They absorb the water and make drying time shorter.Have used these for many years</li>
    <li> Two thumbs up! If you travel:perfect. Great too to dry your hair fast. Absorb water in a few seconds .</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say much.  This towel is just what my wife wanted, works great for her and there were no surprises.  Just what we ordered and price was good - hard to find them locally.</li>
    <li> I have the regular Aquis towel and the waffle and the waffle is much more absorbent and holds up better.</li>
    <li> I received one of these towels as a gift several years ago.  It was, by far, one of the best gifts I have ever received!  It soaks all of the water out of your hair and leaves it perfect for blow drying.  For women, this is a five star gift!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for my thin \\&quot;hair towels\\&quot; which are now ragged with age. This works well -- thin and absorbent. As pointed out in the other reviews it&#x27;s about the size of a larger hand towel, which is fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  However, based on the descriptions and the price, I&#x27;d hoped to have something super and amazing that would render my hair dryer all but obsolete. If you don&#x27;t care what you spend, buy this towel -- but otherwise I wish I&#x27;d bought something cheaper. (I wanted to give 3.5 stars.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--I noticed just now that today&#x27;s price is much lower than the over twenty dollars I paid. It won&#x27;t let me change the stars, but I&#x27;d&#x27;ve rated it higher. Watch for sales!</li>
    <li> I purchased the BODY TOWEL for use with my hair when I discovered the split microfiber was so soft and luxurious that I wanted to use that towel for my body as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I was so amazed how fast the towel absorbed water and dried that I wanted to purchase this smaller size for my hands and face. I love my matching towel set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the price was quite high (come on, who spends $50 for 2 towels??!?), I really love them and would recommend everyone to have AT LEAST ONE in their home.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true that this towel is very absorbent, that it dries fast after use, and all that jazz but it&#x27;s just too small to wrap your hair with. I got it when I had short hair and it just didn&#x27;t answer the purpose, now that I have long hair it works even less (and no I don&#x27;t have a huge head or thick heavy hair). On the other hand the Aquis turban works great and I would highly recommend it instead of this towel. I keep it around as a hand towel.</li>
    <li> Great towel, helps my thick wavy hair dry faster.  I have 1 original aquis towel and two of the microfiber turbans, I got 2 of the waffle to try them out.  The waffle weave is by far my favorite.  As someone else mentions it doesn&#x27;t pick up lint and looks nicer, plus it seems like my hair doesn&#x27;t stick to it as much.  Though I do hate that giant tag sewn flat as you can see in the pic.  That tag can hurt if it happens to be the end you&#x27;re trying to tuck in the back if you wear it turban style!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t found anything like it - it&#x27;s a shame you can&#x27;t find them in any shops in Europe so far</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and this towel works well for scrunching.</li>
    <li> I have semi-long hair (upper back length) and I don&#x27;t like to blow dry my hair - partially because I&#x27;m just too lazy to bother :) These towels wrap around my head and twist around my hair and have just enough left to tuck the end underneath at my neck to keep it in place.  If I leave it on for about an hour as I do things around the house, when I take it off my hair is dry enough to not worry about getting my shirt or pillow wet.  The only drawback to them is that they begin to smell after a few uses and have to be washed often.  I&#x27;m guessing this is because they absorb so much water that they don&#x27;t dry out all the way.  I have found this to be the case with every microfiber towel I have bought so it isn&#x27;t just this brand.  Even with this I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I like the size of it. It is perfect to make a turbant. Dries really fast. But, as a beauty product, it is not essencial.</li>
    <li> The size is perfect for hair drying, and it does a great job of removing a lot of water, cutting down on drying time.  Just bought my second after many years of use from the first one.</li>
    <li> I purchased only one of these towels last year to see what I thought. I really like the weght and size of this towel for my hair which is medium thickness. Worked great for me, so I bought another.</li>
    <li> Like some other reviewers, I have also used the smooth version of the Aquis microfiber towel.  I like the waffle weave better for its absorbency.  Toss it in the washer, hang dry and you&#x27;re in business.  I never use terry towels anymore.  BTW, if you travel with these, expect to bring an extra along - your hostess will love it so much you&#x27;ll want to gift one to her!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using one of these hair towels for years and loved it.  Unfortunately, after so many uses and washes it was finally time for a new hair towel but we were highly skeptical that we would fine one as good as the original.  Imagine my surprise and my wife&#x27;s excitement when we saw the exact same towel was still for sale on Amazon.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Granted, it doesn&#x27;t take your hair from soaked to dry as a bone, but it really makes a difference. Even if you have long, very thick hair. I highly recommend this towel.</li>
    <li> Great product that all the women in my family use on a daily basis....both for after shower hair wrap and at the gym.  They are high quality and stay looking great for a very long time!</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed these towels immensely, they definitely dry your hair must faster then regular towels, and make your hair softer... (i&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference) probably would be great for camping.  I have 18 inches of hair on my head, and its thick..These 19 x 39 inch towels can fit it all, and the seller was great.</li>
    <li> I love this towel.  It&#x27;s thin, not bulky and dries quickly.  It&#x27;s great on hair as well as it&#x27;s very absorbent.</li>
    <li> This towel is perfect for drying hair and wrapping it as a turban.  After using it for a few months, I bought a second one and one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Sephora 2+ years ago and loved it (they no longer sell it). It truly absorbs much more water than a regular towel.  It&#x27;s soft and even though it&#x27;s a much flatter weave than a bath towel, it wicks away all the water and then dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have my hair colored and the first wash after a fresh color some of the dye faintly comes off on the towel.  It always washes out with regular Tide detergent.  So don&#x27;t be worried that buying white will end up with lots of stains.  My 2+ year old towel has no stains.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a different Aquis Microfiber towel that is not waffled (flat weave) and I don&#x27;t like it nearly as much.  It&#x27;s not as absorbant and takes longer to dry.  So I came back and got another of the waffle one and it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have thicker hair that hits the middle of my shoulder blades and I have no issues with wrapping it all up in this towel and tucking the towel end in so it makes a turban.  Unless you have very long or very thick hair, this towel will work as a head wrap.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on Thursday (with standard shipping) and it was delivered today (Saturday. I love this towel, it is super absorbent and cuts my hair drying time in half. Plus, it&#x27;s cheaper on amazon then just about anywhere else I&#x27;ve seen in store.</li>
    <li> This is a great product - light and super absorbant. It&#x27;s the perfect size to go around your head. I would highly recommend it.  Delivery was very quick too.</li>
    <li> I love it.. saves on using the hair dryer so much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d had some Aquis hair towels for probably a couple of decades, but they&#x27;re wearing out and are discolored.  I was delighted to find that they&#x27;re still made, and like the waffle design.  They absorb water very well and are a good size for wrapping around the head.</li>
    <li> We used to call these &amp;#34;swimmers&#x27; towels.&amp;#34; You could carry them in a gym bag and they didn&#x27;t take up too much room.  I now use them exclusively. You can step out of the shower, wrap your hair in this towel, and by the time you&#x27;ve brushed your teeth, your hair is virtually dry.  The microfiber sucks the water right out. The towels dry quickly on a rack so they don&#x27;t develop an odor like terrycloth. Even this small size is adequate for a bath towel. My guests are skeptical at first, but want to buy their own after using them a few times.</li>
    <li> I wrap my hair in this after showering, and blow dry an hour later. It&#x27;s light weight doesn&#x27;t leave a crick in my neck. I clip it into place with a barrette, and it stays in place indefinitely. Cuts down my blow dry time from 15 minutes to 2 minutes, and still leaves my hair looking like I just got back from my stylist. I&#x27;ve had this towel since April 2012 and use it pretty much daily. It&#x27;s not as white as before (mostly because I get lazy and wash it with my colored laundry sometimes) but is still holding up well!</li>
    <li> This towel is super absorbent.  I just bought my third one since they start to look grimy after a year or two, presumably due to the stretchy material.</li>
    <li> I bought this towel mainly for the purpose of drying my hair after swimming.  I wanted a less bulky towel that would make it possible for me to comb out my hair shortly after swimming without having to blow dry.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind having somewhat damp hair, just wanted it to not be dripping wet.  Personally I&#x27;m not finding it to be that awesome considering all the 5 star reviews.  As someone else noted, it does have an almost rubbery feeling to it...not that soft at all.  I don&#x27;t feel like it absorbs that much better than any other towel and my hair is not that much drier when I go to comb it out.  I do like the size for packing in my gym bag.  Overall, for $17 I would have expected more and according to most of the other reviews I though it was going to be the answer to my hair-drying needs.  Not so much.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine, curly hair and this didn&#x27;t work any different than a towel or a t-shirt.  Now I just use it to dry my hands, but it may work for some.</li>
    <li> This is the third of these towels I&#x27;ve bought.  They&#x27;re like sponges on wet hair.  Cuts hair drying time in half at least.</li>
    <li> This towel is much better than the usual towel because it absorbs a lot of water. After I use it my hair is almost dry. I have long hair and I leave the towel wrapped on my head for about 1 hour. When I take down my hair it is almost dry.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair towel.  I sorely miss it when I&#x27;m away from home, and am considering buying an extra for the suitcase.  I&#x27;ve had this particular towel, the waffle weave one, for 5 years now, and it&#x27;s finally lost it&#x27;s absorbency, so I&#x27;m purchasing another.  I think it&#x27;s a great value and am extremely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used the lisse one, which I think has a strange texture after a few washes--I would recommend this waffled one over that one.</li>
    <li> Aquis Microfiber Hair Towel, Waffle, White (19 x 39-Inches).  who does not like this product has not used it long enough.  I just love this towel and have one for travel as well.  I do not want to be without this.  It lasts very very long.  It&#x27;s really a great quality product and I shopped around and found this great price here to boot!&lt;br /&gt;Very light weight, stays in place, is absorbent, and holds up to many many washes.  What more can you get for this price. T. A.</li>
    <li> This hair towel does everything I wanted it to do....lightweight, absorbent, perfect size for my shoulder-length hair.  Furthermore, it has a nice hand and is quality.  In addition to drying my hair after washing, I use this towel daily in place of a shower cap.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these towels. Mine have lasted 6 years. I have long thick hair and using these means less time blow drying in the morning!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for shoulder-length hair. Works much better than a big towel. I&#x27;ve had several in this line and think I like the waffle weave the best.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and a LOT of it and these towels are amazing. They are lightweight so I don&#x27;t feel like I am balancing a basket on my head when I wrap my hair and they absorb so much more water without making my hair frizzy. I personally like these better than the hair turban but partly because I find the waffle texture nicer than the lisse crepe. I love them so much I refuse to travel without one for my hair because regular towels just don&#x27;t cut it anymore. Good thing they are small enough where it isn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I do not have any issues washing and drying these towels but I do notice they look worn quicker than regular towels but they still work. I also make sure to wash them separately from EVERYTHING else because I have a dog and these things pick up animal hair/lint like a fleece blanket. I think its worth it though.</li>
    <li> Hands down, the best hair towel. Do not be fooled by imitators. All microfiber hair towels are not created equal.</li>
    <li> I had one of theses for the last 20 years and it&#x27;s still works great, so I bought a new one and I love it. Awesome hair towel!</li>
    <li> I really love this towel. It has cut down the time I need for blowdrying my hair by about a third. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair towel - works way better than regular towels.</li>
    <li> Wish I had discovered this item sooner.  Great for washing hair.</li>
    <li> Bought on recommendation from a friend.  Absolutely love it.  Took it to the salon to show my stylist how much time he could save using microfiber vs. cotton.  He was impressed.  I also bought the Aquis body towel in lisse crepe and it&#x27;s wonderful also.  Drying skin is just a quick blotting motion.  I&#x27;ve been using both towels for about two months and don&#x27;t miss big fluffy cotton towels a bit.  The microfiber air-dries (between showers) and machine-dries far faster than cotton.  Saves time, electricity and dryer sheets. It also develops less between-laundering odor than cotton.  Also packs in far less space if you travel with it.  Don&#x27;t yet know how this will wear over the long haul, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it even if I have to replace it oftener.</li>
    <li> Really helps with controlling frizz.  I use two one for the front one for the back of hair . I have the waffle weave and the smooth one both work well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an Aquis waffle towel for years - no other &#x27;high absorbency&#x27; towel compares.  I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t source this excellent product in UK, but Amazon service is so easy and speedy - I&#x27;m delighted with my new towels; no dripping head, they save so much drying time and therefore minimise heat damage - a must have!</li>
    <li> Perfect absorbent microfibre towels.  They are a really good quality and not to be mistaken for the lightweight ones I can buy locally.  I have used this make for over 10 years and will be re-ordering more when I need them.</li>
    <li> I have had a couple of Aquis Microfiber Towels for about twenty years and they are the perfect solution for drying newly shampooed hair.  Realizing the towels were finally wearing out I cam to Amazon looking for replacements....found one here and love it.  It&#x27;s the same product I have enjoyed for years...very absorbent and the perfect size.  So happy Amazon is the place to find hard to find products.</li>
    <li> The Aquis brand seems to be higher quality than the other options.  The waffle weave texture is nice and very absorbent.</li>
    <li> i have very thick hair and blowing it dry takes hours. Using this towel gets my hair dry (an soft) with less dryer time needed</li>
    <li> The Perfect size for wrapping up hair, not heavy on the neck. Soaks up more water than a regular towel, dries quickly, If you use it only on clean wet hair, you can use it over and over, saves on laundry. I would buy these for baby receiving towels if I ever needed those again. The only towel a curly girl should use on her hair, especially if you are doing the curly girl style book method of hair styling. Only wish I had these years ago, but so glad I have them now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Never use fabric softeners on any microfiber towel, leaves a coating on fabric that inhibits the ability to soak up water.</li>
