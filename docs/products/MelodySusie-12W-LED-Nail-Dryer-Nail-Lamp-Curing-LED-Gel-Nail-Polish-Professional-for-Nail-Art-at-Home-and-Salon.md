      <li>So fast and easy!</li>
      <li>Much better price compared to other options out there and seems to do just as good of a job.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have the faster LEDs after using a traditional light for awhile.</li>
      <li>Great little product.</li>
      <li>even though my whole hand fit, I still needed to cure my thumb separately.  </li>
      <li>cures the gelish brand very well</li>
      <li>Big hand won&#x27;t fit,  </li>

      <li>Doing gel nails is much easier with this.</li>
      <li>It works fast as stated in the product description.</li>
      <li>It has the perfect size, not too small, enough to fit my whole hand without having to cure the thumbs separately, but not as big as other lamps I&#x27;ve seen around.</li>
      <li>but if you have the extra money, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth upgrading.</li>
      <li>Guess I&#x27;ll have to buy a new lamp, but it won&#x27;t be this brand.</li>
      <li>my* hand, which is an extra large with all five fingers inside.</li>
      <li>I can put my whole hand it here...but don&#x27;t feel that my thumbs will cure properly at that angle.  </li>
      <li>The preset times (I use the 30 and 60 second timers) are very convenient and spare you from watching a second hand.</li>
      <li>I received my light on time and she included a little gift!!</li>
      <li>I do, however, need to put my thumb nail as straight upward as possible or the side that faces down won&#x27;t get cured correctly.</li>
      <li>It is little but fits my large hands.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s a little cramped when you put your whole hand in.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize I was ordering a gel dryer, but now I&#x27;ll never go back to &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; polish! So fast and easy! Love it! Did Manis and Pedis with it. Super easy.</li>
    <li> Love this LED lamp. I use the 90 sec button and never have any issues with my nails setting. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Great little product. Does the job!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t dry my nails. I bought this to use on my clients as an add on service. Unless you plan on sitting there for 10 minutes with your hand under a light, you might as well use regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> After doing a ton of research, I ordered this 12W LED lamp.  It arrived very quickly and looked great and worked pretty good also.  Just took a few extra rounds to cure properly and even though my whole hand fit, I still needed to cure my thumb separately.  I decided at that point to upgrade and get the 24W lamp.  Contact MelodySusie and they promptly and effortlessly processed my return and refund!  Great customer service!!  Bottom line, is this lamp is a good lamp for the price point...but if you have the extra money, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth upgrading.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery works great</li>
    <li> I received my light on time and she included a little gift!!</li>
    <li> Works great! Cures my Gelish in just about 30 sec every time.  I have had no issues.  Much better price compared to other options out there and seems to do just as good of a job.</li>
    <li> It works fast as stated in the product description. I watched my nail technician dry both hands of her customer&#x27;s within seconds.</li>
    <li> I saw quite a few reviews for this dryer saying negative things. I can&#x27;t say anything negative of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this dryer with the Gelish brand gel polish and it dries each layer in 60-90 seconds. I have been doing 90 just to make sure and it works great. There are 4 times settings (30s, 60s, 90s, and 30min). The dryer fits one hand or one foot and turns off at the end of the timed cycle. It is lightweight and compact but your hand will fit just fine. Make sure to use LED curing polish and you will not be disappointed by this dryer at all!!!</li>
    <li> Loving it.&lt;br /&gt;It does perfect job.</li>
    <li> Works great and its super affordable. No more expensive trips to the salon. I have dropped it a few times and it still works.</li>
    <li> Big hand won&#x27;t fit,  gotta do the thumb separately</li>
    <li> I can put my whole hand it here...but don&#x27;t feel that my thumbs will cure properly at that angle.  It&#x27;s nice to have the faster LEDs after using a traditional light for awhile.</li>
    <li> The lamp works very well. It has the perfect size, not too small, enough to fit my whole hand without having to cure the thumbs separately, but not as big as other lamps I&#x27;ve seen around. The little led lights are scattered evenly throughout the ceiling of the lamp and the mirror base reflects the light.. I do, however, need to put my thumb nail as straight upward as possible or the side that faces down won&#x27;t get cured correctly. It&#x27;s not too bad, just don&#x27;t put it completely sideways.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is because I read in the description that it has a sensor that detects the movement when you put your hand in and it starts automatically and mine doesn&#x27;t do that. Every time I put my hand in I have to press the time button for it to start. It has four preset timers and they all work correctly.&lt;br /&gt;It cures the gelish brand very well and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Very good led lamp. does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to and works great. It is little but fits my large hands.</li>
    <li> Works really good, happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> VERY disappointed. Does not cure any gel polish; perfect summer, candy lover, or gelish. Maybe I got a defective lamp, but unfortunately the seller is unreachable. Guess I&#x27;ll have to buy a new lamp, but it won&#x27;t be this brand.</li>
    <li> this work SO much better than my UV light, I&#x27;m so glad I switched. It dries so much better and faster. Doing gel nails is much easier with this. It&#x27;s on the small side so it&#x27;s a little cramped when you put your whole hand in. It&#x27;s so much faster to use I usually end up doing one nail at a time so I can make them perfect. I also use it for my toes.</li>
    <li> I find that this works great. The preset times (I use the 30 and 60 second timers) are very convenient and spare you from watching a second hand. The opening is big enough for *my* hand, which is an extra large with all five fingers inside. I&#x27;ve used it with Gelish and Gelaze nail colors and had good luck.</li>
