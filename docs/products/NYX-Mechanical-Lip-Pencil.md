      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>Love this lip liner as it stays in place and it is the perfect neutral color.</li>
      <li>I love this pencil liner, the quality is very good, creamy</li>
      <li>but it still nudes out my lips for bright lipstick</li>
      <li>So in terms of quality, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s good but not mind-blowing.  </li>
      <li>So that&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>and it goes on very nice love</li>
      <li>I love this lip liner!</li>

      <li>The pencil works fine, great that you don&#x27;t have to sharpen.  </li>
      <li>Not only is this a great price, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
      <li>This pencil is really the perfect &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; shade.</li>
      <li>color is nice, it is a nude</li>
      <li>So I don&#x27;t own many colors of lip pencils.</li>
      <li>Amazing :)</li>
      <li>It goes on very smoothly.</li>
      <li>This was a great product, most products I buy on amazon that are cosmetics turn out to not be the color depicted in the advertisement, but this one was exactly how I thought.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and a good price not expensive</li>
      <li>Perfect natural &amp;#34;lip&amp;#34; color which is easy to use without the need for a sharpener.</li>
      <li>I will be buying more of this for sure.</li>
      <li>I love this color and how it looks matte.</li>
      <li>:) love it</li>
      <li>Love this lip pencil.  </li>
      <li>:) i will buy this lip pencil again..</li>
      <li>You can make your lips bigger, more even, or perfectly shaped without looking like a clown with this &amp;#34;your-lips-but-better&amp;#34; color.</li>
      <li>I was hoping it would be a lighter color, more like a concealer</li>
      <li>I just make sure to apply a non glossy Chapstick before using this.</li>
      <li>sometimes I fill my whole lip in with the pencil for a great nude look.</li>
      <li>It is a better color than any of MAC&#x27;s pencils which I find are always too brown.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a beautiful color even by itself enhances your natural lip color sort of conceals it.</li>
      <li>more importantly, too orange.  </li>
      <li>I have spent years looking for the best pencil</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great buy; super affordable, very versatile, and comparable to high-end quality.</li>
      <li>Not bad!</li>
      <li>Goes on easy, no feathering or caking.  </li>
      <li>Use as a lipstick; just draw it on and maybe put a gloss over for a easy application.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply but end</li>
      <li>but overall I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
      <li>Run&#x27;s smooth and stays on well.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite lip pencil ever!</li>
      <li>Though it is made very sturdy, and you shouldn&#x27;t be able to break it</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite.</li>
      <li>I use it on a regular basis and would recommend it for a good nude color.</li>
      <li>Arrived in timely manner- true to color</li>
      <li>This is a nice lip liner because I didn&#x27;t want to have to buy a million different lip liners to match my shade of lipstick</li>
      <li>A lot of other brands make nude pencils (like Too Faced&#x27;s famous one), but this is the most cost efficient by far.&lt;br</li>
      <li>the retractable ability makes it very easy to use and it helps my lipstick from going out the outside of my lips</li>
      <li>I am a big advocator of using a lip brush to achieve perfect shape when applying lipstick, and that&#x27;s only if I&#x27;m wearing a really bright color (like red, or neon pink).</li>
      <li>Long lasting, and beautiful color.</li>
      <li>It is the exact color of your lips if you&#x27;re around an NC/NW 25 to 40.</li>
      <li>Color  is the only reason why I gave 4 stars to this products, would be better if here were pictures of models wearing those lip pencils.</li>
      <li>If you run it side to side, you will experience more friction since you have creases that you are running the opposite way of.  </li>
      <li>I use it under my nude lipstick as well as my bright red ones (to keep it longer lasting).</li>
      <li>It is soooo much nicer than I could have imagined.</li>
      <li>The color lasted for hours (almost the whole day with me eating).</li>
      <li>Goes very well with the creme brulee lip gloss.</li>
      <li>Just remember don&#x27;t push out the product too much or it&#x27;ll break off.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s better then any other one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Those who have very light skin tone needs lighter color, as this one is not nude at all... still I use this color when I have dark make up.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair-skinned with cool undertones, so if you&#x27;re not, you may have a very different experience with this.  </li>
      <li>If lips are slightly dry then worsens this and makes it more obvious.</li>
      <li>If you run the same way as the vertical creases, it will go on better due to the color absorbing into it.  </li>
      <li>It works amazing and it was delivered only a few days after purchasing it.</li>
      <li>It is my staple color, I usually do not deviate from the nudes.</li>
      <li>It will make any lipstick on top last slightly longer, kinda like a primer.</li>
      <li>Get the natural color.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my wedding, and I think it&#x27;ll definitely last through the whole day</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see the reason of buying a super expensive lipliner because this one works just fine.</li>
      <li>A little bit on the dry side but better than moving around your mouth.</li>
      <li>I normally buy Revlon lip liners but this has made me only want to buy these NYX lip liner.</li>
      <li>My main complaint here was just the shade, and that&#x27;s a pretty personal thing.  </li>
      <li>(if you do, it means you&#x27;re being too rough) with normal use.&lt;br</li>

<li> It didnt last me a long time though :/</li>
<li> It is neither too pink nor too brown.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve spent $$$$.</li>
<li> Color lighter then I expected.</li>
<li> Came as expected based on the item description.</li>
<li> The tip is very small and thin, so you can get a precise line.</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t overly drying, but stays matte and adheres to your lips extremely well.</li>
<li> I prefer a sharp point.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Goes very well with the creme brulee lip gloss. :) love it</li>
    <li> Not bad! It didnt last me a long time though :/</li>
    <li> Great nude pencil. I&#x27;ve had it about three weeks and it&#x27;s better then any other one I&#x27;ve tried. Run&#x27;s smooth and stays on well. Waterproof and dose not smudge. Just remember don&#x27;t push out the product too much or it&#x27;ll break off. I swatched it on my arm and it&#x27;s been really hard to get it off. So that&#x27;s good. I&#x27;ve found almost any color lipstick goes over it and blends in. I like it, color was what I wanted. So go put your lips on : D</li>
    <li> Long lasting, and beautiful color. I bought this for my wedding, and I think it&#x27;ll definitely last through the whole day</li>
    <li> Love this lip liner as it stays in place and it is the perfect neutral color. Matches well with the lip stick that I am using. Doesn&#x27;t bleed or move around like some others. A little bit on the dry side but better than moving around your mouth.</li>
    <li> Perfect natural &amp;#34;lip&amp;#34; color which is easy to use without the need for a sharpener. I wish that it came with refills.</li>
    <li> Those who have very light skin tone needs lighter color, as this one is not nude at all... still I use this color when I have dark make up. Color  is the only reason why I gave 4 stars to this products, would be better if here were pictures of models wearing those lip pencils.</li>
    <li> I like the creamy texture and the nude, slightly peachy color. It goes on very smoothly. I don&#x27;t see the reason of buying a super expensive lipliner because this one works just fine. I use it under my nude lipstick as well as my bright red ones (to keep it longer lasting).</li>
    <li> Not only is this a great price, it&#x27;s a great product! The shade works with any lipstick and sometimes I fill my whole lip in with the pencil for a great nude look.</li>
    <li> This was a great product, most products I buy on amazon that are cosmetics turn out to not be the color depicted in the advertisement, but this one was exactly how I thought. It is practically invisible on my lips! I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect shade for a nude lip. This liner in  &#x27;Nude&#x27; is my go to liner.  Pair this with the Crème Brulee Butter Gloss from NYX and it is beautiful!  I will be buying more of this for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this lip liner ! My absolute favorite. It works amazing and it was delivered only a few days after purchasing it.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite lip pencil ever! It is my staple color, I usually do not deviate from the nudes. I love that it&#x27;s retractable because I hate sharpening pencils. I have spent years looking for the best pencil and I&#x27;ve spent $$$$. I pair this pencil with MAC hug me Lustre lipstick. Perfect combo. These are my signature colors.</li>
    <li> I like this lipliner.  I was hoping it would be a lighter color, more like a concealer but it still nudes out my lips for bright lipstick well. It doesnt set and become immovable but overall I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t let me down my go to to define my lips</li>
    <li> It is neither too pink nor too brown. It is the definition of a nude liner. It is the exact color of your lips if you&#x27;re around an NC/NW 25 to 40. It is just as long wearing as Makeup Forever&#x27;s Aqua Lip Liners. It is a better color than any of MAC&#x27;s pencils which I find are always too brown. This is the Kylie Jenner upper lip color if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> I love this lip liner! It is soooo much nicer than I could have imagined. I normally buy Revlon lip liners but this has made me only want to buy these NYX lip liner. This is cheaper than the Revlon lip liner too.</li>
    <li> its a beautiful nude color,,, perfect to wear along a nude lipstick.. :) i will buy this lip pencil again.. thank you..</li>
    <li> I wish I had paid attention to the reviewer that said the nude has a brown undertone.  I personally think the nude is ugly.  I was hoping it had a hint of pink and just barely be visible.  This is definitely not that.  The pencil works fine, great that you don&#x27;t have to sharpen.  I just should have picked a different color.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Lasts a long time on! I had to repurchase it! Amazing :)</li>
    <li> I love this color and how it looks matte. I just make sure to apply a non glossy Chapstick before using this.</li>
    <li> It does glide on easier than other lip pencils, but I don&#x27;t think it lasts any longer than average.  So in terms of quality, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s good but not mind-blowing.  My main complaint here was just the shade, and that&#x27;s a pretty personal thing.  I ordered the nude.  I&#x27;m fair-skinned with cool undertones, so if you&#x27;re not, you may have a very different experience with this.  For me it was a little too dark, but more importantly, too orange.  I was expecting a lighter, pinker shade based on the photos. I may still use it to balance out a too-blue lipstick someday, but it&#x27;s definitely not going to be an every day product for me.</li>
    <li> Love it!! I have thin Asian lips and this helps cheat the size of your lips if you use it to draw a bit outside your lip line and add some gloss after. It lasts for hours even after drinking and eating. I just need to retouch the gloss.</li>
    <li> Color lighter then I expected.</li>
    <li> Love this lip pencil.  I use it on a regular basis and would recommend it for a good nude color.</li>
    <li> Arrived in timely manner- true to color</li>
    <li> Came as expected based on the item description.</li>
    <li> This is a nice lip liner because I didn&#x27;t want to have to buy a million different lip liners to match my shade of lipstick so I figured that if I go with a nude shade I can use it with different lipsticks which is what I am doing and it is working out wonderfully and I only have to use one thing and it goes on very nice love the retractable ability makes it very easy to use and it helps my lipstick from going out the outside of my lips which was why I wanted to use a lip liner it&#x27;s a beautiful color even by itself enhances your natural lip color sort of conceals it. It&#x27;s nice and a good price not expensive so I am happy with this.</li>
    <li> I love this pencil liner, the quality is very good, creamy, I use it with a gloss or else it might by a bit drying on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is nice, it is a nude but with a bit of a brown undertone I&#x27;d say. I would recommend this product and will definitely buy other colors.</li>
    <li> Makes your lips look bigger. Get the natural color.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great lip liner.  It&#x27;s mechanical so you don&#x27;t have to deal with sharpening it.  The pencil can be used to line lips or be a lip filler/color.  I just colored in my lips with the pencil (BUT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO RUN THE PENCIL VERTICAL ON THE LIPS INSTEAD OF SIDE TO SIDE).  If you run it side to side, you will experience more friction since you have creases that you are running the opposite way of.  If you run the same way as the vertical creases, it will go on better due to the color absorbing into it.  I used a lipgloss over it to add moisture because it seemed dry just using the pencil on my lips.  The color lasted for hours (almost the whole day with me eating).</li>
    <li> Great!  I use it to layer with the NYX Butter Lip Gloss in Creme Brulee.  Perfect nude shade.</li>
    <li> Helps my lipstick to stay put in place. Brownish nude color. Easy to apply but end is blunt I prefer a sharp point. If lips are slightly dry then worsens this and makes it more obvious. I apply some lip moisturizer while I&#x27;m applying rest of my makeup</li>
    <li> I am a big advocator of using a lip brush to achieve perfect shape when applying lipstick, and that&#x27;s only if I&#x27;m wearing a really bright color (like red, or neon pink). So I don&#x27;t own many colors of lip pencils. However, I use this pencil for when I want to cheat my lip shape, or if I&#x27;m using a sheer gloss. This pencil is really the perfect &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; shade. I think this is a similar one to the Boots No.7 nude pencil. A lot of other brands make nude pencils (like Too Faced&#x27;s famous one), but this is the most cost efficient by far.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great buy; super affordable, very versatile, and comparable to high-end quality. It isn&#x27;t overly drying, but stays matte and adheres to your lips extremely well. It will make any lipstick on top last slightly longer, kinda like a primer. Plus, you don&#x27;t have to sharpen as it&#x27;s a twist type pencil. The tip is very small and thin, so you can get a precise line. Though it is made very sturdy, and you shouldn&#x27;t be able to break it (if you do, it means you&#x27;re being too rough) with normal use.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, some tips I have to using it. 1. Use it under any color lipstick to make it last longer, or to give your lips a even base. 2. Use as a lipstick; just draw it on and maybe put a gloss over for a easy application. 3. Use to cheat lip shape when using other lipsticks or glosses. You can make your lips bigger, more even, or perfectly shaped without looking like a clown with this &amp;#34;your-lips-but-better&amp;#34; color.</li>
    <li> Because this is nude, it helps draw out the lip size and shape even with just a gloss or Chapstick.</li>
    <li> Great product thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a great liner.  Goes on easy, no feathering or caking.  Now I just need to find a great nude lipgloss/lipstick.</li>
</ol>
