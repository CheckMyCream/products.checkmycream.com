<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LOOOOVE these nail files. They give a super smooth finish and I really like that I can clean them with hot water and disinfect them. I will buy more for sure.</li>
    <li> These were a bargain price for 3 files.  The large one makes filing toe nails much easier.  Also easy to carry small one in my purse.  The files work very quickly, and if not careful, more nail will be filed than anticipated!</li>
    <li> Product arrived and all were in great shape. None were broken.  My mom got me this set for a gift and I loved them so much I want to get some for gifts.  I recommend this product to everyone. You nails will look great. Keep the small one in you handbag.  Big one works great in the shower. Get  a set for a friend or family members</li>
    <li> These files are beautiful and practical. They leave your nails feeling like they&#x27;ve just been rough-polished instead of coarsely ground. There are never any rough edges on your nails and the files don&#x27;t wear down.  You just rinse, dry, and store them for next time!</li>
    <li> These files are a great. Leaves nails smooth and snag free. The three sizes are nice to have one for home,one for purse,and one for feet.</li>
    <li> GREAT product with good quality!!!  :D</li>
    <li> These crystal glass nail files work really well for filing.  The packaging was not done well though an one of the set of three was broken in the soft envelope package.</li>
    <li> The nail files are good but it took an AGE for them to arrive - It was a few days off a month.&lt;br /&gt;Also, my phone number was cleary printed on the packaging for all to see.</li>
    <li> Wow!  These are great.  They leave your filed nails so smooth.  So much better than the metal files and emery boards.  I&#x27;m glad I got these and if they ever wear out, I will definately be ordering more</li>
    <li> Looks a good product and is certainly value for money, but as I have bought these as a gift for someone, cannot comment on the quality at this time.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely fabulous - it is exactly as described, and I can find no fault with it! Shame it doesn&#x27;t come in different colours!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy who doesn&#x27;t care much about his nails but I recently started developing ridges that really bothered me.  So off I went into the world of cuticles, nail care and manicure products... Fast forward and I found this set of files that got stellar reviews for a great price.  Shipping was reasonably fast and I was excited to see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been four months since my purchase and I&#x27;m very happy with the assorted sizes.  They really come in handy and are built to last.  They work very efficiently and I don&#x27;t have to spend much time to get the look I want.  Even my girlfriend was jealous when she saw them.</li>
    <li> wife says these are by far the best glass files that we have ever purchased.The cheeky brand is a higher quality and is not wearing down as others have done.great pricing.</li>
    <li> Wife broke her expensive one her mom got her from that TV shopping network. Purchased these to replace. Saved a lot of money and she cannot tell the difference.</li>
    <li> When these files showed up in the mail, they were shattered into a bunch of glass shards. The thin padded envelope that was used for shipping was not at all adequate. I assume that any crushing or bending of the package in transit would cause this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If these files were packed in a tiny cardboard box, they would probably survive the trip without being completely destroyed.</li>
    <li> Great files, very different. The crystal glass files work very well, and quick. They have a unique look about them, better than the metal or emery boards. I like the different sizes also.</li>
    <li> product is very gritty but you get what you pay for.. I have a good quality one which cost a lot more but can certainly feel the difference.  this product is cheap.  delivery was ridiculous waited 3 weeks for the product to come from china, this was not explained when I bought it.. it said 6 - 10 days.</li>
    <li> And I finally bought this set.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  I&#x27;m not sure what the one and two star reviewers thought they were going to get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned these files for two years and use them, especially the big one, all the time. They&#x27;re still in the same perfect condition as they were the day I received them. Honestly, getting three of these for less than the price of one &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; file is a GREAT deal. These are excellent quality files that give a smooth, never ragged line (like you get with non-crystal files). If I ever break one of these, I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase this set.</li>
    <li> I have to file my big toenail so I won&#x27;t get ingrown toenails- my toenails are VERY HARD!  But the large file does the job in much less time than other files- I LOVE, LOVE, love these files!!!!</li>
    <li> These are great-order 2 because you&#x27;re going to want them everywhere. Trims nails beautifully without splitting or damage. Pretty sturdy too-recommend</li>
    <li> I really like glass nail files and will never use anything else. I like to have one at work, home in my purse...basically at all times. These are just as good as ones that I ordered through QVC. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t crazy about is in the picture they looked black and when they came are actually dark purple. I also didn&#x27;t think the protective cases were great. They are a thin plastic case where as the QVC ones were in a nice velvet material pouch. Great for the overall price though!</li>
    <li> Love it! Files so much better then a regular rough file, which can cause more cracking and peeling of the nail end.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely the best nail files I&#x27;ve ever owned! I do my own nails, which are very strong, and after I cut them it doesn&#x27;t take me very long at all to file and shape them again. Used to take forever and I hated doing it. Also great on toes! After using, clean with water and toothbrush and they are as good as new!</li>
    <li> I keep the little one in my pocket wherever I go and people love it when I happen to just have it there with me.</li>
    <li> After going to a natural, organic nail salon, the manicurist stated that she only uses crystal nail files and I loved on smooth and sculpted my nails looked. Unlike paper/grit files, you can file your nails with crystal back and forth in both directions, allowing for more fineness and precision shaping. I love the way my nails feel and the three different sizes are great to keep one in your purse and one in your office (or for travel).</li>
    <li> Bought this product to replace a broken one.  This was two thirds cheaper than my previous one and contained three files instead of just one and was the same good quality.  Well pleased!!</li>
    <li> One is in my purse in a metal protective tube I had laying around, one is in my night stand for when I remember to file (better than using nail trimmers as that causes more breakage) big ones in my bathroom for hair removal on legs</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a glass file before, so take this with a grain of salt, but these are great! I like the range of sizes as well</li>
    <li> These files are of very good quality, especially considering the price.  I had purchased my original set from QVC for quite a bit more than this set.</li>
    <li> I had another file like these that I accidently broke.  They are the best files for your nails.  They leave the nail smooth, no rough edges like you can get with an emory board.  You can file in either direction with good results, unlike an emory board.  This set is handy with an extra file for your purse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using cheap free foam nail files that I got from a wedding expo for years. I finally decided to actually invest in real nail files that don&#x27;t dull after each use. These work perfectly, and with having multiples, I can keep one in the bathroom, by my desk, and by my night stand for whenever I need to compulsively file my nails.</li>
    <li> Love!!, the nail file set although the large one was broken inside the delivery box. they are gorgeous! I&#x27;m new to crystal nail files and definitely sold. Thank you amazon.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product. Great price, but I rather have one good file then three bad once. Very rough , painful and doesn&#x27;t leave nails smooth. Contacted company about return.</li>
    <li> Work well and have not dulled on me yet!</li>
    <li> Several years ago, I read that glass nail files would help my pitiful, thin, peeling nails so ordered one off another website. I really liked that nail file but recently broke it accidentally. After much research I settled on the Cheeky brand for my replacement. While there were other, more economical options, I don&#x27;t need that many nail files so chose this set of three. They are nice looking and work just as well as my first purchase. A nice surprise (to me, at least) is that they are textured on both sides. My last one was only textured on one side. They are sturdy and the sleeves keep them from getting gunked up while not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for helping my pitiful nails? I replaced my broken one quickly because I really missed it. These glass files seem to seal the nail edge better so they don&#x27;t peel so badly. I love it and hope to never be without one again.</li>
    <li> These are great! Get a different color- this one just kinda looks dingy/dirty but other than that is amazing. My nails love them and they aren&#x27;t as fragile as I feared (I can keep the small one in a bag with other items in my purse). Far better than even diamond ones.</li>
    <li> They are ok.  I especially like the large one for smoothing out toenails after clipping them.</li>
    <li> I love mine but they are glass and can break if you drop them.  But they file nails nicely and make a great gift for a friend who has everything.</li>
    <li> These e exactly what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the variety of sizes and they work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Would consider buying as a gift!</li>
    <li> These are the only type of files I will use on my nails. The best for a smooth sealed edge.</li>
    <li> I really like these; they work great. I have no complaints about them working the way they should. However, both of the larger ones broke within a few weeks, they are very fragile. My 7 year old sat on one, and then I dropped the other. They seemed pretty sturdy; they are not thin or fragile looking. I would get them again &amp; just be more careful. Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with the price &amp; quality.</li>
    <li> These took a while to get here, but they work very nicely.  They are glass, so you have to be gentle with them, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> These do not tear your nails up &amp; don&#x27;t leave those nasty nail bits to clean up over &amp; over.  Easy too clean &amp; won&#x27;t need to buy more!  Just wash to clean!  Love the sizes, one in purse, one in night stand &amp; one next to couch!</li>
    <li> Great product. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best nail files ever. I have strong nails and this files them den so evenly and proffessional looking. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product, however it arrived to me broken. The largest file was still intact. I love how quickly I can file my nails with these. Just rinse them with warm water and let them dry to clean them and you are good to go.</li>
    <li> These is the first set of glass nail filers that my wife has had. She will not go back to the cheap paper ones after these! She&#x27;s had them for a month now and still work like new! The price is great too!</li>
    <li> Seem to do the job, but they&#x27;re somewhat thicker than I thought they&#x27;d be (about the thickness of 1-2 dimes).  Also one of them broke in two while in a briefcase - not really sure why as it wasn&#x27;t dropped or hit.  Will see how long they remain coarse enough to keep filing.</li>
    <li> Crazy fragile I dropped one from less than the length of my foot from a wood floor and it shat treed into 5 pieces the other maybe a foot from a glass tabe into 3.. They are decent but you have to hold them like frabragie eggs.. On the throw one but I,probably will looks elsewhere for the next set.</li>
    <li> I will never buy regular files again. Talk about saving time. These things are awesome. no body around here has even heard of these things. Love love. Good buy.</li>
    <li> With little effort, the rough edges on your nails disappear, but if you are not careful, you will file away your nail down to the finger tip.  These files take a little getting used to.  They are very efficient nail files.</li>
    <li> SHIPPING FAST GREAT QUALITY AND A GREAT TOOL ,THE QUALITY IS VERY GOOD EVEN  FOR PROFESSIONAL WORK!!!ENJOY THE PRODUCT VERY MUCH</li>
    <li> I purchased this set for my Mother and she loves them.  She has long natural nails and likes the way these files work.  She is going to order another set and share with her niece and mother.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t used the glass files I would recommend this set.  They are nice to carry, I carry the middle size with me. My nail are really hard and these files work really well.</li>
    <li> I will never again buy the cheap disposable files from the drug store. It&#x27;s glass from here on out for me.</li>
    <li> love these nail filers ! i bought a set of the smaller ones for myself and they are the only ones i will use from now on.they are delicate ( i broke one carrying it in my purse ) but if you are careful you will have no problems.i ordered this set here because it has the larger file in it.my hubby is sick and needs his nails done by me.when i used the smaller pointed end ones i stuck it a few times in his toe.but the large round one solved that problem.im sooo happy with this product and would def. reccomend it ...thank you !</li>
    <li> Never tried these before and I was so surprised at how great they work! It is so much easier to file nails using this file. I love them</li>
    <li> I like them. One was broken when I opened the package.</li>
    <li> Love these crystal files!</li>
    <li> These are my first set of crystal-glass etched nail files. I got them because I like the idea of being able to sanitize or disinfect them after use.&lt;br /&gt;I love that there is one for the purse, fingers and toes ~ covers everything!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t vouch for longevity, but if they fall apart in a year, I&#x27;ll come back to this review and say so.</li>
    <li> I am not totally sure that these are real glass nail files.  They work well for now.  They are thicker than my good glass nail file and they feel a little different to the touch and feel more like the fake ones I bought that have sand on them instead of being carved like the real glass ones. I wanted the large file for my toe nails.  I file them instead of cutting as I am Type 1 Diabetic and a cut could cause me to lose a limb. Since the price was fairly cheap I figure that if I break this set traveling I would not have lost much.</li>
    <li> These are so much better than the other files I&#x27;ve used! They glide very smoothly and don&#x27;t leave my nails jagged. The different sizes are great. I look forward to using these for a long time!</li>
    <li> Worked great until I dropped the large one on a tile floor. Shattered into many sharp pieces.</li>
    <li> Glass nail files are the best to use. You wont have any sharp ends on your nail. Clean finish. Once you done wash it off under warm water</li>
    <li> Other glass nail files go for $9-$15, and this one is just as good. But what makes this one better is that you are getting 3 for the price of one! There are 3 different sizes: a mini one, a regular sized one and a jumbo one. And, as compared to the other files out there, these are so pretty! They do a great job filing, they are very smooth and you can sterilize by washing them with hot water. A great buy!</li>
    <li> Purchased these files so my nails would stop peeling and breaking. Filed well with smooth results. Even smoothed out skin around nails. Glad they came in a three pack so I can have one in purse, bedroom and work.</li>
    <li> Great nail files for a great price!  I won&#x27;t go back to regular nail files after using these.  I love the variety of sizes and that there is a little one for my purse.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. The best part is it comes in black. My bf likes to use nail files, but it doesn&#x27;t mean he would use a pink one.</li>
    <li> The files themselves were nice, but two out of three were snapped in half during shipping. The box they were shipped in was so thing (about the size of a book) that anything heavy set on top of the box would easily put too much weight on the files and break them. I&#x27;d rate the files a 4, but since they arrived broken and I have to ship them back to get a refund, I&#x27;ve given them a 3 for inconvenience.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set to keep one on me at all times and to keep in my room. I have the other one to my mom. My mother is so use to the cardboard ones and figured this would help keep her nails sealed. Since I&#x27;ve been using this it&#x27;s been wonderful. Even my mom threw all her cardboard nail files away and even bought her a set. Good product and quality and keeps nails from cracking.</li>
    <li> Makes terrific stocking stuffer for Christmas!</li>
