      <li>I highly recommend these razors if you never want to purchase shave gel again!!</li>
      <li>These are the best razors ever made they suds up with shaving cream they last a long long time for me almost a month per cartridge</li>
      <li>No need for extra bottles of shaving cream/lotion, a smooth shave, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and easy to pack for travel!</li>
      <li>As other reviewers have mentioned, these wear down quickly and are only at their best for 2-3 uses each, tops.</li>
      <li>Wife uses them often and they are much cheaper than at the stores.</li>
      <li>Work very well in my Intuition</li>
      <li>This makes them very expensive to continually replace; however, for those of us with sensitive skin, they are the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>I use them more in the summer than any other time especially on vacation when I don&#x27;t want the inconvenience of a shaving cream and razor.</li>
      <li>The shave is so smooth (the first two times with each razor, at least), no bumps, no cuts, no burns.</li>

    <li> Great. Have been using intuition for years. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!!!</li>
    <li> I love these razor blades. I get the closest shave with them. I use them more in the summer than any other time especially on vacation when I don&#x27;t want the inconvenience of a shaving cream and razor.</li>
    <li> Does the job without the product juggling. It&#x27;s all I ask for.</li>
    <li> The soap bar runs out really fast and its hard to rinse the hairs out of the razor. The bar around is convenient and works while its still there. This did not give me a close shave. I shaved last night and I had stubble on my legs this morning.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite razors. Couldn&#x27;t shave without them.</li>
    <li> These are the ONLY razors I use and this was an amazing price for these razors!! Very cheap. I highly recommend these razors if you never want to purchase shave gel again!!</li>

    <li> Love these! No need for extra bottles of shaving cream/lotion, a smooth shave, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and easy to pack for travel! I just wish they were easier to find. None of the local stores around me carry them any longer.</li>
    <li> Has a great coconut scent and leaves my skin feeling silky. A great purchase for someone with moderately sensitive skin.</li>
