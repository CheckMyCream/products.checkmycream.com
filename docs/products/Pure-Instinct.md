      <li>but it does smell nice.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it to &amp;#34;attract&amp;#34; since I don&#x27;t believe in things like that, but I use it because it smell really nice.</li>
      <li>Nice smell but doesn&#x27;t do as what was commented .</li>

      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>I feel like it did put my in a better mood</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>Maybe it is my head, but I have worn it for two days and get more complements on my scent and attention.</li>
      <li>but I have to monitor this to make sure it doesn&#x27;t make me itch a liitle.</li>
      <li>love it..</li>
      <li>but i did not think it was an oil, and in my opinion i don&#x27;t like an oil I am more for the sprays myself.</li>
      <li>It attracts more females than I&#x27;d like but that supports the credibility.</li>
      <li>Very sweet and girly, I woudlnt even try it if I were a guy</li>
      <li>Nice light, clean scent, light citrus scent...Have been told many times...</li>
      <li>People are friendlier and my husband seems more attentive.</li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>Shipping came on time, but cap easily breaks on bottle.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so awesome to find the same thing for so much cheaper!</li>
      <li>I like the pleasant, clean scent of this cologne, it hides the musky smell of the pheremones without completely masking it.</li>
      <li>The scent itself is light and fruity.</li>
      <li>Ordered this through an adult party for about $25 and loved the scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s VERY popular, especially with nurses and people who can&#x27;t wear perfumes.</li>
      <li>Very light and  pretty smelling.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast, the item smells kind of like a sweet musk.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s pretty affectionate anyway, but seems even more so with this cologne.</li>
      <li>It smells fruity and clean.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update my review if I notice any changes, so far I am loving it.</li>
      <li>All around a good buy, I will definitely buy it again.</li>
      <li>Fruity and sweet smelling in me.</li>
      <li>Even if it doesn&#x27;t actually attract men, its such an attractive scent on its own, and enhances the perfumes you wear (if you should decide to wear both this and another scent).</li>
      <li>I also did buy it because the price was pretty cheap</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just for fun.</li>
      <li>Also, something I hadn&#x27;t expected is that I feel more confident when wearing it.</li>
      <li>I get a fair amount normally, it just seems like it&#x27;s a little more.</li>
      <li>It says it&#x27;s gender friendly and guys can wear it too but unless you sweat so much it drips off of you</li>
      <li>Smells very nicely just out of the bottle, but I do believe it smells differently on everyone personally.</li>
      <li>I did not like this product, first off</li>
      <li>When cuddling with someone, they seem to have a higher inclination for arousal</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it worked exactly like it says.</li>
      <li>If you can actually pick up women without it you will  be ok.</li>
      <li>my husband can&#x27;t stay away ;)</li>
      <li>;)  </li>
      <li>This product really works , I use along with my regular perfume and people always ask me what I&#x27;m wearing , but when I use it with Amor Amor is my favorite perfume</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have this just for the scent, it smells really sweet before application and turns a little more musky on me.</li>
      <li>Smells really good but the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
      <li>This works very well with men.</li>
      <li>Very fruity smell.</li>
      <li>but i did not see anything really happen to me.</li>
      <li>It really, really works.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>This is such a sexy smell on me and it intensify my natural pheromones&lt;</li>
      <li>Are you supposed to use other perfume on top?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure that it attracts men, but it smells nice and blends very well with my perfume.</li>
      <li>The smell is not subtle.</li>
      <li>Smells ok but doesn&#x27;t actually attract the opposite sex.</li>
      <li>The scent is very strong at first and only requires a few dabs.</li>
      <li>Once I read that this product suggested the &amp;#34;aroma&amp;#34; of cat urine, that is exactly how it smelled though I could not place it precisely, prior.</li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;m getting a little more attention from men in general.</li>
      <li>and it is long lasting because I was able to still smell it on myself after a long day of working.</li>
      <li>As far as it working as an attractant, I will say that my husband has been affectionate when I wear it.</li>
      <li>Was expecting it to be a natural perfume that adjusts.</li>
      <li>So far, nothin.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not shallow enough to say it&#x27;s because of the way I look.</li>
      <li>For someone like myself who happens to be sensitive to fragrances, this is soft enough to not bother me.</li>
      <li>tried it with different woman and different places but just the normal stuff, no woman running over to see me or want to go out with me.</li>
      <li>Honestly smells kinda weird..... &amp;#34;pungent&amp;#34; comes to mind.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t understand what other people are smelling, when they say It has a fruity or bubblegum fragrance.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried many different pheromone sprays and oils and am extremely disappointed with this one.  I did not not like the teenager scent and it did not work one little bit..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it attracts men, but it smells nice and blends very well with my perfume. It smells fruity and clean.</li>
    <li> I love this. This works very well with men. I dont know why but it does! I dont like the fruity smell of it so I combine it with another favorite cologne of mine which is just perfect.</li>
    <li> Nice smell but doesn&#x27;t do as what was commented . Doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> I like the pleasant, clean scent of this cologne, it hides the musky smell of the pheremones without completely masking it. As far as it working as an attractant, I will say that my husband has been affectionate when I wear it. He&#x27;s pretty affectionate anyway, but seems even more so with this cologne. Also, I&#x27;m getting a little more attention from men in general. I get a fair amount normally, it just seems like it&#x27;s a little more. Also, something I hadn&#x27;t expected is that I feel more confident when wearing it. All around a good buy, I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product really works , I use along with my regular perfume and people always ask me what I&#x27;m wearing , but when I use it with Amor Amor is my favorite perfume always get many compliments .</li>
    <li> Now, I absolutely love the scent of this stuff but I will say that I have not noticed any change in behavior of people around me though I have only wore it three times now. However, I do notice I feel good with it on and it is long lasting because I was able to still smell it on myself after a long day of working. I&#x27;ll have this just for the scent, it smells really sweet before application and turns a little more musky on me. I&#x27;ll update my review if I notice any changes, so far I am loving it.</li>
    <li> Bottle was broken and leaking everywhere had half of the left when received. Does smell nice</li>
    <li> Smells okay.....not what I tought I was getting. Very sweet and girly, I woudlnt even try it if I were a guy</li>
    <li> Honestly smells kinda weird..... &amp;#34;pungent&amp;#34; comes to mind. Not sure if it&#x27;s just me and my sensitive nose or not. Bf, room mate and Co workers didn&#x27;t notice. Meh. Are you supposed to use other perfume on top?</li>
    <li> It works. Let&#x27;s just say that. We sell this at my store as well. It&#x27;s VERY popular, especially with nurses and people who can&#x27;t wear perfumes. For someone like myself who happens to be sensitive to fragrances, this is soft enough to not bother me.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product, first off it didn&#x27;t work, and i only bought it because i did see reviews that it would attract woman to me which it did not, i put some on my neck, my wrist and i tried it for some time but i did not see anything really happen to me. if it does work it didn&#x27;t work for me. i guess you can&#x27;t believe everything you read online. tried it with different woman and different places but just the normal stuff, no woman running over to see me or want to go out with me. i did buy it but i did not think it was an oil, and in my opinion i don&#x27;t like an oil I am more for the sprays myself. I also did buy it because the price was pretty cheap, i guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> While the smell is a bit fruity (literally smells like fruit) for my liking, I&#x27;ve noticed an immense difference in the way people interact with me while wearing this. It attracts more females than I&#x27;d like but that supports the credibility. When cuddling with someone, they seem to have a higher inclination for arousal and I&#x27;m not shallow enough to say it&#x27;s because of the way I look. This product is a great enhancer to one&#x27;s already remarkable features and/or electrifying personality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, and the fragrance isn&#x27;t as powerful as some other (stronger/more expensive) brands. Definitely great for beginners.</li>
    <li> This is such a sexy smell on me and it intensify my natural pheromones&lt;br /&gt;It works so well</li>
    <li> Maybe it is my head, but I have worn it for two days and get more complements on my scent and attention. It&#x27;s an earthy sandalwoodish smell. Kinda like you walked into an incense store. I really like it.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, and everyone is VERY nice to me when I wear it. This is the 2nd time that I have ordered.</li>
    <li> Ordered this through an adult party for about $25 and loved the scent. It&#x27;s so awesome to find the same thing for so much cheaper! I don&#x27;t use it to &amp;#34;attract&amp;#34; since I don&#x27;t believe in things like that, but I use it because it smell really nice.</li>
    <li> This is not what i was expecting ... not even an aroma ..just a lil smell as roten orange .peoples around me don&#x27;t like it .. i guess the previous reviews belongs to the seller.</li>
    <li> Really bad smell. I tossed it out.</li>
    <li> It smells amazing by itself. But as soon as you put it on smells like cat pee</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells so good!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it&#x27;s defiantly attracting a lot of attention.</li>
    <li> I like how it smells!...</li>
    <li> love it.. my husband can&#x27;t stay away ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been complimented by many on how great I smell. Even if it doesn&#x27;t actually attract men, its such an attractive scent on its own, and enhances the perfumes you wear (if you should decide to wear both this and another scent). I dab it on my wrists, behind my hears and on my chest. It smells so good!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful,  I really don&#x27;t understand what other people are smelling, when they say It has a fruity or bubblegum fragrance. it smelled like sweat in a bottle as soon as i opened it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it worked exactly like it says. My boyfriend still gives me the same amount of attention as he did before. But it does smell really good and I&#x27;d buy it just to use it as a perfume. It arrived very quickly. I feel like it did put my in a better mood and I kept smelling it on myself all day. So the scent lingers.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference using it yet. Shipping was fast, the item smells kind of like a sweet musk. Blends well with any scent you are wearing.</li>
    <li> Smells really good but the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I don&#x27;t know that the phermones are doing anything but it does smell nice.</li>
    <li> Does not work. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I got this and tried it out. Guys, unless you want to smell like a girl don&#x27;t buy this. It says it&#x27;s gender friendly and guys can wear it too but unless you sweat so much it drips off of you your gonna be stuck with the girl smell all day long. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but it will make you smell like a girl. The smell is not subtle.</li>
    <li> Once I read that this product suggested the &amp;#34;aroma&amp;#34; of cat urine, that is exactly how it smelled though I could not place it precisely, prior. Seems very strong and persistent.</li>
    <li> So far, nothin.  Im going to try it at an event this weekend and see what happens</li>
    <li> It works! People are friendlier and my husband seems more attentive.</li>
    <li> Smells Divine!  I would definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> I would buy this for the smell even if the pheromones don&#x27;t work. Whoever said something about this smelling like cherries I know why they said that. However I like the way this smells but I have to monitor this to make sure it doesn&#x27;t make me itch a liitle.</li>
    <li> The scent itself is light and fruity. Not offensive, but not particularly attractive either, and certainly not sexy. However, the scent slowly disappears and the pheromones remain.</li>
    <li> Nice scent for an oil</li>
    <li> Very fruity smell. Geared for women</li>
    <li> love it. It really, really works. I won&#x27;t go into detail, but it works for me.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Very light and  pretty smelling. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Smells very nicely just out of the bottle, but I do believe it smells differently on everyone personally. Shipping came on time, but cap easily breaks on bottle. The scent is very strong at first and only requires a few dabs. Fruity and sweet smelling in me.</li>
    <li> Smells ok but doesn&#x27;t actually attract the opposite sex.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t affect my husband</li>
    <li> LOVE the scent! Nice light, clean scent, light citrus scent...Have been told many times...How nice I smell....  So if people (both men and women) go out of their way and take the time to compliment me, then I guess the pheromones are working...My boyfriend is always complimenting me every time I wear it too. And NOT just on how nice I smell, but on what I&#x27;m wearing, etc...(Yay pheromones! ;)  I&#x27;ll wear it alone and with other perfumes as well...It&#x27;s soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t compete with other scents.....</li>
    <li> This was my gift to my self for Easter and (((hugs))). I got all day was great, they just keep on coming, and soon there as a line as they want more.</li>
    <li> Novelty item. It smells like piña colada which I am not a fan of. Somewhat of a cat pee smell as odd as that sounds. Was expecting it to be a natural perfume that adjusts. It&#x27;s just for fun.</li>
    <li> got this for a friend that said she need some romance from her husband after she got it she had  to come to tell me that it works and was happy with it</li>
    <li> I like it. It&#x27;s anybodys guess if it actually works. If you can actually pick up women without it you will  be ok. This is no cure for being a loser. You will still be a loser if you started out as one, you&#x27;ll just smell better.</li>
    <li> this is incredible really works I have stopped using because it brings me problems with my boyfriend when we go out to dinner ... it&#x27;s amazing ツ</li>
