<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This has become a dual usage product in our house. Besides being great for my sensitive skin, I also use it as a leave-in conditioner for my toddlers fine, curly hair. She smells like a little rose, and I know I&#x27;m not exposing her to a bunch of chemicals. Plus her curls are bouncy and shiny between shampoos.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful.  It erases any dirt or oil left behind by my cleanser but does not dry my skin out.  My whole face feels soft and refreshed.  I have combination skin, so it can be hard to find products for my face that does not dry out my dry spots and make my oiler spots behave like an oil slick.  I also use it to removed hair spray from my face after I get done styling my hair and before I put my sunscreen on.  I love all my products from Beauty by Earth!</li>
    <li> Love it.........use it daily......doesn&#x27;t dry out my face....makes my skin feel good and I&#x27;m really seeing a difference in how my skin looks too........much healthier ! Very happy with my purchase ..........Will buy again .</li>
    <li> This is actually really good! I was scared because I had bad experiences with previous toners. I used Olay&#x27;s facial toner before and it broke me out and left my face dry. The smell was nice, though. But this toner is much more natural and smells much better and I haven&#x27;t broken out once over the nearly 2 weeks since I bought this. My pores have visibly reduced in size and my face looks much more clear. My process is using Molivera&#x27;s almond oil to wash my face, dab my face with a warm and wet washcloth to try to get some oil off but not all, then tone with this and then moisturizer again with almond oil and this is working well for me!  I love this company. They care about their customers and always deliver high quality products. I&#x27;m not a person to lie. If you need a toner, get this one! Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel sounds good but this has more and better ingredients!!  Edit: it&#x27;s so good, months later! Unfortunately I spilled a lot but surprisingly, I still have enough to last me March. This is definitely a product I&#x27;d like to purchase again and make my staple.</li>
    <li> It smelled great.  I didn&#x27;t feel like it made my skin feel better and my skin was a little sensitive to it.  However, I rarely can use toners.  I gave it to my mom and she likes it.  I LOVE LOVE their mint lip balms tho!</li>
    <li> I wondered if this would be The One, finally a toner w/o alcohol and ingredients I can identify and understand, let alone LIKE! I am happy to say that I believe I have finally found not only the best toner on the market, but the best BRAND  for toner, Argan Oil and many other products, which so far have all been absolutely 1st grade. Let me tell you why I love this toner:&lt;br /&gt;- Senior skin (I&#x27;m 60) is by definition, thinner and more fragile than younger facial skin. We need more, not less attention to our skin now. This toner is smooth and gentle, leaving my face feeling re-hydrated not &amp;#34;scraped clean.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- Undereye area is naturally much more delicate than anywhere else on the face for everyone. I thought , AHA this will be the real test - will it remove the mascara smudges (you know the raccoon eyes from the mascara) or not? Not only did it remove the residue eye makeup under my eyes gently and thoroughly, and I mean gently,both it and the Argan Oil sold by Beauty by Earth, put on afterwards in combination, has actually REDUCED MY UNDEREYE WRINKLES in less than a week! Seriously! I&#x27;m SOLD!&lt;br /&gt;- Rosacea which for those who know is a real pain,is a flush of facial redness which can actually hurt, resulting from drinking red wine, blushing, overheating, certain foods, whatever. I used this after a party where I had some red wine and Voila! it soothed and cooled down the redness almost instantaneously, leaving me feeling oh so refreshed and soothed, calming the rosacea rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;- Smell :some toners add certain ingredients just for the fragrance. I have studied herbs so I usually know what they are adding and why.. This toner uses roses liberally, for its soothing capabilities as well as fragrance apparently. Not the cloying artificial smell so often associated with &amp;#34;rose fragrance&amp;#34;, but a not too sweet fragrance that dissipates somewhat in time so it doesn&#x27;t conflict but combines with your other fragrances. Tho up close and personal, &amp;#34;You smell great!&amp;#34; is always a nice thing to hear...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So am I sold on this Toner from Beauty by Earth? You can be sure of it. I have also given it to all my girls for Christmas stocking stuffers and am waiting to hear what they say too on their younger skin and different skin types. I&#x27;m sure they will love it as I do. Highly recommend.u smell great!&amp;#34; is always a nice thing to hear...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So am I sold on this Toner from Beauty by Earth? You can be sure of it.

    <li> I really enjoy this product. I haven&#x27;t really used any toner in the past but thought I&#x27;d give this a try. The first thing you notice is the great smell. It&#x27;s like roses in liquid form. I found it really nice, and not overpowering. Second, the toner basically just goes onto your face and feels like your face is being washed by lovely rose scented water. The next thing you notice is that your skin feels immediately clean, calm, and smooth. It doesn&#x27;t sting or hurt at all, and does not leave me feeling dried out or parched at all. My face feels moisturized after and really clean and good. Afterwards I like to apply my favorite moisturizing cream. It&#x27;s been about a week and already I&#x27;m noticing a difference in how my facial skin looks. It&#x27;s clean, clear, and just feels smooth and refreshed. I&#x27;ve actually used this toner on a couple occasions when I didn&#x27;t have time to shower, just so I could get the refreshing and cleaning effect! Overall a great product I&#x27;d recommend to anyone who uses toner or would like to start.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and have a tendency to break out, this is one of the few products I can use daily that never causes breakouts and helps my skin stay clear. I am very happy to have found this and I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday, sometimes several times a day.  It is very refreshing and a great way to cool off your skin after a workout!  You only need a few drops on a cotton pad to do the trick!  The smaller bottle has a spray top, this larger bottle does not.  It should last a long time.  I love all the products from this company.  They will have me as a customer for a long time!  The website is great and has lots of other products and tips.  It also tells you all about the products and the company.  Their customer service group is very prompt and very helpful!</li>
    <li> Only used it three times so far but I really like it! It smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t have any nasty alcohols or chemicals in it. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I can now honestly say that this is my favorite toner! I started using it and noticed right away that my very large pores appeared smaller when I put on my makeup. It also controlled my oil, which has never happened before. I am usually an oil well after a few hours. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was from the toner or a combination of the new toner, a new cleanser and new moisturizer. I ran out of the toner, used a different one, and did not get the same results. So, it for sure is the toner that did the magic :) Plus, it is very refreshing!</li>
    <li> Super hydrating, and love the smell!!  Unlike many other toners I&#x27;ve tried, this one actually helps also take off my makeup which surprised me.  Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This toner smells so good! I apply it before my moisturizer to tighten my pores and leaves no residual feeling on my skin. I am going to purchase a small spray bottle, so that I can have it in my purse to refresh my face during the day. I will purchase as gifts for friends.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife because she heard about it from a girlfriend and had actually been looking for a toner or something to use on her face besides just cream. She said that it feels very refreshing, it&#x27;s kind of like aloe in a spray form, makes your skin feel taut and clean. Actually she had tried some waxing on her face and it had a horrible reaction and was breaking out, no joke she used it the first night and in the morning some of the little white breakout spots had completely gone away so she really liked that. One thing is it doesn&#x27;t taste very good in your mouth or on your lips, obviously just like any products (even if all organic and natural doesn&#x27;t mean you should eat it!), so my wife recommends what it says on the directions of using a cotton swab instead of just spraying. If you like spraying for that fresh feeling and don&#x27;t want to rub any cotton on your skin, then just suck your lips in and close your eyes so it doesn&#x27;t get in/on them. My wife still uses her lotion because this doesn&#x27;t give you that kind of feeling, it makes it real fresh and taut as said above, so best she found is to wipe it all over her face and then still use her favorite lotion right after.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product! Feels really nice and only the best of ingredients.</li>
    <li> It smells amazing!  After just 3 days of use, a dry spot on my face got better. I like the gentleness of the toner. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I like the toner. What I like the most is that it is natural and organic, suitable for sensitive skin like me. It is also alcohol free which doesnt make your face dry after applying it. I have tried it and I like it.</li>
    <li> Like the product. And came in the time allotted.</li>
    <li> My new favorite toner! I have been using Dr. Hauschka for 13 years, and was looking for something more affordable that didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve tried many other natural toners, but this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that works as well and isn&#x27;t irritating. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for a week now and it has done almost everything it has said it would. Takes redness out and my pores are much smaller! I didn&#x27;t use it for anything else like makeup remover so I couldn&#x27;t say on that, but I Personally just LOVE this product. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I seriously LOVE this stuff!! Very light and clean smelling yet leaves my face feeling brand new and moisturized! WILL recommend to my friends!!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic, inexpensive natural toner, and it smells great. I normally don&#x27;t use toners so I don&#x27;t have anything else to compare it to. The closest thing to a toner that I have used is a softener from a high end brand, which I am not going to name (am I allowed to mention other brands in my Amazon reviews?). When I first used the softener, which is $50, I thought, &amp;#34;WOW this is amazing!&amp;#34; because it literally softens the skin. But since it is, after all, $50, I wanted to find a cheaper (and definitely more natural) alternative. I stumbled on this facial toner while looking for aloe vera products on Amazon and decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how did this approximately $20 toner compare to the $50 softener? Pretty well I would say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way softener works is that it prepares your skin for moisturizing, and it allows the skin to absorb more products. It also helps remove dirt, makeup, and soap residue. It&#x27;s quite similar to a toner. So here&#x27;s a comparison breakdown between Beauty by Earth toner and the high-end softener:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Is it moisturizing?&lt;br /&gt;True to its name, the softener really softens and takes away that dry feeling I normally get after cleansing. The toner does moisturize to a certain extent. But make no mistake, the moisturizing power does not match that of the softener (keep in mind that this softener has quite a lot of chemicals in it to make that happen).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Is it refreshing?&lt;br /&gt;Both refresh the skin quite well. However, I prefer the toner because it smells so good! I put the toner in the fridge too, and that&#x27;s added bonus for the hot weather (I live in California).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Does it clean well?&lt;br /&gt;Both clean well. I normally don&#x27;t wash my face with soap in the morning, so the toner is perfect for me as a morning cleanser and refresher. So far, I am loving this quick, simple experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Price?&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, the toner wins here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Ingredients?&lt;br /&gt;Again, the toner wins with its natural and organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Overall experience?&lt;br /&gt;Although I liked the softener, it didn&#x27;t really improve my skin. I ran out of the softener so I stopped using it, and my skin certainly doesn&#x27;t miss it. As for Beauty by Earth&#x27;s toner, I wouldn&#x27;t say that it changed my life. However, I do notice the overall improvement in my skin tone after using it. My skin looks brighter, like it&#x27;s glowing from the inside out.

    <li> I tried this on a whim last month and returned this month to purchase my second bottle! I use this at least twice daily, usually after washing my face, before applying serum and/or moisturizer. I&#x27;ve tried this product with its other suggested uses such as a cooling agent for minor burns (a slight case of razor burn), and as a general refresher throughout the day with stellar results.&lt;br /&gt;This works wonders on my fair, oily &amp; acne-prone skin, which normally is finicky to a fault. Since using religiously for about a month, my skin has gotten clearer and softer. I even applied after a mud mask left my skin too red and irritated. Within a few minutes of application, my skin was calm, cool and yet airy. That&#x27;s one thing I really like about this toner - how light and airy my skin feels once the toner dries (which takes just a couple seconds, depending on how much you use at a time). Some toners leave my pores feeling clogged, even if the products claim not to. This one lets my skin breathe, and as a result, heal.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is mild - soft and refreshing, a blend of rosewater and cucumber. Just breathing in the toner is a stress reliever! :)&lt;br /&gt;This is a new beauty staple for me and I highly recommend for all skin types. If my finicky skin can fall in love with this toner, anyone&#x27;s can. :)</li>
    <li> I am a new fan to Beauty by Earth. I fell in love with their Complexion Hydrating Facial Mask and wanted to try another product. And this facial toner did  not disappoint. What I love most about Beauty By Earth products are the natural and organic ingredients.  this product contains Organic Witch Hazel, Organic Rose Petal Water, Natural glycerin, Organic Aloe Vera, Organic Cucumber, and Citric Acid. I use this facial toner after cleansing my face. It feels like a rejuvenation after applying. I like that it does  not dry out your skin like many toners do. The packaging is great, very natural, tasteful and classy. I look forward to trying more products from Beauty By Earth. I highly recommend this product. I received this facial toner at a promotional discount to try and provide my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> wonderful products and excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> This toner has a very light floral scent to it, which I love. I mention the scent because I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to smells in products, but this one is super light and doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.  I use this product daily as a toner because it makes my skin feeling hydrated and refreshed.  I also use it as a spritz to set my powder makeup when I wear it. I&#x27;ve already bought another bottle and I recommend it highly to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a great toner.</li>
    <li> This one is great. I&#x27;m from China, and I have tried to find the water toner for years in U.S.A. Here it is. This product impressed me! It smells great and keeps my face moist all the day. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this toner. Smells good, is gentle and non-irritating. I have very dry skin, but since I live in a hot, hot place I don&#x27;t like to use traditional facial moisturizer in summer because it just slides off and is gross. This toner is just light and moisturizing enough to take away the tight dry feeling and leave me with smooth dewy skin. It&#x27;s fantastic and I&#x27;ll buy it again when I run out. I&#x27;m really happy I bought the larger bottle!</li>
    <li> Wow!  I was not a fan of toner of any other product.  This has really made a difference in my skin in a short period of time.  I will definitely keep this as part of my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Love this toner! Bought it on a whim because I haven&#x27;t had much luck with toners in the past. They dry my skin out, which in turn makes my skin produce more oil, which makes me break out....and it&#x27;s just a vicious cycle. BUT - not anymore! The Beauty By Earth toner is gentle, but still seems to be doing a great job cleaning and refreshing my skin. I use it not only as a toner, but a makeup remove, and I love it! The scent is very light, but really nice. Also love knowing that it&#x27;s not full of harmful chemicals. Bonus: The Beauty By Earth team is so friendly and helpful. I absolutely recommend both the company and their products!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister for Christmas, she has used it a couple of times and says she loves it</li>
    <li> I love this toner.  I have very sensitive skin and it does not irritate it at all.  My face feels so clean after I use this.  It is the best!!!!</li>
    <li> I like the idea that this toner can be used as spray on, but I wish it came with a sprayer. It is gentle on the skin and it clean away dirt and make-up. Some of the nice features is that it is made in the USA, it is alcohol free, paraben &amp; chemical free, non-toxic and contains organic ingredients. The bottle is a nice size and should last quite a while. The toner states that it can help to reduce redness, inflammation and less the appearance of bruises this is something that might take a few weeks of use to see a significant difference. It also works on taking the sting out of sunburn which I have already tired and it worked. Over all the product is a nice and works for a number of applications. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the packing. There is no safety seal of any kind, during shipping by lid loosen up and spilled some of the toner. I would rather see the product have a seal of some type and not be placed in a box if it is a cost issue. I was provided this product to review, this did not influence my review. I would recommend this product because it is a good and is made in the USA and chemical free.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a week and I like the way it hydrates my face.  i don&#x27;t use moisturizing cremes because my face is sensitive and the cremes has caused unwanted pimples in the past.  I also noticed what my facial cleanser does not wash away, this toner picks up when using a cotton ball.  I changed to a new facial cleaner when I started using the toner and certain areas of my face began to itch.  So I changed cleansers and will see if the mild itching goes away.  So far the itch intensity decreased so maybe it was the facial cleanser I was using.</li>
    <li> i love the smooth feeling and lovely smelling.</li>
    <li> I have been using this all natural toner for about a month and it is the best toner I have ever used.  I use it at night after cleansing my face with a premium cleanser and have been amazed at how much makeup it still finds.  My skin tone (I&#x27;m a fair redhead) has improved and evened out, and my pores are reduced.  Best of all, it just feels so good to apply.  It is light, alcohol free, and the scent is soothing. I truly love this product.  I also love the other Beauty by Earth products I use: both the Argan Oil and the Sunscreen.  Not only are all these products natural, there is a wonderful, caring, genuine energy about them, from the packaging (the box is hard to throw away) to the products to the customer service.  I&#x27;m hoping more products are being developed. Thank you, Beauty by Earth!</li>
    <li> I totally love this toner. Why? Because it is the best toner I have ever used and I&#x27;ve used so many different toners in the past. My skin has never felt better, my skin has never looked better than it does now after using this since December. Plus this toner also completely fits in with my beauty philosophy which is use products that contain the best and most natural ingredients possible and don&#x27;t use products that contain harmful or toxic ingredients. So obviously, I&#x27;m in love with this toner, I purchased the large size and now I wish I had bought a whole case of it because I&#x27;m getting down to the bottom of the bottle. Oh yeah, that&#x27;s another thing that&#x27;s important to note- this is the only toner I&#x27;ve ever used that produces a noticeable and visible improvement in my skin and therefore, it is also the only toner I use or have ever used consistently. I once spent 90 bucks on toner at the insistence of my esthetician and I only used it 3 times. 90 dollars is a lot of money to waste. On the other hand, 17.99 is an amazing and unbelievably reasonable price to pay for great skin. I bought this in December and I use it every day sometimes 2-3 times a day, I love what it does, how it smells, the ingredients used, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain ingredients or chemicals that I hate! I recommend this toner to everyone and anyone. Go buy it! And if you already have bought it, go buy more! You will run out soon because it&#x27;s so awesome and you use it everyday and you will need another bottle soon! Thank you so much to Beauty by Earth for making this Toner, I love it!</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST toner I have ever used. I have extremely sensitive skin and must be very careful about the facial products I use. For toners I have tried Aveda products, plain rose water, etc and this is he first time I have actually felt truly hydrated. I used to think people that raved and raved about facials products were ridiculous but I found myself seriously looking forward to using this every evening and then I was racing to someone about it and had to laugh. This item is definitely a keeper!!! I also use it as a refresher during the day as my foundation can sometimes make me feel dry. He must is fine enough that it doesn&#x27;t affect my makeup.</li>
    <li> works great and smells great</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  So very refreshing.  My skin looks and feels younger. I hv sensitive acne prone skin. As I age, my skin becomes more and more sensitive.  I cant rely on products containing salicylic acid anymore.  They dry out my skin causing my face and neck to appear tight, flakey and haggard. Beauty replenishes. I wash my face with an antibacterial soap and salicylic acid face wash, then, follow up with Beauty Facial Toner and Pure Body Naturals Vitamin C Serum.  Beauty Toner doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, I suffer no blackheads (not that I ever did) and my pores are virtually invisible. My skin glows with healthy radiance. Its all part of a structured routine that has this 40 year-old looking 28 instead of the usual 32 I WAS being mistaken for!  I&#x27;ve recommended Beauty Hydrating Face Toner to several friends and family members.  None hv bn disappointed.  Only upset that I&#x27;m not sharing ALL my youthful beauty secrets! LOL</li>
    <li> This does smell good and I think if I needed a clarifying lotion this would be great.  I&#x27;m 40 and my facial oils have lessoned (even though I get a shine by the end of the day).  This Toner was too drying for my face.  I would have loved it to work because it smelled nice and was lotiony, but overall drying....  After washing my face, I don&#x27;t need an additional cleaner, it already feels like it need moisturizer.  The argan oil has been a very nice (not greasy looking) moisturizer!</li>
    <li> So far, I love it. Use cotton ball to apply. A few drops...all you need. The aroma is very very nice. The best part...my skin was smoother RIGHT AWAY. Use on face AND neck. Oh... I should mention, that if you are having any issues, you can get advise and encouragement from &amp;#34;Beauty By Earth&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I recently started using toner and this is by far my favorite to date!  I noticed that it provides a light hydration before applying my moisturizer and also helped my skin cream and makeup stay on my skin better.  The ingredient list is top notch, no chemicals or perfumes. Thank you Beauty by Earth ... can&#x27;t wait for a hair care line!</li>
    <li> I decided to leave a review now that I have used this toner for a full week.  I really love it.  Before this product, I was using a different brand organic rosewater toner, but I like Beauty by Earth&#x27;s toner so much better.  The toner by Beauty by Earth cleanses and moisturizes my face so much better.  It has a really nice scent that is not overwhelming.  It doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin at all.  My foundation has been applying so much better even without putting on some primer.  Only thing I wish is that the &amp;#34;spout&amp;#34; was a spray type but that is my personal preference.</li>
    <li> This toner leaves my skin feeling refreshed and wonderful. I love that the ingredients are all natural!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! It works wonders on my skin!!</li>
    <li> I love this! It is refreshing (not drying). It smells good (not overpowering). It feels good. It is all natural. And, it is works well. I am very happy with this product and I love Beauty by Earth&#x27;s lip balms. I highly recommend this toner and I look forward to trying more of their product line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week but so far, so good. Doesn&#x27;t seem to overly dry my face as some toners tend to. In addition to the fact that the toner appears good overall I really like the pleasant smell from the rose water.</li>
    <li> I like how gentle this is on my skin. I Normally don&#x27;t use anything on my face as it dries out pretty easily (especially this time of year- winter) but this toner actually feels good on my face and does not dry it out at all. The scent can be a little strong but not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it works well and I really like it.</li>
    <li> I really adore the subtle rose water scent. I was using an all-organic rose water facial toner that would run me up 3 fl oz for $50. I received a promo for this product. I&#x27;ve noticed a sudden reduction of my large pores, redness around my chin, and how clean my face feels after applying this toner. I appreciate this product because it&#x27;s made with almost all organic ingredients, vegan, savvy packaging, fragrance, and faultless skin types.Ever since I had some drastic results, I bought more.</li>
    <li> This is the best toner I have ever tried.  It removes dirt that the normal cleanser leaves behind.  I have the L&#x27;occitane cleansing water as well as the Mary Kay botanics toner, and they are okay and fine.  This one is the BEST.  It smells lovely, has natural ingredients, and it really works!  I will buy again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I have tried many  toners and facial products that leave my face dry and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one really feels clean and it has just enough moisture to improve my combination skin. I like how it smells and that the ingredients are organic.</li>
    <li> Works Great! Smells so good!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!! Leaves my skin feeling cleaner.  I love how it really smells natural... No chemical nasty stuff!! Totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> So far, so good, cleans the face well. Smells very good, just started using. Like it!</li>
    <li> Really works great. Every morning my husband asks me what I did because my face looks so well taken care of. If I spent three times the amount of money I would not get a product that works better. So happy that I found this.</li>
    <li> I really like this toner! My face feels clean, but still soft and hydrated after using it. I&#x27;ve been using a sensitive skin astringent, but this is so much better and so much gentler on my skin.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful, soothing toner. Asking for more products from this company. For my mature skin just great.</li>
    <li> I love this toner. I have troubled skin and it tends to be oily and then get really dry. This toner does NOT leave my skin dry like a lot of toners do. It feels clean. I love Beauty by Earth products.</li>
    <li> I love Beauty By Earth products! I&#x27;ve yet to be disappointed in anything (Argan oil, sunscreen, konjac facial sponges, lip balm)! The ingredients are pure and the products work. This toner has made my skin so much smoother and it feels so clean after I use it. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like most toners do and it has a really nice scent. I use it morning under makeup and at night before bed. Thank you for making so many amazing products without all the toxic crap!</li>
    <li> I got this for a friend for Christmas who is really into facial products and although she did not tell me how it is, she was estatic to receive the product since I let her try one of Beauty by Earth&#x27;s other products (Lip balm). I would definitely recommend this product compared to Khiel&#x27;s overpriced facial toner</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m revising an earlier review.  Note: if you want the spray mechanism, order the smaller version.  I first purchased this in the large size and thought it was just okay, perhaps making my skin a little dry.  However, after ordering the small one that comes with a spray nozzle, I&#x27;ve decided I love this stuff. I keep it on my desk and \\&quot;tone\\&quot; throughout the day.  It&#x27;s a great way to refresh!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product every night for almost a month now and have already started seeing results. I had never used toners before but i am glad I found this all natural product. I wanted a Toner with witch hazel in it as it is considered to be very good for all skin types.</li>
