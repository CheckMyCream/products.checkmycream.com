    <li> Wore these with a nude pink nail color and got so many compliments I wished I had purchased more. One downside is that there are only 10 so when one (or more) falls off--and they will fall off--you have nothing to replace them with. The rhinestone made the design stand up more than the logo alone and I couldn&#x27;t get the edges of the C&#x27;s to glue down completely so I lost 3 of them before giving up and changing my nail art--but that was after almost 10 days of wear and tear on all of my fingers. Would still wear them again gladly.</li>
