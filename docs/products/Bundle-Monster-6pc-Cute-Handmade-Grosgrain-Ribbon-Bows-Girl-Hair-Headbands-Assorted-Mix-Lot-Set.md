      <li>/&gt;*This item was sponsored to me by Bundle Monster in exchange for my honest review</li>
      <li>They are  for toddlers and kids who are adept at handling hair ornaments or their mommies.  </li>
      <li>There is a nice variety and they are even cuter in person than in the pictures.</li>
      <li>Very cute and stylish and durable</li>
      <li>These are the perfect touch to a young girl&#x27;s accessories!  </li>
      <li>This was the best set of headbands I could find for our 4 year old granddaughter.  </li>
      <li>These headbands are really cute, but they are not holding up.  </li>
      <li>but they are adorable out of the box.</li>
      <li>So although they are cute.</li>
      <li>She looks SO cute in them though.</li>
      <li>headbands are top quality stuff.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>They also fit her head quite nicely.  </li>
      <li>They are made very well and have great details in each ribbon wrapped design.  </li>
      <li>These are precious, but that preciousness is all for naught, as they won&#x27;t stay on my daughter&#x27;s head or in her hair for even the time it takes her to walk out of the bathroom.</li>
      <li>These are really cute.</li>
      <li>Their mommy says they are super cute, and the girls love them!</li>
      <li>I purchased these headbands for my 2-1/2 year old niece, and they are beautiful.</li>
      <li>They are colorful and cute and stay in place nicely.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m glad they fit now.  </li>
      <li>Each one is unique and really cute.</li>
      <li>Perfect for any little girly - girl:)</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re all fine.  </li>
      <li>I thought these were super cute on my daughter.</li>
      <li>Super cute and flexible.  </li>
      <li>It is a real shame, too, because they are adorable as they hang decoratively on her headband holder . . . .</li>
      <li>Bought this for my 2 year old niece and it can be used with so many outfits.</li>
      <li>My daughter has very fine blonde hair and these headbands will not stay in her hair longer than 10 mins while she is playing</li>
      <li>My niece has a small head, and they fit her well; however, they will probably fit most children well, as the bands are pretty flexible.</li>
      <li>Really well-made..no glue showing!</li>
      <li>I tried putting hot glue underneath to roughen it up, as well as that gripper stuff, but it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>So they are adorable but if your child is not used to wearing them, they won&#x27;t make it back home.</li>
      <li>They are soft and comfortable.</li>
      <li>The look exactly like the online pics.</li>
      <li>They have held up really well!</li>
      <li>Since the headbands are made for children, I expected them to hold up to more than one day of use.</li>
      <li>She wants to do all of our hair.</li>
      <li>The bundle of hair accessories are as expected and more.  </li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re all beautiful and they don&#x27;t squeeze hard on the sides of her head at all!!</li>
      <li>All in all, I would recommend them because they&#x27;re cute and very durable (a light, flexible material... not like the hard plastic ones for older kids)</li>
      <li>The little crotchet flower is a favorite.</li>
      <li>They snapped right in the middle .</li>
      <li>I can wear it comfortably and they are loose on my two year old.</li>
      <li>My 3 1/2 year old loves them!</li>
      <li>I did dress them up a little more by adding gems and bigger bows</li>
      <li>The ends of every headband that my 3.5 year old daughter has worn have unraveled.  </li>
      <li>I bought these for my two year old.  </li>
      <li>My 6-year old daughter loves them.</li>
      <li>We live in NYC and similar head bands are a fortune.</li>
      <li>She has a pretty big head, and they are too loose and have no grab.</li>
      <li>My niece is only 9.5 months old</li>

<li> The wide head bands stay put well on my daughters (age 2 and 4), but the thin ones do not.</li>
<li> and I mean that after she put them on the dog and the dog running around digging and playing ball while wearing these headbands!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought these for my toddler and am very pleased. There is a nice variety and they are even cuter in person than in the pictures. The little crotchet flower is a favorite. Don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;ll hold up, as we just got them but the headbands seem fairly flexible. If they break within the next few months, I&#x27;ll post an update.</li>
    <li> These headbands are perfect. The look exactly like the online pics.They are soft and comfortable. My granddaughter wears it for hours at a time. She is three and they fit great. The price is also good. We live in NYC and similar head bands are a fortune. I recommend  these with no reservations.</li>
    <li> My babies 3 &amp; 5 yrs. love it. Just wished it cost a little bit less. $15.00 &amp; sum for just 6 pcs. it&#x27;s alright I guess..</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these headbands but always takes them off and looses them. So they are adorable but if your child is not used to wearing them, they won&#x27;t make it back home.</li>
    <li> Super cute and flexible.  Not too tight</li>
    <li> Some of the headbands are kind of ugly but other than that product was as described</li>
    <li> The sizing is big as other reviews say. I can wear it comfortably and they are loose on my two year old. She looks SO cute in them though. She will have them for years since they won&#x27;t get outgrown.</li>
    <li> These headbands are really cute and a great value. They have held up really well! We haven&#x27;t had any of the bows fall off or the fabric come apart. My daughter loves them and the variety of colors go great with all of her clothes.</li>
    <li> These are really cute. The wide head bands stay put well on my daughters (age 2 and 4), but the thin ones do not.</li>
    <li> Very cute but a bit pricey. Santa will be leaving these in my granddaughters stocking! Will be quite adorable dressed up or casual.</li>
    <li> Adorable! My 3 1/2 year old loves them! Great buy!</li>
    <li> I thought these were super cute on my daughter. She loves wearing headbands, but these all broke in no time at all. They snapped right in the middle . So although they are cute. They will not last.</li>
    <li> The bundle of hair accessories are as expected and more.  They are  for toddlers and kids who are adept at handling hair ornaments or their mommies.  I will possibly be a repeat buyer if the occasion arises.</li>
    <li> she loves having the different options. and they&#x27;re all beautiful and they don&#x27;t squeeze hard on the sides of her head at all!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;These headbands are top quality stuff. The packaging is very nice and they came in perfect condition. This is the only brand I invest in when it comes to my daughter&#x27;s hair accessories. 5 star product.</li>
    <li> Runs small. If your child can wear and woman&#x27;s small hat this will not fit her head. Also nongrip. My daughter has very fine blonde hair and these headbands will not stay in her hair longer than 10 mins while she is playing</li>
    <li> I purchased these headbands for my 2-1/2 year old niece, and they are beautiful. My niece has a small head, and they fit her well; however, they will probably fit most children well, as the bands are pretty flexible. Good quality, great designs.</li>

    <li> Bought this for my 2 year old niece and it can be used with so many outfits. Each one is unique and really cute. A steal for the price! Really well-made..no glue showing!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves to keep her hair down.  I like her hair up so it doesn&#x27;t get messy when she plays.  This provides us with a perfect compromise.  These are darling headbands.  I did dress them up a little more by adding gems and bigger bows but they are adorable out of the box.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these!  They are colorful and cute and stay in place nicely.  Perfect for any little girly - girl:)</li>
    <li> I love these headbands! I bought them for my three granddaughters who always have hair in their eyes. Work perfect.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect touch to a young girl&#x27;s accessories!  They are made very well and have great details in each ribbon wrapped design.  The colors will go with any wardrobe.  I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased these!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my two year old.  They&#x27;re slightly big for her, but they work.  They&#x27;re very cute, and they look just like the picture. They also seem fairly sturdy.  Plus, at $3 a piece, they are a bargain!</li>
    <li> These are precious, but that preciousness is all for naught, as they won&#x27;t stay on my daughter&#x27;s head or in her hair for even the time it takes her to walk out of the bathroom. I tried putting hot glue underneath to roughen it up, as well as that gripper stuff, but it just doesn&#x27;t work. She has a pretty big head, and they are too loose and have no grab.

    <li> Excellent value and beautiful designs. My 6-year old daughter loves them. I would recommend for little girls or as a gift.</li>
    <li> My niece is only 9.5 months old but she has a massive head of hair so I&#x27;m glad they fit now.  Her favourite is the brown one (set 2); she&#x27;s chewed it, bent it in every way possible, she&#x27;s flopped down on them and they&#x27;re all fine.  All in all, I would recommend them because they&#x27;re cute and very durable (a light, flexible material... not like the hard plastic ones for older kids) AND if you shop at Carter&#x27;s they will go well with your baby clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This item was sponsored to me by Bundle Monster in exchange for my honest review*</li>
    <li> This was the best set of headbands I could find for our 4 year old granddaughter.  They&#x27;re very nice and she loved them!  They also fit her head quite nicely.  I recommend them.</li>
    <li> We loved it. Very good quality product</li>
    <li> These headbands are really cute, but they are not holding up.  The ends of every headband that my 3.5 year old daughter has worn have unraveled.  Since the headbands are made for children, I expected them to hold up to more than one day of use.</li>
