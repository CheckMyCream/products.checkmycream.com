<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this product everyday for 3 or 4 years. I love how soft it makes my skin and now I can find it cheaper and delivered to my door!</li>
    <li> Like this soap. love the way it smells.  Works real well, and its a good price, you can&#x27;t beat this price in a store for this many bars of soap at once!</li>
    <li> We swear by subscribe and save for many reasons, especially the convenience.  We buy this soap here and love the clean, fresh smell.  It is light and not overpowering but smells so nice.  It leaves my skin clean but not dry.  My husband and I both use it and have noticed better skin texture since using this, which I wouldn&#x27;t typically expect from an inexpensive brand, but I love it!</li>
    <li> My expectation was cranberry.  I loved how my husband smelled right out of the shower.  When I chose the soaps by recognizing the red color box, I thought it was what we purchased before.  In fact, it&#x27;s a much softer fragrance called Power Berries.</li>
    <li> just love the smell of this soap its fantastic and didn&#x27;t cost much at all I recommend it to all my frends.</li>
    <li> I use it every day. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> Great smelling mild/gentle glycerin soap.</li>
    <li> A well sought out soap, that is usually sold out of stores. Well, if yur are a fan of cranberry, or fruit smells then look no further. This soap is amazing. It leaves the skin feeling soft, and refreshed. And, the smell last hours after you shower. Enough said, if you are thinking of purchasing this, then I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received two six packs of this soap and gave one pack to my sister.  I have used the soap and like it very well.  It smells good and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> The scent of this soap bar fills the entire bathroom with a cranberry aroma.  The bars seem to last longer than most glycerin soap so that is a plus!  I will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> Cheap does not always mean bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is much better for my skin compared to regular detergent laced soaps</li>
    <li> It smells great! It left my skin feeling really soft and smelling good. Will buy again. Great soap! Also cheap!</li>
    <li> Bought many times and always happy with the service and the product!</li>
    <li> It has a wonderful smell and you come out of the shower feeling very clean and freshed!!!!  Give it a try!!!!</li>
    <li> My local Target store used to carry this soap, but no more.  Thankfully, Amazon has it.  IMO, this is the BEST smelling soap ever.  It&#x27;s glycerin, so it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  And, it lathers up nicely.  There is nothing negative about this soap.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  It has such a fresh and appealing scent and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wanted to try something Dial other than the usual. Wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all with this. Great lingering scent and makes the whole bathroom smell good. Definitely recommend and I&#x27;m gonna try them all eventually. Great price and fast delivery. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Nice faint smell/ pretty color/ gets skin squeaky clean/ smaller sized hand soap/ doesn&#x27;t clog drain/ not a moisturizing soap though not drying on skin</li>
    <li> Not only does this item have a nice fragrance, it is also glycerin based so it does not leave a soapy film on your body or your shower.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this soap and it has the best aroma . It is not offensive as others.</li>
    <li> And the only bar soap I will ever use. Leaves a very attractive scent and is excellent for making homemade laundry detergent.</li>
    <li> This soap smells great, but it doesn&#x27;t last a very long time.  As far as glycerin soaps go, this one does a great job of hydrating your skin.  The cranberry scent is amazing.  I just wish the individual bars lasted longer!</li>
    <li> i like it and every thing is perfect. very nice as described.&lt;br /&gt;thank you. and that all to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ghassan</li>
    <li> I just love the Dial glycerin soap. I can never find them in stores. When I found them on Amazon, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I love both the fragrance and the feel of them. They are great for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I happy dial created a glycerin soap bar, I have sensitive skin, when using this glycerin soap ....I have confidence in the fact that it is safe for my skin. especially my face.  I know there are others (glycerin) out there but dial is a trusted brand.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, works well and great value when on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these and the green ones and enjoy them.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance but wish it was stronger. I like the shape of the bar. I like the way it lathers.</li>
    <li> Glycerin soap is so soothing and pleasant to use, good quality, price</li>
    <li> it smells exactly as how you would think cranberry soap smells like. it&#x27;s not an overpowering smell and it does it job of keeping me clean.</li>
    <li> Smells good suds up good also good price.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only soaps I have found that has never reacted badly with my very sensitive skin. My husband brought it home a while ago hoping it might work. It was great. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin sticky or dry it out. It smells good without being overpowering. The downside? It became somewhat hard to find- until we looked on Amazon. Now we get it shipped directly to us and don&#x27;t have to worry about finding someone who stocks it.</li>
    <li> We really like this glycerin soap and when our local store stopped carrying it, we found it and ordered it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> They sent a box of old ones. The box they came in was plain cardboard and said &#x27;not for resale&#x27;.They hardly had any smell at all. Usually these are very fragrant. I was not aware I was buying something like a factory reject.</li>
    <li> Love this is my fav soap Cranberry rocks !!</li>
    <li> I cannot get over how great these smell. I don&#x27;t think they last as long as generic cheap soap, but to me it is well worth it. I like the fruit smell. And the color is neat too.  I buy them at the local box store, but find them here even cheaper sometimes. So when I see them on sale I get a lot.  In fact I am expecting 3 of these, so that&#x27;s 3x8x2 &#x3D; 48 bars! Haha.  Sometimes I worry if I put them too low on the tub, my dog may want to eat one because they smell so delicious.  My dog is adopted.  I &amp;lt;3 my her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adopt a shelter pet.</li>
    <li> This is the best bar soap i have ever used. I have sensitive skin. Tried many bodywashes and bar soaps, but all of them gave me allergic reaction. This is the only bar soap that cleans well and soothes my skin. The fragrance also doesnt give me any migraine.</li>
    <li> Good soap.  No longer available at the Publix supermarket.</li>
    <li> Great Buy! Nice smelling Scent!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, but the soap I have right now smells of cranberry and blue cheese. Not a scent that I want wafting off my body. I wont be getting this kind again.</li>
    <li> This is a sudsy, foamy great smelling soap!  The cranberry smells awakens your senses and makes showering an even bigger joy than it currently is.</li>
    <li> I use is all over, including my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like laurel-sulfate shampoo.  It smells great, but doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
    <li> Wonderful non-drying soap, I use it exclusively.</li>
    <li> I have bought this soap a nunber of times from Amazon and here is what I have determined so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The Glycerin soap lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It doesn&#x27;t turn to mush in your soap dish.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It is a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;4.  The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering yet it does give you a hint of cranberry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have actually given a few bars away to people in my family and they are hooked as well!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a good price, about $0.25 per bar.  The other reviews are correct about the smell, it smells good, like cranberries.  But, even after the first use, I immediately felt I might have got a product that I would never buy again.  My main complaint is the sensation of the skin after rinsing off the soap.  It feels almost sticky, or maybe just less smooth, that what I am used to.  I&#x27;ve never used a glycerin bar soap before, so maybe it is this way with all glycerin soaps.  Just not my bag.  I&#x27;ll be giving the rest away.</li>
    <li> I bought this to relieve my dry skin which happens mostly in the winter,  I bought a variety of types for a variety of fragrances.  It is great soap.</li>
    <li> I wanted red soap and this fits the bill.  It&#x27;s decent soap but I bought it for the look and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> good bar of soap.Has a good smell to it glycerin in it helps your skin not to dry out.makes bathroom smell great also</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t get this product it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t last very long and the scent is even worse, don&#x27;t get it, I&#x27;m warning you.</li>
    <li> The wife and I have been using the dollar a bar Caress and Dove for years and I decided to try a few other soaps to see if one will stack up. This is pretty good and at half the price, I think we found a winner.</li>
    <li> Many years ago, I tried Dial once and had to throw out the whole pack because it was so dry. I have been using Lever 2000 moisturizing bars for 20 years but felt it&#x27;s a bit too dry for me now that my skin is getting less oily with age. I also felt the soap smells too soapy for someone my age. I switched to liquid soaps but don&#x27;t like the slippery feeling sometimes. After reading the great reviews on Amazon, I decided to give the Dial Glycerin soap a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These soap, like many Glycerin soaps, smells good. I no longer smell like the much younger me who just stepped out of the gym all the time. These soaps also leave the skin soft. I&#x27;ve been only using it for a few weeks and already noticed a great improvement especially on my elbows, knees, and feet. But it&#x27;s the good clean kind of soft, not the slippery kind from liquid soaps. I have not used it in the dead winter yet. So I may need to switch to a liquid soap with lotion, or switch up my body lotion. But I think I will be using Dial Glycerin soaps for some years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find the Dial Glycerin bar lasts much longer than some of the expensive specialty Glycerin soaps. With some other Glycerin soaps, I can go through one bar per week in summer time when I take a few showers a day. Some folks may love that in a bar soap ingredients. But it&#x27;s too much work for me just to repurchase. With the Dial Glycerin soaps, at the Amazon price with a large pack shipped to my door, it&#x27;s a win win win.</li>
    <li> Seems to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; more easily from the steam of a shower and therefore does not last that long (compared to order dial brands)</li>
    <li> My husband loves this soap, and so do I. It smells like cranberry and cleans the skin very well, just liked soap should.</li>
    <li> I smell Cranberry after using this soap, very happy about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;willing to buy more. . . . . .</li>
    <li> I buy soap on price.  This seemed inexpensive but I then found it elsewhere for less money.  When I use this soap I find that hit lathers up and removes dirt. It doesn&#x27;t smell.  I don&#x27;t care about anything else, except the price.</li>
    <li> I love glycerin soap. Good smell. Don&#x27;t last as long as other soaps but for the price, you still come out ahead.</li>
    <li> I love the antioxidant glycerin soap bars.  They are not harsh on my skin and the scent is wonderful.  The price on Amazon (especially subscribe and save) is great.  I hardly have to shop locally anymore and what could be easier than having it shipped regularly to my doorstep.  No worries!!</li>
    <li> I really like this soap.  It is really sudsy and smells really good.  The bar lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> Overall I like this soap and the cranberry is noticeable, but it isn&#x27;t as strong as a few reviews made it sound.  Wish it had a stronger cranberry scent.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice.  When you open the package and put it in your bathroom, your whole bathroom will smell like the soap for a week.  And, as it should, it keeps you clean.</li>
    <li> This soap is almost perfect. It lathers well, the suds last and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Another unadvertised use of this soap is that it is an excellent shaving soap I went back to shaving with a double edge razor two years ago.I use a brush and shaving soap. After experimenting with Dial Cranberry Soap I find it works very well and leaves my skin soft and smooth By the way , I am a 66 year old man , but I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have loved this dial soap since it came out and I was so happy to see the price that Amazon was selling it.  I now have soap for the next few months and then some.  The fragrance is wonderful and the lathering is great too.</li>
    <li> THANK GOD FOR GLYCERIN SOAP!!!! NO MORE FILM ON ME OR THE SHOWER</li>
    <li> This is hands-down THE best-smelling bath soap I&#x27;ve ever used. I love it, my wife loves it, and my mother who has sensitive skin tried it when we all went on vacation together and loved it too. It is now the only soap she&#x27;ll use. 10/10 would recommend.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this is the end-all soap product, but it has a very distinct smell (that&#x27;s good) and I love that amazon offers in-bulk. A case if this lasts me WELL over 6 months (daily use)</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive so I cannot used perfumed soaps and I have to often resort to a dove bar. Dove can be pretty expensive so I am always looking for an alternative. This bar of soap leaves my skin feeling soft and not overly dry. It also has a nice subtle fragrance that does not cause an allergic reaction. Very nice soap, it&#x27;s so good that you almost want to eat it. The red bar is so unique and attractive. I know soap is not supposed to be attractive but I do love this Dial Bar.</li>
    <li> I first bought this soap at a local retailer and loved it.  Now it is no longer available at any local store, so I went on line to see if I could find it - and to my surprise I was able to purchase it at Amazon at a substantial savings.</li>
    <li> stopped buying this product because it uses palm oil that is not sustainable</li>
    <li> As promised, as delivered!</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this soap that I have even given it to friends &amp; family.&lt;br /&gt;Very fragrant without being overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;It lathers well and leaves no apparent residue on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Its now my new favorite bar soap hoping they make a liquid version soon too.&lt;br /&gt;If you are afraid to get the large pack it is sold in a two pack.&lt;br /&gt;Its worth the try !</li>
    <li> My favorite soap.  Smells lightly of soapy cranberries...but not overpowering and still manly.</li>
    <li> I purchased for shower.  Got total of 16 bars which should last a very long time.  Nice bouquet;  last long.</li>
    <li> My bo love the soap and I got it for a good price. I will be getting more from the company. I will tell my friend and family about you guy.</li>
    <li> Dial gives you so many choices. I love them all. The antioxidant cranberry bar soap is great. Your skin is soft, smooth, and you smell great!</li>
    <li> Two stars for the price.  Otherwise one. The problem for me?  The cranberry smell is a little too strong.  Otherwise it&#x27;s Dial and you get pretty much what you&#x27;d expect for lower end soap.</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer said, this soap does make your bathroom smell good. I put one pack in my bathroom and one is my sons&#x27; bathroom. I feel so clean after each use.</li>
    <li> I think I am hooked on this soap. Lathers great and really has made a difference in helping make my skin softer. I also really like the smell. Being glycerin based it does tend to get used up quicker than most soaps. Will buy again as long as I can get it.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this does a great job getting me clean but not drying out my skin. No more red blotchy patches !!!! Highly recommend.</li>
