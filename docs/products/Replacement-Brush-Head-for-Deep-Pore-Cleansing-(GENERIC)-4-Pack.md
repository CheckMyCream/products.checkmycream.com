<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Said package of 4 box containing brushes contained 4 but only contained 3 brush heads</li>
    <li> Works in the Clarisonic Mia 2 PERFECTLY. May be just a bit rougher than the Clarisonic brushes in texture but not overly so. What a find....glad there is an alternative that saves a LOT of money!</li>
    <li> Not as good as original.</li>
    <li> these work on my clairesonic just as well as the brand name ones. But for way wicked less.</li>
    <li> They fit my Clarisonic Mia3 (Aria renamed, evidently) perfectly. I have pretty sensitive skin, and since switching to these from the brand name, I find that I get small, fine cuts on my forehead. I&#x27;m only 40, so it&#x27;s not as though my skin is naturally weak due to aging. Therefore, I can only unfortunately assume that the bristles are simply not as soft as their more expensive, brand name counterparts.    Rather than buy the expensive brand name ones, I just use these every other day, and only in the evening, and then they seem to work fine.</li>
    <li> Not *quite* as stiff as the real deal, but at $8.47 for 4, no complaints here.</li>
    <li> These fit perfectly on the Clarisonic Mia. I can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the Clarisonic brand, other than the vast price difference!</li>
    <li> excellent, works just as good as the name brand</li>
    <li> These are definitely a good value for the price when compared to the clerisonic brand replacement brush heads.</li>
    <li> I am about a year past due on replacing the brush head on my Clarisonic Mia. I wasn&#x27;t wild about the idea of spending $25 for a brush head. These fit my Clarisonic Mia perfectly, and work just the same as name brand. At about $7 for 4, I think I will buy some more and have plenty on hand.</li>
    <li> These work perfect in the mia 2.  I liked them so much I ordered another one for my friend for Christmas.  Love them! I&#x27;ll be a customer for life!</li>
    <li> Took FOREVER to get these (2 months), but they were super inexpensive and work just as well as the fancy ones that cost a fortune.</li>
    <li> Came from China.  My mistake, if I had realize where they were coming from I wouldn&#x27;t have bought them</li>
    <li> As good as the expensive brand</li>
    <li> Love them fit perfect the clarassonic</li>
    <li> Brush was Too soft, did not work well with Clarisonic device. I was Not pleased with my purchase</li>
    <li> Fits perfect on my clarasonic Mia.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly to my Mia 2</li>
    <li> I ordered these as the one for my Mia2 were $22 each.  Decided to try something different.  I used a new brush head this morning. It fit and rotated/vibrated on the Mia2 just fine.  Feels fine. I will order more!!</li>
    <li> AWESOME BRUSHES!!---same as the brand name at a fraction of the price! great deal!!</li>
    <li> Works well, needs a little adjustment when you first put them on - need to pop the head in correctly. Other than that, better than expected.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work!  Would not allow to charge.</li>
    <li> Seems like the real deal.  I got tired of spending so much on replacement brushes for my Clarisonic.  These do the trick for me!</li>
    <li> These were pretty good, and you can&#x27;t argue with the discount over the name brand ones. However, I did find them to be a bit scratchier than the ones my clarisonic came with.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic!!! Way better than spending $25 for an individual brush head</li>
    <li> works just like the name brand!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love these brush heads. I was buying the Clarisonic replacement brush heads at $25 each. This pack of 3 is a much better deal for the same quality and it saves me a trip to Ulta. I love the fact that Greenlnsync offers the various cleansing types as Clarisonic does. I personally use the sensitive type. Will continue he to repurchase over and over.</li>
    <li> Super soft and the clear cover clicks on them even better than my name brand original head ever has.</li>
    <li> Only 2 of the 4 brush heads in my 4 pack worked on my Clarisonic.  I tried everything to get all four to work on my Clarisonic, but only 2 worked.  There is a notable difference in quality compared to the original $25 brush heads.  Wanted to point this out as people are raving about the knockoff brush heads and after trying to go cheap, I will have to go back to regular price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take this as a warning, if the injection molding is off by centimeters, it will not fit your Clarisonic and you will have a box of brush heads that do not work.  The Brush heads will snap into your clarisonic, but when you turn on the device, the knock off brush heads will not &amp;#34;spin&amp;#34; like the regular priced brush heads.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and brushes are great!  Same as the ones the clarisonic uses.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the $24 heads at the department stores</li>
    <li> Nope. They started smelling musty after just one use even though I fully removed the head and drained it on a small rack as I had with the Clarisonic brand. Thought maybe it was a one-off but I&#x27;ve had it happen with each one in the 4 pack. Also the Sensitive set seemed to tear up my&lt;br /&gt;Skin more than the Clarisonic brand did. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to find this product at such an affordable price. But when it came it was not what I ordered. It said in the product description that it was a four pack... WRONG. It was a three pack. The product description also said that it was a four pack of sensitive cleansing brush heads....WRONG. It was a sensitive, deep cleansing and an acne cleansing head. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Does not clean very well. The brustles are too soft the be effective. Points for price and delivery of vendor, but the product itself is of no benefit.</li>
    <li> Fits our Clarisonic perfectly.Brush is soft but does a great job.</li>
    <li> This does not fit the clarosonic brush as described. It will not work when inserted into the brush handle.</li>
    <li> Just like the name brand, but at a much better price.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  I bought these to use on my Clarisonic Mia.  They don&#x27;t seem to fit quite as securely as the clarisonic brush that came with it, but so far it&#x27;s working just fine!  And these are a much better price!</li>
    <li> Works as good as the more expensive version. Fit perfectly, I haven&#x27;t had any issues in 2 months.</li>
    <li> Buy these brush heads! For healthy skin, the brushes on your Clarisonic need to be replaced monthly. Expensive, UNLESS you ditch Sephora &amp; buy these brush heads from Amazon, they work exactly as the name brand brush heads from Sephora, but these are SUPER inexpensive.</li>
    <li> These are a great alternative brand for Clarisonic. They fit my Clarisonic Mia perfectly and work just as well. You get four which is a years supply and only only spend $11 after shipping.</li>
    <li> Fits perfect! Bristles are so soft, would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Fits my Mia2 perfectly. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> These seem really rough compared to the authentic clarisonic heads.</li>
    <li> Review from my wife: Works great with my clarisonic</li>
    <li> These are great! They might be a tiny bit more rough than the name brand kind, but to get 4 of them for less than 1/3 of the price of ONE name brand kind, it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find these at a great cost.  My face feels wonderful again.</li>
    <li> Ok, so here&#x27;s the situation.  I ordered these as a 4-pack of sensitive cleaning brush replacements for my Mia 2.  But that is not what I received!  Instead, I only got 3 brush heads, not 4...AND instead of them all being sensitive, I received 1 sensitive, 1 deep cleansing and an acne cleansing head. And here&#x27;s the other thing...they all feel exactly the same!  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Fit great on my clarisonic!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between the real and these! I will be back to purchase more in the future!</li>
    <li> Pretty close to clarisonic&#x27;s brush heads. Bristles feel a bit more synthetic but price difference makes up for it. Will continue to purchase this brand.</li>
    <li> So pleased with these!</li>
    <li> I like the Clarisonic for my face and these are less expensive and works as well as the name brand.</li>
    <li> It will fit onto the Clarisonic Mia 2 but it blocks the motor so it barely has any power when it vibrates. It is a total waste of money and you can&#x27;t really use it effectively at all. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to replace the brush head on my Mia Clarisonic.  What a find!  These fit perfectly!  This is a much more affordable option to the $20.00 replacement head for ONE at Ulta.  I will be repurchasing these.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase because I feared lesser quality, but did based on other reviewers.  I was not disappointed these brush heads are the same as the name brand with only two differences that I can find.  One, the printed box (and who misses that?), and two, the price.  Here you can get four for the price of one.  The shipping takes longer because it is shipped from China.  But it is worth the wait and definitely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> As advertised, good value.</li>
    <li> If you have super-sensitive skin these may not be for you.  The bristles are a little harder than the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; brushes but I really like these.  My skin is not super-sensitive so the fact that they are a little harder does not bother me.  I have only been using my first one for a couple of weeks but it is holding up wonderfully.  I expect that each brush will last over a month and perhaps even for 3 months (the time they tell you to change it).  Considering the price that is a great bargain.  With the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; costing $25 per brush you can afford to change these every month and still come out cheaper than just one &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; brush.  I would highly recommend these and will be ordering more when I run low.  Well worth the cost and they arrived actually a little sooner than promised.  These are a super deal!</li>
    <li> I was shocked to see that replacement heads for the Mia were $37 when purchased from Clarisonic.  I found this replacement pack, and have been using them about 10 days.  The results are fantastic, my skin looks great.  Great value.</li>
    <li> My eyes and face get irritated and I sneeze when I use this.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> The only regret I have is not discovering and purchasing these sooner. My skin feels and looks just as good as it did with the Clarisonic brand brushes. I actually appreciate the way these feel better :)</li>
    <li> Fits my clarisonic aria perfectly!</li>
    <li> I bought a pack of four sensitive skin brushes, I gave one to my friend and put one on my clarasonic, it fits perfectly just like the authentic brand. I really love it. It is perfectly soft for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Worked great.  They scrubbed more than the official Clairsonic brand Sensitive, but worked great for me.  Didn&#x27;t fit as perfectly into the clairsonic as the ones that came with my Clairsonic, but once you get it on works exactly the same.  Saving something close to $20 a pop was worth it to me.  I will be buying an off brand from now on.</li>
    <li> I got a hold of these and didn&#x27;t have high expectations but they fit my clarisonic just fine. Why would I pay more?</li>
    <li> These brush heads work just as well as the &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; name ones!&lt;br /&gt;Was hesitant on purchasing, but am glad I did.</li>
    <li> These are great on sensitive skin, they&#x27;re even softer than the original brush heads. Fits perfectly on the Mia. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic savings over the department store price for these and just as effective.</li>
    <li> Why pay full price, when you can have these for a fraction of the cost!? I will not buy the name brand after finding these!</li>
    <li> Wife has commented she likes these better than the OEM Clairsonic brand. Saves a ton of money as well.</li>
    <li> I must confess that I ordered these with great trepidation...they just seemed too cheap! But I read the reviews and decided to try them.  They are fabulous! They fit my Clarisonic Mia 2 perfectly and are working great.</li>
    <li> WTF?! Why are some people saying these brush heads are compatible with the Mia 2?? These do not work at all!!!! What a complete waste...</li>
    <li> These work well but don&#x27;t always fit on exactly right.  I would probably purchase them again as the price difference between this and the clairsonic brand.</li>
    <li> Since the brand-name are $25 each, and you&#x27;re supposed to change them out monthly I was thrilled to find this! A generic package of 4, for $15.00. I use the Clarisonic Mia. They do seem a little stiffer, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in how they work. I would recommend them, but they&#x27;re not exactly the same bristles.</li>
    <li> Fits my Clarisonic perfectly and I like that the brush is not too rough- great for my skin!</li>
    <li> Work well. Seem a little stiff.</li>
    <li> I am using clarisonic since past 4 years. I always purchased the original replacement brushes to deep clean my sensitive skin. I had ordered similar kind of brushes before where they did not mention generic brand but original clarisonic. I returned them as I stopped using my clarisonic with those brushes on. They used to hurt my skin so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I thought to give a try to these brushes. I have given 1 extra star for their honesty that they mentioned Generic in a bracket. The brushes are denser than real brushes. They hurt my face badly and make it red. They are good if you have non sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> They are not at all for sensitive skin, they are very rough.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a cheaper alternative to the expensive heads I typically buy for my Mia. They seemed fine to me until I attached them and turned it on at which point I discovered that they barely transmit any vibration at all, making them pretty much useless to me.</li>
    <li> Definitely just as good as the Clarisonic heads! I&#x27;m very impressed</li>
    <li> These fit fine on my Clarisonlc and are much cheaper</li>
    <li> I purchased these ( for my daughter who uses sensitive brushes) with the hope of saving money but these aren&#x27;t the same as clarisonic brushes,  they are softer.  She says her skin doesn&#x27;t seem to be getting as clean as when she uses the clarisonic brand.  We did the white face cloth test, and it appears she&#x27;s right, she was able to remove a small amount of additional dirt.  I repeat it was only a small amount.  Bottom line, I think they are OK.</li>
    <li> Hope there will be more of a deal like this!</li>
    <li> Great replacement brushes for the way over priced originals. These fit perfectly and are even a touch softer than the original sensitive brushes. Love!</li>
    <li> These brushes work well with the Mia2 and I was pleasantly surprised. Great deal for the price and beats paying full price for a Mia2 brush!</li>
    <li> These are great. These are just like the Clarisonic ones, just much cheaper. I wound defiantly buy these the next time I need them.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after refusing to spend $22 on ONE brush head! I have to say I am VERY impressed with this product! If you look at the picture I included in this review, the brush head looks different from the original (the generic is on the left and the original is on the right), but once wet it is the SPITTING image of the original! While this product looks just like the original, it does not feel the same. The bristles are not as stiff and seem to work better for my skin. Think of toothbrush bristles and velour; right in the middle is where you find the texture of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this product! I will be buying it again VERY soon!</li>
    <li> Fit Clarisonic nicely but bristles are harder than original Clarisonic bristles.</li>
    <li> Would not have ordered if I had known they were sent from China.  They are not the same quality as brushes I have previously ordered for Clarisonic, and  more difficult to get on and off, the Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> These really are just as good as the clarisonic brushes. They are also a fraction of the cost. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate on this purchase at all.</li>
    <li> Work great, love the price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not good as the orginal, it&#x27;s hurt when using it!</li>
    <li> The replacement brushes DO NOT WORK! They look almost identical but they barely agitate when attached. I bought it because the price was awesome but you know what they say &amp;#34;if it is too good to be true it probably is!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very good for the price!</li>
    <li> I find these harsh, even though they are Sensitive. The price makes me willing to try the Gentle ones to see if they might work better for me. There is a bit of shedding, and the quality is not near what the name brand ones are. However, at this price, I can afford a new one each month, instead of the recommended three months.</li>
    <li> As good as the clarisonic brushes!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t allow the center piece to vibrate freely on my Clarsonic Mia. It fits too tight, defeating the purpose.</li>
    <li> They were just like the expensive ones!!!</li>
    <li> So happy I got them they work just as good at the other brand</li>
    <li> I used the actual calrisonic brushes for almost a year (replacing them every 3 months), but when I saw these I thought, they&#x27;re so cheap might as well try it. I&#x27;ve used 2 of them, and have not noticed a difference from the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; ones at all! Cleans just as well, doesn&#x27;t get stained from make-up, fits on the brush. A much better bargain.</li>
    <li> I have the Mia spin facial brush and very sensitive skin and these replacement heads work better then the expensive ones. Hmmm buy one head for $33 or a generic 4 pack for $12. You don&#x27;t need to be a rocket scientist to do the math haha</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my Mia 2. I was skeptical because it&#x27;s made by a third party but it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> These are fine, but you do get what you pay for! They fit my Clarisonic. I can tell they are &#x27;generic&#x27; and they don&#x27;t seem to have the same cleaning power as the brand brush heads. Once these run out, I&#x27;m going back to Clarisonic replacement brushes.</li>
    <li> Would never know the difference from these and the expensive name brand ones.  The price is amazing and the product is fantastic!</li>
    <li> These are wonderful!  They feel and work exactly like the name brand ones and fit perfectly on my Mia!</li>
    <li> I like this system and these brushes are just fine for my Clarisonic. I was a little worried at first, but they seem to be exact duplicates of the brushes that came with my system.</li>
    <li> Love my Clarisonic, hated the price of the replacement heads. I bought the generic heads for &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin which are softer than regular brush heads and I&#x27;m very satisfied after using for 2+ weeks.</li>
    <li> Excellent price and works perfect!</li>
    <li> Great alternative to the expensive Clarisonic brush heads. I used this for the Mia brush and they fit in and work perfectly.</li>
    <li> I was so tired of paying upwards of $25 per replacement brush buying the Clairsonic brand. These at the very affordable price of about $13, for 4 brushes, was an incredible buy. I find no difference at all. I have 4 Clairsonic brushes for my entire family and purchasing 4 new Clairsonic brushes ever couple months was pricey. So excited I tried these. EXCELLENT experience, and incredible buy.</li>
    <li> These work great, and are an order of magnitude cheaper than brand name replacements.</li>
    <li> Amazing scrub! Bought the Clarasonic last year and have purchased the replacement brushes as a twin pack for $50.00 at Sephora. I got 4 brushes for 1/5th of the price and you get a much better scrub action with these!</li>
    <li> great value for the price! i paid about $7 for 4 of them! will buy again!</li>
    <li> Brushes fit my Clarisonic and were a great buy.</li>
    <li> A little harsh on the skin. I used it once and it left my face red for a little while.</li>
    <li> Does not fit the Clarisonic Mia properly.</li>
    <li> I was so thrilled that these fit my Clarisonic Mia at a fraction of the price of the brand name replacement heads.</li>
    <li> Fits the Clarisonic perfectly.  Softer bristles are nice.</li>
    <li> The replacement brush heads fit well on my Clarisonic Skin Cleanser.  The brushes are about the same as the brand Clarisonic ones.  The price was right.</li>
    <li> You get four for the price of two&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to all who use product&lt;br /&gt;I will return to order again</li>
    <li> These work just as good as the expensive Clairsonic ones. I am very happy with their performance.</li>
    <li> These do NOT fit the Mia2 clarisonic... it keeps popping off whenever i try to use it. Do not buy this product as a replacement for brushes if you have a Mia2</li>
    <li> Seems to be as good as the name band ones.</li>
    <li> 1 out of 3 brush heads was damaged during shipping.  These also do not fit the ProSonic Brush Cleansing System.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> The bristles seem a tad stiffer than the original, but what the hey…there&#x27;s such a price difference that the little stiffness is minor.  Good deal!</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, as expected and as described. I am so impressed with the value! Seriously, I cannot see any difference in the more expensive Clarisonic replacement. Seriously.  I am well pleased!  : )</li>
    <li> Great product! Bought for sensitive skin. No difference between this brush and the Clarisonic. I stocked up in case I can&#x27;t find them again! Seriously, why pay more?</li>
    <li> Looks almost identical to the clarisonic brush heads. The only difference is it has gray plastic instead of white plastic behind the bristles. Good quality. Came in quick. Glad I found them for an AMAZING price.-       EDIT 2/20/2015 The only thing that I have noticed, and it could totally be coincidence, but my calrisonic is new and I leave it in good condition that now my clarisonic dies all the time. I used to be able to charge it at night after I used it to wash my face, then the next morning I would unplug it and it would still stay charged when I went to use it at night. Now when I charge it at all night long (7-8 hours WAY over what is needed to charge it) it is completely dead the next time I go to use it. As I said, it could totally be unrelated but it only started happening when I used the generic replacement brush heads. Weird.</li>
    <li> While the price was very attractive, once I tried these I realized they were very poor quality. And they do not last close to as long as they should so in the long run it is actually cheaper to get the other brands that cost more.</li>
    <li> These fit perfectly on the Clarisonic Mia. The bristles are a little longer than the Clarisonic brand, but work just as well. The only other difference I can tell is that the bristles seem a little stiffer. This has no real effect on the brush&#x27;s performance. At this price, I would definitely recommend purchasing these over the more expensive name brand.</li>
    <li> wonderful. Love the sensitive brush head.</li>
    <li> I would say I am glad I bought it because my old clarisonic was like a year old and I can afford these but there not as good as the real thing.</li>
    <li> Not as soft as name brand</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re okay. I guess it is true what they say &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; because they do feel I bit rougher than the original clarisonic brush heads. But they get the job done and that&#x27;s what matters I guess, so for now they will do.</li>
    <li> They work just as well as the name brand ones.</li>
    <li> Good price; work well. Note they come straight from China and take some time to arrive.</li>
    <li> Not the soft brushes I expected</li>
    <li> These do fit a Clarisonic Mia exactly and they look identical to the name brand replacement brush heads/feel the same too.&lt;br /&gt;Price point is perfect considering shipment time-&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is this vendor ships from China and I was in US it said about three weeks shipping estimate so I wasn&#x27;t in a rush but it actually took 8 weeks--so don&#x27;t order if you need soon lol.</li>
    <li> A little cheap but works</li>
    <li> These are great, they fit my Clarisonic Mia perfectly and work exactly as the brand name brush heads.</li>
    <li> The brushes are fine and fit nicely into my Clarisonic, but I gave only two stars because I ordered the 4-pack of sensitive brushes and received a variety pack of three brush heads.</li>
    <li> These items did not work with my Mia2.  In addition I had to wait 3 weeks for delivery.</li>
    <li> Exactly like my original clarisonic Mia 2 heads! So happy I found these!</li>
    <li> Love them!  Just as good as the name brand that are much more money.</li>
    <li> this is good I cant us this is ganeric is not for my mia 2</li>
    <li> I received the 3 pack instead of the 4 pack. Still a good price and worked well with my clairsonic.</li>
    <li> Hard to fit in to my Mia2, but once it&#x27;s in it works just as well as the name brand brush heads.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the clarisonic brand brushes, and they&#x27;re a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Great price and they work perfectly. Now I will order a different strength, now that I know they fit and work properly. Can&#x27;t beat the price. And they arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> My wife says these just as well as the original Mia&#x27;s brushes, but at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> These do not precisely match my Clarisonic Mia 2.  The center part of the circle is actually separate from the outer ring and it kept coming apart as I initially tried to attach the new head.  However, I have used the device ten times or more since then and have not experienced a problem again.  I do not think that these are wonderful or miraculous (I ordered sensitive and it is anything but soft), but they will do the job of allowing you to keep up with your investment and enjoying a cleansing experience that your hands and or a washcloth simply can&#x27;t touch.</li>
    <li> Just like the original!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for these but I guess this was a case of I  got what I paid for. These were rough and harsh for being a &amp;#34;sensitive cleansing&amp;#34;. I have ordered other replacement heads that were not the Clarasonic brand but unfortunately these I will not be able to continue to use as they are just too harsh on my skin.</li>
    <li> Fit perfect for my name brand Clairsonic. So much cheaper. Will definitely be buying again when I run out in 1 year :)</li>
    <li> Fits my Mia perfectly.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste  your time or money on this. I ordered mine mid August and was supposed to receive them around September 10th-September 21st. Now nearly a month later, I&#x27;ve finally received them, but I&#x27;d already gone out and brought me my Clarisonic 2 replacement heads.</li>
    <li> It took about 6 weeks or so for the product to arrive, but if you&#x27;re not in a hurry, these are great. They are 1/10th the price of the name-brand brush heads. They aren&#x27;t exactly the same, but they fit the ClairSonic Mia 1. I did email the shipper several weeks ago asking about the order and they explained that to keep the price so low, they ship from China without tracking and to be patient. I was and the product arrived within the time frame the said it would.</li>
    <li> I noticed in one of the three place settings the brush head doesn&#x27;t oscillate properly but everything else about these brush heads is perfectly fine. When it happens I undo the brush head from the device, spin it 1/3 the way, and lock it back in place.</li>
    <li> Seems just as good as name brand, only much less costly.</li>
    <li> Feels very cheap and irritates my face, even though they are for &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin. Not even close to real clarisonic brush heads.</li>
    <li> It works with a clarisonic mia</li>
</ol>
