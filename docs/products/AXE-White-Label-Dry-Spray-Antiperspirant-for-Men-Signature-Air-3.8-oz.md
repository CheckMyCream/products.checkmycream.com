      <li>The product smells great, so that was a plus.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for when you want to smell great on a date but not wanting to be over powering with cologne.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s suddle but smells great.</li>
      <li>If you prefer spray deodorant/antiperspirant, this is a great choice.</li>
      <li>This brand plus the Brut antiperspirants are great.</li>
      <li>I know it is probably for a man, but I use it anyway because it is a great product.</li>
      <li>This makes it very nice for travel.  </li>
      <li>This stuff smells good.</li>
      <li>of the Axe products are surprisingly good.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I think this product is good for the protection.</li>
      <li>but they do offer good prices and promotions.</li>
      <li>This is a good antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>Except it did and the aroma was pleasant and my wife liked the smell.  </li>
      <li>I have to see how it works when I work out, but for now I love it!</li>
      <li>That said, this product by Axe does seem to give out first, whereas the one by Dove worked flawlessly throughout the day.</li>
      <li>What a refreshing antiperspirant!  </li>
      <li>The scent is just amazing.</li>
      <li>But there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to rinse in warm water before use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;He also liked how the container opened.  </li>
      <li>Nice fragrance and</li>
      <li>On the bottle it states &amp;#34;if clogged, rinse in warm water&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I cannot verify that this product is effective for 48 hours, but can assert that it will exceed 24 hours with ease.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s kind of the point, huh?</li>
      <li>I used the \\&quot;Night\\&quot; fragrance, which is scented, in a sort of powder-masculine kind of way.</li>
      <li>protection did not make it through PE class but was moderately effective</li>
      <li>Okay, so you want to smell good.</li>
      <li>As an antiperspirant, the product is effective.  </li>
      <li>The Night smell itself is very appealing -- not too strong or overwhelming, which can often be the case with deodorants, but pleasant in nature.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So if you want a good antiperspirant that has a unique container, you may like this one.</li>
      <li>However, the scent dissipates very quickly and it&#x27;s actually nice</li>
      <li>It also sprays a nice fine mist.</li>
      <li>I did get better, but still I think it&#x27;s wasteful.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll try to keep my own opinions separate from what I think are important facts.</li>
      <li>He enjoyed the feel of the application and is overall very happy with the product.</li>
      <li>Fragrance: 3 out of 5 stars</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m pleased with the product and may buy more.</li>
      <li>Shop for best price which is not necessarily on &#x27;zon</li>
      <li>The twist top releases a button, which you push to release the spray.</li>
      <li>Many cause me skin bumps.</li>
      <li>Turns out the forest smells ok</li>
      <li>LOVE AXE,</li>
      <li>Functionality: 3 out of 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>Which leads me to believe that this spray works better in warmer temperatures.</li>
      <li>Love the smell of Night in my fiance.</li>
      <li>unless of course, you&#x27;re some type of deodorant purest who has to have the most ultra-modern, over-priced, top-shelf nonsense.</li>
      <li>Not over-powering and not some wimpy &amp;#34;cover-up.&amp;#34; All-in-all you should be satisfied...</li>
      <li>In addition the fragrance is no overly obnoxious like I find many Axe products.  </li>
      <li>Protection (how well it keeps you from sweating): 5 out of 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;I think this antiperspirant does an excellent job of keeping you dry.</li>
      <li>The problem with this spray is that it really becomes airborne and goes all over the place, and I’m sure inhaling this stuff can’t be good for you.</li>
      <li>Works very good but the initial smell is too abrasive</li>
      <li>Most importantly to an deodorant, again both of them work.</li>
      <li>Some of them smell really good, and then tend to work really well.</li>
      <li>I realize fragrances are very subjective, but if you like a musky fragrance, &amp;#34;Night&amp;#34; is really really good.  </li>
      <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t seem to come out easily.</li>
      <li>48 hours is a bit of a strech, but Night is a great scent that does last for more than a day.</li>
      <li>Got both cans very quickly, it&#x27;s just that they were supposed both be the night and one was night and one was forest...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m talking about how easy it is to use the product.</li>
      <li>I think that the cedarwood scent may be the strong scent that can be a turn</li>
      <li>They could also call it a deodorant if they wished to, as the product is scented, but as mentioned it goes on strong but mellows out</li>
      <li>/&gt;AXE has strong perfumes.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is a bit strong when you apply it.</li>
      <li>a very,very,very strong scent that lingers.&lt;br</li>
      <li>antiperspirant has a lot of that body spray sort of thing going on, and the scent is actually kind of strong when you first put it on.  </li>
      <li>Good price, normal size can.</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant as most Axe sprays are and I will definitely be adding this item to my rotation.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t work as well as a solid, but again, if you prefer a spray, this is a great one.</li>
      <li>in all, Axe White label is a great deodorant/anti-perspirant.</li>
      <li>White label Axe smells great</li>
      <li>I think this is important because I think the temperature plays an important role in how this spray comes out.</li>
      <li>Though I prefer the stick type of antiperspirant, I though that I would give this a go when it became available on the Vine.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s important to rate it in these categories:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is easily in my top 3 for antiperspirants right now.</li>
      <li>The spray goes on completely dry and the scent is very clean and pleasant.</li>
      <li>All of the Axe body sprays I&#x27;ve used in the past have done an excellent job of odor protection but they have not provided wetness protection.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure 50% of what comes out of the canister when I use it goes into my mouth and lungs.</li>
      <li>This deodorant has a pleasant, yet penetrating fragrance that seems you are actually wearing perfume.  </li>
      <li>First off, the design of the spray-bottle is very cool.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s one cool thing about this spray.</li>
      <li>: piney with a hint sweet fruit at the end.</li>
      <li>It would be cool if axe made a cologne varient.</li>
      <li>Looks cool.</li>
      <li>it was alittle too fruity and sweet;</li>
      <li>It has nice masculine scent.</li>
      <li>It would be AXE that would create a cool container.</li>
      <li>So the bottle is cool when I use it.</li>
      <li>After bathing, I reapplied the antiperspirant...and true to its labeling...</li>
      <li>But then I realized that it&#x27;s not so easy to see where exactly the nozzle is pointing toward.</li>
      <li>and I can do a quick spray after a quick shower before heading to work.</li>
      <li>You would need to spray quickly and then leave the room until it all settles.</li>
      <li>The fragrance &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; was mild and not over powering... nor was it too flowery.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the lid on this - it rotates cleverly to close.</li>
      <li>Goes on dry (as advertised), spells great, makes you feel pretty neat.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband has used the Axe deodorant products and has one or two favorites, so he thought he&#x27;d give this dry spray antiperspirant a try at work. He&#x27;s pleased with the results.  If you hold it close to your body it goes on a little wet, but dries very quickly and smells great.  (If you hold it too far from your body it just seems to spray everywhere--the goes on dry effect takes some getting used to after years of using sprays and sticks.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the workday--which included office (desk) time, travel time back and forth in the field, and time walking around the plant--he still smelled great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also liked how the container opened.  When you twist the top to reveal the nozzle, the button you depress to spray the product pops up.  Twist it again and everything closes up. This&#x27;ll keep it from accidentally spraying in his travel kit or gym bag.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells good. I like the dry spray and the bottle/cap configuration is wonderful. I know it is probably for a man, but I use it anyway because it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an Axe user for years and have tried both their body sprays as well as their actual deodorants and have been very pleased always with the results. When I saw this new product offering, I was excited to give it a try. Now some may not be aware of the difference between deodorants and antiperspirants so let me run through that first. Deodorants offer odor protection only while antiperspirants offer both odor protection and wetness protection. All of the Axe body sprays I&#x27;ve used in the past have done an excellent job of odor protection but they have not provided wetness protection. With this new offering, Axe finally has the complete package, a product that comes in spray form (helping avoid those pesky white marks on your shirts) that also provides wetness protection as well. Right after applying the spray, the antiperspirant becomes dry almost immediately, eliminating the feeling of walking around with a wet shirt as a result of using the spray. I&#x27;ve used this playing both basketball and football and the results have been very positive. The scent is pleasant as most Axe sprays are and I will definitely be adding this item to my rotation.</li>
    <li> If you prefer spray deodorant/antiperspirant, this is a great choice. The spray goes on completely dry and the scent is very clean and pleasant. It works pretty well through the course of a day. It won&#x27;t work as well as a solid, but again, if you prefer a spray, this is a great one.</li>
    <li> My son is a big fan of and regular user of AXE antiperspirant/deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is pretty different - the &amp;#34;dry spray&amp;#34; claim is not misbilled, to the point that when he first used it he thought it was malfunctioning. He said it reminded him of the air spray we use for the computer keyboard. In terms of dryness and scent protection, it&#x27;s been working very well. Teenage hormones (and gym class) can make this a demanding task. He carries an AXE solid antiperspirant to school with him, but has not needed to apply it since he began using this. Of course, it&#x27;s December. Time will tell how it holds up to summer heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AXE has strong perfumes. This one is no different. If you use their products, you should be careful to use them in proper amount and, if mixing, make sure your mix is harmonious. If you overdo it, the scent can be cloying or downright headache inducing.</li>
    <li> I like the Axe product line.  Though I prefer the stick type of antiperspirant, I though that I would give this a go when it became available on the Vine.  I like the fact that you have to turn the cover on the head in order to use the spray.  This makes it very nice for travel.  I have had instances when the can&#x27;s lid popped off during baggage handling, and depending where it was in the luggage stacking, the nozzle was depressed...and well, you get the picture.  With the twist cover, I don&#x27;t see this handling.  The fragrance &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; was mild and not over powering... nor was it too flowery.  To give it the &amp;#34;antiperspirant&amp;#34; test, I applied it and then began to brush paint the eves on my house.  This involved multiple trips up and down the ladder, frequent refills of the paint tray...and yes...the karate kid overhead and front brush strokes.  Four hours later when I took a break...the under arms were dry...the t-shirt on the back and front was sweaty.  After bathing, I reapplied the antiperspirant...and true to its labeling...no sweaty pits for two days.</li>
    <li> It seems to work under mild use but the smell lingers and it is NOT pleasant. It does the job fighting body odor but it leaves &amp;#34;Axe odor.&amp;#34; Even cologne is no match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
    <li> I just reviewed &#x27;Dove Men+Care Dry Spray Antiperspirant, Clean Comfort&#x27; and Can say this product pucks up where that one fell a little short. Both go on dry, and at room temp (not cold like other aerosols); and neither leaves deodorant stains. Most importantly to an deodorant, again both of them work. No sweating and no body odor. That said, this product by Axe does seem to give out first, whereas the one by Dove worked flawlessly throughout the day. The Axe can start to feel weird towards the end of your day, like you become aware you&#x27;re wearing it: slightly moist, not really a burning, but it can cause you to not want your arm to close all the way as it just feels odd when the deodorized skin makes contact with itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big plus for Axe over the Dove version for me, however, is the scent. White label Axe smells great: piney with a hint sweet fruit at the end. I personally like it a lot. Where the Dove reminded me of baby powder, Axe is distinctly manly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, Axe White label is a great deodorant/anti-perspirant. If you haven&#x27;t tried a dry aerosol yet, then I highly recommend checking them out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a spray-on deodorant/antiperspirant before, so this was a new experience for me. First off, the design of the spray-bottle is very cool. I like the twist nozzle. The product smells great, so that was a plus. On the other hand, actually using it reminded me of the hairspray my mother and aunts used to lacquer their hair with when I was a kid, and how they would fill the room with a noxious, lung-deadening cloud whenever they used it. I have a relatively small bathroom, and it&#x27;s 20 degrees out, so I didn&#x27;t have a window open when I used it, and wow.....I was tasting that stuff all morning. My armpits stayed dry and sweet-smelling, but I was left to wonder how bad it was to be breathing this stuff in. Further use is in order, but I&#x27;m not sure if this is something I&#x27;d buy...I&#x27;d probably stick to roll-on deodorant.</li>
    <li> This deodorant has a pleasant, yet penetrating fragrance that seems you are actually wearing perfume.  Exercise a little caution when applying if you are not used to aerosol products or have allergic people nearby; it does create a big cloud of spray. Protection-wise it does the job for me, although I can not attest to the 48-hour claim. I still prefer the dry-stick type deodorants for the regular, daily use, but resort to the Axe deodorant for weekend / social activities.</li>
    <li> Got both cans very quickly, it&#x27;s just that they were supposed both be the night and one was night and one was forest... Turns out the forest smells ok</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders at keeping odors away.</li>
    <li> LOVE AXE, BUT THIS IS TERRIFYINGLY NOXIOUS.</li>
    <li> Not sure it works as good as traditional antiperspirant</li>
    <li> It goes on dry, which means no worries about getting it on your clothes when getting dressed. It smells decent and seems to hold up throughout the day. My gripe is that it comes out like a fire extinguisher, leaving a cloud of antiperspirant hovering around my head. I&#x27;m pretty sure 50% of what comes out of the canister when I use it goes into my mouth and lungs.</li>
    <li> This is a very good antiperspirant that gives that Arrid Extra Dry type protection.  While some might be concerned about the environmental aspects of using a spray can, I can say that times are a changing.  The spray can design has been updated to reflect modern sensibilities.  Unlock the old spray can these have lock and open features.  Of course the best part is the spray itself. Very dry so far and no residue on clothing, which is a big concern of mine.  In addition the fragrance is no overly obnoxious like I find many Axe products.  It&#x27;s a fresh clean smell that last for a while, although the product claim of 48 hours might be a stretch.  All in all a very good antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> This dry spray antiperspirant works well for athletics.  I have had no issues using it during exercise, and it works.  The scent does make me a bit sneezy but I like it - it&#x27;s rather unisex, I think, and that&#x27;s a plus for me.  As for lasting 48 hours, I wash it off and reapply every morning (showers, you know?), so I&#x27;m not sure of that claim.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s still working in the morning.  It is also not as disperse in the air when you spray it, so that&#x27;s also a plus for me, as I dislike inhaling deodorant.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this!</li>
    <li> AXE White Label Dry Spray Antiperspirant Night is a great product overall.  The Night smell itself is very appealing -- not too strong or overwhelming, which can often be the case with deodorants, but pleasant in nature.  In addition, the dry spray does not leave white marks on shirts compared to other deodorants.  For this reason, I have switched over to a rotation of AXE and Degree dry spray products.  Finally, this product is really effective at limiting perspiration -- it has been strong enough to be effective and not require constant reapplications like some other deodorant products.  I would highly recommend AXE White Label Dry Spray Antiperspirant, especially the Night type.</li>
    <li> Good price, normal size can. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I cannot verify that this product is effective for 48 hours, but can assert that it will exceed 24 hours with ease.  It caused no irritation or reaction on sometimes sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m honestly surprised by axe. They really stepped their Game up. After  long day if moving furniture and sweating in the heat I still smell nice. I&#x27;m definitely gonna try more scents from them.</li>
    <li> What a refreshing antiperspirant!  Nice fragrance and whoever designed the applicator is to be commended as it was not only different but worked so that one could not accidentally spray oneself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Dry Idea for years and have absolutely nothing but good things to say about it, but this new spray may make me change my buying habits.  I use the word &amp;#34;may&amp;#34; because the idea of applying antiperspirant in the evening is not something I&#x27;m accustomed to doing.  But I&#x27;m pleased with the product and may buy more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 40s, but I still like AXE products. Some of them smell really good, and then tend to work really well. 48 hours is a bit of a strech, but Night is a great scent that does last for more than a day. I&#x27;m not a fan of sprays since I feel some of the product is wasted, but I do like the more mature aroma of this one. Very herbal and woodsy. Masculine. I would get this one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
    <li> Most of the “no white residue” antiperspirants on the market do not deliver as promised. I’ve tried a few and I’m always left with white streaks on my black clothing despite the claims. This AXE White Label Dry Spray Antiperspirant is different. It gets the job done right. However, there are a few concessions to be made in exchange for that effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, the scent of this aerosol spray is extremely overpowering. It is designed to provide 48 hours of protection, which I suppose would explain the hounding scent, but I don’t even wear cologne. I certainly don’t want my antiperspirant making me smell like a perfume factory, which alas, this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scent, I still can’t figure out if it’s masculine, feminine or designed for both sexes. It’s described as “a cool rush of grapefruit, lavender, cedarwood and praline notes,” but the only of these I can really pick up on in the smelly assault is perhaps cedarwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle design is also novel, but watch out. The twist top releases a button, which you push to release the spray. But if you’re like me, the natural tendency when you’re done is to push the button back in to close it. Not if you want this stuff in your eye. Not a pretty sight to be crying from eye pain while you’re already hyperventilating over the scent. Be sure to twist closed as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I have sensitive underarm skin and have to be careful with the antiperspirants I use. Many cause me skin bumps. Thus far this one has not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I’ll probably only be using this AXE White Label Dry Spray Antiperspirant on occasions where I know streaking is going to ruin my outfit and I have no other alternative.</li>
    <li> Dry spray which goes on clear.&lt;br /&gt;Gave it to my teen son to try out.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for gym lockers&lt;br /&gt;Has a very,very,very strong scent that lingers.&lt;br /&gt;He said wetness  protection did not make it through PE class but was moderately effective&lt;br /&gt;If you are sensitive to strongly fragranced deodorants, the avoid this</li>
    <li> I perpetually get the &amp;#34;deodorant skid marks&amp;#34; (my wife&#x27;s term) on my shirt if I put my stick antiperspirant on first.  This stuff completely solves that problem.  When you spray it on, it&#x27;s a little weird how fast it drys - it made me think I hadn&#x27;t sprayed enough on at first.  However, a little goes quite a ways, so don&#x27;t feel like you need to hose yourself down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically take a shower every morning after the gym, so I don&#x27;t know if it actually lasts a true 48 hours, but I can tell you it will survive a heavy gym session without a problem, which isn&#x27;t something my stick antiperspirant can do, so easily a solid 24-36 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The **one and only** complaint I would have is the smell.  It reminds me of a car freshener.  My wife really likes it (which, let&#x27;s be honest, is what counts), but it&#x27;s not a particularly pleasant smell for me.  If they release other choices, they have a customer for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking at this, I&#x27;d say give it a shot.  This comes close to being the holy grail as far as antiperspirants goes.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to use a spray antiperspirant but have to say I was surprised how this went on dry. So dry that I thought nothing came out.  Except it did and the aroma was pleasant and my wife liked the smell.  It keep me fresh smelling throughout the day (normal use).  I have to see how it works when I work out, but for now I love it!</li>
    <li> Smell great! It goes on dry &amp; it lasts a Very long time!</li>
    <li> Works very good but the initial smell is too abrasive</li>
    <li> The scent is just amazing. It&#x27;s suddle but smells great. The scent is like none other. It&#x27;s great for when you want to smell great on a date but not wanting to be over powering with cologne. It would be cool if axe made a cologne varient.</li>
    <li> Our college son is very happy with the AXE White Label Dry Spray Antiperspirant. He says it does not have the stronger odor as other Axe products, and that&#x27;s a good thing in his opinion. He enjoyed the feel of the application and is overall very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This is a good antiperspirant. It lasted me the whole day though it was definitely weakening towards the end... so i doubt the 48hour claim. I didnt care much for the scent... it was alittle too fruity and sweet; if that makes sense. It definitely wasn&#x27;t the masculine oriented scent i though an Axe product would have. I love the opening mechanism; always know when its open or closed. I recently tried a Degree antiperspirant spray and it took me a while to get used to knowing if it was open or closed.</li>
    <li> I suspect that different people will have different personal opinions regarding this antiperspirant. I&#x27;ll try to keep my own opinions separate from what I think are important facts. I think it&#x27;s important to rate it in these categories:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Protection (how well it keeps you from sweating): 5 out of 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;I think this antiperspirant does an excellent job of keeping you dry. I put this on in the mornings and even though I have a desk job, I tend to walk about 10000 steps a day. Sometimes I run a little with my lab. But no matter what, by the end of the day I&#x27;m still dry when I use this antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Fragrance: 3 out of 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s where I think you&#x27;ll get different personal opinions. The fragrance is a bit strong when you apply it. But I find that as time goes by it gets less strong. In fact, just a few minutes after applying the spray the fragrance becomes tolerable. I don&#x27;t like strong fragrances and this particular fragrance has a musk-like smell to it. On the description it says the fragrance is a combination of lavendar, grapefruit, cedarwood, etc. I think that the cedarwood scent may be the strong scent that can be a turn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Functionality: 3 out of 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Here I&#x27;m talking about how easy it is to use the product. This was my first &#x27;spray&#x27; antiperspirant. And I don&#x27;t think I like the spray action. Mainly because I think a lot gets wasted as you spray this on. At first I thought I was just dysfunctional and kept missing my armpit! But then I realized that it&#x27;s not so easy to see where exactly the nozzle is pointing toward. I did get better, but still I think it&#x27;s wasteful. Also it doesn&#x27;t seem to come out easily. It&#x27;s winter right now as I write this review. My house is at about 68 F. So the bottle is cool when I use it. I think this is important because I think the temperature plays an important role in how this spray comes out. On the bottle it states &amp;#34;if clogged, rinse in warm water&amp;#34;. Which leads me to believe that this spray works better in warmer temperatures. As it is you have to shake the spray before use. But there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to rinse in warm water before use. Too much hassle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s one cool thing about this spray. To open it you have to twist the top cover and as it turns 90 degrees, the nozzle pops up (like the headlights on older cars). Looks cool. You then press on the nozzle to spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this product is good for the protection. But due to the other limitations I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This Axe spray smells pretty good, goes on dry and seems to work very well at keeping me dry.  I usually don&#x27;t like spray ons due to how long they take to dry but this is so dry when it is applied, there is no waiting.  When spraying, there is little to no smell.  However, within a few seconds, the smell comes out.  Not too strong like other Axe products but definitely more noticeable that others I use like Degree.  This is easily in my top 3 for antiperspirants right now.</li>
    <li> Okay, so you want to smell good. That&#x27;s kind of the point, huh? You don&#x27;t want to offend anyone with your malodorous aroma. All I can say is that this stuff is pretty nifty for throwing in the old gym bag. It doesn&#x27;t take up much room and I can do a quick spray after a quick shower before heading to work. I am not really worried about what the co-workers think, but I still don&#x27;t want to stink. The Axe White Label does the job.  This is &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; spray, not like that heavy stuff from a few years back (for those of you who remember that). This is a much more subtle product that does what it claims. Not over-powering and not some wimpy &amp;#34;cover-up.&amp;#34; All-in-all you should be satisfied...unless of course, you&#x27;re some type of deodorant purest who has to have the most ultra-modern, over-priced, top-shelf nonsense. Get this! Get the job done! Move on!</li>
    <li> My new favorite antiperspirant. This brand plus the Brut antiperspirants are great. Goes on dry (as advertised), spells great, makes you feel pretty neat. Recommended. Shop for best price which is not necessarily on &#x27;zon but they do offer good prices and promotions. Try it out. There&#x27;s tons of sprays out there, this is one of the best.</li>
    <li> I like the AXE White Label products. I use the deodorant on a daily basis and it smells nice and keeps me dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I like this spray and enjoy the smell, it seems that it does not cover as well, and I have to use more than expected to get the same coverage as the stick. Giving it 4 stars instead of 5 since I feel like this will run out rather quickly and is not super cheap.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of Night in my fiance. Haven&#x27;t tried the others yet. But this scent lasts all day. Perfect for him.</li>
    <li> This stuff is as-advertised!  Goes on dry and smells amazing.  I realize fragrances are very subjective, but if you like a musky fragrance, &amp;#34;Night&amp;#34; is really really good.  Almost could be your cologne!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed AXE didn&#x27;t make this sooner. It seems to work as an antiperspirant very well for me. What I really like is the container. I like how the sprayer comes out. I doubt that would be the thing that would make me buy it, but it&#x27;s pretty cool. It would be AXE that would create a cool container. This is probably the one spray antiperspirant I don&#x27;t mind putting in my suitcase. I don&#x27;t have to worry about the cap coming off and spraying. It would take a lot of random movements to make the sprayer coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want a good antiperspirant that has a unique container, you may like this one.</li>
    <li> Unilever, I think it is, has been going &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; and is releasing a series of 3.0 oz spray antiperspirants (as opposed to the usual stick antiperspirants).  Actually, there are a lot of advantages to aerosol antiperspirants, as they go on a lot drier, dry faster, and don&#x27;t cake on your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve tried the 3.8 versions of Degree, Axe, Dove for Men and soon Dove.  Same basic concept for all of them, but the packaging, percentage of active ingredient, and scent are all different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the Axe products are surprisingly good.  I&#x27;ve bought their hair products for quite some time.  As you may know, Axe is also known for their body sprays, and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of these personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This antiperspirant has a lot of that body spray sort of thing going on, and the scent is actually kind of strong when you first put it on.  However, the scent dissipates very quickly and it&#x27;s actually nice once that occurs.  As an antiperspirant, the product is effective.  They could also call it a deodorant if they wished to, as the product is scented, but as mentioned it goes on strong but mellows out quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it though.  Good product.  5 stars.</li>
    <li> Goes on dry with no residue, and smells nice.  I&#x27;m not sure what praline smells like, but the other notes mentioned in the blurb do smell fresh and pleasant.</li>
    <li> I generally use stick deodorant, and decided to try this to see what it was like. Overall I like it very much. I used the \\&quot;Night\\&quot; fragrance, which is scented, in a sort of powder-masculine kind of way. It&#x27;s different. My wife likes it, or at least doesn&#x27;t object to it. I&#x27;ve received no complaints from anyone else, either.    The ultimate question, of course, is does the product actually work? In my experience, yes. No objectionable odors. I work in an office during the day, coach swimming in the evening, and work around the house on weekends. I haven&#x27;t done a lot of intense workouts or labor that cause me to sweat profusely, , so I can&#x27;t say how it holds up under these situations, but for normal everyday use and work around the house, it works well. The bottle claims it works for 48 hours. There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to test that claim (I want to keep my friends) but for the use I&#x27;ve put it through it lasts all day.    The bottle is very distinctive--I like it. Instead of a straight round can, it starts out round at the bottom, transitioning into a rounded rectangle at the top. In order to actually use the product you have to twist the cap, which exposes the nozzle and raises the button. Safety and style all in one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the lid on this - it rotates cleverly to close. It also sprays a nice fine mist. As advertised, it lasts for well over a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...but that fragrance, man. It&#x27;s just too much. It&#x27;s not even a bad smell. It&#x27;s just too heavily fragranced.</li>
    <li> If you like the fragrances Axe uses in their other products then you will probably like the fragrance of this product. It has nice masculine scent. The spray goes on dry if you hold it at a distance. If you hold it close, it goes on wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The problem with this spray is that it really becomes airborne and goes all over the place, and I’m sure inhaling this stuff can’t be good for you. I saw my husband spray this and could see the cloud of it around him that took a while to settle. And those were the particles that were large enough to see. I’m sure there were still smaller particles that were airborne longer that I could not see. You would need to spray quickly and then leave the room until it all settles. That is inconvenient to say the least. Overall, it is an effective antiperspirant with a nice scent, but using it is inconvenient if you want to avoid inhaling it.</li>
    <li> As others have noted, the smell is strong and somewhat overpowering as it hits the open air, but it also delivers on its promise of not leaving any residue and keeping you feeling dry after most bouts of physical activity.  I was impressed with how little is needed to get dramatic results.  The removal of a fifth star is based on the clash of smells that will take place when you wear this antiperspirant with cologe (this is probably not true of all colognes, but several combinations I tried seem to reign anarchy on the noses of those around me).</li>
