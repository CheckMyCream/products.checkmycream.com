<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would buy this product again</li>
    <li> Why buy batteries a few at a time and pay too much?  These hearing aid batteries will last a long time, and cut overall costs.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> Have ordered from this company before and all was well. This time, I ordered multiple packages for a discount. Then, when I pulled out the first package and realized the batteries didn&#x27;t fit, it was past the return policy deadline. Am contacting the seller directly to see if the situation can be rectified; but, I don&#x27;t have much hope.</li>
    <li> I use two to four of these batteries per week. The last time I ran low I decided to buy these from Amazon because of the price.  Now that I have used them for a while I will buy them again because of the service I receive from them.  They last just as long as name brand batteries that cost twice as much.</li>
    <li> The process of ordering was somewhat cumbersome,specially old people who are not computer savvy. Even so, I am very happy that I got the product so cheap. Excellent. I will always check Amazon first for any future purchase.</li>
    <li> Poppy cock.  These things are perfectly fine and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used them for years and encounter a dud just about never.  They last about a week (I divided overall quantity by elapsed time since ordering) which is just about as long as any other batter...including those of higher price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect the dissatisfied users have dirty contacts in their aids and therefore not all batteries start the aid.  Clean the contacts with a little scraper and you won&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
    <li> Seller was very fast with the delivery. The batteries seem to last as well as can be expected (2-3 days). We are new to hearing aid use and the batteries that came with the devices lasted the same amount of time.</li>
    <li> Batteries were purchased for elderly mother. Cost savings for her were  over 50% with same quality and same usage time. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great service,  received it as promised  and no problem with anything.   I will purchase my next order of hearing aid batteries from them.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get so many batteries at such a great price. They ahve been durable as well. My son&#x27;s hearing aids are working great</li>
    <li> I bought these for my in law for her Hearing aid and it seems they perform very well. Good quality batteries at a good price.Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I have tried different brands but these work as good or better than Ray O Vac.  Keep up the good work</li>
    <li> The batteries are less expensive than the major advertised brands, but work just as well.  Got the batteries when iCell indicated they would come.</li>
    <li> Let me start by stating that I don&#x27;t normally write reviews.  The rare occasion I write a review is if a product is exceptional or horrible.  Unfortunately, these are not exceptional. I am reviewing the product, not the purchase through Amazon.    I purchased these batteries based on what I thought would be a good price deal.  I&#x27;m a bilateral BTH wearer and I usually buy batteries from Costco in bulk or single packs from one of the chain drug stores.  Those batteries  typically last for a full week, both name and drug store brands.  I wear my aids from the time I wake up until the time I go to bed.  When they are out the battery case is opened so the batteries don&#x27;t drain.    The first of THESE batteries I used lasted for a whopping 1 HOUR before my aid started signaling that the battery was dying.  The second of THESE batteries did not work AT ALL.  I&#x27;ve gone through 2 packs already in about 2 weeks because most of the batteries are either duds or last for less than 3 days.  There are times when a new battery was just put in and my aid will immediately start signaling its dying and I open &amp; close the battery case a few times and then its fine.  I&#x27;m constantly worrying that they are going to die unexpectedly though.    Going through these batteries as fast as I am means that the good deal I THOUGHT I was getting isn&#x27;t so.  Save your money - buy the batteries you usually do, not these.</li>
    <li> They last for 11 days...or 1 to 2 days.  Very strange.  Some are basically DOA, dead on arrival and go dead in a day.</li>
    <li> So much cheaper than Walgreens. I love these. I buy a big box of them and keep them in the freezer so they last longer. I don&#x27;t know if freezing them helps, but...I feel better.</li>
    <li> I have used a couple of these batteries and so far they last as long or longer than name brands</li>
    <li> These fit my hearing aid perfectly.  I purchased a13A battery the first time and they were huge and not the right ones.  This time I looked closer at the fine print and these were the right size.  Not counting the cost of the first batteries I bought and can&#x27;t use, these were lower cost than I can find locally.</li>
    <li> These iCellTech #13 batteries work just as well as the more expensive name brand batteries I originally received with my hearing aids.  Best value for your money with the 10-pack bundle!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mom about 18 months ago. She has two hearing aids. One hearing aid is on during the entire day the other one sees intermittent use. Some folks may be failing to let the battery air activate for at least one minute before inserting it into the hearing aid. This will shorten the battery life. I blow air into the two battery holes to be sure each battery has activated correctly. Some have lasted two to three weeks. I am very pleased with their performance.</li>
    <li> These batteries are a fantastic value for the price, I purchased them for my 83 year old mother(2 hearing aids) they last as long as the name brand ones that go for about $10-12 bucks for a pack of 6 0r 8. Will definately buy more !!</li>
    <li> Best price but quality unknown so far. Hope it warrants repeat purchase; if not we&#x27; ll try another low-priced brand.. (I find this &amp;#34;headline&amp;#34; and 15 word requirement a d--d nuisance!)</li>
    <li> Cheap, and they last a good  long time in my behind the ear hearing aids.  Product shipped fast.  I am using less batteries.    I highly recommend these batteries and the seller I got them from  Good value</li>
    <li> fast shipping, first set of batteries have lasted 6 days so far, but hearing aids are not as loud as they were with other batteries, plus i&#x27;ve notice my daughter(3yr old) is not as attentive as she was while using the other batteries.</li>
    <li> I bought a pack of 60 about two years ago and have three cards left.  They have an expiry date of 08/2013.  They were fine for the first 18 months but now 25% of them are no good.  Last week I took one aid to the audiologist as it wasn&#x27;t working properly -- and I had just put a new battery in it.  He tested the battery and said it was dead.  He advised there are four factories world-wide that make zinc-air batteries -- some are good, some are not-so-good quality.  The audiologist kindly gave me his battery tester gratis and recommended in future buying brand-name batteries from a place with high turnover.  Another customer at the counter overhearing the conversation said avoid pharmacies.  He&#x27;d had dud brand-name batteries from the pharmacy -- they don&#x27;t sell enough to turn them over.  The audiology practice sells only Rayovac batteries; I bought a pack and left.  Since then I have had to replace a couple more batteries.  Two of the Icelltech batteries lasted a few minutes -- the tester showed them to be dead.  Looks like I&#x27;m going to have to bin the last couple of cards of batteries.  Summary -- these batteries are best avoided.  It will cost extra to buy quality batteries but if you don&#x27;t have to discard 25% of them out of the pack you&#x27;re better off.  5 Feb 2012 - Update.  Just threw out the last two cards - every one a dud.</li>
    <li> the first two I used were duds then at least one out of every pack was a dud. You don&#x27;t save money if they don&#x27;t work. would not order again.</li>
    <li> 2nd time I bought these. They work just as well as the name brand products at less than 1/2 the price. A great deal!</li>
    <li> They work just fine. Good price</li>
    <li> These batteries cost about half as much as main line brands.  The good ones last just about as long, BUT, too many of them fail quickly (many times in less than 24 hours of use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the first 6 I put in my hearing aids, 3 failed within 24 hours and 1 was dead on arrival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend getting this brand unless you are willing to carry 4 spares with you where ever you go even for just a day or two.  If you travel on an extended trip, I would take 4 batteries for each 7 days, just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the money works out to close to the same cost as far as the cost per day for each battery, I gave it 3 stars.  But having to use 50 - 60 batteries to get the same overall use as 30 of the Rayovac or Duracell will make me avoid this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning after an additional month of use.  The performance over a month has been worse than the first week or so.  Too many of these batteries fail within a day and a couple were dead out of the box.  I think they fail the cost-benefit badly.  I would normally expect 60 batteries to last me for 10-11 months.  These cost about half as much but I don&#x27;t expect to get more than 3 months use out of the box of 60.  I have to change my initial 3-star rating to 1-star.  Not a bargain at all.</li>
    <li> I use about two batteries every 8 days with my hearing aids, and I wear my hearing aids all day every day.  These are the best value I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> These batteries so far have proved to be an excellent purchase.  I still have plenty of packs to go and am able to carry extras so I don&#x27;t run out.  Thanks to the low cost.</li>
    <li> Do not buy ICELLTECH hearing aid batteries! They are of VERY POOR QUALITY. If you buy them it will be a case of &amp;#34;I told you so.&amp;#34; Nuff said!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, product as ordered. As to evaluating battery life, assumed OK; Delivered to Nursing Home, no complaint from 96 year old.</li>
    <li> had these battieries before and they seemed good. however this batch (2nd purchase) life not as good..some went dead only 4 days of use</li>
    <li> I can never have enough of them</li>
    <li> Just got the package in the mail. This is the same brand that I&#x27;ve used in the past -- they work well, and the pricing is great. Installing them into the hearing aid, and removing them when they run out, is pretty easy.</li>
    <li> they are what i expected inasmuch as i use batteries all the time.  i have not used them yet. ok</li>
    <li> Last nearly as long as the name brand for much less money.  Will buy again when these run out.</li>
    <li> I got hearing aids recently and have been appalled at how much batteries cost and how short a time they last. This package of 60 batteries was very inexpensive, and the batteries seem to work as well as any others I have tried.</li>
    <li> These were shipped super fast, quality product, lasts longer than Energizer batteries for less than half the cost of buying them in-store!! Would highly reccommend!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> These batteries keep a charge longer than the ones previously used.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase again when this supply is exhausted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of hearing aid batteries. I&#x27;ve used all major brands. I buy according to low price. Most brands are as good as others.</li>
    <li> Batteries arrived very fast. Good quality. My onyl grudge is they should have included a printed invoice with the shipment. I need it to claim on my health-care spendign account.</li>
    <li> My friend wares a hearing aid in both ears and goes through a lot of batteries. For her it is prudent to by batteries in bulk.</li>
    <li> I buy these batteries for my grandfather&#x27;s hearing aids.  The overwhelming majority of the batteries were already dead and the ones that weren&#x27;t died within a few hours.  Will not be buying this brand again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t last that long compared to other brands.</li>
    <li> Product is excellent and delivery was within the two-days as promised.</li>
    <li> These batteries appeared to be good value but I&#x27;m seeing large percentage failing after a few hours or a day of usage. I checked the voltage and it shows &amp;#60; 1V. I&#x27;m experiencing this on both hearing aids so it&#x27;s the batteries that are failing. Some will work for the normal 10 days. It&#x27;s a reliability issue.</li>
    <li> The first two batteries I placed in my hearing aid were dead. The third battery lasted one day. I will have to admit that the price is great, I just wish the batteries would have worked.</li>
    <li> I wear aids in both ears.  The batteries I usually buy from the local drug store or the grocery I shop last 9 or 10 days.  I opened my first pack of six of these iCell Tech batteries a week ago and they are gone.  A couple of the batteries were dead when I put them in my aid.  The best of the six lasted 4 days.  What I though was a terrific deal didn&#x27;t turn out to be much of a deal at all.  Save you money and buy what you usually buy.</li>
    <li> Many of these batteries do not have a full day&#x27;s use. There is value when they don&#x27;t work as expected</li>
    <li> As expected from description.</li>
    <li> I was paying this price for 24 batteries, so getting 60 for the same price is great.  They last just as long as the name brand I was purchasing previously.</li>
    <li> I finally got around to opening the box of batteries (2 weeks after the return period ended) and almost all of the batteries have white corrosion on them.  Some are really badly corroded.  I would NOT put these in anything I valued, definitely not in an expensive hearing aid.</li>
    <li> I am  and have been getting 75% failures right out of the box....Never again to icell and Amazon on hearing aid batteries, I will gladly pay more to get better. ICell is disgusting..</li>
    <li> Great price. They work great.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. 60 size 13 batteries. They came quickly and in good condition. They last for a week easy in my sisters hearing aids that she wears 16+ hours a day, provided you open the battery door at night.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand of battery for 5 years, and now Amazon had the best price I had ever seen</li>
    <li> They were as expected.</li>
    <li> Thaqnk u for the prompt reply to my request for #13 batteries they are just what  ineed thank you again  L</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a crap shoot ... some of them will work for 8-10 days, some 10 -15 minutes, a few of them didn&#x27;t work at all!&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll pop for the extra $3 and get a better battery next time!</li>
    <li> The only problem was I got shorted by 6 batteries. The 54 i did get will last for years, unless they lose power before then.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because the light was not as bright as expected .it is a good light source I am very satisfied with the glasses and will definitely order again  . the extra batteries what definitely a bonus my package came very quickly  I&#x27;m I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer</li>
    <li> it works for Grandma&#x27;s hearing aid.  Lasts some time too.  Good product and will buy more.  The price always goes down...</li>
    <li> I bought these batteries thinking I would save a few bucks over the ones I purchased six months ago. As soon as I opened the package I was disappointed. Most of the batteries were corroded in the package like they were stored in inappropriate conditions. I have purchased [[ASIN:B001FNVXS4 Power One Size 13 Zinc Air Hearing Aid Batteries (60 batteries)]] in the past from Amazon and they work great. Not sure the difference but the Power One brand are made in Germany, while iCellTech are made in Korea. Power One are also the brand that my son&#x27;s Audiologist provides when we visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adage \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; comes to mind but it doesn&#x27;t mean you have to pay a hog&#x27;s price either.</li>
    <li> I purchases I&lt;br /&gt;Cell because it had the lowest price. I&#x27;ve used the batteris now for a few months, and have found only two to have defects. I will purchase ICell again. Recommended if you are not concerned by an ocaisonal bad battery.</li>
    <li> I shopped around for a great price on these batteries and found these to be the Best for the price.  Consider me a repeating customer.&lt;br /&gt;Rocco</li>
    <li> a great subject cleverly treated, suspens with a sly sence of humor, toally engrossing subject well treated. would recomend to my friends</li>
    <li> The shipping was fine. However, The batteries seemed old and did not have good battery life in my hearing aids.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years and it has proven to be as good or better than the &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; brands. Given the lower cost I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Though it apears to be a good deal only about half of them actually work.  I think they were just old batteries.</li>
    <li> Do you have any idea how much they want for hearing aid batteries &amp;#34;over the counter&amp;#34;.  Way too much!  I will continue to order this size thru Amazon!</li>
    <li> I am 100% pleased with these batteries. They are a great value and work just fine. I use my hearing aid about 16-17 hours a day and I would say I average about five days on a battery. I do not hesitate to recommend them.</li>
    <li> They are no good if they work at all it&#x27;s only for a hour or two! These battery are junk!!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd order of these batteries. All of the ones in the first order worked great. You do need to wait about 30 seconds after you remove the seal before turning on the hearing aid. It takes time for the battery to start up.</li>
    <li> Daughter uses a lot of batteries for her hearing aids. It is crucial we find a good value for her.</li>
    <li> It is the best type of battery he has used in the last 5 years.  The length of use is better than others he has tried.</li>
    <li> The first four batteries went dead as soon I put it on the device. Tried a different pack and worked for two days, I will not buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> The batteries were priced fairly. They arrived in good time. They work very well. They are actually for my mother and she is delighted with them.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent service!</li>
    <li> When these batteries work, they last about 5 days.  We&#x27;ve gotten 2 60 packs and each one has at least 1 six pack that is completely dead.  It appears that sometimes the batteries leak and get ruined.  We&#x27;ve converted to the slightly more expensive Duracell and they are lasting longer.</li>
    <li> This time they were very good - last time I got a couple of bad ones in the mix...</li>
    <li> These batteries work just fine in my hearing aid, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d trust them in anything critical.  Quite a bit cheaper than Duracell or other name brands, with the associated doubt about the efficiency and longevity of discount batteries.  No problems, but I always have a spare available.</li>
    <li> 12ea 1.4vdc batterys measured around .9 to 1.05vdc and won&#x27;t run any of 3 hearing aids,  Too busy to return them.  Just want the facts to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased hearing aid batteries from Amazon for some time now....usually the Power Ones....Out of 60 batteries, I might have 2 or 3 duds....I can live with that. But these Cell Tech....geesh! I&#x27;m on my third card....6 to a card....and I&#x27;ve had 4 duds! Expiration states 2017, but they are not performing well at all. I wear the Phonak bte aids, size 13 battery. When there are no duds, they do work for 4.5 days, which is what the power ones do too. But the &amp;#34;dud to good ratio&amp;#34; is too high!</li>
    <li> 80% of the batteries had a 5 day life span, if they didn&#x27;t have corrosion problems. Fortunately, for me I had other batteries around.</li>
    <li> iCellTech size 13Hearing batteries last between 14 to 17 days each! Other brands would last only seven days or less.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my husband&#x27;s hearing aids.  So far he has had to toss out almost 1/2 of the batteries.  Do not purchase this product.  Not worth it.  Seemed like a good price until you can only use 1/2 of them.</li>
    <li> I use these in my hearing aids and I have been comparing how often I had been changing my other batteries and these last longer.  Why?  I do not know but I got more usage out of them. That is important when you buy in bulk.  Very quick shipping and no problems at all.</li>
    <li> You never really know what you&#x27;re going to get when it comes to buying batteries.  I took a gamble on this product once before and couldn&#x27;t have been more satisfied.  This was my second order from the same company via Amazon.  Don&#x27;t worry, the batteries work just fine and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> excellent work. same hrs. battery life as duracell, enrger and other famous brand. for  as i way using my hearing-aids like 14-15hrs. a day. price is  very economical. i think no one beat  this price and quality as per to day. recommended to strongly  buy from &amp;#34;AMAZON&#x27; SUPPLIER. RECEIVED VERY FAST DELIVERY AT DOOR STEP.  THANKS FOR AMAZON  AND HIS SUPPLIER.  IS  &amp;#34;FIVE STAR&amp;#34;. GOD BLESS THEM AND CONTINUE SAME SERVICE IN FUTURE.</li>
    <li> The quality of A10 cell is found to be poor in the second pack of 6 cells opened. All Totally drained as removed from packs.    I am sceptical on other packs,</li>
    <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
    <li> Halfway through the batteries&#x27; rated shelf life, some of them were dead. They&#x27;re cheap enough that I would probably buy them again despite this.</li>
    <li> These hearing aid batteries are just as good &amp; last as long as those sold at the local pharmacies for so much less.</li>
    <li> That was simply the best price for Batteries that we found anywhere. the batteries last longer than other one&#x27;s also!</li>
    <li> An excellent product with fast service!!</li>
    <li> These are fine for general, everyday use, and the price is certainly right. However, if you use a Bluetooth connection with your instruments (in my case, with a TV Link), they apparently don&#x27;t have enough juice. Mine will go dead within an hour after I connect the TV Link to amplify TV dialog. However, the batteries recover overnight, and work fine, until I hook up the TV Link again. With name brand batteries, the TV Link works fine, although the batteries do zonk out somewhat sooner than normal (which is expected).</li>
    <li> these are very poor batteries.  the outer case on some of them have a patina of corrosion on them  I had to clean them off with steel wool.  the last ones I used actually had a bunch of white corrosion under the orange activation tab.  I&#x27;m going to stick to brand names from now on.</li>
    <li> Wife and I both use and they work well.  no problems with life or value. Also good packaging. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> They were delivered fast, delivered well-packaged, delivered cheaper than most, they last 10 to 15 days (depending on noise and humidity) and they don&#x27;t leak (so far). Got my $$$ worth.</li>
    <li> These are the same size 13 batteries I used to purchase at the store but a lot cheaper. They last just as long as the more expensive ones. With 2 hearing aids, I use a lot of these so this is a good buy. This was my second order.</li>
    <li> These batteries function very well in my MDHearing Aids.  The 60 batteries last well over a year for me, and at the price they are a good value.  The large number means I always have a replacement battery available if I should need one.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them to other hearing aid users.</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering these batteries. The first set of 60 lasted 9 months!  I will definitely continue to order these!</li>
    <li> They work well in my new hearing aids. Long life! Lower cost than local stores. Packaging is much  like competition.</li>
    <li> they last longer than other batteries for me and they cost less than any I can buy in the store or at the ear clinic</li>
    <li> Use them all the time. That seem to last as long as any other battery and are half the price.</li>
    <li> I love it! It has a good quality. I recommend it. Excellent purchase and I would buy it again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> half of them were almost empty. Usually when the battery is fresh keeps for approximately 160 hours, these lasted for 50-80 hours</li>
    <li> The price was good. But . . . one out of every three batteries didn&#x27;t work.  When I pulled off the orange tab, some were scarred, corroded with a fine film. Others looked fine. But I put them in my hearing aid and they were dead.  Not a sound, not a whimper.  I&#x27;ve been wearing hearing aids for forty years and have used a variety of batteries, most recently Radio Shack&#x27;s, but when I got new hearing aids which required batteries every three or four days my audiologist suggested that I try buying at Amazon. So I did.  Never again.  I&#x27;m going to order Power One.  More expensive but if they work, they&#x27;d be a bargain compared with iCellTech.</li>
    <li> I am a  retired senior on a budget. I also have a taste for quality. These are the best deal I found, Batteries lasted a long time, got then in 2 days and they are way cheaper in price than say, the corner drugstore. Way cheaper.IMHO</li>
    <li> I bought 60 hearing aid batteries, figuring that they would last a while for my daughter. I went to the batteries for her to go to school, I had no working ones, all the batteries had a crusty white powder all over them. I have only used 6 of the 60 batteries I bought! I am not happy at all with the product, total waste of my money!</li>
    <li> This purchase was great because it gave you a large number of batteries at a very reasonable price. They also came in packages of 6 batteries which are easy to carry with you. I will be trying to get some more of these ICellTech Batteries as I need replacements.</li>
    <li> we ordered this 60 batteries and we only have it for 4 months plus now and I have more than half left in stocks but they are no longer 1.4 V anymore and some of them even have mold without opening it. I had bought iCellTech Batteries in the past and they are good for 2 years. this batch I received have an expiration date of 2017 but we are at august of 2014 and already 40 plus batteries without using doesn&#x27;t have power. WTH? don&#x27;t buy this from this buyer. since it has been 4 months, I can&#x27;t even contact them at all for exchange.</li>
    <li> It seems there is something wrong with the batteries.  They do not even last for 1 hour and they should last for at least 5 days.  Is there a number I can call to talk with Local Battery?</li>
    <li> Perfect price for hearing aid batteries.</li>
    <li> This hearing aid battery item is one that has been on the market for several years. it is air activated by removing the tiny orange tab from the contact surface so it is generally fresh from the first moment of use. I have used them for many years, though this is early in my experience with Amazon.</li>
    <li> The ones I got must have been near the end of shelf life.  As I went through them, they got progressively weeker and at the end some were dead, others lasted just a couple of day.</li>
    <li> We were in need of batteries for our daughter’s hearing aids and chose iCellTech as the supplier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order was placed and notification was received. The shipping was quick, the order arrived on time and the product is good for the price paid. In short, the product is what they said it was, their service is fast. We will surely look to them for future needs and recommend them to those we know who wear hearing aids.</li>
    <li> I bought 60 batteries because of new hearing aids, less than 10% worked at all and the ones that did work lasted only a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;My advise-stick with name brands!</li>
    <li> I bought a 60 pack of batteries last year and they worked great.  This year I bought another 60 pack BUT someone rained on my parade and I am having major problems with this new batch.  Before putting the batteries in I let them breathe (ahhhh) and i&#x27;m still only getting maybe a day or two of usage. I&#x27;m gong through batteries like money in my checking account and see no change.  The six packs on the back are stamped with 06 CB 2017 which I think means use before June 2017 so that obviously means nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an appointment with my audiologist and he gave me some of his batteries and they work fine giving me between seven and ten days of use. SO what can be wrong - hello to iCellTech the ball is in your court. Fix your problem or potential users/buyers - BEWARE.....</li>
    <li> Bought Hearing aid for my ex.and added the 60 batteries so she can hear me when I call.She is delighted .</li>
    <li> good hearing aid batteries good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten these a few time.  They work, they last a week at least, it is rare to find a dead one in the shipment.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Good quality and met expectations</li>
    <li> Best batteries, they last longer than other ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Great seal on batteries for my mom&#x27;s hearing aids. This is the only way to buy heatring aid batteries.</li>
    <li> works well in my hearing aid. will buy again</li>
    <li> I bought these batteries as a gift for my father in law. Those were the worst batteries we ever purchased. Only lasts TWO days. You get what you pay for... or less in this case. I&#x27;d rather rate it \\&quot;0\\&quot;...</li>
    <li> There is not much to say interesting about hearing aid batteries.  These work as well as the much more expensive ones and save us a great deal of money.  My husbands uses and loses them by the dozens.</li>
    <li> Batteries do their job and last for quite some time. No problem with them so far. I would use them again considering the cost.</li>
