<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I first heard of this product from Birch Box, I received a sample size of it and decided to try it.  I liked the look of the tube, the design - it immediately felt like a natural, organic product to me.  When I squeezed a little out onto my fingertips to try it, it DEFINITELY felt like a natural, organic product.  Let&#x27;s face it - there&#x27;s not a lot to get excited about when you&#x27;re thinking about smearing something dark green, earthy-smelling and gritty-feeling on your face but when you do .... oh my goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it so much, I went looking for the full size and found it here for less than Birch Box, and since I&#x27;m a prime member I got the free 2 day shipping and it was all just too good to miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am lazy.  I have a four month old. I don&#x27;t have the time for a regime full of lotions and potions and serums.  I keep a tube of this in the shower and every couple of days, I clean give my face and neck a good scrub with it.  After that, all I need to do is put on some moisturizer and I&#x27;m good to go.  My skin feels so much softer to the touch, and I have received compliments about how my skin has improved.  I love the feel of a quality product and using this makes me feel clean, natural, refresh and renewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not be sorry you bought this.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have using it twice a week to exfoliate my face. Thank and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is my Go to Skin Care brand. Love that it&#x27;s organic and feels fresh and natural. Keeps my skin clear, note this scrub is only to be used every other day or so.</li>
    <li> Use in shower or its makes a mess - nice product - smooths out dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have a very difficult time finding any facial products that won&#x27;t swell up my face or cause me to break out in a red rash. However, this scrub is unexpectedly fantastic... my skin didn&#x27;t react poorly at all. In fact, it left my skin smooth and hydrated (not too dry, and not oily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scrub has a very subtle, pleasant earthy smell. You use just a little bit (about 1/4 to 1/2 inch paste) and rub gently into your face. It is just the right texture... not too scratchy, but just abrasive enough to get rid of the dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a product I will order again and again. I highly recommend it for all skin types... even those of us with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> ...having very sensitive and acne prone skin, I have spent a lot of money on trying to find the right product. This product is not only very affordable but my skin has never looked better. I have recommended it to my other girlfriends (ages 32-46) and they all swear by it. You will notice immediate skin improvement, if used correctly.</li>
    <li> This product is intense! A little goes a very long way as it is very scrubby :) I usually add a dab to my olive &amp; mint cream moisturizer from the same line to soften its coarse texture, and I use it by itself as a body scrub! Seriously awesome product that brightens and tightens without scratching or overly drying. Do a magnifying test before/after and you will SEE how it removes the dead skin after one use. And the ingredients/company are wonderful to boot. A+</li>
    <li> It has enough grit to gently massage dead skin off without irritation.  I&#x27;ve been using vitamin C and kojic acid at night to help resurface my skin and use this every other morning to assist in the sloughing :-)</li>
    <li> Exceptional product !!! I love it. Works on combination skin with freckles. My skin has become more clear and even toned then before.</li>
    <li> I loooooove this product!!!! It was my first time using/purchasing it. I have actually ordered several products in this line and am not disappointed by any of them!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff. Scrubs good. Face nice. Yummy scent. Animal friendly. Yay. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> After using this scrub, I was ecstatic-the skin is soft,smooth,clean!But then I began to notice that he bad cleans the pores, and now, after this scrub, I additionally use a salicylic acid scrub.And only after that can see your skin is well cleansed.</li>
    <li> This is the best face wash! It looked weird at first...it&#x27;s a dark rich green and very textured (I recommend using in the shower). It&#x27;s all natural and organic and really makes my face feel fresh and clean! I also have very dry skin and this is perfect at washing away the dead dry skin on your face - great for exfoliating. I found I can buy this now at Target but before it reached target I was buying on Amazon. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate buy this! Love it so much.  my skin feels so clean and smooth when I use it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! A friend of mine gave me the last a her very own sample size and I am SOLD. I found that Target in my town carries the 4 Oz size for 9.99 and so to save a few bucks I will be purchasing it there. I can to wait to get my hands on this product! I just used up the last of what i was givendors last night. I have acne and scarring and combination skin due to using retin a Cream  and bascially this product blew me away. Amazing.</li>
    <li> Really brightens up face, leaves it smooth!</li>
    <li> I really like that this product is organic and it does a great job!  My skin feels much better after I use this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully 2-3 times a week. I have normal/combination skin. For whatever reason, this product has not brighten, tone or clean my face. It was breaking me out with whiteheads. I was so hoping it work, but it did not. I&#x27;ll just pass it on to my sister who has very sensitive skin. I do love the color of it..its green and gritty.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Fine gritty exfoliating bits, but only use a little dollop.  I mix it in with cleanser every other day or so.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT GOES ON GRITTY AND IT&#x27;S BLACK..... OH, AND IT WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I apply this product I use a soft toothbrush, I look in the mirror and rub it in , and let it sit for 30-60 seconds, then hop in the shower.  This stuff REALLY clears out my skin and gives it a firm and fresh look.  It immediately takes down acne by about 50%... this is an amazing product, and all natural</li>
    <li> Best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. Isn&#x27;t full of chemicals and alcohol and all of the things that my face hates. Also super cheap compared to buying it from a department store. Nice and gritty for great exfoliation. Leaves skin shiny, but not greasy/oily. Will buy again.. and again.</li>
    <li> Best Facial scrub every. I love it! I usually buy 4 at a time. Face scrub and body scrub. Its sooo good! Looks like mud coming out.</li>
    <li> worked fine but wasn&#x27;t anything special for me</li>
    <li> For the price, I like.  But, I would not buy again.  I will pay more for better quality.  It kind of reminded me of St. Ives brand.  Not knocking it, just in a different category of scrubs I prefer to use.</li>
    <li> Love it great product!</li>
    <li> I positively adore this product. I have been using it for going on three weeks now, 2-3 times per week and directly after using Acure&#x27;s creamy face cleanser for normal to dry skin. My face looks fresh, my pores are smaller and cleaner and my skin feels softer. I also recommend using it on the neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage.  I follow each wash or exfoliant treatment with the Moroccan Argan Oil as moisturizer and Wow! this is just the fresh start my skin care regimen needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched from a scrub with Alpha Beta Hydroxy because I was seeing signs of increased sensitivity to the sun and worsening dark spots (even when closely following directions to use sunscreen, etc.).  I have no fear of darks pots reemerging when the sun returns this summer because Acure&#x27;s product has naturally derived ingredients that work even better than the chemical components in the scrub I was using previously.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this scrub 2 weeks but love it so far! The Acure line was recommended to me by a dermatologist as a highly effective yet natural brand, great for problem skin. I&#x27;ve used it to exfoliate a few times a week and it always leaves my skin soft and glowing. I believe this is helping to minimize breakouts too as my skin has looked clearer than ever since using this scrub. In my 20&#x27;s I wasted hundreds of dollars on expensive skin care brands including various acne control and anti-aging products. Now I am in my mid-30&#x27;s and am finally achieving clearer, smoother skin using a regime of totally natural and inexpensive products &amp; supplements. (Other favorites include Dr. Woods Shea Vision soap, Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel, Kiss My Face Olive &amp; Aloe lotion, and Burts Bees Intense Hydration eye cream).</li>
    <li> I love this scrub!!  Just after one use, I can feel that my skin is much smoother and softer!!</li>
    <li> I really like this scrub.  Has just the right amount of abrasiveness, leaves skin feeling silky smooth.  I use daily.</li>
    <li> Extremely happy with this product. Cleans wonderfully and leaves a healthy look to skin. A little is all that&#x27;s needed. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I liked this more than I expected! I was hesitant because of the low price point. I assumed it may not be good quality but the reviews convinced me to give it a try. It works great!</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample in my BirchBox and I knew right away that I would be purchasing this.  I&#x27;m on my second tube and love this.</li>
    <li> Works as expected, on time.</li>
    <li> Great product for the face, it smells delicious and your skin will be left silky soft. I like that the ingredients are clean and that it is gluten-free.</li>
    <li> I received the package in time, and it has been working real great! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This stuff is holy grail. I think people with sensitive skin miiiight wanna reconsider this one, it is pretty abrasive (it&#x27;s like the consistency of sand). But it&#x27;s all natural and vegan, free of all those harmful chemicals and nonsense. I noticed positive results only a couple days after I started using it. My breakouts stopped growing and began to fade, my skin felt softer and fresher... it&#x27;s just great. My skin looks great now because this exfoliator, and I recommend it wholeheartedly.</li>
    <li> Ahhh, I really love this scrub! Doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin, and my face feels very clean afterwards. I do like the smell, and it&#x27;s green, which is fun : )</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it 2x week. It leaves my skin soft and I didn&#x27;t have any allergic reactions. I like it.</li>
    <li> A tube of this product appeared when my wife and I moved in together. I was secretly gleeful about it (please don&#x27;t tell her!) and have since made it a habit of buying a more... as a replacement for the product I use. Whoopsie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admit it to yourself, right here and now: you enjoy a facial SCRUB, rather than a facial WASH, right? This product has the grit that you KNOW you&#x27;re looking for. It exfoliates and leaves you feeling clean and renewed. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it every day (I think the instructions call for every other day?) but when you do, it&#x27;s a treat. Your skin will feel ten times better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for all the technical mumbo-jumbo? Maybe my wife can tell you about the Chorella growth factor... I just know it feels good!</li>
    <li> This is my first review ever, so this product is indeed worthy of one.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, first starting with a few times a week as recommended.  But the way it makes my skin glow makes me use it more frequently, almost every day (the best glow is when I use it at night and wake up in the morning).  I pair this with another gentle gel cleanser to help it soak in better.  I leave it on for at least 10-15 minutes, sometimes longer if I want to use it as a mask.  It really is fantastic.  I have combination sensitive skin with fine lines, so this does an excellent job of cleansing deeply without irritating or drying out my skin.  I also use other natural/organic skin products and the whole routine works very well for me. And a little does go a very long way.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an organic facial scrub to replace the products I had been using. This product more than fits the bill. The exfoliation process doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry and red. In fact, my face is soft and moisturized and refreshed. So far: fantastic.</li>
    <li> I saw this product at whole foods. They were out, but I was able to get a sample. I used it for a few weeks and my skin is brighter and smoother. I saw it on amazon and purchased it. The ingredients are wonderful and all natural. Love it!</li>
    <li> I cannot say how much I love this stuff. Helps with my sun discoloration, smells like earthy green-tea, the granules are a nice size, makes my skin super smooth and soft, prevents acne and a tube goes a really long way.  I have friends in other countries who have me bring this to them where they can&#x27;t get it. Fantastic natural product... just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes (sand + eyes &#x3D; ouch) :-P</li>
    <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t look so great or smell so great coming out of the tube, lol, but my skin loves it! The label says to use twice a week, but I have just started using it every other day. As you can see, from the picture, it is a very THICK formula and as &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; suggests, it has a really good texture to it that helps with exfoliating your skin. My skin looks and feels refreshed after this.</li>
    <li> Great scrub!  I like a scrub that really SCRUBS, not gentle, barely noticeable exfoliation.  This is a wonderful scrub, especially when used on dry skin or with just damp skin.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic stuff! Very fine, small beads of particles to scrub your face with. Definitely gets the scrubbing job done, and I have to say, helps to unclog pores. I was having a problem with clogged pores along my hairline and by my chin. One application of this and those clogged pores were on their way. I would not use this product every day, but maybe once or twice a week for maintenance. Every day use would just be too harsh on my skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this scrub. I have been in the market for awhile for something that doesn&#x27;t have those little plastic beads. This one actually has walnut shells and is quite the exfoliant! It is a great scrub with a refreshing minty smell. I also kind of like how green it is! Both my husband and I would use again!</li>
    <li> I have tried quite a few facial scrubs and either they would make me break out, or be too harsh and leave my face red and blotchy. Not this product. It leaves your face nice and smooth, nor red and irritated AND it has not caused any break outs for me. I have tried other products from this line and have been very happy with everything.</li>
    <li> Thumbs up to ACURE on this Facial Scrub! So far this is my favorite product of theirs. The scrubby bits are mostly from Lemon Peel Granules and on account of the Chlorophyll, French Clay and Sea Kelp it is a cool looking rich green color filled with other great skin nurturing ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredient List &#x3D; Organic Acai Berry, Organic Blackberry, Organic Rosehips, Organic Pomegranate, Organic Rooibos, organic Calendula, Organic Chamomile, Organic Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Vegetable Glycerin, French Green Clay, Organic Lemon Peel Granules, Saponifed Organic Coconut Oil, Vegetable Cellulose Gum, Organic Olive Oil, Organic Sea Kelp, Cocoa Powder, Organic Chlorella Growth Factor, Chlorophyll, Fermented Sugar, Carageenan, Argan Stem Cells, Organic Argan Oil, Potassium Sorbate, Salvia officinals (Sage) Essential Oil, Mentha spicata (Spearmint) Essential Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are generous with the Lemon Granules which are small and rounded so they are not jagged or too scratchy but still effective so that with just a small amount you can give your skin a really good polish without irritating it. It does not smell like a \\&quot;seaweed\\&quot; based product. The aroma is a minty herbal one due to the Spearmint and Sage Essential oils in it. I really like it but if you have a thing against herbal scents then I suggest passing on this one.&lt;br /&gt;Your skin feels smooth and clean after and with the 4 ounces of product it should also last you a pretty good while especially if you are just using it 3 days a week as recommended.</li>
    <li> makes my skin look smooth and clear!</li>
    <li> For an organic product (no sulfates), this scrub lathers up great &amp; leaves my face feeling clean and smooth. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> MY FACE FEELS REALLY CLEAN AND SOFT AFTER USING THIS</li>
    <li> Love this product - I use it 2-3 times a week no problems with breakouts either just smooth glowing  skin.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this consistently but I have noticed a difference in the way my skin looks and feels. I use this with the argan oil. I am currently using hyaluronic acid in liquid supplement form (not consistently) but I am pleased with the results so far. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I am 32 years old and had wonderful skin until about three years ago when \\&quot;hormonal\\&quot; acne scarred my face horribly. I got the hormones under control with progesterone cream and found out about an undiagnosed allergy that made it worse. SO, all of that to say that my face was in terrible condition. I had large deep purple marks everywhere and had tried everything from \\&quot;at home\\&quot; remedies, to the expensive grocery store stuff and everything in between! No success...until NOW! It&#x27;s been almost a month and my skin is glowing, my scars are fading!!! The directions say to use a few times a week but I use it every night with my Clarisonic facial brush. I only use a pea-sized amount and do it every evening without fail. I follow it up with two drops of the argan oil by Acure and the healing is remarkable! I am so thankful to have found this company! I will say too that I have used their shampoo and conditioner as well and will NEVER go back to the expensive salon stuff, ever! I get compliments constantly and tell everyone I know about this company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for good, clean healing don&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> The smell, the color and the feel of this scrub just makes me feel good! I have only been using this product for a couple of days, so I will need to update, but so far I am in love. I am using this with the argan oil and the two together have my face feeling like new. I have been searching for some organic products for awhile and have tried quite a few from Whole Foods, but this is the best so far. I am 33 and just had my second child. I am feeling tired and I have some remaining \\&quot;mask of pregnancy\\&quot;. I am hoping this will help. At the least, I feel good using it. Stay tuned for update!</li>
    <li> The scrub is amazing! I love how my skin feels and looks after it. Highly recommend and will always reorder it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite cash wash ever. Acure recommends to only use 3/week, but I use every single night without irritation. This scrub has completely cleared my acne and leaves my face feeling baby soft. After I scrub my face, I use the extra lather on the backs of my hands. It also leaves them feeling ultra soft! I won&#x27;t use anything else...ever! I also follow up with two drops of Acure&#x27;s argon oil. It&#x27;s perfection!</li>
    <li> I needed a scrub that was harsh enough to get all the dead skin on my face off, but still be light enough not to make my skin red and break out and I love this! I like the smell but the color freaks me out a little. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t  really work with my skin.</li>
    <li> This scrub has definitely improved the overall look of my skin, giving it a balanced healthy glow. I&#x27;m a huge fan of Acure products and this one definitely didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> The particles are so small. My face is so much smoother after scrub and can absorb moisturizer / cream much better! Love it!</li>
    <li> This is truly the best face I have ever used</li>
    <li> I love this exfoliating cleanser.  My skin gets dry and dull and even flakey (damn that 10X magnification mirror).  I use this 2-3 times a week and my skin is smoooth and glowing and flake free,  but not irritated.  It&#x27;s gentle and my skin isn&#x27;t screaming afterward like it has with some exfoliating cleansers.  I dig the smell,  too.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING.  I&#x27;m 34, and never had a blemish... until I hit 30.  The hormonal cystic acne has plagued my chin and neck for years.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from washes, scrubs, microdermabrasion, facials, masks, even antibiotics as a last resort.  NOTHING cleared my skin like this!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for only 2 weeks and my skin is clearing beautifully, as well as my old acne scars disappearing.  People are making comments about how fresh, young and healthy my skin looks.  Its a small tube, but you only need a pea sized amount for your face, neck and chest.  Thank you Acure for finally clearing my skin after 4 years of searching!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got very oily, acne prone, large-pored skin that is also sensitive and I&#x27;m very picky about exfoliating products. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of scrubs and only repurchased one, which is now discontinued. I finally decided to purchase this Acure scrub and I&#x27;m so glad I did! Not only is it an effective exfoliator, it works amazingly well at cutting down oiliness and I feel like I&#x27;ve just used a clay mask after using it. My skin looks much brighter and more even. I was worried I would be allergic to this since I have been allergic to so many organic skincare products with lots of plant ingredients in the past but I&#x27;m happy to report this didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. Will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> I love this scrub. Not harsh, and I use every day. Does it brighten? Well, my sun spots are still there, just slightly lighter.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels amazing</li>
    <li> This product is great! I genuinely look forward to using it a few times a week. It feels great going on and leaves my skin so smooth and soft! Reasonable price too for such quality ingredients!</li>
    <li> The grit in this is probably a good exfoliator, but my face didn&#x27;t improve with this at all. Didn&#x27;t make my skin feel clean like other products.</li>
    <li> The product claims that it can be used for &amp;#34;all skin types&amp;#34; but, sensitive skin user beware! It is quite the rough exfoliant. I would say that it is tougher than St. Ives with twice as many little exfoliating beads. I like to use this on my feet and my well worn legs and arms/elbows. My senstitive face was hurting after this one, even with a test of gentle lathering.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Skin feels more smooth and clear</li>
    <li> Horrible made me break out within a week from using it. And supposedly it&#x27;s &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; !!</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful exfoliant, I like that it isn&#x27;t harsh but cleans deep, I love Acure products not only are they good for the earth but they are great for your skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I keep it in shower for every other day use</li>
    <li> I didnt buy this online but i wanted to review this to be helpful to those looking for a scrub. I really like this because it doesnt break me out and its not creamy texture like st ives. Scrubs really well but it is a little rough on skin so I only use it 1-2 times a week. I gave this 4 stars because I havent seen any brightening but I am a black female so most produtcs like these wont have that affect.However exfoliating in general does give you a even tone and helps diminish dark spots so I will contiune to use this. Overall if your looking for a scrub that  has good ingredients this is your best bet.</li>
    <li> I just tried this product for the first time today and I LOVE it.  It felt really good going on (tiny bit of tingle, but not too much) and I could feel it exfoliating without being overly harsh.  I followed up with my normal Clinique facial cleanser.  I was so impressed when I got out of the shower and saw how smooth and bright my skin looked.  I will definitely be checking out other Acure Organics products.</li>
    <li> I saw little white heads (1 or 2) coming out, the day after I used it. for the first two weeks. Now I maintain a little scrub once a week, love it and glad its natural. I didnt like chemicals and this has a great rating on EWG</li>
    <li> Just started using this so I can&#x27;t say if it reduces pigmentation yet but I like the feel and smell of it.  It makes my skin feel super soft after I use it and I love that it&#x27;s a natural product.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for a scrub I have ever used!! I am a fan of ACURE now because of this wash! And it is half the price here where I paid double at a mom-&amp;-pop health food store (duh me). I have VERY SENSITIVE SKIN!! And also suffer from Rosacea and am not suppose to even use scrub products, but I use this one because it is nice makes your face, it is packed full of great stuff and it makes your face feel super-duper squeaky-clean! It also gets nice and Suds up I add some drops of eucalyptus oil to it in my palm and adding drops of water when you mix it with lukewarm water it almost becomes creamy! Love this product it feels good smells really good and most importantly it is organic and cruelty free and vegan makes prepping for your next skin care treatment a charm, it helps my other products work better, this really works! It&#x27;s great to use even once a week,(label says use 3x a week) I also use &amp;#34;DeVita natural skin care&amp;#34; capillary support serum which helps calm red tiny thread veins and i lovelovelove to use this scrub and apply my favorite products by Eminence, Rosehip tonique and Couprose-C serum! This is all working together to treat acne/ cystic Rosacea and helps with fine lines and wrinkles!!! Give this a try! Its awesome!</li>
    <li> I love this scrub....little bit goes a long way. I use it on my face , neck and my hands . My skin improved dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> My face felt really clean and smooth after using this.</li>
    <li> I thought this scrub was way too harsh for dry and sensitive skin, I mention this because it is very misleading for Acure to label this product as being &amp;#34;for all skin types&amp;#34;. I would only recommend it for oily and combination skins, normal skin types only to use maybe once a week. I&#x27;m still looking for a natural facial scrub that&#x27;s actually gentle enough for dry and sensitive skin, since all this one did was cause irritation.</li>
    <li> After using this 3-4 times a week, I really like it.  isn&#x27;t really harsh on your skin when you are scrubbing, smells nice, leaves your skin nice and soft and smooth.  Bonus is that it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or make it flaky.  Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> I add a touch of water to it to make it slightly thinner and use it as a facial and body scrub. My skin feels soft after exfoliation and I do not experience irritation at all.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of all the dead skin!  I always get it on my nose, and you can see it when I apply foundation there.  Not anymore!  I&#x27;m hoping overtime it will also fade my acne scars like other reviewers have said.  Best part, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like the ones you find at the grocery store!  I have sensitive skin.  I use it every two days, or every other day when I feel I need it.  A pea size amount is all you need, so it should last a long time.  Also, it&#x27;s an amazing price for an organic skin care line.  No complaints!  👍</li>
    <li> We discovered this brand through BirchBox and love it! I&#x27;ve stopped using Clinique scrub after I found this one! Pretty awesome product...I recommend trying this product..</li>
    <li> Scrub smells awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently started having issues with my skin (yes, hormonal fluctuations after my mid-20&#x27;s, though I was clear all through puberty. Just my luck!). I&#x27;ve started getting occasional pimples and tiny red dots which just wouldn&#x27;t go away. I realized I had to start using natural products, and I&#x27;ve had great luck with this one. I know, the cult favorite is St. Ives, which my mother has been using for 50 years, but it just felt too harsh for my skin. I&#x27;ve tried high-end products like Clarins but they just didn&#x27;t quite do the trick. I stumbled upon this on amazon, and it&#x27;s been great. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any new &amp;#34;cell growth&amp;#34;, but I do love the way my skin feels afterwards. It&#x27;s not in the slightest bit aggravated or red, it&#x27;s just smooth and feels supple. I definitely recommend this if you have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t usually react well to regular scrubs. It&#x27;s been working great for me and I haven&#x27;t had pimples or irritated skin since I started using this!</li>
    <li> This is a dupe for EXFOLIKATE. I like this product and it works just as good or if not better then Exfolikate. This can be used daily and it is brightens up your skin. The down side is that I do not like the smell but it is not bad enough to lose a star. I could see results in about 3 uses and my face remained very soft. I would recomend over Exfolikate.</li>
    <li> This is my fifth Acure product, and I can only echo the positives in the other reviews. I find the smell just a bit &amp;#34;funky&amp;#34;, but I LIKE that. It borders on a Chinese herb smell to me (the herbal ones, not the bitter ones), and I love the exotic-ness of it. As for the function of the product: A+. The value for its price: A+. The product is aptly named: &amp;#34;brightening facial scrub&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 40+ mildly sun-damaged skin with mild-moderate rosacea. I&#x27;m not supposed to use any scrub b/c of the rosacea, but my skins loves this product. You must must must use a gentle touch, and have patience (barely flop your fingers in light circular motion for 1-2 minutes) and not scrub roughly in a hurry. I can hardly believe it when I come out of the shower with less red in my face, and my skin is sooooo soft.</li>
    <li> The best facial scrub I&#x27;ve found--and no fake plastic balls to clog up our ecosystem.  All natural, fragrance is not beautiful, but what it does to your skin is.  My skin is dry so many exfoliants can be too harsh but this one is great.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff... i&#x27;d been looking for something that wasn&#x27;t greasy &amp; that had the right grainy consistency for a face scrub, and this is definitely it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;most other scrubs are too fine or too &#x27;goopy&#x27; and don&#x27;t have enough &#x27;scrub&#x27; to do any good... this certainly has enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have sensitive skin (i definitely don&#x27;t) i would not recommend this - i guess it can be a bit abrasive? but if you apply it GENTLY, it should be just fine. this scrub is great and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my acne, i will be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this face scrub. I&#x27;m picky about what I put on my skin bc it&#x27;s very sensitive &amp; this scrub makes my skin feel amazing after. I&#x27;ve only used it for a week but feel SO much better about what&#x27;s going into my skin! The ingredients are so cleansing and natural. Perfect concoction! Loving it so far.</li>
    <li> Good for your face and the environment. The fine granules make me skin so smooth and soft. I also saw this for sale at whole foods. Great product. Light scent, long lasting.</li>
    <li> Love this scrub!  I originally discovered at another store but they have been out of stock.  Was very glad to see I could order here.</li>
    <li> Simply the best! It open pores and leaves skin smooth.</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive combination skin that is pretty damaged from 35 years of &amp;#34;yolo.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is freaking magical.  Even the supermarket started carding me again for wine.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using Acure products. I love that they are chemical free with mostly organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the scrub, I am equally as satisfied. I have sensitive skin so I am always weiry of trying exfoliating products out of fear my skin will break out or get a &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; feeling. This product has not caused any of those problems. In fact, it leaves my skin feeling fresh, soft, clean, vibrant, and even moisturized (it has some oils in it). It feels as though the old dry skin is removed. I then follow up with the radical resurfacing cream, then either the day cream or the night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those interested: it is green, is grainy/sandy feeling, slightly oily, and smells like seaweed. They recommend using up to three times per week.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Use it in my face and on my arms (some pimples caused by the sun and they disappeared right away)!&lt;br /&gt;It feels very organic and natural, highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best face scrub I&#x27;ve found yet (and I&#x27;ve tried MANY).   First thing is it&#x27;s all natural - no microbeads, yay! It smells nice and fresh, is just gritty enough (don&#x27;t rub it in too hard!) and rinses away clean/doesn&#x27;t leave a residue at all. My skin is really flaky especially in the winter and this helps get rid of the stubborn flakes without irritating my sensitive skin.   I haven&#x27;t noticed any brightening effects after finishing a bottle, but I still love the product for its exfoliation properties.   I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural facial exfoliant - it&#x27;d work great on dry or oily skin (i&#x27;m dry in winter and oily+breakout prone in summer and it works well all year round for me).</li>
    <li> I found this product through a monthly beauty subscription.  Is it also highly rated for being safe for skin.  I use it 1-3 times a week.  It&#x27;s great a great smell and leaves my skin feeling wonderful after.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Acure Organics Sea Kelp &amp; Chlorella scrub for several months &amp; am happy to report great results!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fairly course scrub yet leaves my face feeling refreshed &amp; stimulated.&lt;br /&gt;Others have commented that my complexion appears brighter.&lt;br /&gt;No adverse side effects.</li>
    <li> This stuff is like magic! I&#x27;ve never had a scrub that made my face feel so soft without being over abrasive. I really enjoy it, and will continue to buy it when this tube runs out. I also really like that the product is vegan and natural!</li>
    <li> I like it! Smells... funky but I know it is because they use natural/organic ingredients. Just a tiny dot is enough. My face feels super smooth and soft after this. Using too much can damage your skin so be careful!</li>
    <li> This product made my face break out even worse.</li>
    <li> My favorite scrub.  Makes my face (and arms and legs) so smooth.  The texture is perfect.</li>
    <li> I use this every  other day.  really  refreshes your skin and brightens  your skin .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product just a couple of weeks now. A small amount gets the job done--my face is super smooth! I haven&#x27;t had any burning sensations or break-outs like I have with other products. I have incredibly sensitive skin so it&#x27;s nice to finally find something that is gentle but still does its job!</li>
    <li> The best scrub! It does not clog pores which is what other scrubs were doing to my face. I can already see that the white heads and black heads are disappearing. It not only is organic, it also &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; organic. I feel so happy using this. My acne has reduced to a great degree!</li>
    <li> After I used this product i started to break out on my face. I was not too sure if it was the shampoo I was using or this product. but ever since I stopped using it, my face cleared up.</li>
    <li> I really like this face scrub and could definitely see the different after using. The main issue for me personally is that the minty, lemony, sea weed smell is fairly overpowering and upsets my sensitive allergies a bit. It actually smells good and natural, it&#x27;s just really strong. I think it&#x27;s something I could still use in the shower as I can wash it off pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Just got it and used it ones but can tell that it&#x27;s a good product. I will probably keep buying this only from amazon.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  My face doesn&#x27;t feel clean unless I use this every day and it does actually brighten my face.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this face scrub! I have never used a product and was blown away immediately like I was with this one. I could tell a difference in my skin right away. It smells very good too. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin bright and takes the dead stuff away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon: STOP requiring more words for my reviews, you idiots.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It leaves my skin super soft and feeling amazing! Highly recommended. A tiny pea size goes a long way! Lasts a long time, great value.</li>
    <li> finally a scrub that&#x27;s not too rough but definitely gets a polish going. I know this doesn&#x27;t contain mint but I can&#x27;t help but describe the feeling afterwads as minty</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or acne, so I can&#x27;t comment on some magical powers of this scrub some users experienced. But it absolutely does what I expect it to do, plus it is a natural alternative to some harsh products out there, so I give it 5 stars! Texture is nice, and my skin is very soft to touch after each use. Good buy!</li>
    <li> I am new to Acure, and so far really like their products.  I have decided to purchase only organic and the Acure line is, and lacks all the commercial &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; ingredients traditionally found in skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;This one in particular has been a pleasant surprise.  I have been looking for a good facial scrub that actually does what it says, i.e. gently polishes away dead skin cells without irritating my skin.  I was given an Origins facial scrub that didn&#x27;t do a thing; the &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; were too large and soft, and therefore completely ineffective.  This one feels nicely gritty but doesn&#x27;t leave my face scratched or red, and I&#x27;ve already noticed some improvements in my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It feels great on your skin and it is made out of natural things. My skin feels smooth and bright.</li>
    <li> I bought this product while I was pregnant and after I loved another in the Acure line. The texture is somewhat harsh which I know my facial lady would try to deter me from and it does leave my skin a little pink but I really do like it and feel it&#x27;s great to get a deep clean when you just use it one to two times per week. Definitely great for the price. This line is also available at Whole Foods!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff....just started using this brand and I&#x27;m loving all their products - so far I&#x27;m using the wash, the scrub and the day cream too.</li>
    <li> Amazing scrub and my skin looks fresh.  Great product and great value.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I have very fair, sun damaged skin and this has helped lighten some spots.  It feels great, not too rough and really deep cleans my skin.  Plus, I love buying organic, natural products that aren&#x27;t killing animals and poisoning our water supply.  This is now a must have item for me as is their Marula Oil which I slather on all the time and my skin loves.  Love this company &amp; this product.</li>
    <li> Love this scrub. Definitely worth the money and lasts a long time. A little bit goes a long way with this product.</li>
    <li> Product NOT real!!!  I have been using the real thing for years... I noticed my skin has been horrible since using this one. There are huge sharp pieces that literally cut my skin!  I finally stopped using it and bought one from Whole Foods (it was actually cheaper) and I am sooo glad I did before this did more damage to my skin.  The real one doesn&#x27;t have large sharp pieces like this one... My skin is in really bad shape after using this. Buyers beware when using facial products online. I have had to learn the hard way.</li>
    <li> Oh this makes my face so soft without feeling like its ripping my skin off! Skin feels cleaner!! I did notice some more acne than usual during the first few uses, but now after a month or so of regular use (3 or so times a week) my face seems to be clearer than before I used it! Best exfoliated yet!</li>
    <li> This is the scrub I&#x27;ve been looking for: pleasing fragrance, no polyethylene micro beads, and, the clincher: a high density of granules that are perfectly-sized and milled.  This is in contrast to scrubs that either do not have enough granules (so that you end up chasing them around your face), or granules that have not been milled down smoothly.  I do have sensitive skin, but I believe the key is to let the Acure scrub do the work for you.  Avoid pressing hard with your fingers as you rub, and you&#x27;ll avoid injuring your skin.  A slow, gentle circular touch over a longer period of time yielded perfectly polished results.</li>
    <li> A lot more effective than any skin scrub i have ever tried. Truly cleans and gives you glowing skin.</li>
    <li> This face wash is okay. Its very hard for me to put on my face and spread around, and I used it once and broke out, and also, this may just be an allergic reaction but i get a headache every time I use it and my face gets burning hot. ouch.</li>
    <li> I like the way my skin feels after using this product but I do not really like using the product. It is very black and gritty so I have to be very careful that it does not get on my close or anywhere else. I especially do not want to get the stuff in my eyes, but it really does a very nice job on my skin and that is why I am giving it four stars.</li>
    <li> Great facial scrub but not for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> It was the first time that I tried an Acure product. The reviews were great and I can confirm why. This facial scrub has none of the chemicals most other brands unfortunately use in their products. I prefer organic and non chemical substances when it comes to skin care, and this product delivers just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light, smells fairly good and works wonder on my skin !</li>
    <li> This scrub is fantastic.  Brightening as promised.  The granules are very small and truly make my face feel like I&#x27;ve gotten rid of excessive dead skin and little bumps.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a miracle facial scrub, lol! It works wonders. My skin is like freshly done by a microderma effect. It made my skin clear and clean and brighter. Love this product so much and to think it&#x27;s only been a week.</li>
    <li> this is a great scrub. it left my skin really smooth and clean. it helps with my break outs. love it.</li>
    <li> I have so many skin issues; dry, oily, eczema, uneven skin tone, cystic acne (occasionally). African American Lady mid thirties and wears foundation everyday btw..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple weeks of use, my skin looks brand new, less oily, and very balanced. I used it in combination with the sensitive skin moisturizer that comes in the blue container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have problem skin, I HIGHLY recommend this. Use it every other day tho since it is a scrub, I bought the sensitive skin face wash( kinda runny but very effective) to rotate with this, sometimes I mix the two(which makes you use less of both products)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Was first concerned about small size of package at first but a little of this product really goes a long way! I use a pea size amount on my face in the shower every day to every other day! Its a very nice texture - powerful yet small granualar doesnt scratch or damage but gets the job done! Nice earthy smells - rinses clean! Leaves skin feeling refined and refreshed! Reccommend! Has made me curious about other products in this line. Price point is decent - not an outstanding value, but for the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; &amp;#34;chemical free&amp;#34; features is a thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I love this product because it&#x27;s one of a very few that I can use without my face developing a nasty rash.  I am hypersensitive to everything when it comes to my face, but I am able to use this product in moderation (once a week, sometimes twice) without issue.  My face feels super soft after use (I can&#x27;t stop touching my face!).</li>
    <li> Very gritty paste that will buff your face clean and leave a silky after glow!</li>
    <li> Purchased this not knowing what to expect and I am completely in love. I do as directions said I use this 3 times a week and my skin looks so great again. I also purchased avocado oil and that made my skin 100 times even more better. Will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this a few weeks now and absolutely love it!  I have sensitive oily skin and it does not cause any sort of reaction.  It suds up and cleans really well and lifts all the execs oil out as I hoped it would without drying out my skin so far.  I use it about every other day.  I hope they keep making this product.</li>
    <li> I have the most sensitive skin on the planet. My skin feels amazing following exfoliation days with this product. Zero irritation. Super smooth skin. All anyone could ask for.</li>
    <li> I love it :) It&#x27;s a great scrub - not too aggressive but good enough to leave your face feeling clean. It also makes my face feel super soft after. Great product</li>
    <li> While I have not yet used this product, it came with a barcode sticker covering the original barcode. For personal care and skin care items, this is a sign of diversion, a process by which unauthorized resellers allow barcodes (and the product) to sit in a warehouse until it expires, then slap a new barcode over the original one so they can resell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be reporting the seller to Amazon, but I would highly recommend purchasing this product elsewhere due to the shady practices of this seller and the fact that the product may be expired.</li>
    <li> This scrub is amazing! It smells great, and a little goes a long way. It says brightening scrub, and it does just that. My skin literally glows after I use this.</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s good. It brightens up my skin. I always use this after the beach.</li>
    <li> For anyone that&#x27;s been looking for a REAL solid hard core scrub you&#x27;ve finally found it. For years I continuously bought scrubs that never felt like they were actually scrubbing away dirt. You know the pretend facial scrubs that feel like soft little granules doing nothing. I LOVE this stuff it&#x27;s Always a part of my regimen. -Normally oily skin type here.- Anyhow, I use a regular wash first to take off the impurities and makeup for the day and then use this for about a min, pat my face dry and complete my regimen by putting organic argan oil on my skin and the next day I wake up and Presto!! Highly Suggested.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m here ordering my second tube, and thought I&#x27;d add to the positive reviews. The directions on the back of the tube suggest you use the product a few times a week, but I personally find it gentle enough to use every night in the shower. It has drastically helped my oily/combo skin maintain balance. It scrubs out blackheads and other nasties while the thick, paste-like seaweed bonder acts like a sponge to suck all of the gunk out of your pores, without drying your skin out. I scrub it into my face, neck, and chest, and let it &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; for a minute or two to let it really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is silky soft after use, and I love the fresh, unique scent. The only way I can think to describe the scent it is &amp;#34;oceanic&amp;#34; meets &amp;#34;anise&amp;#34;. No perfumes, though, it&#x27;s 100% natural, which is very important. I also love the dark forest green color, and the little scrubbies in it are walnut shell, and other natural things, and the consistency for me is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many exfoliators over the years, up and down the price spectrum, but the Acure brand one is the one I&#x27;ve found the most benefits from. I actually purchased this Acure brand to replace a more expensive brand I&#x27;d been using, bc I couldn&#x27;t afford it anymore. I like the Acure exfoliant much better (thankfully)! Also, even with my daily use with a pea-sized amount, the same tube lasted me between 4 and 5 months.</li>
    <li> Hmm. This product really is impressive. First of all, it&#x27;s proven that the reviews I read prior to purchasing were right on the money. It smells great (herbal) and has the ability to cut oil, grime and dirt like no one&#x27;s business. I also have to compliment them on the formulation as to the consistency and lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are nice size granules that exfoliate as the lather utterly rinses and calms the pores. And trust me when I say that a little goes a long way. Even with everyday use, I can see this lasting 2 months or longer. Once you wash with this, (especially after the gym) you&#x27;re left with clean and clear skin. It&#x27;s simply awesome. Plus I think it dries up pimples quite nicely. As far as brightening, I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference but I&#x27;m haven&#x27;t finished using my tube yet. However, I will say that your skin does get a nice pick me up and feels much smoother after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I have tried expensive scrubs from Sephora and this comes really close to one of my favorite brands but without the large price-tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint and reason for the 4 star rating is the difficulty in getting the product out of the tube. Because of the consistency, I&#x27;ve had the scrub get stuck a few times already. It&#x27;s a bit annoying but not a total deal breaker. I think the hole for the top needs to be a bit larger. Other than that,there aren&#x27;t any other negatives I can think of. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST facial scrub I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried many brands. I used to use the facial scrub by Devita, which was great, but if you&#x27;re looking for a rough scrub that will make your skin smooth and soft, this is it! This stuff makes my skin glow and my face has never been smoother! From here on out, I will use this scrub and ONLY this scrub! Acure has turned me into a loyal customer. I&#x27;ts nice and griddy and it smells great! Be careful about getting it in your eyes though. I use it every other day because I&#x27;m just that addicted to it. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Nice.  It&#x27;s a little &#x27;rough&#x27; so I add it to a soft cleanser and that seems to help it exfoliate more gentle for facial skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product - fairly gently scub, but can be a bit messy</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading that it was a good dupe for ExfoliKate, a fantastic facial scrub I tried once. As great as it was, I wasn&#x27;t about to pay $85 for a couple ounces of it. I bought this after reading reviews, and when I tried it, I was amazed at how similar it was to ExfoliKate. This is a dark green scrub, so just be aware of that. THe first time I saw it and it looked like the color of baby poop, I was like, um, what? But who cares about the color? It is a fantastic product and I use it twice a week in the shower, scrubbing it on, and letting it sit while I wash my hair, condition, soap up, etc, just kind of rubbing it around a few times intermittently. I wash it off right before i get out and then moisturize. My skin feels cleaner, and I do think it&#x27;s brighter and more even-toned.</li>
    <li> After only about a week of use, my skin has already improved drastically! I feel really good using this because it&#x27;s natural and cruelty free as well. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does to my skin in the coming month!</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter.  She likes it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> ...I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many. It&#x27;s got enough grit to it so you feel like you are polishing your face. But its still gentle enough to keep you from going overboard. I like that it has clay in it, giving it the green color. Smells sort of like cloves to me. The tube lasted me quite a while.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best scrubs I&#x27;ve used and is affordable as well! It has tiny dense grains of exfoliating material so you can really scrub every inch of your face. I use a light touch so I use this more like 4-5 times a week instead of the 3x it recommends. I like to use it in the mornings to make makeup apply smoother. It smells good and it&#x27;s natural too! It also rinses off easily. I can&#x27;t say anything bad about the product.</li>
    <li> Feels really nice and cleans skin well only thing I don&#x27;t love is the smell. Not bad just not great. Almost has a bar soap smell? But I love how it cleans my face</li>
    <li> This a good facial scrub. The particles are medium sized and it has the consistency of a grainy paste.  The product exfoliates skin well.</li>
    <li> Great product! I switched over from my Bliss products because after some research I realized that the beads in most face/skin products end up in our fish populations as the waste plants can not filters the small beads. I wanted to find a product that had natural scurb properties. I first found this at Sprouts markets while grocery shopping and love it, does not over dry my face but feels clean and soft. I use it everyday and would suggest it.</li>
    <li> helps with my stubborn blackheads...my face is incredibly soft and smooth. smells bad but who cares when it works so well lol</li>
    <li> I was really hoping to like this product, but I just can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: cleaned face well. Loved the gritty feel Not too abrasive, but definitely felt like it was doing its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal skin, but have some small pimples on my forehead. They are not really noticeable, but some have redness. This product seemed to lessen the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Skin felt very tight after using. It didn&#x27;t make it oily, or have dry patches, just tight. The next day I noticed bigger pimples pop up in my temple area. It&#x27;s been nearly 3 days now since I&#x27;ve used the product, and my face burns and itches. It doesn&#x27;t look dry--no rash, or anything like that, but it doesn&#x27;t feel good at all. I didn&#x27;t have the guts to continue after 1 use. Won&#x27;t use again.</li>
    <li> It is great I&#x27;ve been  using it  this is my second tube of it!</li>
    <li> This is good stuff! Highly recommended! Stop putting all those crazy chemicals on your skin, all natural is the way to go!</li>
    <li> So far so good I will upgrade first time trying this products love the smell and texture my skin look very clear after application</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this scrub! It&#x27;s super gritty, which I love because I feel like it&#x27;s actually exfoliating. I love that there are no chemicals, and the mixture of ingredients must be perfect for my skin because I use this every other day and my skin is the clearest it&#x27;s ever been! Days that I don&#x27;t use the scrub, I was my face with ACURE Facial Cleansing Gel Superfruit + Chlorella, then follow up with using the ACURE Serioulsy Firming Facial Serum.&lt;br /&gt;I have always been self concious about my large pores on my cheeks and nose, I&#x27;ve been using this combination of products for about a week and I&#x27;m in LOVE, absolute LOVE with my skin again! It&#x27;s truly amazing! I don&#x27;t normally write reviews for products unless they are terrible, but I have to share! These will be my new skin care products, hands down, and I intended to convert my friends and family onto ACURE!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Works and smells great!</li>
    <li> I use this whenever I feel my face gets really oily so a few times a week. It does wonders the scrub is gooooood! It gets rid of all the build up on your face , clogged pores no more!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best affordable scrubs out there. It is not drying unlike those infamous apricot scrubs. And it is course enough to actually exfoliate the skin.</li>
    <li> Since using this product, i have noticed a decrease of redness in the appearance in my face. My face also feels much smoother. I have no complaints so far.</li>
    <li> Its a nice scrub but that is it. I have been using it for a month now and there is no brightening</li>
    <li> this stuff works great. not too harsh for my skin. smells good.</li>
    <li> Now I know this is marketed to women but this is the best face scrub I&#x27;ve found as a preshave wash. It leaves your skin very smooth and makes shaving with a DE razor a bit easier. It actually has more grit than many of the scrubs that are for men. Also its free trade and 100 percent natural.  I&#x27;ll definately be buying again.</li>
    <li> Revives my skin every morning. Cleared my face up after a week of use.</li>
    <li> Did not like it because it did nothing for my skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this exfoliator. It is gentle in the skin but feels like it cleans well and leaves my skin very smooth</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE fan of Acure, and now my husband is as well. This was the perfect gift for him, it doesn&#x27;t smell feminine and the results are amazing, such soft glowing skin. I always get complements on my skin and almost became an aesthetician. I love this product line (their night cream is wonderful too)!</li>
    <li> Ive tried a few different Acure Organics and love them all, however, this is my favorite.  Its the best facial scrub I&#x27;ve ever used.  Its very gentle, yet very effective and leaves no residue and is not drying.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this at whole foods for my boyfriend. He has very very sensitive skin and every face wash he has tried from the drug store causes him to break out. This was the best product and his skin has really cleared up after using it! Such a better price buying from amazon!</li>
    <li> My fave was breaking out and I started to use this and it helped immensely. I&#x27;m African American with youthful looking skin however as of lately I&#x27;ve been breaking out but this helped.</li>
    <li> Its amazing. Great for acne scars, I have seen a HUGE improvement on my face. Kudos!</li>
    <li> good item intersted to buy again</li>
    <li> I love this. I have very sensitive skin and have to use baby soap or Cetaphil as a body wash otherwise I&#x27;ll break out with eczema. I have had really bad acne the past few years (I am almost thirty years old) and previous to that not very much acne at all so I was very frustrated. I had tried everything I could think of-proactive, murad, clinique, Neutrogena, gene juarez products,  lush products, 5 different prescriptions including topical and oral and some others. I come to this product and within a few weeks my skin is clearing up. I have paid it with the argon oil as a moisturizer.  It is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I had to give this a try after having learned about it and seeing so many great reviews.  I love the product!  It really makes your face feel soooo smooth.  I like the fact that the ingredients are organic too.  The price is great and the product goes a long way. Please do not hesitate to try it.  You will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> Love this facial scrub! As it&#x27;s plant-based, it looks a little odd at first - like gritty, grassy paste - but feels great, and a little goes a long way. My skin has felt fantastic since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this scrub, but it is just a tad bit too rough for daily use. I use it about 3-4 times per week and it smells great and really exfoliates your skin. It also rinses very clean and does not leave your skin tight or dry. Worth a try for those interested in more natural and chemical free products.</li>
    <li> This is as good as one of the very expensive scrubs I bought. I will buy the one again. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is my second order. I also use it for a scrub on my arms and neck. My skin feels soft and more even toned.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this enough. Soaps dry and are full of chemicals...this just cleans your face. Just don&#x27;t ever drop it in the shower because the plastic used to make the cap is cheap and breaks easily...now I have a great scrub...in a broken container. :(</li>
    <li> Impeccable ingredients wonderful results! What more could one ask for in a product?!&lt;br /&gt;The Sea Kelp/Chlorella are ingredients I especially am drawn to having lived at the water my entire life. I now live part time inland an hour and 10 min from Newport Beach, CA. So I am always searching out Sea based natural products and was drawn right in to this particular item first. Bought the Argan Oil with it too and am loving it also! Sinks into the skin leaving it fed and happy ;)&lt;br /&gt;Have been using both, daily, and with my balanced skin it has been great. Being not too dry (on the face) or oily. It has brightened up my skin as exfoliation will do naturally but there is a difference with this Sea Kelp/Chlorella combination that is unmatched! Hope they keep this in the line as I will be a life~timer! ~ ~ ~</li>
    <li> I love this scrub! After finding success with other Acure Organics products I decided to try this scrub as an exfoliant and I love it. It starts out really grainy but softens really fast on the face - so it&#x27;s not harsh at all. I use it a few times a week and I feel like my skin has been way more radiant. I have gotten a bunch of compliments since I started using it!</li>
    <li> This does nothing for me period!</li>
    <li> Works well nice product!</li>
    <li> I like how this product makes my face feel after I wash it off, and also like feeling the little granules while I am scrubbing my face.  I am not sure what kind of difference to be looking for whilst using the product.  So I cannot comment on that.</li>
    <li> i like the way it makes my face feel after using it. feels refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;the price was good.&lt;br /&gt;it arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;over all a good product. . .</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this facial scrub out. I read the reviews on it and everybody loved it. In the past, I have used harsh, non organic facial scrubs which I felt just irritated my skin in the long run. So, I was a bit skeptical when I read that this had a very fine texture that still exfoliated the skin. The packaging on all Acure products is great- the bottles all have neat designs on them and it seems to compliment the product. At first, this product scared me. It&#x27;s a mossy-green color and is thick when it comes out of the bottle. When you rub this product into wet hands however, it turns into a light green color. I gently rub this into my face when it&#x27;s wet for about 30 seconds. I was pleased to find out the particles in this facial scrub are indeed very fine and did not irritate my skin in the long run. I massage this over my neck and upper chest as well and those areas have not been irritated. After I massage this into my skin, and I feel that I have cleaned out my pores, I wash it off. It does not leave any sort of residue on your skin and you are left feeling clean and clogged poor free. I use this facial scrub 3-4 times a week and have seen a significant reduction in the amount of blackheads on my nose. The texture of my skin is also more smooth, even compared to other facial scrubs I have used in the past. I would definitely recommend buying this facial scrub if you are looking for a skin transformation. As with with other Acure products, you will not be disappointed by this product.</li>
    <li> Great product! Leaves skin fresh, smooth, and visibly clean. And ORGANIC?! can&#x27;t beat that. I love Acure products including shampoos.</li>
    <li> I love love love this scrub. It truly brightens and softens your skin. People definitely notice a difference. It&#x27;s rough when you apply it but you really can see your skin change. It even help with discoloration. I use this and a fade cream to help even out my skin tone and people swear I use foundation because my face is that smooth. A little does go a long way to. Just a tab on damp face and really scrub your face. After 2 days you will see a difference</li>
    <li> Not sure about the brightening aspect, but it exfoliates well and feels very natural and organic. A little goes a long way when you add water.</li>
    <li> acure makes great products and this is no exception. the small beads are great for cleansing and easily washes off my make up. I love the way it feels.</li>
    <li> I tried a bunch of other scrubs from different companies and this is the best one. Natural and very effective. You only need a TINY bit to be able to cover your whole face. It leaves the skin bright and smooth. I have eczema and sensitive skin- this stuff doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s also fun rubbing it on your face because of the color, leaves face feeling super soft</li>
    <li> Love this scrub!! I love the fact that it&#x27;s all organic and natural. I love how my skin feels after exfoliating.</li>
    <li> Love love love helping my acne!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this 3 times but it&#x27;s an instant favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the ingredients are natural which is a huge plus, and there are no artificial dyes or fragrances.  It has a very earthy, herb-y aroma and smells almost like something I would put on crackers or pasta, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the grittiness, I can see why some reviewers say it&#x27;s a bit too much.  However, the key is GENTLENESS and don&#x27;t scrub for longer than one minute on your entire face/neck/chest.  Use a very light hand in small, circular motions, and of course follow up with a good moisturizer.  Even without the moisturizer I was able to get rid of &amp;#34;face dandruff&amp;#34;, or small flecks of dead skin on my face that would fall onto my clothes like dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, just use it correctly and you won&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s natural, works great on my skin, and not super expensive. So glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> it works great. I was so surprised considering the price point.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the shower every few days on my face, neck and chest. It&lt;br /&gt;helps with the dead skin/ exfoliation and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;I have turned into a loyal fan.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Ive only been using it a week and there is a noticeable difference. My face is clearing up right before my eyes, even my boyfriend has noticed. It says to use 3x a week. However I&#x27;ve been using it everday and my skin is smoother and clearer.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace one of those scrubs with the plastic bits that worked great but made me feel rather guilty. This stuff is extremely gritty - you need to mix it with a lot of water to get it to a usable consistency. Doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin, however, even if it feels like sandpaper. I use it every other day.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best beauty products i have ever used.  anyone i ask to try this has said it is truly one of the best.  recommend without hesitation.</li>
    <li> This product is both gentle and effective.  Both my husband and I use it twice weekly.  You will notice the smoothening of your face and decollette.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub! It had enough scrubbing power to be an effective exfoliant, but is not too rough on my very sensitive skin. Best of all, no rosacea flare ups with this product! That said, it is a little bit drying, but I just use my night moisturizer after this, and everything is good. Leaves skin soft and removes poor clogging junk better than my clarisonic.</li>
    <li> My three star rating is bordering on a two, but ultimately I am rating it a 3 because the only negative about my experience with this product is my disappointment at how mediocre it&#x27;s been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highlights:&lt;br /&gt;- This stuff is thick and green--really green--and smells kelpy and earthy which, though not &#x27;pleasant&#x27;, is tolerable and preferable to the inclusion of chemical fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;- Ingredients list &#x3D; very natural, the only thing I think anyone sensitive would react to with it is the physical abrasions from actual scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;- As scrubs go, it&#x27;s on the medium-fine side and feels like more of a skin polish.&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t notice much of a change when using this product, if at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the ingredients list, I was really surprised this didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my skin. I was super excited to try it when I got it, but ultimately felt that it did a lackluster job of polishing away any dry areas and I end up having to use a wet washcloth or another scrub to finish the job. Because it didn&#x27;t seem to be doing much of anything as a scrub, I decided maybe I should scrub my face with it when I shower but wait to rinse it off for a while (this was born out of the hope of at least experiencing brightening effects). I&#x27;ve been using this almost every day for the last few months with no decrease in breakouts and do not believe I&#x27;ve experienced any improvement to skin brightness from this product. If there was an improvement, it was mild enough that I didn&#x27;t really pick up on it. In contrast, I&#x27;ve added some new things to my skincare routine over the past few weeks and saw near immediate improvements to skin brightness with them, so I feel like I likely would have noticed if this had any positive impact on my skin during the number of weeks I had been using this scrub. I like Acure products a lot, but this has fallen into that unfortunate &amp;#34;I just need to use it up&amp;#34; category. This is the first Acure product I&#x27;ve encountered that I don&#x27;twant to repurchase. I see much better exfoliation and glowiness results with Ole Henriksen Walnut scrub or even by mixing simple baking soda with the Acure normal to oily gel cleanser. I&#x27;m glad this worked for other people, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything (either positive or negative) for me.</li>
    <li> Great product, amazing smell. Super natural. Has a good amount of grittiness to exfoliate. My husband and I love it!</li>
    <li> Beat exfoliant out there. It is a core piece to my face cleaning practice every night.  I have acne prone skin and this cleans (and gets all makeup off) without irritating.</li>
    <li> Feels great, smells great, and seems to do a good job. I have been using this with other products (every other day regiment) for a few weeks and noticed results from....not using any products. So it does something, and feels great because your essentially smearing berries on your face rather than stinky chemical gel/cream.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best facial scrub I have ever used. The scrub granules are the perfect size and texture to get a good exfoliation without making it look like you had a chemical peel. My skin can handle this daily, but those with more sensitive skin may only want to use a few times a week. I love Acure Organics and this is probably my favorite product by them.</li>
    <li> Great product! So good I got the cleanser as well -- which is also super!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually post reviews but this product is amazing! It leaves my skin feeling so soft.. The smell of lemon wakes me up in the mornings.</li>
    <li> This scrub really cleans out my pores and exfoliates my skin. It also cleanses well and smells good. It has the consistency of finely ground sand and scrubs nicely.</li>
    <li> Best scrub I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
    <li> I love this face scrub! It has a really good level of grittiness and I find the slight ocean/green smell refreshing. It leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I love the whole Acure Organics line. This scrub really exfoliates but doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I love the herbal smell as well. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product - look at the ingredient list and you will love it too. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell which is nice, my skin feels very soft after I use it. I will be buying again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I love this face scrub.  No harmful chemicals.  Works great at scrubbing the dead skin off of my face.  I highly recommend this brand!</li>
    <li> It cleans my face well - love it.</li>
    <li> Have now purchased 2 bottles of this and it works great to remove dark spots from sun and acne.  I have never repurchased this type of product before because nothing has ever worked like this does.</li>
    <li> Great!!!! Excellent scrubbiness without being harsh. Great ratio of scurbbies to formula.</li>
    <li> This product looks disgusting. It&#x27;s greenish black poop like substance but it does wonders for my skin. The smell is actually minty and pleasant and my face feels very refreshed after I use it. I&#x27;ve only used it couple of times a week for the past month and it hasn&#x27;t made me break out or dried out my sensitive skin like so many products do.</li>
    <li> Gentle and works nice.  Have pumps on the back of your arm?  This is for you!  Will order more.</li>
    <li> I love the stuff. I gave it to move it to a friend of mine for her 35th birthday recently. It really improves the surface of the skin</li>
    <li> Great organic facial scrub.  So many other have plastic microbeads that pollute lakes and oceans and have chemicals in them gross.  this product I know they use high quality nature derived ingredients.  It makes my skin feel smooth.  The scrub had enough texture to clean and exfoliate but still gentle enough to use daily.  It is a bargain for what is in it.  I am going to purchase other things from this skincare line.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It really does brighten your face. I use it twice a week and find thats perfect. Helps remove all dirt and grime off face.</li>
    <li> I received this product on time and have been using it every since.  I have very dry skin and it has helped relieve the issue. I will continue to purchase and use this product.</li>
    <li> Only been using for less than a week but I use it every morning. I have VERY dry skin and some acne so I use my acne medication at night and then the scrub in the morning. Then I use a little moisturizer with one drop of Aragon oil and let it sit a couple of minutes before doing my make up. So far the scrub has made a big difference. Edit: Been using it everyday for 3 1/2 months now. Still have like half a bottle left. Hasn&#x27;t made me break out. Skin looks much better. UPDATE - been using it for about 3 years now. Sometimes I will run out and just pick something up at the local store but it never works for me. I haven&#x27;t been able to find one that works as good as this one.</li>
    <li> The best exfoliating scrub I have found. Healing for breakouts and gentle enough for every day use.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  My skin feels so clean smooth and hydrated after I use it.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of exfoliating and removing oils and last quite a long time as you don&#x27;t need to use much each time.  This is the best face scrub I&#x27;ve used and it doesn&#x27;t have plastic microbeads which is now considered to be a major source of environmental pollution.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this scrub from my local wholefoods store because I don&#x27;t like buying anything before trying it just in case I don&#x27;t care for it and WOW this is definitely something I will be purchasing. It definitely does have a nice brightening effect to it after you use it and you do not need a lot AT ALL! I use a pea size amount and it&#x27;s literally enough to cover my entire face. It has very fine beads so its not abrasive on my dry sensitive skin. Plus there&#x27;s no harmful ingredients which I love! :)</li>
    <li> So I like this scrub, and this might sound weird, but the granules are so small, they get stuck in my pores, so I&#x27;m no longer going to use it.    Edit: I repurchased this scrub and it&#x27;s giving me no issues. It&#x27;s a great scrub and is the only \\&quot;natural\\&quot; scrub I have found that matches the texture of St. Ives Apricot Scrub without all the chemicals.</li>
    <li> To start off, I have to be the pickiest person when it comes to beauty care products, and i can HONESTLY say this is by far the most incredible facial scrub I&#x27;ve ever come across. My skin is super sensitive and so prone to acne when aggravated. This scrub i use daily in every morning shower, and is so gentle yet makes my face feel fresh and new again after every wash. Thank you soooo much for crossing my path acure ! Will buy and buy again :)</li>
    <li> Awesome face scrub- It&#x27;s almost better than getting a professional facial! i bought extra for Christmas stocking stuffers. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and I like that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I DID like it until I realized that it&#x27;s got loads of those tiny plastic things and not something natural like salt or brown sugar.. I got one in my eye and it was there for weeks before my body got it out (unless it&#x27;s still there and I just haven&#x27;t had any recent irritations...)&lt;br /&gt;Nevermind how bad it is for the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey, I really like this brand. Just not when they use things like plastic beads. :/</li>
    <li> Awesome exfoliating scrub.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. It never irritates my face even ifI use it twice a day and it has almost completely eliminated dry flaky skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a good, non-irritating exfoliator.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Leaves my skin smooth to touch.</li>
    <li> Best scrub ever! I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year and I&#x27;ve never liked a scrub more than Acure. My skin is very sensitive to just about everything and I&#x27;ve tried lots of different scrubs over the years. It&#x27;s a nice textured scrub that you can feel scrubbing without being too rough. Definitely one of the best scrubs out there!</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of weeks ago and love it. It&#x27;s organic and simple to use - good on both counts. I only use a tiny amount, so it should last quite a while. It has just the right amount of grit to it, as well, which is important.</li>
    <li> Great product - organic, and the ingredients are all posted on the Amazon website (other vendors should follow their lead). I use a small quantity mixed with a facial cleanser (e.g., Avalon Organics Facial Cleansing Milk). A little of this scrub goes a long way, and the scent is lovely.</li>
    <li> Better value than buying in store! I love this product, it leaves my skin glowing and feeling very smooth. I have very small pores and little to no oil in my skin, so I don&#x27;t use it everyday for fear of becoming too dry, I use it about once a week.</li>
    <li> A pea-sized amount with about 1 tablespoon of water onto wet skin works best for me.  It is doing a very nice job evening skin tone.  It lightened a scar that I have had for many years and lightened redness on my neck.  I also notice softening of my skin.  My husband also uses and said this is the best scrub he has ever used. He likes that it prevents adult break outs, softens skin, and evens tone.</li>
    <li> Best natural face scrub I have found. Never caused a breakout, also always gets rid of the little dry flakes of skin that can happen sometimes.</li>
    <li> I really like this scrub, and it&#x27;s been a life-saver since I&#x27;ve had to stop using my usual Derma-E glycolic acid/vitamin A scrub because I&#x27;m pregnant; I might permanently switch to this one.  The walnut shell powder is finer in the Acure, which I love, and my skin feels cleaner after I use it.  However, I like that the Derma-E contains glycolic acid, which has always helped my acne and large pores.  I&#x27;ve only been using this one for a couple of weeks now, so only time will tell.  I haven&#x27;t seen much of a brightening effect, but my skin feels so smooth after I use it.  Also, I have acne prone skin, and this one doesn&#x27;t break me out - a miracle in and of itself.</li>
    <li> Acure makes great products, I discovered them somewhat by accident.  This scrub is a dark black, green in color and feels very natural and mud/sand-like.  I really love it, it make my face feel really clean and it smells good and feels like it doesn&#x27;t have anything artificial in it.  I don&#x27;t think its good for daily use but I use it a few times a week and love it.  I am not sure if it improved my skin a great deal but it feels great.  The texture is really fine so it feels pretty gentle, unlike some of the apricot exfoliants that I have used.</li>
    <li> I really like this produce.  Makes my skin very smooth and has a nice, natural scent.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, dry skin and have been using facial scrubs for a long time to get rid of dry, dead skin and clean out my pores. This is the best scrub that I have ever used, it feels like it polishes your skin and leaves it smooth and extremely clean. I followed it with a little bit of the seriously firming serum for moisture and immediately noticed that my pores looked cleaner and smaller. Great product, great company, has definitely become my go to line of skin care!</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a few days now and I can already tell the difference in my skin. I am loving the scrubbing power that it has and the fact that it&#x27;s all natural makes me find favor in it even more. The smell and the dark coloring caught me off guard a little, but it&#x27;s very much worth looking pass. Acure brightening facial scrub is so far worthy of the price and has become part of my collection.</li>
    <li> Wow....this facial scrub is excellent! It&#x27;s not harsh and it brightens the skin beautifully.</li>
    <li> An excellent product! I will definitely be buying more of it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing product. Skin feels great without leaving it dry. Must have product!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face scrub. It&#x27;s nice and scrubby and does it&#x27;s job!</li>
    <li> This scrub is good enough to rub off the dead cells but it feels too strong on my sensitive skin. And I have not seen any brightening effect in particular. For me its good to have it but not a must have. Won&#x27;t be repeating.</li>
    <li> I just love this product!! I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months now.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It feels good on my face, like a homemade, fresh smelling veggie scrub.  It is dark green in color and I love the way it cleans without drying.  No chemicals and a very nice product.  This is my second tube.  I used another scrub that smelled kinda of weird and didn&#x27;t feel that great on my face so came back to my favorite and am sticking to it.</li>
    <li> Only exfoliating scrub I will use.  Non irritating,  but 100 real and works amazingly well. My boyfriend loves it on his acne prone skin in combination with your probiotic facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> i love that it&#x27;s almost all plant derived but it did absolutely nothing for my specific skin type and I found that if I did use it, that my face would develop little bumps on my face. I suppose it could just be my skin getting used to it but Dr Bronners tea tree castil soap never did that and actually helped clear my face the only thing was that it was drying out my skin. But no biggie, I just use more moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite brand!  I have 4 of their products and they&#x27;re all excellent.  The scrub is my absolute favorite!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I received a sample of it in my Birchbox and I actually thought it was a much higher-end product. I searched it, expecting this to be a $20-$30 item and I was very pleasantly surprised to see this price! I love this exfoliator and I use it daily. I feel like it makes my skin look very fresh.</li>
    <li> The best scrub ever! Is rough enough to take off dead skin, but redness goes away really quickly! The spirulina in it is wonderful for restoring your skin. Almost all the blackheads on my nose are gone!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this face scrub! It&#x27;s gentle, yet effective. My skin feels soft and refreshed after using it, and I really like the uplifting lemony scent.</li>
