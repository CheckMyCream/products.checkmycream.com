      <li>This is the beard trimmer to get for anything under a full length.</li>
      <li>Seriously, the best face/stubble trimmer out there.</li>
      <li>it goes quickly.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it !!</li>
      <li>It is worth the price.......</li>
      <li>Right now, throw-up.</li>
      <li>I love keeping a 5:00 shadow, after playing around with all the settings, I finally found which one I like to keep my scruff at the right length.  </li>
      <li>This is my first trimmer</li>
      <li>I wanted a trimmer that could reliably give me that 1-2 day beard look, and found that many don&#x27;t actually cut that close despite advertising themselves as a stubble trimmer.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>My oldest mechine is better than this one, the hightes are not enough..</li>
      <li>Works exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am satisfied overall.</li>
      <li>My review, will only echo the many positive reviews you probably already read.</li>
      <li>so i have to go over a couple of times other than that i really like the amount of trim length it has and the nice deisign.</li>
      <li>But that being said I have been able to work with it fine over the past 8 months.</li>
      <li>The guard that helps it to follow the contours of your face make this easy to use and reliable for the same trim every day.</li>
      <li>I like it a lot, but it bites your skin on certain pritave parts</li>
      <li>Cuts smoothly for short stubble looks.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re really going to buy this i-Stubble, don&#x27;t get the bonus trimmer.  </li>
      <li>Absolute junk.</li>
      <li>He says it does all that he wants.</li>
      <li>Easier to clean it, than re-package and ship it back to Amazon for replacement.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend for anyone who wants a quality trimmer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this beard trimmer for many years, and it was time for a replacement one because a few plastic parts on the old one broke.  </li>
      <li>This is my second one, the first lasted for about 3-4 years before the batteries started going south.</li>
      <li>I also clean this every day with the included brush...if you aren&#x27;t abusive, this will last you for a long time</li>
      <li>This is exactly the trimmer I&#x27;ve been looking for for a long time.</li>
      <li>This shaver is fast but it doesn&#x27;t get under my nose properly.  </li>
      <li>Pretty gross (used personal hygiene product)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>The adjustment is very fine, and the blades cut through a very thick beard with no tugging or pulling.</li>
      <li>Which Is The Battery Goes Dead quickly</li>
      <li>Other cheaper trimmers cannot give the consistent envy that this trimmer delivers.</li>
      <li>At least you can remove the blade and clean it separately.</li>

<li> Other cheaper trimmers cannot give the consistent envy that this trimmer delivers.</li>
<li> At least you can remove the blade and clean it separately.</li>
<li> I use the included Nose/Ear trimmer to get those few hairs right below my nose above my mustache area because this shaver does have trouble getting close enough due to the guard...</li>
<li> It is not loud at all.</li>
<li> The battery (if you follow the instructions and charge it as recommended) lasts for a LONG time.</li>
<li> If you do that minor amount of maintenance, you&#x27;ll use this thing for a LONG time.</li>
<li> He has a thick, fast growing beard.</li>
<li> Every time I charge it, I actually take the blade portion out carefully and do a deep brushing to remove all the hair debris, as well as drop a little blade oil on it after I put it all back together.</li>
<li> Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right, or maybe my facial hair is too weird.  </li>
<li> For me, it&#x27;s barely a problem, and when I see a few I missed, I just use that bonus trimmer to get them.</li>
<li> Istubble is hands down the only way to go!!</li>
<li> but that is the only slight issue to note.</li>
<li> /&gt;After reading the other reviews about how this thing can&#x27;t hold a charge, I&#x27;m returning it.  </li>
<li> so I&#x27;m forced to use another trimmer which sort of defeats the purpose of having multiple settings.  </li>
<li> All other ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past suck.</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t consider it unreasonable after years and hundreds of charge/discharge cycles, the blades also become dull so replacing it every couple years should be expected.</li>
<li> (some have complained that the plastic guard broke, but they must have not read on how to remove it).</li>
<li> So annoying when my my hairs below my nose stick out further than the rest.</li>
<li> Terrible, even though it looks the same... don&#x27;t be fooled by the lower price.</li>
<li> And it&#x27;s also difficult while working on the mustache.</li>
<li> Useless piece of junk</li>
<li> Ignore all the stupid reviews that say you can&#x27;t get under your nose, or the battery life sucks, etc.</li>
<li> I bought this for the 5&#x27;0 clock shadow look to trim beard, fails miserably.</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> DOA. I got it, charged it for the recommended 16 hours, and the thing wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  Plugged it back in and attempted to power it on while plugged in, and it ran for about a second before shutting off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the other reviews about how this thing can&#x27;t hold a charge, I&#x27;m returning it.  I was looking forward to a nice trim, but I think they forgot about the battery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; nose and ear trimmer is a AA-powered piece of junk.  If you&#x27;re really going to buy this i-Stubble, don&#x27;t get the bonus trimmer.  You could buy the same trimmer at the dollar store.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the 5&#x27;0 clock shadow look to trim beard, fails miserably. Useless piece of junk</li>
    <li> This is my first trimmer so I don&#x27;t have a reference to compare to, so this might be unfair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied overall. However I don&#x27;t feel like it reaches the hair as it should around the facial curves and jawlines. I have to maneuver my hand a lot and give the same area several runs for it to even out the region. And it&#x27;s also difficult while working on the mustache. But that being said I have been able to work with it fine over the past 8 months.</li>
    <li> This works great!  The quality of the materials is very good.  The guard is great and even with the guard off I have never scratched my face or head.  Be sure and charge it well as once it starts running out of power it goes quickly.</li>
    <li> My oldest mechine is better than this one, the hightes are not enough.. the remingtom mechines are butter...-</li>
    <li> I use this all the time.  I love keeping a 5:00 shadow, after playing around with all the settings, I finally found which one I like to keep my scruff at the right length.  It works great!</li>
    <li> Fantastic trimmer..... Good quality product and very smooth on operation.... The edges are smooth while nevigating a curve.... Overall an excellent trimmer</li>
    <li> It Is A Great Product.  Does Give That Stubble Look That I Wanted. OnLy One Problem Which Is The Battery Goes Dead quickly</li>
    <li> Did a ton of research on these before I finally landed on this one. I wanted a trimmer that could reliably give me that 1-2 day beard look, and found that many don&#x27;t actually cut that close despite advertising themselves as a stubble trimmer. This one does, and the electronic adjustment of the trimming length is excellent. The battery (if you follow the instructions and charge it as recommended) lasts for a LONG time. I use this every morning and only charge it maybe once every 2 weeks. The guard that helps it to follow the contours of your face make this easy to use and reliable for the same trim every day. I use the included Nose/Ear trimmer to get those few hairs right below my nose above my mustache area because this shaver does have trouble getting close enough due to the guard...but that is the only slight issue to note. For me, it&#x27;s barely a problem, and when I see a few I missed, I just use that bonus trimmer to get them. I also clean this every day with the included brush...if you aren&#x27;t abusive, this will last you for a long time (some have complained that the plastic guard broke, but they must have not read on how to remove it). Every time I charge it, I actually take the blade portion out carefully and do a deep brushing to remove all the hair debris, as well as drop a little blade oil on it after I put it all back together. It still cuts just like the day I bought it. If you do that minor amount of maintenance, you&#x27;ll use this thing for a LONG time. I love it, highly recommended for those looking for an easy, accurate way to maintain ANY length of stubble you may want.</li>
    <li> Got this to reace my old 3 year old istubble and the bonus trimmer is very handy! Istubble is hands down the only way to go!!</li>
    <li> Packaged looked like it had never been opened, but manual was missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went to use it, it was loaded with cut whiskers.  Easier to clean it, than re-package and ship it back to Amazon for replacement.  Pretty gross (used personal hygiene product)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will re-post and upgrade rating once I use it.  Right now, throw-up.</li>
    <li> Did not work...AT ALL! Would not even turn on, while plugged in or after a 24 hour charge. Absolute junk.</li>
    <li> I keep hoping I find one of these that works well and I keep failing.  Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right, or maybe my facial hair is too weird.  I just don&#x27;t find that this cuts evenly, in spite the many setting.  If all you need is something to trim bush off your face, this will do a fine job.  But for grooming in a more precise way it just did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this beard trimmer for many years, and it was time for a replacement one because a few plastic parts on the old one broke.  Love it !</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned!</li>
    <li> This shaver is fast but it doesn&#x27;t get under my nose properly.  The comb head is too big so I&#x27;m forced to use another trimmer which sort of defeats the purpose of having multiple settings.  Basically my upper lip is however close I decide to trim it and the rest of my face is another length.  So annoying when my my hairs below my nose stick out further than the rest.</li>
    <li> Battery will not charger properly. Plan on returning</li>
    <li> My review, will only echo the many positive reviews you probably already read. Seriously, the best face/stubble trimmer out there. At .4mm It looks like I just shaved this morning. THe perfect 5-c-clock shadow look. Definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> The SAME unit, under the BaByliss brand has selectable settings 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8, 3.0 mm. The Conair branded i-Stubble is only selectable to 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 millimeters. Terrible, even though it looks the same... don&#x27;t be fooled by the lower price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and it works great.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> Ignore all the stupid reviews that say you can&#x27;t get under your nose, or the battery life sucks, etc. Follow the directions and this little machine is awesome. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> The best trimmer if your want a quick and uniform stubble trim. Other cheaper trimmers cannot give the consistent envy that this trimmer delivers.</li>
    <li> Very best Quality and customer Service</li>
    <li> This is my second one, the first lasted for about 3-4 years before the batteries started going south. It uses 2x 600mAh NiMH batteries so I don&#x27;t consider it unreasonable after years and hundreds of charge/discharge cycles, the blades also become dull so replacing it every couple years should be expected.</li>
    <li> this is a fantastic product!  The level of control you get  with the different lengths is really nice and it does an awesome job.  Really nice for giving you the look you want!</li>
    <li> Great trimmer!  I wish I would have ordered it sooner.  The adjustment is very fine, and the blades cut through a very thick beard with no tugging or pulling.</li>
    <li> The digital length display and mechanized adjuster is awesome. This is the beard trimmer to get for anything under a full length.</li>
    <li> It does its job quite well. It has only one defect: it cannot be cleaned under the water. At least you can remove the blade and clean it separately.</li>
    <li> This is pretty amazing! I did not expect it to be when I got it and looked at it and was like &amp;#34;huh?!&amp;#34; And then I tried it! It&#x27;s a fantastic trimmer!!</li>
    <li> Great device. Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Took one star off because it does take a bit of an effort to get into close spaces (under the nose).</li>
    <li> Best beard trimmer I have ever owned!!!!! It is worth the price.......</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is a very good beer trimmer. I like to keep my beard short, almost none so using number 2 or 2.5 works out perfectly. You wont get a close shave if you use number 0... Note that this is only a trimmer, not a shaver</li>
    <li> Husband loves. He has a thick, fast growing beard. This is easy for him to use and handles the beard just fine.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my husband and he says he loves it.  He says it does all that he wants.</li>
    <li> Its a great machine and has a good battery life. For me it doesn&#x27;t trim my chin evenly so i have to go over a couple of times other than that i really like the amount of trim length it has and the nice deisign. It is not loud at all.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, but it bites your skin on certain pritave parts</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it !!</li>
    <li> This is exactly the trimmer I&#x27;ve been looking for for a long time. Cuts smoothly for short stubble looks. Highly recommend for anyone who wants a quality trimmer. All other ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past suck.</li>
