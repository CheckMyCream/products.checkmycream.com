<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got to try this product for free through Influenster for the purpose of my review and have been using it for a week now.  I have seen an improvement in my texture it does not feel brittle and dry anymore it is soft and manageable.  The scent is also a plus love it and would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> As a member of Influenster, I got to try this product for free...I guess I got what I paid for. The smell is very chemical-ly and it leaves your hair feeling like it got hairsprayed; almost sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is great, the sprayer is easy to use, and the product does come out evenly, but those are the only pros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel like it did much for my hair at all as far as protecting it or helping me to keep my curls straight after I used my flat iron. After using Vidal Sassoon shampoo &amp; conditioner and LOVING them, I really was expecting a better product in this. Back to the drawing board with this one, please!</li>
    <li> I like this! It doesn&#x27;t make that burning smell when you use it. Just wish it would help with frizz which is why it&#x27;s not a 5 star rating. It does make my hair nice and shiny!</li>
    <li> I received this in a VoxBox, and was excited to try it out. I&#x27;ve got medium-length curly hair, and usually use an expensive heat protect spray daily. It seemed to work even better than the brand I&#x27;d been sinking way more money into! My curls were shiny, the frizz was knocked-out, and it had a pleasant scent. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this in the future!</li>
    <li> I love this for a leave-in conditioner on my curly hair. I use it on washing day and let my curls do their thing. Then I use it on non-washing days to revive my curly bounce and keep my hair soft and shiny without being weighed down.</li>
    <li> Love how I used this to protect my color from the sun before going outdoors and also while using my flat iron! It can be used in so many ways, not to mention the great price and how easy it is to purchase!</li>
    <li> This product was so surprisingly good.  I&#x27;m so used to having damaged hair because I&#x27;m not willing to cut it very often as I love my length.  I don&#x27;t normally buy heat protection products because I&#x27;m so used to them not working.  BUT, THIS IS THE BUSINESS, PEOPLE!  It smells wonderful, slightly sweet but in no way overwhelming.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair and in fact, after using it 3 days ago, I still don&#x27;t want to wash my hair because the results are so perfect.  I have waist length hair and I spritzed about 10-12 sprays before blow-drying and then straightening.  RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> I really liked how this product worked on my very curly &amp; dry hair.  I applied it on wet hair prior to blow drying. It made my hair look shiny, felt soft, and made the process of blow drying a lot easier.</li>
    <li> Love this! I received this complimentary via Influenster to try out along with  shampoo and conditioner. I have thick, wavy hair that I usually air dry. I tried this on two different occasions, once on my air dried hair to straighten, and once on my wet hair to blow-dry. Worked great both ways! My hair felt soft, and the spray has a pleasant, not overpowering odor. Will use and recommend this product for sure!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product.  It smells great &amp;&amp; works great.  It&#x27;s a great budget friendly hair product.  It has done a great job at protecting my hair from daily flat ironing.  I&#x27;ve been very impressed with this product so far.  I did receive this product free for review, but the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I used this product along with the Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock shampoo and conditioner. I didn&#x27;t feel like the spray offered any added benefit for blow drying, and when I used it on dry hair before straightening it left my hair looking greasy and weighed down. I&#x27;ll happily go back to using my It&#x27;s a 10 leave-in conditioner. I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I just loved this heat protectant for my hair. I blow dry/ style my hair 2x week and have used several other brands and I have to say that this one works the best so far.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair less frizzy, soft and shiny, without the heaviness of its product nor oily if you use a little bit more than the usual.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product and would totally recommend to anyone to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;I tested the product at no cost, and this opinion it&#x27;s my own after testing it for a month or so.</li>
    <li> I received this from Influenster in a voxbox to test for free. Honestly, I&#x27;m torn on this product! I see a few pros and cons with the products. Although I liked the way my hair felt with the conditioner and shampoo I am unsure about this. I was excited to use and put it on my damp hair before blowdrying. I made sure to keep it light and towards the hair shaft &amp; not the root as to not get a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look....My first impression was the alcohol like hairspray smell. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell at all!I was hoping for a more perfumed/pleasant smell from the spray.  It had a light sticky feel to it and I found that after using it my hair seemed to have a light film on it... I guess I should have a film to protect my hair,  but I have used other products where I still felt like my hair flowed nicely and had a pleasant smell. On a positive note, my hair looks smooth and is easy to brush through without frizz. Assuming that the product actually did protect my hair from the heat than it performs well and leaves a great look! I just don&#x27;t like the feel of buildup on my hair ( I didn&#x27;t use a lot either). I will give this a middle of the road rating since there are both pros and cons! It is a great price point and some may like it better than I did as i dont straighten my hair i scrunch it with my natural wave.</li>
    <li> This is great product!</li>
    <li> This products your hair from heat styling.  I do not feel there is anything special about this product that makes it stand out from another heat protector.  This product works as expected and doesn&#x27;t weight down fine/thin hair after use.  I received a sample of this product to test and review, but my review of this product is my own.</li>
    <li> I like the scent of the product, and it makes my hair look nice and smooth. I use this as a light mist before flat ironing. To me, it seems more like a styling product than a heat protector, because it holds my hair in place to some degree. The only problem is that it makes my hair stiffer and rougher. I don&#x27;t love the texture. I was sent this product to test by Influenster (all opinions are my own), and though I will use it up, I am not sure I will buy it again. I prefer products that keep my hair feeling soft and natural.</li>
    <li> I love This product. Heat Protect &amp; Shine is a necessity in my blow drying routine. I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t like being blown dry, but when I add this to my hair prior to drying it the damage doesn&#x27;t seem so bad. it also helps make my hair so soft and shiny. I will be using this a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I was given this product to test for free. I don&#x27;t dry my hair a lot, but I tried this a few times over the weekend and I loved it. I&#x27;m always afraid of damaging my hair with the heat from the blow dryer and this prevents it from looking dried out. It also leaves my hair feeling shiny :)</li>
    <li> I received it from Influenster in a voxbox for testing and I really like the way it makes my hair smell, but I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s doing anything for my hair. I already use a leave in conditioning spray before I blow-dry, so I&#x27;m not sure that this is a necessary step.</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with the end result of the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Protect &amp; Shine.  It did give my hair that shiny look, but the smell of this product was less then desirable and had a strong smell of alcohol.  I received a complimentary bottle of this product via influenster for trial purposes.</li>
    <li> really love how this product works. I first used the VIdal Sassoon Moisture Lock shampoo and conditioner. I towel dried my hair then liberally sprayed my hair with this wonderful heat protecting spray. I blew most of the moisture from my hair then took a paddle brush and finished the smoothing. I cant say enough about this. I was impressed how silky and soft my hair was. It felt so soft and it managed the frizz I would&#x27;ve gotten with the rainy damp weather we&#x27;re having. Highly recommend this trio!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product. I have thick hair which tends to frizz and has a mind of it&#x27;s own so flat irons are my best friends! I see a few reviews stating it weighs hair down, leaves it filmy, or smells like alcohol. However, I did not find this at all. I&#x27;ve used many heat protecting products including shampoos, conditioners, sprays, and cremes. I found that this product really leaves your hair light and smelling great. The scent is a light scent. I&#x27;d suggest shaking the bottle up before use and maybe that will get rid of the &#x27;alcohol&#x27; smell others have experienced. I tend to have to wash my hair every other day or every day depending on products I use. I have not had to wash every day with this product and have really stayed with the typical every other day wash using this product. I even used it once when I washed and dried my hair and again the next day when I flat ironed it and still didn&#x27;t see an excess of oil or &#x27;film&#x27;. I like the way my hair feels when using this product. The directions state not to apply directly to the roots and I&#x27;ve followed that direction to a T. Perhaps others who are experiencing increased oil are applying to the roots?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I straighten my hair every day. I’ve found Heat &amp; Protect Spray to be excellent in helping to keep my hair from getting damaged from a flat iron. In addition to a flat iron, I’ve found it useful in spraying on hair before blow drying. It cuts down on my time spent blow drying my long hair but also helps stop my hair from getting frizzy during the process. I’ve found Vidal Sassoon Heat &amp; Protect Spray courtesy of Influenster VoxBox to be a good addition to my hair care routine.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my naturally curly hair!  As my hair is already dry, you want to add moisture to it, and this product does the trick! It smells really good too!!</li>
    <li> Received this product in my influenster box. Probably one of the few heat protect sprays that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel in my hair, or starts to burn off while drying and leaves a weird chemical smell, and I have tried many. The smell is floral and light. It is half oil in the bottle so you have to remember to shake it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up with silly straight hair for three days and I have long wavy thick hair. So mission accomplished.</li>
    <li> This sparay is amazing.  I have naturally curly hair and I often use a flat iron to straighten it.  My hair looked so damaged, dry, frizzy, and unhealthy.  I have tried other products in the past and they left my hair oily, and nasty.  The Vidal Sasson Heat Protect and Shine leaves my hair looking great.  It really helps protect my hair from the use of my hair dryer and flat iron.  I highly recommend this product and have told my friends who have also struggled to find a great product to use.</li>
    <li> Im really funny about heat protectant sprays. I have had some that mae my hair feel WORSE and that is a BIG NO NO... This stuff here not only protects from heat it also aids in making your hair look and feel great.. :) very glad to have received this item free from influenster for testing purposes</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find that this product gave me the shine I was looking for and it also made my hair a little sticky after use. I&#x27;m African American so I&#x27;m not quite sure this is the best product for my hair type.</li>
    <li> I used this before using  hot hair dryer and hot curling iron. It helped protect my hair and left it smoother and with no fly aways and my split ends were less obvious.</li>
    <li> I like this product for heat styling.  It&#x27;s not the most favorite one I&#x27;ve ever tired but it seems to do the job and it&#x27;s a fraction of the price that I&#x27;ve paid for other ones.  I do notice my hair feels/looks a bit greasy after using this product and I wish that weren&#x27;t the case.  I like the fragrance!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in Love with this product! My daughter models and acts so I have been looking for something to use that will protect her hair from all the Hot Irons that are used in her hair constantly. I washed my daughter hair and sprayed it on her hair before using the blow dryer, than I applied it again before using the curling irons. The shine it gives her hair is awesome with her big gigantic curls. There is no sticky film that other products leave behind and no strong fumes that may cause breathing problems. It has a very great smell of fresh flowers. I test the product at no cost, but all my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I recently tried the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Protect and Shine and was very happy with the results. It was able to provide protection when I flat ironed my hair and also had left my hair with a nice glossy shine. It has a nice sent that I got complements on my perfume, but I wasn&#x27;t wearing any! It was the Protect and Shine. I was also able to try the Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner in the Pro Series also added to my softness and shine. I was able to try these at no cost but the opinions expressed are exclusively my own.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product and I thought it smelled great! I did not find the product overwhelming in any way. Some said it left their hair oily and I have oily hair, even though I get the frizzies on the ends, and I did not notice this. I used the product when my hair was towel dried and air dried for a few minutes. I would then spray it on and sometimes use a few velcro rollers before blow drying or sometimes I skip the rollers and just blow dry. It left my hair feeling soft, looking shiny and without the waxy feel I get with so many of these products. I was fortunate enough to get a free sample from @Influenster, but these are my own honest opinions.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and it really works! I used only this to straighten my naturally wavy (and stubborn) hair and it worked so well that my hair still looked good the next day. I would recommend this to anyone that heat styles their hair. Mine was so soft and shiny, but not at all sticky or greasy. I&#x27;m so glad that I got the chance to test this product at no cost to me. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received this spray from influenster to test, and I fell in love with it not only because its a heat protector but because it shines and also conditions and it helps to rapair your hair. I didn&#x27;t want to spray it to flat iron my hair I challenge it with my wet curls. What I did was washed my hair put in my original products for my curls then I spray some of this, the smell was amazing then I infused my hair with my infuser on the hair dryer and I can say it passed the challenge, my curls were bouncy and it shine very well. I tested the product at know cost, and all the opinions are my own</li>
    <li> i love this product. i use it after the vidal sassoon moisture lock shampoo and conditioner. it doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or feel gross. and it smells great. love it</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair and have a difficult time finding products that leave my hair the way that I like. I sprayed some in my hair after I towel dried it before blow drying. Once it dried I sectioned my hair off and sprayed it on my dry hair before I used my flat iron. It smells really nice . It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling super oily. I think if you have wavy hair this product will be wonderful for you. Super curly hair, its ok... not my personal favorite but I have tried worst.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product, but it left my hair feeling sticky and gave it an odd texture. I used it before blow drying my hair and just wasn&#x27;t impressed. Also, the smell isn&#x27;t my favorite - it&#x27;s a tad on the chemical side for me.</li>
    <li> I straighten my hair regularly and am a stickler when it comes to a good product that will actually protect and give my hair that straight look that I love when I leave the salon. I took my time with this product on dry hair. I sectioned off parts of my hair, took small sections and coated it with this product. Then, I flat ironed that sectioned. There was a lot of &amp;#34;sizzle&amp;#34;, but I felt that it was protecting my hair. It took a long time to do my hair in this fashion, but that&#x27;s how they do it at the salon for good results. When all was said and done, my hair was super sleek. My ends weren&#x27;t as smooth as I would like (but I am also due for a trim, so that could have been part of it.....). The smell wasn&#x27;t fantastic.....reminded me a lot of &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; level hair products. But I use other products on my hair that made up for the lack of an enticing smell.</li>
    <li> This is a great Heat &amp; Protect Spray. I received it free along with Moisture Lock Shampoo and Conditioner! This doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking heavy and it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. It also smells great and adds a bit of a shine to my hair as well!  The opinions on this product are my own!</li>
    <li> I have been using this heat protecting spray for a couple of weeks because I got the chance to test it free of cost to me but either way my honest opinion is that this is a vey nice product and I have been pleasantly surprised. I spray it on after I wash my hair and it is still damp before blow drying my hair and use it as well when I use any hot styling tools. This product make my hair feel manageable, protected and shiny with out it being heavy. I would purchase it when I run out.</li>
    <li> My hair is like the ombre color-style, except my outer bottom layer isn&#x27;t colored...it&#x27;s dull, crisp, and frizzy! Sometimes I feel like I am in the movie &amp;#34;Groundhog Day&amp;#34; because I spend so much time in the hair care aisles and searching for remedies online. Most days my hairstyle is the &amp;#34;pulled up in a clip and messy&amp;#34; look. I cringe when I have to style with heat. Even having to blow dry it gives me anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;...But that was then, because recently I was given the opportunity to try Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Pro Series Heat Protect &amp; Shine Spray.&lt;br /&gt;WOW!!! Hallelujah, WOW!!&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed the product on my damp hair before blow drying and it helps calm the frizz. The most significant difference was when I used the product on my dry hair and then my heating irons. My hair had a silky shine and even the coloring in my highlights was enhanced.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend starting with light spritzes and then increase as needed to attain your desired look. I sectioned my hair to test different amounts and my blonde hair reacted better in look and texture by using it lightly.&lt;br /&gt;Please note: I received Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Heat Protect &amp; Shine at no cost and all opinions are completely and fully my own.</li>
    <li> Use this before flat ironing my natural kinky curly hair and I&#x27;m in love with the results. Other hair protective sprays have left my hair sticky but this does not! It&#x27;s very mild but gets the job done. I have no heat damage which is a PLUS. Love this! (I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own)</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It works just as well as more expensive versions of heat protection spray. The only drawback is the smell, very sweet and overpowering. This thankfully disperses when dry. Highly recommended! This product was provided to me at no cost but all opinions expressed are my own</li>
    <li> Definitely the best heat protection spray I&#x27;ve ever used! Silky smooth hair without leaving hair oily! It smells great too! Which I love!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this from Influenster to review at no charge, but the opinion is my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have curly hair, so I let my hair air dry to protect and seal in the curls.  However, I like to switch things up every now and then and straighten my hair using a flat iron.  Heat can be extremely damaging to hair, and I&#x27;m growing my hair long, so I don&#x27;t want to damage it or slow growth.  So, I always use something to protect my hair as I straighten it.  The Heat Protect &amp; Shine Spray works great!  My hair wasn&#x27;t left sticky.  It smoothed out any flyaways and protected my hair while I was ironing it.  The smell is pretty mild, so I really don&#x27;t notice it much at all.  Great product that I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Whenever I blow dry my natural hair, I use a heat protectant to ward off any damage to my delicate tresses but I have to say that I wasn&#x27;t in love with this product. The pump makes it easy to apply but the Heat Protect &amp; Shine Spray left my hair feeling sticky. When I was done, I wanted to give my hair a thorough brushing to remove the build up. It seems to have a very high alcohol content and I didn&#x27;t notice that my hair was particularly shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample of this product for review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, coarse, wavy hair that I flat iron at least several times a week. The product looks neat in the bottle, because it is two separate parts/colors that mix together when shaken. Unfortunately though, that means that you have to shake it before each spray. When I straighten my lion&#x27;s mane I have to section it off, shake the product vigorously to combine, spray each section individually, and then run the flat iron over it. Repeat, repeat, repeat, etc. That means that it adds a lot of time to an already time-consuming process. It smells like hair spray, which was to be expected. Not bad, but not particularly pleasant, either. However, it didn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff, sticky, or with a noticeable residue like some sprays do, which was a positive. I&#x27;m not sure how well it protected my hair from the heat of the flat iron, because there&#x27;s really no way to tell. This product might work well for someone with a different hair type or different styling routine, but unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. Full disclosure: I was sent a sample of this product to test free of charge, however the opinions in this review are strictly my own.</li>
    <li> I got this from Influenster to test, but my opinions are my own.  I loved this spray.  It smells nice and it left the hair shiny and looking gorgeous.</li>
    <li> I love love love the Vidal Sassoon Heat Protect and Shine Spray! I love the way it smells, and it makes my hair SO soft. Plus its a good price for the huge bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Heat and Protect Spray for about a month.  My hair is natural, but i do use a blow dryer to blow it out.  I usually use the hot setting and this spray works great for me.  I don&#x27;t use a ton of it, so I&#x27;m not having issues with my hair being sticky or heavy.  I usually apply after washing and conditioning.  I really like the outcome and I would recommend it.  I did receive this product test out at no cost to myself.  My opinions are solely based on my own personal experience while using this product.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. It worked great in both my daughters (8yr old) hair and mine. I used it to add a bit of shine as well as a heat protectant. I liked the scent but thought it was a bit strong. I did receive this from a vox box from influenster. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bazillion different heat &amp; protect sprays over the years, but this one is quickly becoming my favorite. As far as I can tell, it works to protect hair from heat damage, and it also gives a silky shine that I love. It tames my frizz and smooths my hair, and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling heavy or full of residue/product. I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> I got this product in a full size free from influenster and I must say I fell in love. Not only does it protect my hair from the brutal heated styling products I use on a daily basis, but it also adds some volume to my flat fine hair. Smells great and is easy to use. I liked it so much I bought more and have added it to my hair routine.</li>
    <li> I will be using this product forever!&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it protect my hair when I straighten it, I feel like it helps dry my hair faster...and I have thick hair!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite heat protectant.  Leaves my hair silky, smooth, and shiny.  Does not leave my hair feeling heavy or weighed down. I was sent this product to test at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This product leftyy hair feeling sticky and weighed down. This product is full of alcohol, which dried my hair out! I had to completely re-wash my hair! This product is not good for my hair type!</li>
    <li> My hair takes a beating with coloring, blow dry, and using hot curlers. This stuff puts a little love back into my hair making it shiny, silky, soft, and still giving it body</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product and I was reluctant to use it because I&#x27;m so used to having to spend a lot on heat protection spray. But I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and my hair looks great! It&#x27;s shinier, healthier, and there&#x27;s no breakage. I will definitely buy more of this product as it&#x27;s just as good as the salon products.</li>
    <li> Great product! Tried this recently and it really helps. I blow dry and straighten my hair so it&#x27;s great to have a product that protects it from some of that damage. This product was tested at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> for the price, this is a great heat protectant</li>
    <li> it made my hair easier to style, and shinier, I love this product, I feel my hair is better sense I have used this product, and I dont need as much heat to style my hair as I usually do, big thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for quite a while now. I have very thin hair doesnt weigh it down. and leaves my hair really soft. When I go to the store its always sold out. Thats why I bought it on amazon. Really recommend :)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like this provided any protection for my hair. It left my hair crunch and straw like after I straightened. The next day I had massive tangles and my hair just felt tacky and stiff. I also tried this on my daughters hair when she wanted princess curling hair (she is 4) and her hair felt awful and straw like too. I think I will stick with an oil, not alcohol, based heat protectant. And I would no advise purchasing this even though it&#x27;s cheap, for a few dollars more you can get something that works. I currently use one and only Argan oil spray treatment which I find works a lot better on my hair! The treseme hear protectant works okay too.</li>
    <li> I thought this spray was good.  I&#x27;ve used heat protect products before that were both better and worse.  This left my hair shiny and silky, but a tad bit sticky.  I have very long hair, so I used about 4 pumps and kept it away from my roots.  I&#x27;ll keep using what&#x27;s left since it&#x27;s good for my hair to be protect  from heat styling and it smells nice!&lt;br /&gt;*I tested this product at no cost and all of these opinions are original and mine.</li>
    <li> I had not used this product before I received it from influenster for testing purposes, and I had not put any heat on my hair to straighten it for almost a year. I decided I wanted to go straight for a little bit, so I decided to use this product to see what it was about and if it was a good product. I have to honestly say that it did its job and protected my hair from damage of using my Chi. I have already recommended this product to numerous friends who straighten their hair. I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> Between using the Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock Shampoo and conditioner and then using the Vidal Sassoon Heat &amp; Protect hair spray my hair is looking better than ever. I color my hair and straighten it often so its pretty damaged, but since I have started using these 3 products its looking so much healthier and I have never gotten so many compliments on it! I did get this product for free to test out and I&#x27;m so happy I did, I will be buying more of it.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s important to use a heat protection product when using heat on my hair so I was excited to try this heat protection and shine spray. I must say I didn&#x27;t test this using a flat iron that was higher than 400 so my review is only up to 400. I used this product to flat iron my entire head and I have a lot of hair.  I do like that the product isn&#x27;t sticky so when I used it to flat iron my hair I didn&#x27;t end up with crunchy hair.  It does have alcohol in it but after that wears off when you are spraying this product has a nice pleasant scent. Not sure how much extra shine I got but the important feature for me is protecting my hair which it did. Overall I think its a nice product although I am not sure how well it will do at higher temps. I received a complimentary sample in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Really liked the scent of the Heat Protect &amp; Shine Spray!  It sprays on easily, and my hair felt very manageable-not sticky or stiff like some sprays.  The shine on my hair was great!  I&#x27;ll continue to use this product.  I received a sample at no cost, but this is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Great coverage and protecting so far!!</li>
    <li> I originally bought it to protect my hair when I am ironing or curling it, but as it turns out it is a great product to be used when the hair is still damp for frizz control and overall better style (if of course, you let it dry by itself like I do). It also enhances my natural curls, which is promised by many products and rarely delivered.</li>
    <li> I received a complementary sample from influesnter to test this product. I will buy! Great for customers on a budget. My hair was shiny and smelt wonderful and knowing it was heat protected made it 100% better</li>
    <li> Awesome product works great</li>
    <li> I liked it! It made my hair soft and smooth.  It also had a very light, clean fragrance.  Some reviews claimed they smelled alcohol but I didn&#x27;t.  I shook the bottle as I would with any product so maybe that made all the difference? Now, because it has alcohol in it, this is not something I will be using all the time and I didn&#x27;t fall head over heels so won&#x27;t be buying once I run out.  But it is an affordable option for you to think about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for shine, maybe that happens with continued use, as I didn&#x27;t look like I was walking down the runway with a halo around my head after one.  I liked that it didn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzier nor leave any build up as that has happened with some products.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I partially blow dry my hair and then blow dry individual sections and wrap them around a velcro roller before I apply my makeup.  When I am done my hair is full of volume and donezo and I could definitely tell that it was smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I received this spray complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I didn&#x27;t think this product worked as well as I thought it would. You spray it on dry hair before using heat utensils but it smells like strong hair spray so the scent was overwhelming. I didnt think it protected my hair or made it shine. It id seem to give a light hold.  The spray also has a sticky feel to it, I&#x27;m not a fan of that. It felt like it did leave a build up on my hair and I like a clean nonfrizzy feel afterwards so I gave it three stars. I could brush through it and it did give a light hold but my hair is pretty thin so maybe that factored in.</li>
    <li> I love this Heat and Protect Spray.  Often other sprays act more like hair spray and my hair becomes crunchy after using.  That was not the case with this one.  I loved it! It smelled good and felt wonderful in my hair. I tried this product at no cost to me and the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It leaves my hair smelling great, feeling smooth and very soft! I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like to curl my hair using the curling wand. This spray is perfect for that. it leaves my hair smooth and protects it from the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I really like this Heat  Protective Spray from Vidal Sassoon. Not only does it smell divine but it works really well too. I have noticed my hair feeling really good after I use it with my heated curling brush. I have used similar products and this product works just as well but without the high cost. I would definitely recommend this product to use to protect your hair from the daily heat exposure.</li>
    <li> This works well for both heated products and air-drying...I tried it both ways. It&#x27;s listed as a light conditioner, protectant and shine enhancer, and it works great on all counts. Even on my fine hair, it wasn&#x27;t heavy, but you do have to have a light hand when applying it. Speaking of hands, that was the only negative I report...your hands get a bit sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With heat products, I didn&#x27;t get the staticky crackle feeling I usually do with my blow dryer and hot rollers, and it stayed smooth ad sleek even through kid watching. Air-drying, I did have to brush it out after it was dry, because it was a little stiff, but in the end, same great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received products from Influenster for testing and review purposes. My opinions and sticky fingers are my own.</li>
    <li> It was the worst thing I have ever put in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It was like spraying hair spray on my hair. I could not brush through my hair while blow drying. it broke my hair off. I had to stop and rewash my hair to get it out before I could blow dry.</li>
    <li> i love it, i got mine 5 days earlier then expected! Thank You!!!!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this, but it made my hair feel stiff and gross. I don&#x27;t recommend at all!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It does not leave my hair greasy looking, after I use my straightner on it ,like most other products I have tried.  It smells great.  Its not sticky like other products.  It leaves a nice shine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always in search of new producta to help protect my hair from all the torture I put it through. I used this product after I washed my hair while my hair was still damp. I combed through and blow dried it. After that I sprayed a little more before I flat ironed it. It has a great freash scent. My hair felt soft after I applied this. It didn&#x27;t feel sticky or still like I thought it would. I will continue to use this until its gone.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Not only does it smell GREAT, but it also protects against heat damage, smoothes, AND adds shine to my hair! I will say that it is important to read the application instructions and follow them. By this, I mean hold the bottle 6-8 inches from head and spray on the middle of the hair shaft and the ends, not on the roots. Overall, I really like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of this from influenster and glad i did! When used alone it does wonders for my hair. Love the way it makes my hair smell and feel but most of all how it protects from the heat. I use a straightener on my hair and i have noticed a little bit of damage. since using this protective spray i am seeing a big difference. No frizzed or burned ends anymore. just smooth and silky hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product, leaves my hair protected, less frizzy and smells great!!</li>
    <li> I have color treated hair and this is a product I use often. I have never used Vidal Sassoon before. I have tried a lot of more expensive brands. It does what it is supposed to do and it has a nice fragrance. I did not get an alcohol fragrance. Some of the more expensive brands may protect your hair better if you flat iron regularly, but if you are just an occasional user, this will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was very shiny and smooth and it looked very nice. Again, you generally don&#x27;t see results like this in a lower priced brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It probably isn&#x27;t something I will use all the time, but I would highly recommend it for occasional use at this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I recently tried the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Heat Protect &amp; Shine Spray as a gift from Voxbox. Im not used to so much fragrence and I dont usually put heat on my hair because it comes out looking fried...The scent is not great. Otherwise, I sprayed my dried hair in sections and used it to curl my hair for a ball and it turned out beautifully, silky and shiny. I was super impressed.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from Influenster for review purposes, and it was okay...I don&#x27;t always use heat protection spray, even though I should.  I agree with the other reviewers though - it definitely smells like hair spray.  I can&#x27;t stand the smell.  That being said,  I have super thin and color treated hair and it didn&#x27;t leave a film or make it look greasy at all.  It was shiny and smooth.  Today it was raining all day, and my hair stayed pretty smooth, so I gave it an extra star for that.  I&#x27;ve paid a lot for much worse products.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it just because of the smell.  If there was an unscented version, I&#x27;d buy that.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t like these type of sprays because they tend to be heavy and make the hair feel not smooth. This one stepped up to the challenge. It is light and my hair still felt soft after using it. That was a nice surprise because I have been disappointed with similar sprays.  I am hoping that with the use of this spray, my hair will be protected from my daily routine which includes drying and straightening the hair. I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Great product, but the smell was over powering.  It reminded me of cheap hairspray.  I did like how it worked with my hair though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did test the product at not cost to me, but my opinions are completely my own.</li>
    <li> It makes the ends of my hair feel smooth and silky but when you spray it on the roots it makes my hair VERY greasy!!! It weighs my hair down at my scalp. I don&#x27;t think i would buy this product again! I tested this product at no cost to me and this is just my opinion.</li>
    <li> This spray is great! I use on my colored hair to protect when heat styling - it also makes a great detangler on dry hair. I don&#x27;t find this spray greasy or oily on my hair like some other brands of shine spray, plus there is an added bonus of thermal protection. The reasonable price makes this product a great value - I think it works as well as some more expensive sprays. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair... this is a good buy. i was the lucky recipient of a trial pack of VS products  from Influenster to try and this is my favorite!</li>
    <li> I have tried several similar products including professional products and they were heavy and left my thin, fine hair oily looking. This product goes on light and adds shine without looking oily or greasy. I would highly recommend trying this product!</li>
    <li> This was an awesome product. I was surprised that it straightened my hair so quickly and that it stayed straight for quite a while. I would definitely recommend this profits l product to natural hair woman that need to straighten their hair to have it trimmed. I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> I like this spray, but it&#x27;s not my favorite. It smells similar to hairspray, which isn&#x27;t a smell I love. It does help protect my color treated, keratin treated hair though, but there are definitely better products out there.  Make sure you don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will land up greasy. I did test this product out at no cost and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> love, love,  love the softness and shine this spray provides for my curly hair! I use it also as a refresher spray later in the day or even the next day! The scent is great, - light and fresh!</li>
    <li> I got this awesome product as part of a voxbox. I was excited to try something new for when I style my hair. Every since moving to NJ I am battling frizz galore. This spray helps me since I have to take my hair more than ever with a flat iron. The product smells good and it definitely does it&#x27;s job. I think it makes my hair a little heavier than other products so I feel as though I have to wash my hair more often. I&#x27;m on the fence because there are other products that I love that do the same job but I don&#x27;t hate this product either. I&#x27;ll keep using it and see what I think!    I tested the product at no cost but the review is all my own.</li>
    <li> I use a wet/dry hair straightener so my hair needs extra protection from damage. I tried the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Heat Protect &amp; Shine Spray and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I used it with damp hair and a straightener, no blow dryer. I made sure not to spray my roots. I found that my hair remained soft and silky even after being straightened. I didn&#x27;t have the stiffness that sometimes happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product to test through Influenster, but the opinions expressed are entirely my own.</li>
    <li> I loved this spray. It smells great. it left my hair shiny, frizz free, and static free. My hair didn&#x27;t feel weighed down or greasy like other products have felt. I would absolutely recommend this product and will continue to use it myself.</li>
    <li> Great product! gives light weight conditioning and shine while protecting from heat damage. I love the way it smells and the great frizz control it gives. I tested this product at no cost but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product! I have never used Vidal Sassoon befor and I got to try the Pro Heat. It really helps my hair out a lot. I have wavy hair and at times I do like to straighten my hair with the blow dryer when wet or the flat iron when dry. When I used the Pro Series spray It left a really nice shine in my hair when used in wet and dry hair. It also took away the frizz when out in damp air. It also helps keep the volume in my hair. When you spray it in your hair its not sticky and you are able to toss your hair as you wish. I am so excited that I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I gave this a try when I received a complimentary sample from Influenster. I was a little skeptical because I have baby fine hair that tends to be on the oily side. I have tried several similar products in the past and wound up a greasy mess. This smells fantastic and works well. I blow dry my hair and use some form of a styler (rollers, flat iron, etc.) 3-4 times weekly. It almost seems to work double duty as a detangler/leave in conditioner. Regardless, definitely something I would consider actually purchasing and something that I would recommend for anyone who has thin or fine hair.</li>
    <li> I received this from Influenster for review purposes.  I used it in my damp hair before blow drying.  First of all, some people have been complaining about the alcohol smell, but I only could smell a faint alcohol smell for a few seconds.  After blow drying, my hair was soft and shiny. I also didn&#x27;t notice and film or buildup from this product.  I will continue to use it before blow drying and using a curling iron.</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I have short curly hair that has been &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; due to processing. My hair is very brittle and tends to go its own way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Shampoo and Conditioner along with VS Repair spray for the last 3 days. I will say my hair feels very good and not as &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; as it did Saturday when I got my samples from Influenster&lt;br /&gt;I will go see how the pricing compares to other items, my current shampoo is not for moisture and I believe the repair and treatment with moisture shampoo and conditioner is going to be great.</li>
    <li> Normally,  when I use other products that claim to be a heat protector , and gives you shine? I almost never believe that.  The reason why is because I end up with greasy and/or crunchy hair. However,  this heat protector has just the right texture, when shaken to give you both. I love it and I recommend it 100 %.</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon Heat &amp; Protect Spray is a good value for the price. It made my hair shiny and sleek when I straightened it, and my hair stayed straight all day when using the product. It even stayed straight on a rainy day, when my hair usually gets frizzy. I really liked the product.</li>
    <li> I used this product today and was happy with the results. The shine was amazing! Not too strong of a smell and long lasting moisturizing feel on my hair without feeling oily. I get my hair done professionally and have spent hundreds on products at the salon that did not make my hair feel this great. The price is nice too :)</li>
    <li> I have tried several heat protectant sprays, but love how this Heat Protect Shine Spray from Vidal Sassoon works on my color-treated hair!  I barely use any to spray on the ends of my hair before I flat iron, or curl my hair.  I love that it makes my hair look shiny, and I save a step from having to add oil to the ends of my hair also!  I was excited to receive this from Influenster to try complimentary, and that I choose freely to give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Liked the smell, but that tends to be down to personal preference... I felt this product protected my hair when blow drying, but really noticed the shine was kicked up a notch when I used my flat iron. I also like that it didn&#x27;t leave any strange tacky film in my hair.    I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this product. I have a comparable product from Redkin and this one worked just as well for a lot less. I blow dry and/or heat style my hair daily. It leaves my hair fresh and not oily or greasy, just soft and shiny. I was happy it did not decrease the time between shampoos, as some products can cause your hair to be really greasy. I will definitely consider this product in the future.  I was sent this product to test in an Influenster Vox Box, and asked only to honestly review it.</li>
    <li> I love anything that makes my hair stay protected from heat the sun the environment and so much more so use this stuff and use it wisely it makes a huge difference to dry damaged hair fine thick curly wavy anything just protect you locks ladies! Vidal Sasson heat protect and shine is simply the greatest ever!</li>
    <li> I love this product and I love the fact that I got this product for free from influenster. I use this everytime I do my hair I absoutely love it. I would recommend this to everyone. It makes my hair feel really soft and usually when I use stuff like this my hair is always greasy well this stuff never makes my hair greasy I love it. All my friends know about these products and they went out and bought most of them.</li>
    <li> Not bad. I don&#x27;t use this type of product often but I have wanted a bit more shine to my hair so gave it a go when I received it as part of a VoxBox from Influenster for testing. And I liked it overall. It was easy to use and smelled nice. I don&#x27;t curl or straighten my hair so used it with just blow drying and in the end it gave a nice shine and left my hair feeling pretty good. I really couldn&#x27;t tell I had any sort of extra product in it which was nice.</li>
    <li> When I was in college, I used a similar product from Jhermack. It also had the purple and pink color scheme! I was so bummed when they stopped making it. Imagine my surprise when I got this! This works almost like that product and was GREAT for blowdrying or flat ironing your hair. My hair was left nice and soft, no frizz, no dryness. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not madly in love with this product, but it does get the job done. It has a light, clean scent that I liked. I didn&#x27;t noticed the alcohol smell that many other people mentioned. I felt a slight film on my hair after using my flat iron but nothing too noticeable. I think for the price, this is a decent product. However, this probably won&#x27;t be one that I purchase again for myself. Great price- but like many things, you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I received a free bottle from Influenster to try. This spray smelled really good, but I was really disappointed. It left my hair feeling sticky and unmanageable. After using it I couldn&#x27;t get my hair flat with my flat iron and my hair looked like a mess all day. I would NOT recommend​ this product to anyone. I&#x27;m not sure if it protects your hair or not, but I know it won&#x27;t make your hair look good. :(</li>
    <li> Love, love this product.  I use every time I use my flat iron,  blow dryer or curling iron. I leaves my hair shiny!</li>
    <li> I really like this spray! I don&#x27;t always use a hairdryer, but this really helps keep my frizzy hair tame! I like how it lightly conditions my hair. But, what I like the most is the smell! it has such a great smell that I found myself smelling my hair all day! lol</li>
    <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.I already had a heat styling spray that I was a big fan of, but wanted to give this product a fair shot. I used this both when my hair was wet, before blow drying, and then on a different occasion when my hair was dry, before flat ironing. Both times, I felt like my hair was much smoother and shinier after heat styling, and it didn&#x27;t feel oily to the touch like some products leave my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very long and I was nervous that I would need to spray a lot of the product on to properly protect it, but I didn&#x27;t. One light spritz per strand when flat-ironing was good, and it didn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy or flat when I was done styling.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this spray. I can definitely say I&#x27;ll purchase it again in the future.</li>
    <li> I am liking this product, I do not often dry my hair or use product but this did really improve the shine and help keep my hair from getting dry when I do blow dry. I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own and when it runs out I think I will get more. It gives my hair a nice weight and less fly aways.</li>
    <li> This heat and protect spray did exactly what it said. I found my hair shinier and healthier after extensive heat styling with my curling iron and hair dryer. The spray is weightless and it has a great scent. I was very impressed with how it worked for me (I was skeptical at first.) I was provided this spray at no cost, but the opinions are all my own.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time on dry hair before I straightened it. When spraying it on, I noticed that it felt more like hair spray going on. After straightening my hair it felt like a residue of some sort was left on my hair. I didn&#x27;t love the product but will try it on wet hair before blow drying and see if I might like it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product at no cost through Influenster, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and silky even after drying and straightening!  Keeps frizz down for the whole day even in the humid south.  So glad I found this!</li>
    <li> I actually like this product.  I think the smell is amazing, but you do have to make sure you shake it up first.  I have used this when letting my hair hair dry and it kept the frizz away.  I also used it after blow drying and before using a flat iron.  As of now, I can&#x27;t say how much it&#x27;s protecting my hair, but it definitely helps with the frizz, keeps my hair shiny and smelling good!  I also noticed a few of the reviews mentioned build up on their hair from this product - That hasn&#x27;t been the case for me.  It has fit nicely into my hair routine!</li>
    <li> This spray is amazing! I love the shine it give my hair and it also leaves a wonderful scent in my hair. This spray has an added bonus and works as a detangling spray too. It gives my hair a nice hold with being greasy or heavy feeling in my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very low maintenance with my hair so I&#x27;m used to just grabbing my hairspray, spraying a bit then on my way I go. The 1st few times I used this I kept forgetting to shake it &amp; you HAVE TO! You can actually see where the ingredients separate if you don&#x27;t, and you&#x27;re not going to get the full effectiveness of it if you don&#x27;t shake it up before use.  It was a good, fine mist and has a nice scent that isn&#x27;t too strong nor chemically scented.  I don&#x27;t feel like it helped much against damage as it reacted the same as any other hair spray product I&#x27;ve used then followed with a ceramic flat iron. Still got damage and felt more damaged if sprayed 1st then flat ironed.  Sticking to ironing THEN using the product.</li>
    <li> I used this after using the shampoo and conditioner.  I loved how it worked on my hair.  It added volume to my hair and a nice bounce.  This product did not make my hair feel oily or filmy.  I applied before blow drying my hair and then after at the base before I used my flatiron and curling iron.  My hair maintained it shape yet was not stiff.  I could run my fingers through it.  I received this as a free trial and I was not sure about trying.  This is my experience, and I am actually switching my products from the another brand.  I would suggest giving this a shot, especially if you want volume in your hair with out the stiffness.</li>
    <li> HairSaver!! Yes a true hair saver. I have very (VERY) thick long hair and it&#x27;s somewhat curly. I like to blow dry it then either use a straight iron for straight hair or hot rollers for soft curls. Blow drying takes a lot of time so I know it&#x27;s hard on my hair. Vidal Sassoon Heat Protect &amp; Shine spray had done just what it says - it has protected my hair and added great shine. After using for a month I see no signs of heat damage from my styling habits - something I would see when not using it. In fact, my hair feels softer and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are completely my own.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this spray!  Normally I shy away from most products so I don&#x27;t get oily hair but this stuff is amazing!! I blow dry my hair daily and before I started using this I noticed the damage from all that heat, now with this product I notice a huge difference.  My hair looks so smooth and shiny without that greasy/oily look.  And as an added bonus I love the smell of this product.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who uses heat on their hair daily, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I recently started using Vidal Sassoon Heat protect spray. I have long thick curly hair which can take some time to dry. I have used other products but they have not work as well.Now I did received this product from Influenster to try out. And I felt that it did have a plesant smell to it. I notice after using this product for a few days that my hair felt softer and more managable. After a month of use there has been no sign of any additional heat damage.</li>
    <li> Love it love it. It keeps your hair curled even if you just wash it spray on and go.</li>
    <li> I used the product on my hair to protect it from heat damage. I used it both when I was blow drying my hair with heated air and while straightening my hair with a flat iron. The product did seem to protect my hair from heat and left it with a shiny finish. The smell is just of product but I wish it would have been scented better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get a free sample to try this out, but these opinions are my own, and I would buy this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have oily hair near my scalp and my ends are so dry.  I have to wash my hair daily which means I have to blow dry it!  I love that this product doesn&#x27;t leave any residue in my hair.  It also leave my ends so smooth and shiny!  In the past month of using it, I feel that my end aren&#x27;t as damaged as they normally have before! I did receive this product for testing. This is my own opinion of the product.</li>
    <li> It is pretty much hairspray, which holds what ever you did to your hair in place witch is good. Here is the catch, the it doesn&#x27;t work as heat protectant  and it smells like alcohol.</li>
    <li> I have been using expensive heat protectant sprays for quite awhile and after using this product I realize I can spend half the price and get much better results.  I didn&#x27;t detect any harsh smell at all and this spray leaves my abundant amount of natural curly/frizzy hair soft and definitely less frizzy. I think my hair looks shinier and there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;crispiness&amp;#34; after its use.  I just use a blow dryer....no other tools.... and I am delighted with this product and have already ordered another.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is absolutely great!  Smells good, feels great on my hair, leaves it shiny and feeling wonderful.  I highly recommend this product to everyone.  \\&quot;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I received this in a #influenstervoxbox complimentary....and this is an awesome hair product.. The scent is so lovely, &amp; long lasting.. The Shine is beautiful!!!&lt;br /&gt;You should def try it!!&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad price on here either!!!</li>
    <li> The first ingredient in this product is alcohol and it smells more like hair spray than a heat protect spray. Alcohol plus extreme heat from styling tools will not protect your hair but damage it.</li>
    <li> Look no further, this is it!! Looking for a great product to use for shine, and heat protection from all the abuse your hair suffers? Well, this spray is incredible! Not only does it smells great, but it gives my hair much needed smoothness and shine, and doesn&#x27;t cost as much as those salon brands.  I use it daily with my blow dryer and hot iron, and overall my hair  was very shiny, soft, and smelled fantastic! Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Some alcohol fragrance at first - but it dissipates quickly when dries. Awesome fragrance - fruity, floral scent.&lt;br /&gt;Feel: Used abundantly on my thick hair and SURPRISE there was absolutely no grease or residue after blow out.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Fantastic value. I definitely recommend this VS product, especially for people wanting that fabulous hair but are on a budget. Same great protection as high priced salon products, but at a more reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick and a little curly. That&#x27;s why I straighten it a lot. The Heat protection spray from VS works great for me! I don&#x27;t see any damaging, and it makes me feel a little safer while using the flat iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel soft and smells good and best of all of got to try it free from influenster. Tamed the frizz well but didn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
    <li> This product was great for my curly, thick, color treated hair. It kept it soft and manageable but definitely protected it from the heat of my flat iron. Will definitely keep using it!</li>
    <li> Made my ends super dry!!  I was really hoping to find a great lower priced heat protectant spray, but this is not it.  Used it the first time on one day dirty hair before using my flat iron to freshen up my straight hair.  It made my hair look and feel super dry and like I had a ton of split ends.  Gave it one more chance after shampooing and conditioning using the Vidal Sassoon moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.  Same results.&lt;br /&gt;Only plus was the scent was decent.</li>
    <li> I received this as part of a Voxbox by Influenster.  Since I don&#x27;t use a flat-iron or curling iron, I had never thought to use a heat protector spray before.  I DO, however, use a blow-dryer on my hair each day, so I thought I would try this product in conjunction with drying my hair.  I have tried various shine sprays in the past and have felt that they made my hair appear too shiny / oily and too weighed down.  VS heat protect &amp; shine spray, when used alone on my damp hair just prior to blow-drying, left my hair soft and smooth.  I didn&#x27;t notice any additional shine, but it did smooth my hair out.  I have very thick but mostly straight hair.  I think this is a great product when used alone.  When I attempted to use it along with a styling creme, I felt that my hair was too weighed down and started to look oily.  If you can get away with just this and some hairspray, I highly recommend using this spray.  If you need additional styling aids, you may need to experiment with amounts.</li>
    <li> I received this in my Influenster VoxBox to try before I buy.  I am happy with the results.  You have to make sure to shake the product well before use.  I like the scent of the product, and I did notice more shine when I used with a flat iron.  The only thing I did not like was the &amp;#34;stickiness&amp;#34; when I sprayed it onto my hair.  However, that did not last once I applied heat.  I would recommend this to people who are looking for a protecting spray at a lower price point.</li>
    <li> This spray is good for protecting against heat since I use a hair straightener almost every day, it has cut down on some of the damage, however I do not love the smell of it. It has a very strong scent of rubbing alcohol.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for some time now and was lucky enough to receive the heat protectant in a subscription box that I received. I have very course, thick and curly hair and it does wonders when I straighten my hair. I also use it when I air dry my hair or as a finishing spray for shine. Plus I love how it smells. Great product!</li>
    <li> I received this from Influenster. Typically, I am not always crazy about the products I receive, but this exceeded my expectations. It seems to really protect my hair without weighing it down or building up. That is important because I have thin, color treated hair. It has a pleasant smell and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Typically, shine sprays or heat protectors make my hair look extremely greasy and weighed down. Especially after a few days of use in a row. This did NOT! It not only made my hair shiny, it kept it&#x27;s bounce and had volume! My hair was so soft too. It didn&#x27;t smell the best, it had that smell of hair spray, but not extremely awful. I&#x27;m obsessed! I also received this product for free, but all these opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have a 5 year old daughter who&#x27;s hair goes through the ringer.  However I&#x27;ve been using this Pro Series from Vidal Sassoon and it seems to be adding moisture back to her hair.  Thank you Vidal.  As someone who know nothing about hair it&#x27;s nive to have a product that all the work and research has already been done.  I got this product for free but the opinion is all my own.  I will definitely purchase this going forward to keep in my house.</li>
    <li> Ok. I love this stuff. Just the fact that you can use it on damp OR dry hair makes it a win in my eyes. As a big proponent of the minimal washings, second-day-hair, dry shampoo movement I LOVE products that work on dry hair. I have short hair &amp; it does not wake up looking cute. I have to style it pretty much every day. I used it the first time before re-curling my crunchy, slept-on hair and this stuff turned my unwashed, hairsprayed &amp; kinked out hair into soft, shiny, just-washed-and-styled-looking-hair. It was soft! It was bouncy!! And it&#x27;s not greasy at all! I had a similar heat &amp; color protecting spray in my bathroom cabinet and I promptly threw it out.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, it smells great too ;)</li>
    <li> there are so many products to help keep your hair shiny, reduce frizz, etc. and few have wowed me. this follows that line of thought. does not do it in any fashion that is better or worse than any other product. when i used this during a blow-dry, my hair was soft and shiny immediately following. however, when using for just flat-iron/curling iron purposes, this made my hair crunchy like if i was using hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i received this product at no cost, and was asked to write a review for my use.</li>
    <li> I recently tried out the VS Heat Protect &amp; Shine Spray and I am so glad that I did!  I can see and feel a noticable difference in my hair after blow drying it.  My hair is softer and shinier which I Love!  I also Love the smell of it which is an added bonus for me!  I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Wanted to like this product. I used this after the Moisture Lock Pro Series from Vidal Sassoon. Yes, I think it helped as far as being a heat protector and giving me shine, but man the smell of alcohol is a real turn off. This product is not for me.    This product was sent to me by Influenstervoxbox for complimentary testing and reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> I loved this product!  I received this free from influenster and was a bit worried about it. I was wrong.  It leaves a great shine and it isn&#x27;t greasy or oily looking.  I would buy it in the future for me and for my daughter</li>
    <li> Wow was my reaction to looking at my ironed hair the next day! I still had no frizzed ends or fly-always. I love how I could feel this product soaking into my hair the moment i startd spraying it on. It also made it easier to brush through. My hair looked so fed and smoothed both the day that I ironed my hair and the day after into the evening. Very happy with this product and am glad that I can find it anywhere. This product was tested at no cost to me,but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I style my hair daily so it takes a major beating. I use this before I blow dry and then a few more squirts before I straighten. I like this stuff. My hair came out much more smoother and shinier. It can get a bit greasy if you use too much though. At least it did for me. I have to be careful not to spray it on the top of my head or it can make my roots look greasy. The rest of my hair looked great and super shiny. I got this from Influenster to test the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> So far I like this product - I&#x27;ve used it a few times when blow drying. While it says you can use it wet or dry, I&#x27;m not sure that I am a fan of using it on dry hair, as I think a lot of shine products are too greasy. I do love this on my wet hair before I blow dry, however. I like the smell, and it has a good even spritz to it. It gives a light amount of control, without being too sticky or making my hair feel super oily. I did receive this as a sample from Influenster, so I&#x27;m going to keep using it and see if I start to like it more.</li>
    <li> I flat iron my hair, and this was okay. Now I will say, I used this up to three times and the last time I got the best results. I must stress that you must shake well before you spray on your hair. My hair did go poofy the next day and I needed to put in oil to take down the poof.</li>
    <li> I customarily don&#x27;t use hair spray. I don&#x27;t like the scratchy feeling against my face, nor do I like my hair not having its own life and bounce. This hairspray was pretty good. Nice smelling, good hold without the scratchy, ugly feeling, without weighing it down. I&#x27;m happy to use this product.</li>
    <li> The Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Heat Protect &amp; Shine Spray is a good alternative to a salon brand protectant. It is affordable, the smell is nice, the design of the bottle is easy to hold and spray (I have tried another liquid brand that has a trigger and it is awkward to hold and spray on your own hair) and I feel the product does an adequate job of protecting hair from heat. The product could have earned more stars if it was a cream, which I think is better for this purpose. This is perfect to have on hand for when I run out of my salon brand. I was given this product free of charge to test. These opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This spray is great! I&#x27;ve tried some other heat protection products before but they never really worked. This makes my hair shiny and soft. I normally only heat dry my bangs, and I use a straight iron or curler every so often and this has kept my hair from being dry and weird. I have pretty wavy hair, to the point where I have curls mixed in with my waves, but my hair is so damaged from bleaching that when it dries it&#x27;s usually pretty straight and frizzy and just gross. When I use this my hair stays wavy and the curls stay in. It&#x27;s pretty great. This also smells really good, like peach iced tea, just like the peach iced tea at Olive Garden! I will continue using this and I&#x27;ll be picking up some more when I run out. I&#x27;m really happy with it and also super happy it&#x27;s so inexpensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of this to try from Influenster, but all opinions are my own! This stuff rocks!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that really does what it says it does.  I use heated styling tools frequently, and the Heat &amp; Protect Spray really does protect my very fine hair from too much heat and damage.  It makes my hair super shiny and smooth and also helps hold my style.  I used the spray with a blow dryer and a flatiron and it works really well.  I was lucky to test the product for free, but all opinions in this review are my own.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product to test and review. I&#x27;ve actually been using this particular heat and protection spray for about  6 months now. It really helped to hold my curls/ hair style longer that other brands have done. My hair is on the thick side so I needed a product that would really hold a curl and this product did the job for me.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing heat protect product! i use a blow dryer alot and this is great! left my hair smooth and soft :D&lt;br /&gt;and yes, ALWAYS SHAKE products before using them, makes a huuge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I must say I LOVE this.  The smell isn&#x27;t as wonderful as the shampoo/conditioner, but it leaves my hair feeling soft and looking shiny.</li>
    <li> *I received a sample of this product in order to facilitate a review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely crazy in love with this spray. I straighten my hair all the time and this is the one product that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel dirty and heavy after using.</li>
    <li> LOVE Vidal Sassoon Protect and Shine spray! It definitely protects your hair while giving it a great shine and it feels soft and smooth! Use sparingly as a little bit goes a long way. Also do not use near your roots as it will give you a greasy look. This is comparable to top of the line products that I have tried in the past.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product and I feel it does what it says it would do. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the smell. It wasn&#x27;t overpowering but could have smelled better. The product works great though.</li>
    <li> my hair has never looked this well ever. i will never use anything else on it.</li>
    <li> I use a Heat Protect Spray everyday because I straighten and Blow Dry my hair a lot. I like the way this product makes my hair feel and it smells great. My usual brand is a lot more expensive and I feel like this is a lot more effective as well as affordable. I also like how this product is a spray and not a serum, which is what I feel like most heat protectant sprays are. The Vidal Sasoon brand is great and now my go to brand. They always offer coupons and have low prices.</li>
    <li> Have thick hair, after blow drying hair is usually frizzy and dry and needs more product. After using spray hair is soft and smooth and I can be all done after blow drying!</li>
    <li> I got this item in an Influenster Vox Box to try (for free) and review. I don&#x27;t normally use heat on my hair, so I tried this out on a portion of my hair. I am not a fan of this item. The shampoo and conditioner is excellent, but this made my hair feel coated with some sticky feel. I washed it out, needless to say, my hair was protected from heat damage (I have curly hair) but I didn&#x27;t like how my hair felt with it on it!</li>
    <li> Received this product through Influenster and I was surprisingly happy with my hair after using it. I have thick, most of the time unruly hair and with the humidity in south TX it can be almost impossible to have a good hair day! I was surprised reading some reviews on here because I didn&#x27;t experience the same results except once...I didn&#x27;t read the full directions where it said to shake well. I sprayed it on my hair and I would barely run my straightener down my hair. After I saw the problem I shook it and it worked great. I&#x27;ve used several different products and this one is the first I have used that didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily. Love it, and will be buying in the future!</li>
    <li> It is interesting that the manufacturer recommends shaking this product before use.  I will have to try that next time.  I used this product before using a blow dryer or heating tools and believe that it was efficient as well as provided my hair with decent amount of shine.  I will continue to use this product.  I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This lovely vidal sassoon pro series heat spray...i love it I got this originally from influenster to test out and review, and I&#x27;m glad that I did. Now I&#x27;m addicted the product is really amazing on my 7 year old daughters long thick hair. When she wants shiny flat hair or curly hair I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning any of it off or spending an arm and a leg since this product is crazy affordable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m torn on this product!  I received it from Influenster in a voxbox for testing and see a few pros and cons with the products. Although I liked the way my hair felt with the conditioner and shampoo I am unsure about this. I was excited to use and put it on my damp hair before blowdrying. I also spritzed a small amount before flat ironing as the directions stated. My first impression was the alcohol like hairspray smell. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell at all! The spray had a light sticky feel to it and I found that after using it my hair has a light film on it,. I guess you should have a film to protect it but I have used other products where I still felt like my hair flowed nicely and had a pleasant smell. On a positive note, my hair LOOKS great! it looks smooth and is easy to brush through without frizz. Assuming that the product actually did protect my hair from the heat than it performs well and leaves a great look! I just don&#x27;t like the feel of buildup on my hair ( I didn&#x27;t use a lot either). I will give this a middle of the road rating since there are both pros and cons! :)</li>
    <li> I received this via Influenster free to test and review!  I love this.  The smell is wonderful and pleasant and leaves my hair feeling light and with body even after using my flat-iron.</li>
    <li> I really like this, I have super dry, chemically treated hair so I try to always use a heat protectant. Some can be too navy or make my hair feel limp and greasy - not good considering how dry my hair is. But This spray is light, sprays evenly and doesn&#x27;t build up. It has a pleasant small, not strong or obvious and my hair does not feel fried after flat ironing or curling. Definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> I received this from Influenster and found it to be a wonderful product for my thick fine hair. It protected my hair from heat styling, gave a nice light hold with a subtle smell. I have no issues with product build up, stickiness, or crunchy hair. It worked fabulously and I am glad I can find it reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I thought this would leave my hair greasy but, it didn&#x27;t. It smelled great and left my hair feeling very soft. I do not use a normal curling iron I used one with a rolling barrel and it added to the softness. I normally have oily hair living in Florida but, after using the Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock shampoo and conditioner then the Heat protect and shine I have gone longer without my hair feeling greasy and oily. That&#x27;s a huge difference for me. I would definitely continue to buy this. It may not work for everyone but, it definitely worked for me.</li>
    <li> Used this product on my daughters hair. When finished noticed her hair felt really dry and brittle. It protects from heat put really dries out your hair</li>
    <li> Ok If you are in a bind and have nothing else.  The price of the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Heat Protect &amp; Shine Spray is certainly not the best product of its sort that I have tried but it is also not the worst.  The first thing I noticed was the smell of the product.  It had a very chemical smell to it.  I did like that the product did not make my hair feel greasy, which some others I have tried do. I used this product with my flat iron and it seemed to work nicely for awhile but definitely did not keep my hair smooth and shiny for more than a couple of hours.  The shine was nice though but did not last long. Overall I probably would not use it again but if I had nothing else around to use, it will do.</li>
    <li> I usually use a the blow drier once a week, I tried this product and I really like it. It leaves my hair shiny, smelling amazing and looking beautifull. I like the packaging also, the only thing I notice is that it has an alcohol smell when you apply it and that I don&#x27;t think is good if you are going to use heat after :-/ but overall I like this product!</li>
    <li> This is my second review on here of this product lol...I LOVE this brand.....as amazing as it smells and how great the packaging design is , I really feel this is truly a great product.  It is so comparable to the higher priced &amp;#34;luxury brands&amp;#34; that I purchase via my salon and shops like Ulta.  I was lucky enough to be one of testers who got to try this product out complimentary.  Influenster sent met this complimentary for testing and review purposes and I used it each morning and through out the day as needed for about 5 weeks.  I definitly will be recommending and repurchasing!!  It is easily accessible at local supercenters, drugstores, online and places like Ulta or other beauty suplly stores near me.  It has a really light texture and keeps my hair shiny and sleek all day.  I feel like I have found a true protectant for my hair when styling each morning.  Right before I flat iron I spray it two or three times and then after a minute I run the iron over it.  Love the vibrancy it has helped my color treated hair maintain.  LOVE VIDAL SASSOON!!</li>
    <li> I received this spray from Influenster for testing purposes. I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product as others from other companies make my hair greasy.  I sprayed it on my wet hair before drying.  I liked the smell of it - not overwhelming.  I think it seemed to protect my hair and my curls seemed more defined but it didn&#x27;t make it shiny at all.  I was disappointed in that part.  I would use this again.  Would like to see how it works when I straighten my hair as well.</li>
    <li> I received this spray as well from an influenster box. I have very fine hair so I used it while dry to help keep my hair from being damaged with my chi. My hair is definitely more shiny with this product. I would have to use it longer to really be able to tell if it is protecting my hair super well but I love the shine! My style also seems to hold for longer while using this product.</li>
    <li> This heat protect and shine spray is the bomb. It leaves your looking and feeling good without frying and damaging your hair. It&#x27;s light and not sticky feeling. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a loud smell I would definitely recommend using this brand of products</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It smells great, its affordable and it works! I used it to protect my hair from heat damage that my flat iron could cause and it did just that plus it left my hair so smoothened shiny! I will continue to use this product and recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I sprayed this into my hair as soon as I got out of the shower. Waited for my hair to dry. Straightened as usual. This VSrepair product did not leave my hair sticky. That&#x27;s always a concern. It made it easier for the comb to go through my hair (hair is very long so this was appreciated). I&#x27;m very impressed and will be buying this as my repair spray. I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. @vidalsassoonproseries @influenster @voxbox @influenstervox</li>
    <li> I love the Vidal Sassoon heat and protect spray. I have very fine hair and has seen lots of damage from years of coloring and using hair dryers and straightening irons. From a few weeks of using this product i have already seen a change! My hair is softer and hardly any frizz! I have tried it on wet hair before i used the hair dryer and also dry before using the iron and found success both ways. I can&#x27;t wait to continue using this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other heat protectors and this one has been the best for my hair! I have naturally oily hair, so a lot of products do too much and I feel greasy by the end of the day. However, this was light and pleasant! After I curled my hair, it was still shiny and beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;Actually one of my co-workers was like &amp;#34;it looks so soft!&amp;#34; and touched it, and it was that soft! I had just recently dyed it, which can damaage hair, but it was not noticeable at all!&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed!!!</li>
    <li> I love love this stuff.  Have been using it in combination with Moisture lock shampoo and conditioner and my hair has never been better.  Its soft and shiny and very bouncy.  My hair looks so healthy.  I will definitely continue to use this product.  Works great with my thin fine hair</li>
    <li> As some one who straightens their hair everyday, I have to say I love this product!! It didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or crispy like others do. It left my hair smooth and shiney after straightening. It smells good too! It&#x27;s ok to use before blow drying and also before straightening and still won&#x27;t make it greasy. I have fine hair, but a ton of it! Good product! I didn&#x27;t pay for this product, but the opinions are mine.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair that gets frizzy if there is any moisture in the air.  I used this product, lightly misting damp hair before blow drying, along with the Moisture Lock shampoo and conditioner.  My hair took longer to blow dry, but ended up very straight and smooth, and stayed that way until next shampoo.  Was impressed as to how well this worked on my hair; I have tried several smoothing serums and formulas and this kept the frizz away better than most, and my hair (&amp; hands!) wasn&#x27;t oily.  I liked the smell and that it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this protect spray for almost two weeks now and love it. It adds some level of moisture while keeping my hair sleek. It even adds some texture when I styled my hair with waves and if I go all curls it adds bounce while keeping the frizz at bay. I feel happy knowing that it&#x27;s protecting my hair from further heat damage when I style and blow dry. This doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel sticky and it has a nice fresh scent to it as well as a great price. I would recommend trying it for yourself.</li>
    <li> After 1 week of use and still planning on using the entire bottle up I am still on the fence about this product.  While I can say I do really like it, it does have a few kinks I am working out (maybe user error) The scent is a bit of a &amp;#34;hair spray&amp;#34; scent but unless you really go OVERBOARD your hair will not stiffen up. Definitely follow the directions on the bottle for the best results. On the side of the bottle it says the word repair...a bit misleading as it says nothing about repairing your hair when reading the back of the bottle, must just be part of the repair line with this being a step in the hair care process.  The product does what it claims to do, coats your hair with a protector and yeah maybe adds a touch of shine.  This product is close to being very very good!  It is a great value, trust name brand and I would say if you are curious to try it definitely purchase it and see how it works on your hair.  I did receive this product for free to test all of these opinions are my own!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this product was so affordable and worked so well. I have used a lot of products like this at a much higher price point, so this one was a nice one to try out. I received this for free to review, but the opinions are my own, and I will definitely keep using this product even after the reviews are written and published. My hair is fine and straight, and this product did not weigh it down at all. It was bouncy and shiny after blow drying it with a hot brush.</li>
    <li> Before using this product, I had a heat protector I loved. Now, after using this, I am in love! My hair is so sleek, soft and frizz free! Because I air dry my hair first, I spray this on all over my hair immediately after the shower and then again in the morning before I blow dry or heat style. I tested this product at no cost, however, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this I sprayed it all over on my wet hair then I used the blow dryer,  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. I have thick wavy hair that I blow dry straight everyday. The next time, I sprayed on each section before I straightened it. This time it worked better. I did notice that my hair was softer but didn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;shine\\&quot; that it claimed I would have. Plus it contains alcohol which is known to dry out the hair.  I have tried all types of products for both curly and straight hair and this is one that I would not buy once I am out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I have used this product along with the shampoo and conditioner and it made my hair very beautiful . It smells great . It left it shiny and soft. And very silky feeling! Even after hours of working it still looked great!</li>
    <li> I sometimes hesitate to use heat sprays because they can leave my hair greasy, but was pleasantly surprised by this one. It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and my hair seemed to be smoother when using this than when not. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I recently received a bottle of this Heat Protect &amp; Shine Spray by Vidal Sassoon for testing purposes. I like that this is a large bottle and will last a long time. I also enjoy the scent of the spray. It&#x27;s a nice clean smell and reminds me of the way professional products smell when you go to a salon and get your hair styled. I think it added a little bit of a shine to my hair but without over doing it. The contents do seperate fast while sitting so there will be a layer of product on the bottom of the bottle and another layer (maybe the water) on the top. So make sure to shake well before spraying on your head. It mixes back together super fast so this isn&#x27;t a problem. Overall I like the scent and it does add some shine.</li>
    <li> I used the Heat &amp; Protect spray when I curled and flat ironed my daughter&#x27;s hair for her homecoming dance. It worked great! Left her hair looking shiny and helped protect it from heat damage. Would gladly recommend to others. I did receive this product at no cost for testing purposes through Influenster, but these are my own thoughts about the product.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse hair. It normally takes quite awhile to blowdry and then needs to be styled further (flat or curling iron). I used this heat protectant right after my shower when my hair was wet. It seemed to help my hair dry faster, gave it more shine and left it soft to the touch. I didn&#x27;t even feel like I had to go in with my flat iron afterwards. Which is a pretty big deal for me!! I will definitely continue to use this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at no cost for testing but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have wavy, frizzy hair that I blow dry and flat iron daily, and I&#x27;ve tried countless products to help protect and tame it. I received a bottle of the Heat &amp; Protect Spray free to review, and it is amazing! My hair has never been softer or smoother, even on a rainy day when I would normally be a puffball :o) Plus, the value is outstanding. I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
    <li> So first off let me say i love Vidal Sassoon shampoo and conditioner! I have been using them for years..I recently received a complimentary sample of their Heat Protect &amp; Shine spray. Which is for flat ironing or the hair dryer. So i started using the product after i washed my hair but before i dried my hair. I have to admit it kept my hair from drying out and looking brittle after i dried my hair. It leaves a soft silky feeling with an incredible shine!!1 A new must have product.</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon Heat &amp; Protect Spray works great! I love that it was protecting my hair while making it look great. I definitely have a new go to product to protect my hair when I am styling it. I recommend this to everyone that wants great looking hair. I received the product free to try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest --&amp;#62; I was a skeptic because I am fairly particular about what I put in my hair, but I decided to give this a try.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The smell is pleasant, the spray doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or stiff, and I was still able to style my hair as originally planned.  A good buy if you&#x27;re looking for a light product to use...</li>
    <li> Great product - smells a little like hairspray, but there&#x27;s no stickiness. Works as a heat protectant (although I don&#x27;t style my hair more than 2x a week) and leaves shine for DAYS. Literally. Days. Love it.    I was given this product free to try. All thoughts are my own.</li>
    <li> Average: Out of all the heat protective sprays I use I prefer the oil based. I fear my hair will burn off with the water based because I hear sizzling when I put an iron to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it smells ok&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes me a while to fall in love with a product unless it is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I packed it away to go in my hospital stay bag for when Im due!</li>
    <li> I really love this product! Makes my hair feel great I use the blow dryer than the hot iron so there is a lot of heat. My hair smells great and shine, What else could a girl want! I did receive this product for free from Influenster in a voxbox, but the review is mine alone. I will continue to purchase this product!</li>
    <li> I love the way this product made my hair feel and look! I have super thick, wavy hair, I sprayed some of this on before flat ironing and was left with super shiny smooth hair.</li>
    <li> I I tested this product with the VIdal Sassoon Moisture Lock shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I believe with my processed(bleached and then toned) hair the shampoo and conditioner is not formulated for me.  I used this Heat protect &amp; Shine spray for one week with the shampoo &amp; conditioner and for a week using my regular shampoo &amp; conditioner.  With this VS Shampoo &amp; Conditioner I was able to use this product as a detangler.  FOr straightening I also used this spray and I found so-so results with softness and manageability.  I went back to my regular S&amp;C and tried the Spray again.  I had much better results.  I get softness from the spray when I straighten and curl the ends.  I did not see a lot of wispy hairs but still had some after several hours.  The next day I did have frizzy hair and I don&#x27;t have that issue with my regular straightening spray.  I recommend this product at this price and like the detangling aspect as a bonus.  I tested the product at no cost from Influenster, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I recently received this heat protectant spray to try for free, and this is my opinion about it. First let me say that I have totally thick, coarse, frizzy hair. Flat ironing is the only way that I can make sense of my hair. I have so many fheat protector sprays and creams. After washing and conditioning with the amazing shampoo and conditioner I also received, I towel dried my hair and sprayed this onto my hair. I didn&#x27;t really notice any significant difference after blow drying. I sectioned my hair and sprayed a bit more on each section right before I flat ironed it. I must say that aside from smelling good, I could totally see how beautifully it worked. My hair was still so soft, and silky. It left a great shine to it as well. No sign of frizz. And the bonus for me was that two days later all I had to do was spay a couple sprays of this, and touch up a few spots from sleeping. Although it is not the most incredible, amazing heat protection spray I have ever used, I&#x27;m totally impressed by it, even more so because it is made by VS. Definitely worth the money. I totally reccomend this. P.S to top it all off, this sample was a full size, so I&#x27;ll be using this for a while. Thanks a million influenster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product to try for free, all of the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received this from influenster to test for free. I was a little skeptical since I usually use salon grade products, and I&#x27;d recently had my hair colored. But I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by this. It&#x27;s *really* important to shake it well before using -- you can see it separate in the bottle. But if you do that, it seems to do a decent job of protecting hair from heat styling. I&#x27;ve actually been blow drying more since getting this.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite go to heat protectors..... Smells great and leaves hair looking fantastic. I tried the this for free but have purchased on my own after trying it.</li>
    <li> I used vidal product in the pass but this by far is the best, I since then have perched several products to complet the set to used on my hair and so far my thick healthy hair is very happy and so am I , I didn&#x27;t think my hair would look and feel different and people notice the difference and ask what I done different to my hair and my response is I teamed up with #Vidalsassoon pro&#x27;s...im happpy.I used it for testing  and now I use it for life.</li>
    <li> I adore the scent of this product and the way it makes my hair shine after use. Just a few squirts to wet hair after your shower does wonders. It&#x27;s great for soft hair once flat ironed as well!</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed with this product. It didn&#x27;t hold like hairspray would nor did it seem to do anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. It protects my hair from the daily use of a flat iron yet still leaves it feeling soft and managable. I even got some compliments about how much shine there was to my hair. I would definitely recommend this product especially for the value compared to much more expensive brands out there</li>
    <li> I got this product in an Influenster VoxBox and I&#x27;m in love with it! I don&#x27;t normally buy Vidal Sassoon products. I think I had it in my mind that the products where cheap. I have officially been proven WRONG! They are affordable but awesome! This spray smells a little funny but once you style your hair you can;t smell it at all. I use so much heat… blow drying, curling, straightening, crimping, and so on.. I love how this product makes my hair shine after I style. I will be using this before each heat styling from now on!</li>
    <li> I used this spray prior to blow drying my hair and later I added more before I straightened my hair with the flat iron. My hair felt very soft after I blow-dried it. I did have some shine in my hair, but not as much as I was hoping for. I seem to have more shine after using the flat iron (and after a second application of the spray.) I will continue to use it as a heat protecting spray. I tested this spray at no cost, but my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> If you are like me, You wash you hair everyday and even style it as usual but if you do this on a daily basis there has to be some heat damage to your hair.  Ever since I started using this product, I knowtest that my hair was much more manageable and looked awesome.  I love all things Vidal Sasson because their products do what they say they will.</li>
    <li> I used this while my hair was wet, before I diffused my curly hair. I love the shine and how soft it was afterwards! I also love using this as a refresher spray for later in the day or the next day~ The smell of the spray is &#x27;fresh&#x27; and light! I love it!</li>
    <li> Heat damage isn&#x27;t an issue for me, but I love anything that makes my fine hair shine without making it look greasy. Most products are too heavy, but this did exactly that and smelled fantastic. It makes me want to skip the ponytail more often! The little bit of hold was just perfect, too. I definitely recommend this product.   I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this product.  She&#x27;s used it for a while since she&#x27;s wears her natural hair straight 95% of the time and she hasn&#x27;t experienced any damage because this protectant is amazing.  She loves the smell, the price is right and it protects her tresses from the heat of the flat iron.  You honestly cannot be any happier than that.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!  I used it before blowing my hair out and saw a noticeable difference in the shine and manageability in my hair after it was dry.  I also really like the smell of it which is important to me in hair products.  I am really happy with it and am looking forward to trying the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This smells so good and left my hair healthy and shiny!</li>
    <li> I really like this product it provides just enough protection between my hair and my wand curler.  It&#x27;s not sticky which is a plus and as an added bonus it smells really great.  It provides a bouncy curl for me.. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary bottle of Vidal Sassoon Heat Protectant and Shine in my Voxbox from Influenster and I was very excited to try this product on my hair. I usually have use a detangler on my hair, which fine to medium texture and curly. Anytime I can use combo products that two things at once, its a win, so the heat protectant and shine was winner in my book. It was bit of a let down, I sprayed my damp hair and combed it through, which was not difficult, but was&#x27;t easy either. I was hoping this product would provide a bit more slip and would leave my hair touchable soft. Sadly, the smell of Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s heat, protectant was not as pleasant as the shampoo and conditioner from the line, it left my hair a bit stiff and not the shine it promised, but as a heat protectant its ok. Left me hair feeling meh!!! I wanted to like the product more.</li>
    <li> I frequently blow dry and flat iron my hair and typically use a cream to protect my hair. I thought I&#x27;d give this a try and after my hair was completely dry, shook the contents, as directed, and sprayed all over my hair. While I think it likely protects I really didn&#x27;t like the way my hair felt. It was very much like hairspray, which I hate, and caused my hair to have a sticky feel to it requiring me to brush it over and over. Alas, it never came out super shiny and smooth. Rather, it was kind of dry looking and course.  I typically enjoy Vidal Sassoon products but this one certainly isn&#x27;t for me. I happened to receive this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. While I didn&#x27;t pay for this product, and wouldn&#x27;t, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I use many hot tools on my hair.  I am always on the lookout for a heat protectant spray.  I decided to try Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Heat Protect &amp; Shine Spray.  It&#x27;s got a great scent.  I love how shiny and soft my hair is after using this.  I highly recommend this spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product at no cost by the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Personally, I like Vidal Sassoon. No, they are not a brand I normally buy because I am trying to go more green and get natural ingredient soaps and shampoos. But, I do love the quality of the items. The shampoo and conditioner made my hair feel extra silky, and I love the heat protecting spray for the days I blow dry and curl my hair. Who couldn&#x27;t use a little extra protection, and especially with the winter months coming up? I know, for a fact, that I will use every drop of this heat protecting!</li>
    <li> I sprayed this product on my hair while it was still wet, then I blew dry and flat ironed like I typically do.  My hair had more shine to it than usual, which I liked.  I can only hope that it really does protect my hair from the heat, but I guess I can&#x27;t really tell that for sure until I have used it for more time.&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product complimentary from Influenster in a VoxBox, along with Vidal Sassoon Shampoo and Conditioner. These opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily.  I spray it on before i straighten my hair.  Not only does it leave a nice scent but it is not greasy like other products. It leaves my hair soft and also a nice shine.  I would recommend using this product.  I also use the hair repair shampoo and conditioner with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week now and have been very happy with the results.  I typically use Enjoy Shine spray as my heat protection product, but decided to try this after Influenster provided me with a complimentary sample.  I have always been weary of drugstore products, but I really do like this.  It smells good and did a great job at making my hair shiny and smooth as I blow dry and straighten it on a daily basis.  It leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth.  I would definitely recommend this product and will continue to use it in my daily routine.</li>
    <li> Best heat spray on the market! I used this for a week during a test group. The spray is the best protection spray that I have ever found. I use hair dryers, curling irons, straightening irons, and a lot of other heat sources that have damaged my hair. I just have to spray the protect and shine onto my hair and style away! No more frizzy, broken ends to worry about. This is a must have to anyone&#x27;s beauty regime! I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I am always on the hunt for a product that will protect my hair from heat damage.  With the thick, long hair I have, it can be quite laborious to dry it, and especially damaging when I introduce heat to dry it faster.  Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Protect and Shine Spray is a dual-phase spray that states will enhance shine, offers light conditioning, and heat protection.  I used this on very wet hair after showering.  I sprayed from the middle of the hair until the ends.  I then blew the hair dry with the addition of a flat paddle brush.  I found that the hair dried at a faster rate than it usually does, though Vidal Sassoon does not claim that that is one of their benefits.  The hair was able to achieve straightness much sooner than just brush and blow dryer.  I found that my ends were softer than usual, and the hair was much shiner using the spray than going without it.  The spray itself is extremely lightweight...once the hair was dry, there was no sticky or weighted feeling to the hair.  There is a scent, but it is rather subtle and pleasant.  I go a few days between shampooing and heat drying my hair, and the for the days in between, my hair was still shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best heat protectant spray I have ever used. I have tried so many over the years, and none have worked as good as this one. I used it before blowdrying on wet hair, and then before flat ironing on dry hair. It worked well on both. I did find my hair was slightly staticy, but i do not believe it was the product, as this happens time to time with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided free of charge for testing purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was sent the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series products to try out by Influenster. I have to admit I was hesitant to try the products, but I&#x27;m glad I did. I have very coarse hair and it tends to dry out when I blow dry it. The VS Pro Series Heat Protect &amp; Shine Spray helps it from drying out. I leaves a nice shine once dried without feeling greasy or sticky. I would recommend this to friends.</li>
    <li> I admit that I was skeptical as I normally use more \\&quot;professional\\&quot; brands and my hair is dry and I battle split ends. I do like this product! I have to be very careful to not spray it close to my roots (the directions are very clear about that) so I don&#x27;t end up a greasy mess, but I like the shine and softness that i get from this product when I do blow dry and flat iron. I also liked the results that I got when I wear my hair naturally wavy (air dry). It helps control the frizz and gives a nice sheen to my hair. Is this the best product I&#x27;ve sued? No. But at this price point, you won&#x27;t get much better!</li>
    <li> I like the heat protect spray but be careful not to spray too much on your hair.  I will become crunchy on you.  Once you master the amount to put on daily, you should be fine.  I have 50% gray hair if that&#x27;s helpful.  Also, I have a problem with the white part of my hair turning yellow with too much product in my hair.  This spray takes a longer time to turn the hair yellow(about 5 days as supposed to the usual 3 days).</li>
    <li> smells great! Not sticky. And tames my fly aways while making my hair shiny and smooth</li>
    <li> I receive this product for review via @INFLUENSTER for testing.&lt;br /&gt;This is an awesome product. I have very dry, ethnic hair..and it made my hair so silky after flat ironing it&#x27;s unbelievable!&lt;br /&gt;Product added Sheen to my hair as well as a protectant against the heat. AWESOME PRODUCT!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone. THANK YOU VIDAL SASSOON!!!!</li>
    <li> this leaves your hair dry and crunchy as if u sprayed ur hair with hairpray instead of heat protectant i really do not recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product almost every day! it leaves my hair silky and smooth and it never damages my hair when I use heat to style it! I strongly recommend theis product to consumers who need some quick and easy heat protectant that actually works!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.\\&quot;   Good product! Protects hair and keeps smooth after using my flat iron it still protects. Reasoning behind my lower credit rating is due to the smell of the spray.</li>
    <li> This spray is alright. It smells good, gives my some smoothness as well as shine. I used the spray before using my straightening iron on my hair.  It worked well and didn’t appear to be damaging my hair. The spray didn’t seem to leave any greasiness or buildup on my fine hair.  The price point for this heat protectant is great, so I would definitely consider purchasing it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I love  this stuff. its great if you need to use a flat iron on your hair. keeps it shiny</li>
    <li> I got this product to try from Influenster. I love the way it works. Just spray it on your hair before you blow dry or flat iron. Flat iron just glides through and your hair is silky and smooth and it lasts forever! Love it.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  I only gave it 4 stars because of the smell, I didn&#x27;t care for that part.  But it worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I really loved this product. I loved how it made my hair so soft and manageable. I first used the Moisture Lock shampoo and conditioner from Vidal Sassoon. but then I towel dried my hair sprayed the heat protect and shine spray on it. I blew out most of the moisture then took a paddle brush and finished the smoothing. My hair stayed silky and smooth for days afterwards. I cant say enough about this product. highly recommend</li>
    <li> I received this via Influenster free to test and review! I spray some one before I use my flat iron.Afterwards it is shiny and smells so good.</li>
    <li> I have long blonde hair and blow drying can leave it frizzy, this product really works! My hair is soft and frizz free! I will keep using this product!!</li>
    <li> So, I don&#x27;t know about you, BUT, I am a big fan of curling my hair with my flat iron, but hate how all I can smell is burning hair all day. Well this product doesn&#x27;t have that happen!  It smells great!!  And it also gave it a great and healthy shine, which makes me feel better about doing so much damage to my hair.  Also, there must be some hair spray mixed into it?  All I know is that my curls lasted all day - and even through sleep - when they normally fall out by lunch time.  This really is a great product - it amazes me that one hasn&#x27;t been made like it before</li>
    <li> I used this on both my hair and my daughters. I have colored hair which is thin, it worked for me when I put it on damp hair left it feeling smooth. My daughter has virgin hair, she used it and you could feel it on her hair like a filmy layer. She didn&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s mixed reviews here since it worked on me but not on her.  Trial and error for hair texture.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past week on my hair and my daughters hairs and it leave it so silky and healthy looking. The best part of it is that it smells really good!</li>
    <li> Love it when me and my hair have different hair types and the same product works for the both of us is great.&lt;br /&gt;Save money and all</li>
    <li> I love this product, I am not crazy about putting too many products in my hair to weigh it down and my hair is very thick and heavy but I used this with my flat iron and it left my hair soft and shiny and did not weigh it down or leave kind of residue, will buy it again! I did get this product to test for free but that does not change my opinion on the product!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product. I have dry, coarse hair, that I blow dry a few times a week. I used the spray on wet hair prior to blow drying, and my hair is softer than it&#x27;s been in ages!! It didnt weigh my hair down at all, in fact, I think I&#x27;ll use a little extra styling cream next time because my hair is so soft and weightless it actually needs something to smooth it down now. Love that it&#x27;s protecting my hair from the heat and that I can use it on dry or wet hair. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is def one of the best heat protectant sprays I&#x27;ve ever used. I have natural hair so a heat protectant is a must for me. I love the smell of this product. I also love that this protectant did not leave my hair sticky or stiff, The packaging is nice as well. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I use an pricey salon heat protection spray and I was impressed with this spray.  My hair is nice and smooth and I&#x27;m not experiencing a bunch of static or fly away which is very important to me especially this time of year as I live in a very dry part of Colorado out on the plains.  I&#x27;m much more impressed with this product then I am their Moisture Lock Shampoo.</li>
    <li> I received this from Influenster in a vox box. I wasnt sure if I would like it or not. I used it to help curl my hair for a party. My hair stayed slick and shiny and smelled great the product did just what it said it would do and I loved it. I am making this a part of my beauty routine. Love it so much!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It made my normally frizzy hair sleek and shiny. Plus it also smells nice.</li>
    <li> Wow! I recently received Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Heat spray and was very impressed with how soft and shiny it made my hair. I sprayed it on before styling with my straight iron and was left with sulky straight hair that smelled divine! I definitely recommend this if you apply heat to your hair often.</li>
    <li> It works ok left my hair with a greasy feeling when I used my flat iron with it, but that could have been because I sprayed too much. It has a scent I&#x27;m not fond of I would prefer a non scented spray. I&#x27;ve used better Heat protect sprays including CHI that is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I gave this a shot not sure what to expect. I don&#x27;t like a lot of product in my hair. I generally wear it straight and don&#x27;t like for it to feel sticky which is a common result of any product. I used this on damp hair before blow drying then finished my routine and went on about my day. Hours later after I forgot about it I ran my fingers through my hair and was so impressed with how soft and smooth it was. I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on my hair as well. I will continue to use this product regularly.</li>
    <li> wow, Love this product!  Another awesome Vidal Sassoon product that does what it says.  And how can you beat the value?  Smells so good, my hair drys faster and is protected now.  Thank you Vidal Sassoon, you Rock!</li>
    <li> undecided but glad i tried it gives this one a new meaning, i got my voxbox in and i had my hair already washed and up so i sprayed in the protect shine and let it dry, my hair was in a long braid so didnt think much but when i took it down the volume was amazing, it smells great as well, this is great for color treated hair that has damage already and i of course did under curl my bangs so wow the shine was amazing no frizz either, definate recommend on it for those who need extra shine, but if your hair is already oily be careful not to use to much otherwise you will have sticky filmy hair! a little goes a long long way!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day once before blow drying and again before flat ironing. I am amazed at how smooth my hair is. My hair color is lasting longer and the damage I normally notice has drastically changed.</li>
    <li> I received it from Influenster in a voxbox for testing and I typically don&#x27;t use these because I have thin, frizzy hair and they tend to make it crunchy and weigh it down - I didn&#x27;t get either with these. I used the whole trio (shampoo, conditioner, and spray), blew my hair out and it was soft and shiny. And no frizz when I stepped outside - huge plus!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this heat &amp; protect hair spray. I&#x27;ve used other sprays, this is by far The best! My hair drying time was cut in half! This product is non greasy after is dry I don&#x27;t even feel any greasy residue on my hair, smells great, left my hair shiny, bouncy, with lots of volume. I can glide my fingers through my hair, it&#x27;s so manageable. The spray nozzle, sprays as a fine mist which I like, I noticed the product separates and you have to shake well before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair like I got it done at a salon but I got it done conveniently at home! Love the results! Out of all heat protecting sprays I&#x27;ve used, this is the best spray I&#x27;ve used ever.  Got this product For testing at no cost to me, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> works great smells awesome and made my hair shine</li>
    <li> It seems to protect my hair and help keep it soft through blow drying and straightening. I only wish it came in a mousse form so that it was easier to distribute through the ends of my hair.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair soft and frizz free. Holds all day, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or residual on my hair. Protects my hair against the cheap gym hair dryers!</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of this spray. While it does protect my hair, it has leaves it a bit stiff, unlike oils that make my hair feel like nothing is in it. I&#x27;ll use this prout in a pinch, but It won&#x27;t be my go to product. *received as a sample to review from Influenster*</li>
    <li> I received the heat protect &amp; shine spray in a voxbox from Influenster. I normally don&#x27;t dry my hair or use heat on it at all because I try to avoid damage. When I got this spray I decided to try it out and I like it. When I first sprayed it on my hair it smelled fruity but the alcohol smell is strong too. It was kind of like a cocktail on my hair! The alcohol smell wears off when it&#x27;s dry though and the smell and feel of the product are nice. I used it again after a shower and just sprayed it on like an antifrizz or something. It did help manage my thick curly hair even without putting heat on it.</li>
    <li> I got this product to try for free from Influenster. And I will be purchasing more when I run out. I have naturally curly, frizzy hair that never stays tame. But with this product, my hair was super soft and it stayed straight all day. I can see a difference in the overall health of my hair also.</li>
    <li> Works fabulously! Doesn&#x27;t make your hair heavy or sticky! I&#x27;ll buy it again and again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of heat products on my hair.  That being said I was in a play where I needed to curl my hair.  Usually my hair holds the curl fine for an evening and then I re-curl it the next day.  On Saturday we had a matin&amp;eacute;e and an evening performance.  I had just received the product for reviewing purposes and decided to give this product a try.  It held my curl all day!  I didn&#x27;t need to touch up my curl at all for the evening performance!  My only complaint is that you have to remember to shake the bottle between every spritz as the product does separate, but once you get used to it, it is no big deal.  I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I usually do not use this type of product. But I probably should have been, since i blow dry my hair with the hot setting. So after using the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Heat Protect &amp; Shine Spray i seriously saw a difference in my hair. It was really shiny and less frizzy. I have used this on several occasions, but the other day i seriously noticed what it had done for my hair. After styling and heading out for a couple of hours of shopping, i came home and headed to my bathroom to wash my hands and looked in the mirror and was just WOWED!. My hair really looked great, and i do not ever think it looks great after coming home from shopping. It is usually yeah the same ol same ol my hair did what it felt like doing. But this time it stayed as i styled it and it didn&#x27;t get all wonky from the humidity.&lt;br /&gt;(I know someone here will know what i mean!) Even after sleeping on it, i woke up and it actually looked good. I definitely recommend trying this product especially if you use heat on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;  but i will be purchasing it again!</li>
    <li> I tried this spray for a month. Though I liked the smell and thought by the description it had great potential it just wasn&#x27;t for me. I bought Vidal Sasson shampoo &amp; conditioner and used all the products and my hair still felt dry</li>
    <li> Made my hair very manageable and shiny.  Easy to use</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff because I&#x27;m on a budget and I ran out of my CHI Iron Guard.  I&#x27;m all about affordable, but this crap is just cheap.  Maybe my hair is just too thick and resistant for it, or maybe it&#x27;s just the heat and humidity in the region of Texas that I live in, but I would have been better off just ironing my hair without it because it didn&#x27;t do anything to hold my hair straight all day long nor do I feel like it protected my hair (from only 370F at that...) and it doesn&#x27;t even make my hair that shiny.  The only thing I liked about it was the floral scent it had.  Don&#x27;t waste your bucks.</li>
    <li> Its ok but it smells good</li>
    <li> When i tried the heat spray and shine recieved free from influenster as part of the Vidal Sassoon VoxBox my first impression was it smelled faintly of alcohol and i was nervous because I&#x27;m using this in conjunction with a flat iron.  It did not burn my hair tho  You must shake the bottle before applying which will allow the other products to blend.  Over all i would buy this.  No tangles, stickiness or tackiness when i ran my fingers through my strands.  This is a really good product!</li>
    <li> This spray is awesome. It smells great, gives my hair much needed smoothness and shine, and doesn&#x27;t cost as much as those salon brands but does just has well. The schtick is that it comes in 2 phases (that you have to shake up before using). One for the shine and one for the heat protection. I haven&#x27;t used it with hot irons yet but I did use it to do a blow out and it was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: fruity and slightly floral but light, dissipates a lot after blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;Feel: I sprayed all over (not the roots) using a total of 8-10 sprays for my long thick hair. Did not get any grease or residue after blow out.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Good value. I would definitely purchase a second bottle after finishing this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> This is some good stuff!  I got this the other day from Influenster and washed my hair with the moisture shampoo and conditioner.  I used the heat protect and shine spray when I blow dried my hair.  After blow drying my hair normally feels really dry, but I got really good results when blow drying with the Heat Protect &amp; Shine Spray.  After that, I applied a little bit more to protect my hair while flat ironing. I got really good results and my hair looks really healthy and with a great shine!</li>
    <li> I like this spray. Not sure if its the best, but I do like it. I used it and my hair smelled really nice. It was still a bit frizzy, but I do think it helped a bit. I got this product for free from @influenster, but my opinions are my own.  I am happy to have tried this and to continue to hopefully see good results.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft &amp; shiny. Got this as a tester item and fell in love.</li>
    <li> I only straighten my bangs, and let the rest of my hair stay wavy.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well this product works!  The first day I used the spray, I got a ton of compliments on my hair.  The spray not only protects your hair from the heat of the straightening iron, but also gives your hair a slight shine, making your hair looking healthy.  I have thick hair, and this product works perfectly for the little straightening I do.  I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note:  I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are solely my own.</li>
    <li> Good to protect hair from heat while on a budget.  Left my hair soft and without residue.  Affordable too!</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample from Influenster VoxBox and wow!  First off, it smells sooo good!!! It really left my hair soft yet held my curls without that sticky heavy feeling.  Definitely a must have for those who want hold and softness all in one!!!!</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product, smells great and gives me a lot of shine when using with my flat iron</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this product from the first use. It provides my hair with ample enough shine and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out like some other heat protectants.</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon spray is great..</li>
    <li> I got this in an influenster voxbox and I actually liked it a lot! I used it on my own hair as well as my sons who has long hair that was damaged and it seems to be helping his hair. I loved that the smell was not gender specific. It was something I liked as well as my son. I used it with the shampoo and conditioner it came with and the combination worked well together. I would buy this product and am glad that I was chosen to try it out.</li>
    <li> This product works really well on my hair.  It makes my hair soft and shiny and really helps decrease the frizz, too.  You do NOT want to spray it directly on your roots, though.  It will make your hair look greasy.  Use it sparingly, too because a little bit goes a really long way.  Make sure you shake it, too.  The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t shake it.  The next time, I shook it up first and the smell and the results were completely different and much, much better.</li>
    <li> I tried this product as part of the Influenster Voxbox promotion.  For starters, I actually really enjoyed the scent of the product.  I found it very pleasant and not like hair spray at all.  As for the application, I have a couple of concerns.  I liked the ease of putting it on.  I went in a different direction and put it on once when my hair was wet and once when my hair was dry.  I actually liked the results much better when using it on wet hair.  I found that it made my hair feel so incredibly soft throughout the day and it didn&#x27;t feel damaged at all.  When using it with dry hair, however, I felt it left a kind of greasy film, if you will.  I have now used it several times on my wet hair, even without using the blow dryer, and it feels kind of like a leave in conditioner.  I am enjoying the trial but can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ll be purchasing it in the future.</li>
    <li> This is horrible. The smell is awful. It has such a strong chemical smell to it. Once I applied heat to it, you could smell hair burning. Definitely did not protect my hair from heat, it burnt my hair</li>
    <li> I was kinda skeptical to try this out but boy was I impressed!  Works so well on my curly hair when I use the diffuser...shine, bounce with just a little hold to keep it frizz free!</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this product. I used this with a ceramic curling iron, and it gave me a nice curl with no crunchy feeling like some heat protectant sprays.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for someone that uses a straightener or blow dryer. My hair was so silky, smooth and shiny. It was amazing</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic product. It not only helped eliminate some of the horrible frizz from my long hair, but it also kept it shiny and soft even during straightening with a flat iron. I smells good and didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy like so many other products have. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> This product does seem to have some hold to it when you use it which is nice, however it does leave your hair feeling a bit dry and &amp;#34;straw like&amp;#34; instead of the silky feeling I would want from a product.  I like that it is protecting my hair from heat and it does not weight my very fine hair down which is also a plus.  Overall, it is good for the price - but there are better salon products out there.  I am reviewing because I received a sample for free, however my opinions are based on the trial period of use.</li>
    <li> I am always on the lookout for a heat protectant spray. I decided to try Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Heat Protect &amp; Shine Spray. It&#x27;s got a great scent. I love how shiny and soft my hair is after using this. I highly recommend this spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product at no cost by the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was sent this product to review from Influenster to review, This product is awesome, I love the smell of it and how it protects my hair before flat ironing. I used it before I got my hair done when I went to the Salon to get my hair done. My hair was so shiny and smelled like the product. It has a pleasant smell. It did not make my hair hard or crunchy, my hair is soft and flowing. I do recommend this product to anyone who uses heat on their hair.</li>
    <li> it had a nice scent and only took a small amount.I liked the price and it didn&#x27;t make my hair oily.I really liked it</li>
    <li> Received this product for free to test from Influenster and was so excited because the spray I do have was just about out. This product was great because it helped to straighten my hair nicely without that dried out feeling you get from straightening. It is also great for when you blow dry you hair as well and leaves you hair feeling soft and light. I definitely would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I recently received this from Influenster to try and review. I liked it. My hair felt kind of sticky at first and I couldn&#x27;t really fun my fingers through my hair.  I brushed through the hair after I was done styling, and it was fine and soft. The  REALLY good thing is that my hair looked good. I live in a dry climate, and my hair gets very static-y. My unruly stray hairs were tame and looked smooth. The scent is okay, light. and the product washed off nicely too. I hate products that are hard to wash out. I think I may purchase this in the future.</li>
    <li> This heat protectant worked as expected and left my hair soft silky and manageable. I did experience slight tingling on my scalp, I&#x27;m guessing because it contains alcohol. I received this sample free from Influenster and this is my honest opinion of the product.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of heat on my hair each day.  It is getting frizzy/dry looking and this product has definitely helped!  It&#x27;s not super sticky and costs much less than the salon products I&#x27;ve been buying...which haven&#x27;t given me the same outcome as this.  I&#x27;d recommend it but make sure to use it as the bottle says.  I tested this for free and would purchase in the future!!</li>
    <li> For the past 2 weeks I have incorporated the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Heat Protect &amp; Shine Spray into my daily routine before blow drying.  I can honestly say this is the best that I&#x27;ve tried.  The smell is great.  This production does not leave your hair feeling greasy or weighed down.  It helps with the frizzies that come after blow drying or straightening your hair.  I highly suggest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to use this product with shampoo and conditioner other than Vidal Sassoon because those do make my thin hair appear greasy after washing.  I did test these products at no cost compliments of Influenster, however, the opinions are my own from experience.</li>
    <li> I love this heat spray, specifically because it did not leave my hair feeling greasy.  Instead, my hair is shiny, and soft.  I color my hair, so it is really important for me to protect it during heat styling, to prevent damage and color fading.  This was just the perfect product, especially since it is so affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a test bottle at no cost for the purposes of reviewing, and all opinions my own.</li>
    <li> I received this from influencer and I am so glad I did. I have used many different heat protectants and oils, waxes and sprays to make my hair do what I want. But this one seemed to cut down on what I had to use. It helped with the fly aways and I used less oil when I was done. Some other reviews didn&#x27;t like the smell, but I loved it. I dislike anything too perfumey, but I still like my product to smell feminine. This one worked for me! I also liked that the smell didn&#x27;t linger with me all day. I will buy this product again and again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the smell or texture of your after after spraying fool you - this stuff ended up working well on my hair! To me it smelled like it had a lot of alcohol in it. I also had a bottle that the cap was defective - so it ended up leaking (annoying) - BUT, the final, after styled result was great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so on the fence about this product. I received a bottle through Influenster for review, and at first I was excited, as I needed a new heat protectant. I sprayed it on after towel drying my hair, and then used the blow dryer. My hair was not nearly as soft as it usually is (without protectant, no less), but I figured that it would soften up a bit after flat ironing. Unfortunately, that was not the case. My hair felt sort of dry, which wasn&#x27;t the goal. In all fairness, though, it could have been user error. You have to play around with spray protectants to see what amount will work best for your hair. So maybe I need to try it a few more times in order to get the right amount of sprays in. But right now, I would say that the product is okay. It&#x27;s just may not be right for me. It smells lovely, though! :)</li>
    <li> I received this product for free through influenster and Vidal Sassoon.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry and frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;This spray tames my hair and keeps it from having fly aways.</li>
    <li> I love using this before blow drying or using my hot iron. It sprays on and stays-no runs. It smells good and you can feel it on your hair until dry in a few seconds so you know it is protecting your hair from the heat!</li>
    <li> I blow dry my hair often and so I use a product like this regularly. After using it several, my hair feels soft and looks shiny after drying, not greasy! Not to mention is smells great! I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided at no cost, but all opinions are my own!</li>
    <li> I use this right after I shampoo and condition my hair with the vidal Sassoon moisture lock shampoo and conditioner..I spray it on my hair especially on the ends while my hair is still wet..It has a nice soft light fragrance to it.It works very well..My hair is shiny and my ends don&#x27;t look dry.Very good product to use before you put all that heat on it..It protects my hair from getting damaged. I recieved this product at no cost and my opinions are my own.</li>
