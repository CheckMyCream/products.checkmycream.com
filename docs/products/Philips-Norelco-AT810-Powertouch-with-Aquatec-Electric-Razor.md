<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is exactly as advertised. Bought it for my 17 year old son who is extremely happy with it&lt;br /&gt;Arrived promptly&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> This shaver (used dry) gives me a super-close shave much like a manual razor.  It&#x27;s very light, and does the job quickly.  On my first try I purposely let my beard (which is heavy) grow out for three days and my face was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind in a matter of minutes.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great battery life. Good shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks.  It&#x27;s pretty good.  Not amazing.  It doesn&#x27;t have a ton of power which is a little underwhelming.  Probably good for battery life though.  Bottom line is that it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Good Item ,but motor is not super strong</li>
    <li> My friend loves it as a gift!</li>
    <li> has a sad little motor</li>
    <li> does not shave that close so I still use my hand razor</li>
    <li> very bad choice, does a bad job shaving.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of junk !  Blades don&#x27;t vibrate or rotate, there is no shaving action. Highly disappointed returned for refund.</li>
    <li> Husband says it works great.</li>
    <li> closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Panasonic wet dry shavers since 1995--I almost always shave in the shower--and got tired of the battery issues on the latest one I owned (sent it in twice for replacement under warranty and the third time it died it went in the trash).  Nothing shaves closer than the Panasonics on my chin and &#x27;stasche, but lousy on the neck area. Decided to try a Norelco--my Dad had one back in the day when they came out and were corded and shaved dry.  Lathered up in the shower and fired this thing up and I could not believe how quiet it was--amazing.  Noticed real quick you did not have to repeatedly shave an area--it did a pretty good job on the first pass shaving against the grain.  Waited 3 weeks to write this review--manual says give your beard 3 weeks to adjust--but it shaved just as close when I first got it as it is now. Does not shave as close as the Panasonic on chin and mustache areas, but acceptable.  I use a blade to shave my neck, but for the first time used the Norelco to shave my neck today and was amazed that it shaved just as close as a blade.  Amazing. Oh, still on the first charge from 3 weeks ago.  I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, so YMMV.  Update 9 months later.  Battery is shot (light comes on/flashes but, no razor action).  Philips was great--got on chat and they are mailing me a handle unit in 7-10 days, so I&#x27;ll swap it out and mail back the defective one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those frequent shavers. In fact, I shave in the morning and before I go to bed.  This shaver cuts very close. I have had it for almost a week now and I love it. Closer shaves than my other Norelco that cost twice the price. When washing my face, after I shave, I can feel the smoothness as the washcloth goes across my face. It doesn&#x27;t get caught on any stubble. Great shaver at a great price.</li>
    <li> Always cut myself shaving and when taking blood thinner, that&#x27;s not good. Well, those days are over. Great shave and NO BLEEDING</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT! There&#x27;s nothing wrong so far with my product. Very happy!</li>
    <li> Having been a blade-razor user for more than 70 years, I found this Norelco shaver outstanding from my very first shave! Sorry I didn&#x27;t try a Norelco electric shaver years ago.</li>
    <li> This one was similar to my old one. I only buy norelco products. I also like the fact that it lets you know when the charge has only one shave left and when to replace the heads.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this.  Holds the charge.  I went about a week and a half without having to recharge.  Does a very good job shaving.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday present for my son.  He told me he was very satisfied with it and liked it very much.</li>
    <li> I like it&#x27;s very Good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several Norelco electric razors over the years.  This one has two drawbacks.  One is a noticeable vibration while shaving and the other is a different angle for holding the razor while shaving which is very tiring.  I feel that the replacement blades are priced way too high as well.  Other than that...it shaves.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it and says it&#x27;s the best  Norelco yet and he&#x27;s had many.</li>
    <li> excellent for me love the smoothness of the shave</li>
    <li> I got this for my dad for Christmas, and here&#x27;s what he&#x27;s told me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a quality razor, not some drug store special.&lt;br /&gt;Being able to shave with shaving cream is awesome.  The shave is basically the same as using regular razors.</li>
    <li> works perfect,very close shave,changing from razors to Norelco,i know will take a few time.love it.</li>
    <li> Look no further. You don&#x27;t need all those gizmos and gadgets. The best razor for the money. I can&#x27;t imagine a better shave at any price.</li>
    <li> Received a dusty product with what seemed to be white hair all over the handle, the cleaning brush and the blade cover. No manuals or documents whatsoever. Since the blade looked new, I cleaned it and gave it a go. Did not even work on stubble, Returned for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely dissatisfied with Philips Norelco!</li>
    <li> I paid full price for this razor but received a dusty, scratched product in a non-descript cardboard box that didn&#x27;t work.  This was purchased and fulfilled by Amazon, so nice bait and switch on their part.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco for over 40 years and will continue using them so long as they continue making a quality product.</li>
    <li> Filled the need for my brother happy with product</li>
    <li> Works as good as my 15 year old Norelco.I hope it lasts as long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed by the effectiveness of this razor, especially around the neck and jaw. It&#x27;s easy to clean and each charge lasts a decent amount of time.</li>
    <li> the product was satisfactory thank you very much</li>
    <li> Seems to run slow to me, but does a good job, and the battery does  last a long time, you do not need the more expensive ones , this one does twice the job they do</li>
    <li> Works well, easy to clean, overall great wet/dry razor. My husband uses it daily.</li>
    <li> It was a gift and he liked it very much. He uses it often.</li>
    <li> love it a great replacement for my old norelco</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. Works great what can you say about a shaver?</li>
    <li> I thought with the Norelco name that I should expect a closer shave I am disappointed</li>
    <li> I was expecting a better quality from the trimmer. The other blades work fine as long as you go over the area enough times (not pressing too hard, or it will hurt your skin and not shave all that much)</li>
    <li> Bought it for my dad and he loves it. No problem so far</li>
    <li> My husband can no longer use razor blades to shave with due to Alzheimer&#x27;s.  This shaver allows him to continue to shave himself.  It is easy to clean, holds a good charge and he loves using it.  Thank you Norelco.</li>
    <li> Had to return the product because it was not as good as found elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Just as described, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> husband loves it, it takes a few shaves for skin to get use to</li>
    <li> Overall I am satisfied with Norelco Shaver 4100, although so far it has not provided a closer shave than my old Remington.  It does seem less irritating than other electric razors I have had.  I did not receive a recharging stand. Should that have been included?    That you for the opportunity to submit a review.</li>
    <li> It only comes in handy in emergencies. Everyday usage is not good. Takes too long and it does not remove all hair. I was a bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, long batter life</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. Well made and gets the job done nicely without a hitch.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver that I&#x27;ve had in years. Holds a charge. Most others don&#x27;t hold a charge after a couple of months.</li>
    <li> So far this has been great. It does a good job and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a life-long Norelco user, and when my old razor gave up the ghost after fourteen years, I naturally went looking for another Norelco.  I was wary of buying a rechargeable because I once had a Remmington that would die right in the middle of a shave.  I charged this one up almost three weeks ago, and it hasn&#x27;t slowed down yet.  It has a warning light that&#x27;s supposed to go on when it&#x27;s time for a recharge, and if you do get caught in the middle of a shave, you can charge it enough in five minutes to finish the job and then plug it back in for a complete recharge.  It&#x27;s quieter than my old razor and it gives me a closer shave too.  And now I don&#x27;t have to fiddle with the outlet on the side of the bathroom mirror when I want a shave.  I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for a friend . The guy just loves it , he has it in the car with him. He has a very sensitive skin so I did think that he will have some problems , but nothing . Is a great product, I do recommend this for a person with sensitive skin , it works .</li>
    <li> Very good razor, possibly the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> My 88 year old husband uses this shaver to replace blade shaving. He also shaves his head. Though not quite as smooth as a blade, he enjoys sitting in a chair to shave instead of standing at the sink.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t cordless :( really disappointed</li>
    <li> works great and its like you bought it at the store my boyfriend loves it and you can use it in the shower which is cool</li>
    <li> Works well but feels a bit cheap in the hand. My old one had a heft to it and just buzzed. This one has a lighter feel and the heads chatter a bit.</li>
    <li> Quality one! Great gift for my father. Thanks</li>
    <li> I thought my old Norelco was good, wow this new addition is exceptional. And I can clean it with tepid water</li>
    <li> As advertised. I like it.</li>
    <li> Gift for my husband.  He likes it.  He has Alzheimer&#x27;s, so I can&#x27;t get any specific reactions from him.</li>
    <li> Wonderful purchase, the best thing about it is that the battery does not discharge when not in use. A single charge lasts about three shaves, and the charge holds well even when I used them a few days apart. No problems with design, blades or cleaning.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat a Norelco shaver. I gave 4 stars because you can&#x27;t shave while it&#x27;s plugged in. Other than that it shaves great..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use. But the package is not the same as the picture. The quality of shaver is not good as I expected.</li>
    <li> This replaced an old  Remington dry shaver which I cannot find parts for.  I hope this lasts as long as my old one.  So far enjoy the wet shave.</li>
    <li> Light, holds a charge very well. Like the pop up trimmer. Previous to this shaver, did not like the cordless shavers but this one has changed my mind. Would absolutely recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Close shave. Great value</li>
    <li> Does a good job of getting the facial hair off.  The pop-up trimmer is poorly designed and does NOT do a good job.  The company needs to fix this.</li>
    <li> For the money, good shaver</li>
    <li> Very pleased with quality of the shave it gives and also how much faster I get a close shave than with my older Norelco.</li>
    <li> As described and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> very poor razor lasted less than 1 year.  A waste of money.  Norelco shame on you</li>
    <li> A good product. makes sense. Though dosen&#x27;t remove imbeded hairs as advertised. I still have shaving bumps though just started using it. Maybe my skin is not yet used to it. But it is a good buy</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He has not had any issues with the Phillips Norelco. It trims the hair without pulling. It is a lot easier and faster than using a disposable razor. Easy to clean. Able to use multiple times without having to charge it very often.</li>
    <li> It does a good job,and it lasts a while on a charge, I like that</li>
    <li> I would rate it good.  Light weight, easy to use, holds charge, and overall a good purchase.  Only negative; seems to require several repetitions over same area to get clean shave.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a gift for my husband for Christmas.  However the packaging was not what I expected.  The shaver is dirty and used looking due to the crappy packaging these items are shipped in.  I hate to return items because its such a hassle for me to track down a UPS box in this town.  But I&#x27;m almost considering it.  Don&#x27;t buy this product if your looking to give it as a gift.  As for the razor itself.  I&#x27;m sure it would have done the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> Perfect shaver for my husband.</li>
    <li> Really good for my skin, And shaves great.</li>
    <li> This shavers gives a clean a smooth shave. I always dry shave.</li>
    <li> bought for a friend, so did not open it.</li>
    <li> Not as close as I was hoping but great shaver besides that!</li>
    <li> Bought this model which seemed comparable to my 15 year old Norelco that finally conked out.  Acceptable but not nearly as good a shave.</li>
    <li> it was a great pleasure to open the package sent by Amazon and find the correct product exactly what you had ordered a phillips norelco shaver that started to shave the moment it arrived ,yes i love this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philips shavers for years. This is another great model. In a way it is much better than my previous more expensive model.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace an older Norelco (Philips Norelco 8140XL SpeedXL Men&#x27;s Shaver) I purchased several years ago.  So far, I am quite pleased with the shave I am getting for my tough whiskers.  This seems very maintainable and seems to hold a charge longer than my old shaver.  It was also cheaper than what I paid several years ago for my older Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how you can rinse this out under hot water to clean out the &amp;#34;after shave&amp;#34; residue.  I like this kind of easy maintenance combined with the nice shave this gives.  I looked at other shavers that were more expensive.  Quite frankly, the prices were not justified for the &amp;#34;bells and whistles&amp;#34; on the more expensive.  This shaver falls into a nice &amp;#34;mid-range&amp;#34; category with what I consider to be &amp;#34;all you really need for a nice shave&amp;#34; combined with nice battery life and maintenance features.  It even comes with the ability to do a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; as well as a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the lack of a case for this shaver (like the one that came with my older Norelco).  I think Norelco&#x27;s just being cheap for not at least including some kind of case like they used to do.  If it wasn&#x27;t for this, I&#x27;d probably have given it five stars.  Aside from that, this seems to be a solid, well-performing shaver with all you need.</li>
    <li> I usually shave with a standard blade.  No more!!  I can shave while tying my tie!&lt;br /&gt;Very quiet and cleans quickly and takes to water!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for just about a month, but it&#x27;s performing even better than I expected.  I&#x27;m up to 18 shaves now without getting the low battery notice, and the shave is even closer than I was getting with my previous electric shaver (another Norelco, which I bought three-and-a-half years ago; it&#x27;s now my backup shaver).</li>
    <li> My second one in two years. Battery would not charge and user replacement is difficult for most (requires soldering). But the razor works and performs so well that it is still worth the price.</li>
    <li> Arrived as planned and meet expectations.</li>
    <li> nice gift for my hubby</li>
    <li> IT WORKS OKAY. NOT TOO M,UCH BETTER THAN MY 20 YEAR OLD MODEL BUT SOME IMPROVEMENT.</li>
    <li> It is the worst shaver I have ever owned.  I have owned 2 different Norelco plus one other copy of  a Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;With the 4100 it takes me twice as long to shave and it is never satisfactory.  My wife has even pointed out areas of my face that she insists I have missed and I didn&#x27;t.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
    <li> The commodity is good，I love it very much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about 8 months now and it&#x27;s not bad for a budget shaver. With a fresh set of blades, I got a shave that was *almost* as close as a manual, but not quite as close. That said, it certainly gets close enough for smooth cheeks on date night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco recommends you replace the blades every year, but my face tells me I&#x27;m about due for a fresh set and I&#x27;ve only got 8 months on them, so that&#x27;s a little disappointing. I shave my beard every morning, so I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m causing it any more use than it was intended for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being waterproof is pretty nice for cleaning it out every now and then. I&#x27;ve never gotten the hang of wet shaving though. If I just shave in the shower, it doesn&#x27;t slide along my skin as smoothly and if I take the time to lather up with cream, well, I might as well just grab my manual razor at that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It charges in about an hour and doesn&#x27;t need charging for about a month under daily use, but it would be nice to be able to shave while it was plugged in. That&#x27;s one thing I liked about my old Remington that I can no longer find blades for. It doesn&#x27;t have a battery meter that lets you know how low your battery is getting like my Remington did either. That would be super helpful in determining if you need to charge it before going on a trip or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not bad and I&#x27;m happy with it, but when this one bites the dust, I may go for one with a few more of the options I liked in my Remington.</li>
    <li> My husband has always used a Norelco.  He says his new one is what he wanted, and it is nice that they always improving the Norelco.</li>
    <li> Works as good if not better than my old razor.</li>
    <li> Very nice a quick delivery&lt;br /&gt;Tanks......</li>
    <li> clean but time-consuming</li>
    <li> Much better than the previous model I had, which did not have the sideburn trimmer.</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves his new razor. I love how smooth it gets his face!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using razor for my entire life and this is my first electronic shaver and I LOVE it. Clean and close shave without pull and cut even neck difficult area to shave.</li>
    <li> Husband is military.....loves that it&#x27;s wet/dry.</li>
    <li> It gives a really good, close, comfortable shave, wet and dry.  It has a good &#x27;grip&#x27; and is light to use. It charges quickly and hold the charge for a long time.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This shaver is great to have. It gives a close and clean shave and is easy to maintain. The charge lasts for weeks and is easily charged with the included adapter. The price is very affortable and will compete with shavers twice its price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for about a month and am happy with the shave and battery life.  I use it to shave my face or touch up after shaving with a blade in the shower.  Based on that type of usage the battery has lasted for the first month without a recharge.  The shave is close without any skin irritation.  I have been using an electric shaver for about 20 years so my skin is accustomed to an electric shaver.  This unit works as well as any of my previous shavers and much better than foil shavers I have tried.  I would recommend this shaver as a good value based on performance/cost.  For new users it may take a week or so to get used to an electric shaver.  Skin moisturizer is recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Very smooth shaving.</li>
    <li> Bought this product to replace an electric shaver I had more many years.  I was pleasantly surprised as to the wonderful improvements made.  This shaver can be used wet or dry.  It can be cleaned with brushes, for a good deep cleaning, or by rinsing it off with warm water.</li>
    <li> My 20 year old son, who has Down&#x27;s Syndrome, is shaving his beard himself, thanks to this razor! He gets a good shave with no irritation &amp; he has sensitive skin.  I am so glad we purchased this for him to try! This has been a boost for his self esteem and another step for independence! This is a great shaver for everyone!</li>
    <li> This my fourth norlco razor and they get cheaper build every time.but they still work fairly good</li>
    <li> love it can barely hear it running works like a champ smooth shave. Its was for my husband now his chin is as smooth as a baby&#x60;s bottom !</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband, he&#x27;s always wanted an electric shaver but his beard is so tough they just couldn&#x27;t give him the close shave he wanted.  This Norelco is wonderful, a smooth close shave every time.  If I had known how good this shaver was I would have bought it for him years ago.</li>
    <li> Worked as as expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for 30 years and this thing is worthless. I have to make 2-3 passes over my face/neck to get most of the stubble off. I have to then use a manual razor to clean up what this thing left behind. Using this razor, it takes about 15 minutes to shave rather than the 5 that I was accustomed to before. I paid less than half the cost of this razor for my last Remington and it worked well for over 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a mountain man with thick coarse hair either, my hair is relatively fine. I gave this thing 2 weeks to determine if it was just how I was using it (the head and cutting blade assembly is different than my last razor) and I got the same shoddy shave on day 14 as I did on day 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving heads require multiple passes to achieve a &#x27;poor/decent&#x27; shave that then needs to be cleaned up manually.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer attachment requires multiple passes to get an even cut.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving dry leaves skin raw with only a &#x27;poor/decent&#x27; shave.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving wet reduces the shave quality even further, so that I have to clean up more missed hairs and stubble.</li>
    <li> Razor is OK. Didn&#x27;t come with a carrying case.</li>
    <li> Excellent stuff I am very satisfied and I will let other people know about your product.</li>
    <li> Purchased as replacement for old, corded Norelco.  Very happy with this product.  Battery life is far better than what I remember for Norelco with NiCad battery that I used prior to corded unit.  Charging time for Li-Ion battery was as stated in description.  No complaints, so far.</li>
    <li> My face is very happy now since i use this. In the past I always hate razor my face day by day but now I can do it whit out problems</li>
    <li> My husband has used the Phillips Norelco for years and loved it.  When his old one finally gave out, we naturally bought the same type.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t give as good a shave as the old one.  After shaving, he still has stubble no matter how hard he presses.  Fortunately, he is blond and the stubble doesn&#x27;t show too much.  The trimmer works fine.</li>
    <li> If I could give 0 stars I would. This item stopped functioning within days after the return policy ended.  It was only a month old.  The item was used for shaving my husband&#x27;s head.  His hair is very fine and few, so there was no reason for the product to stop functioning considering it is supposed to be for much denser and harder facial hair.</li>
    <li> thus far razer is great, can&#x27;t leave it plugged in like the old nicad but holding charge, shaves well,nothing like having new heads</li>
    <li> Great shaver for the price. I like being able to rinse it out under running water. Also, having the option to use shaving cream is nice. Very convenient product.</li>
    <li> this product works like a charm....I have only had it for a couple of weeks and I am happy with it....I have used in in and out of the shower with no problems.</li>
    <li> Really docent have a lot of power and docent get all the hairs like I would expect</li>
    <li> very smooth, have had Norelco all my life. Lets just say I am a old guy. This was for my husband.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband for his birthday. If he uses it every day it works very well. If he skips a day and whiskers get to long it don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I recommend 1000%.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver in several years.  I never was much of a fan of them, until now.  This shaver cuts nearly as closely as a blade, and it is so much more comfortable.  The wet dry shaver with soap or shaving cream makes for the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.  No more razor burn.  I made the switch for religious reasons (I&#x27;m becoming more observant again, and observant Jews aren&#x27;t supposed to use a blade), but just for comfort alone I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever go back to a blade after this shaver.</li>
    <li> not very good ,my dad says it&#x27;s just so-so,the  shaving is not clean,it seems its power is not enough</li>
    <li> The shaver does not work properly, it is not sharp enough and have have shavers from this brand including this model number before. It is broken.</li>
    <li> Seems like a closer, smoother shave could be achieved</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Norelco shaver.  as always, it gives a great shave.  if it had a gage to show how much charge was left or you could shave while plugged in, it would get 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Nothing like an old fashion safety razor. But for quick shaves when you are in a hurry, this does an excellent job. Nice pop up trimmer and battery last well. Haven&#x27;t had any issues. Been using it a month now to get used to it.Great Shaver!</li>
    <li> I bought the shaver since I get bad razor burn but have to shave everyday for work. The shaver is good but only gets close enough if I go over the area multiple times. This causes enough friction to give me razor burn.</li>
    <li> it was given as a gift but the person who recevied it lieks the close cut of the shaver, very quiet when running. with him having coarse hair the clipper attacchment doesn&#x27;t do anything for him. but he enjoys the rotating head shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver.  I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco for about 2 decades &amp; this is my 5th one.  (One doesn&#x27;t count because I gave up on it.  It was GyroFlex 2D, where the entire head moves independently from the body.  It gave a slow &amp; terrible shave.  The heads did not protrude through their holder as far as the one piece type &amp; may be the reason.  Nor could you just plug it in, it had a dedicated base that just took up room.)  This shaver shaves fast &amp; close. I use it dry &amp; have no rash or complaints.  Using 100% clear aloe gel as an aftershave works great &amp; helps your skin at the same time; I usually wipe the residue off my hands by running them through my wet hair &amp; it acts like a mild styling gel: it&#x27;s great stuff.  The head holds enough whiskers that it only needs to be emptied &amp; cleaned when it&#x27;s time to charge, usually about every 2 weeks as a rule w/ these shavers.  Take it in the shower &amp; rinse it off.  (The one that doesn&#x27;t count had to be emptied after each use.)  As for the break-in period, turn it on &amp; walk away from it after the 1st charge.  Let it run until the battery runs out &amp; then recharge it.  This allows the cutters to run-in to their cups &amp; the next time you use it, it&#x27;s like you broke it in for a few weeks.  This is as good as any of the ones that cost 2X as much.  Highly recommended whether it&#x27;s your 1st Norelco or your next one.</li>
    <li> Better than my old Norelco. Does a good job, long lasting battery! Good deal.</li>
    <li> Shaver was everything I expected.  Small shaving heads could be a problem for some people.  Charges quickly.  All in all good product.  Could use a cover for shaver to protect it when traveling.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my husband, for his birthday.He was very happy to have his own. He had used our sons that he got for Christmas, and loved it.</li>
    <li> Since the 1950s this is about my 12th Norelco shaver.  I have always been happy with the shave they give me and this one is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it light weight, and comfortable to hold, it is very quiet and gives me a close comfortable shave without the mess of water and lather over a sink.  If I&#x27;m in a rush, I can shave in the car or anywhere else since it is portable.  The lithium batteries will hold out for more than a week without a recharge so I can take it on a long fishing trip or camp grounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model came without a storage pouch, but I seldom used one anyway, however, for a first time buyer, this might be a detraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One trick to learn while using these shavers is not to skip too many days.  It is very tough to scour through 4 or five days of growth all at once.  I never skip more than a day, even on trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect to get 2 or more years of use without changing blades.  The batteries should hold out for at least that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great shaver for any active man.  Sometimes I&#x27;m tempted to switch brands but I never can come up with a good reason.</li>
    <li> It reminded me of a $20 shaver my mother bought me when I was a teenager and it performed the same. The razor isn&#x27;t particularly bad, but it&#x27;s not good enough to justify the price. I&#x27;ve had to use my Andis T-blade to clean up residue left by this razor, and the T-blade actually has given me a better shave. They say you get what I pay for, but I though $60 was a reasonable price for a shaver. I guess I was wrong, but I&#x27;m definitely returning this product.</li>
    <li> i never thought in a hundred years i would like a electric razor, it shaves all hair off so close to the skin.. i think this is the best thing i have bought off the internet hands down...</li>
    <li> This is, hands down, positively the best Norelco shaver I have owned and used. I have used Norelco shavers my whole life with the &amp;#34;8 series&amp;#34; being my last shaver before this one.  What I like is that I don&#x27;t have to go over and over the same area on my face as much to get a good shave. Whatever is different about the design of the heads is not readily apparent to me. But it just plain works great.  I think it is priced decently too.</li>
    <li> After just one use with shaving cream in the shower, my new Best Friend!!! AAA++++</li>
    <li> Terrible, doesn&#x27;t shave worth a damn, and costs way too much.</li>
    <li> So much better than my old Remington that had worn through its head.&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco is also so quiet compared to the Remington.  Almost a shave in complete quiet.&lt;br /&gt;Shave is very close and smooth without any skin irritation.</li>
    <li> Item was here in a real fast time. Item was just what I wanted. Thank You</li>
    <li> My Husband has abandoned his conventional razor. He now neeeds a stand for it!</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver, should have bought one long ago.</li>
    <li> amazing speed to China. so good so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Phillips Norelco electric shavers for decades and find this new one as good as advertised.</li>
    <li> it was a gift that somebody already had one that liked it.</li>
    <li> Did not include travel case and cream as described</li>
    <li> Exceeds my expectations. Good battery life and great comfortatble shave.</li>
    <li> Compared to the Braun foil razor I just replaced with this one it is great. It gives a good close shave without irritating my skin. The only thing that might make it better would be some sort of light to let you know the battery status. But I&#x27;ve used mine over a week and not have it die. But I suggest you charge it about a nice a week.</li>
    <li> It does not work properly and has not a Philips&#x27;s formal product package.</li>
    <li> just what my husband wanted.  fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Very good. You can buy it without any apprehension</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD,it&#x27;s my best shaver that I have used</li>
    <li> A great shaver...and the fact that you can use it in the shower, really is a nice feature!! Gives a very close shave as well!!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with original box and the seal already been opened before I got it. It just like someone return back. Also there is a lot of dust inside!!!</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this shaver! He&#x27;s in the Navy so he has to shave everyday which can make his skin get pretty aggravated. When he uses this shaver though his skin is less aggravated. I love it because it collects all the hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it all over the sink. Plus it&#x27;s so easy to clean out you just dump the hair and rinse. I thought that it came with a stand when I ordered it but it doesn&#x27;t. However they do sell one separately. I probably would have bought the stand at the same time if I had realized. I also like how this comes with a little brush to help clean out along with the option to pop up the clipper. It&#x27;s perfect for when my husband needs to clean up around his ears if he wasn&#x27;t able to get a haircut before going to work.&lt;br /&gt;All in all it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Not the greatest shaver out in the market</li>
    <li> Gives a good, close shave.  I like this shaver a lot.  The only small upgrade that it needs&lt;br /&gt;is to allow more than 50 minutes of shaving time before you have to recharge it.  Increasing&lt;br /&gt;that time would get this a 5-Star rating.  Basically, this needs to be charged once per-week,&lt;br /&gt;if you shave everyday.</li>
    <li> I have owned assorted (mid-priced) Norelco razors over the years.  I bought the AT810 to replace a Remington whose battery was dying on me.  So far I have no complaints, especially because the AT810 was purchased on deep discount ($40).</li>
    <li> This razor was not new. I t was used and had soap residue on the razor.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> It works very well and is quiet while in use.</li>
    <li> Works Great, I have had no problems</li>
    <li> Bought fir Christmas for my husband he loves it.</li>
    <li> The result is not what I expected</li>
    <li> They only sent me the mahine and brush, I was disappointed not to recieve the cream and bag. And the product did not come in the same bag as advertised.</li>
    <li> Really nice shaver , you will be pleased !</li>
    <li> Smooth  close shave.  No need to spend twice the amount for the other fufu  models</li>
    <li> Good shaver.  I&#x27;ve used various Norelco razors over the years that were similar to this one.  This isn&#x27;t much different than one from 20 years ago, but I was looking for the same thing I had since I&#x27;ve liked it so much.  This uses the HQ8 heads which are OK but I prefer the HQ9 heads for better coverage.  My biggest gripe is you can&#x27;t use the shaver if it&#x27;s plugged in and charging.  It doesn&#x27;t have a gauge telling you the batter level and if I don&#x27;t realize the battery it&#x27;s low and runs out, I can&#x27;t plug it in and continue to use it.  My older model would work when plugged in and other models used to have a gauge.  Perhaps its a safety issue since this shaver is designed to be use when wet and could cause a shock if plugged in.  You probably can get these features in higher priced models, but I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the price.  To me, a $200 shave isn&#x27;t that much better than a $50 shave with this razor</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. It&#x27;s top quality, water resistant, and easy to clean. It&#x27;s not the cheapest priced, but it is one of the best.</li>
    <li> no different then the model I have had for the last eight years. Expected major changes.</li>
    <li> Husband replaced 7 year old NORELCO.  Never changed cutting heads in old model and thought it was time for a new one.  Unfortunately, new one does not cut closer than old one.  Don&#x27;t know if a more expensive model would have been better.  Been using new one for almost a month so it&#x27;s broken in.</li>
    <li> My Norelco shaver of five years usage was very good but finally broke.  This one is no where near as good.  It is noiser and comes without a carrying case.  After about three weeks usage it still does not provide the close shave or comfort level of my old one.  I needed a shaver quickly so I didn&#x27;t try to return this one but I don&#x27;t recommend it. .</li>
    <li> Great Razor.  Close comfortable shave.  Well worth the price.  Better than razors that cost much more ie: Braun which i have..</li>
    <li> Absolutely superb. It has all the qualities I was looking for...side burn trimmer, smooth shaver, and long charge life.</li>
    <li> I thought I was supposed to get carrying case with it. DID NOT GET IT. Doesn&#x27;t cut whiskers as expected.</li>
    <li> I was a razor shaver for over 50 years and will only use this when my broken wrist gets out of a cast. Then I am back to the razor. The electric shaver does not cut like a razor but it is convenient and will not slit my throat when I use my left hand to shave.</li>
    <li> I just had this delivered on Wednesday and used it on Thursday night.  I am coming from a 4 year old Architect that never cut as good as this one does. The old one cost $150 -this one was $60.  I was skeptical about how well it would work, but one try convinced me. First, it&#x27;s way more quiet. Second, it cut hair on every part of my face easily, even my neck.  Third, it wasn&#x27;t expensive.  Get it now.</li>
    <li> Another excellent product from Philips. I really like how fast I can shave with it, no wasting time. I also like that I can shave dry or with shaving cream and water depending on how fast I need to get it done.&lt;br /&gt;Recharges after one hour is another plus, easy to clean too. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> works for intended use</li>
    <li> Works good doesn&#x27;t get as close as a regular shaver of course</li>
    <li> Have owned these Philips shavers from the &#x27;70s and this is the best one certainly for the price. Dry or wet it works great. The charger cord is intended to have a lose fit so you will not take it in the shower. Great product.</li>
    <li> Have used cordless razor&#x27;s for years. This is the best I&#x27;ve bought so far. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase especially for the price!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!  Great product</li>
    <li> As per my grandfather, I have nothing against. Haven&#x27;t noticed it to be superior. It does the job.</li>
    <li> Great, I liked it. Thank you...</li>
    <li> How AWESOME, that Amazon not only offers great prices on great items! They also offer, for a very nominal price, gift wrapping! So my Husband&#x27;s birthday gift was gift wrapped, with a card, (personalized by &amp;#34;me&amp;#34;!) I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased!</li>
    <li> This is the razor I&#x27;ve been waiting for: clean shave, no irritation and fully aquatic razor.</li>
    <li> I have an older Remington this shaver out performs it. I only shave once a day but after 1st charge I have not recharge it&#x27;s been over 30 days&lt;br /&gt;And it cuts long &amp; short hair</li>
    <li> Beats the hell out of shaving with a razor!  Fast, clean and easy to use!  Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Norelco Shaver is excellent, however Cord used to recharge Shaver does not fit in to Shaver in a secure manner leaving recharging of Shaver a constant problem.&lt;br /&gt;Charging Cords should be replaced</li>
    <li> If you are thinking of buying a higher end Norelco shaver, to get an articulated head for a closer shave, save your money and use your hand to move the shaver about your face!  Same difference!</li>
    <li> Performs as advertised, does a better job than any other electric razor I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband who states it&#x27;s the best electric shaver he&#x27;s ever had.  I like the results, too.</li>
    <li> This is the type of shaver I&#x27;ve used since the beginning. I&#x27;ve tried blades, Braun, Wahl, and even a top of the line Norelco ArciTec but I keep coming back to this style Norelco. I have used it both wet and dry and prefer dry. I miss too many hairs when using it wet, but it is a comfortable shave for certain.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift, and our son loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric razor for my 19-year-old son, he said he did not want to use a regular razor anymore. So, I was impressed with the Philips Norelco description. My son LOVES it! He likes the fact that you can use it wet with shaving cream, or dry. Easy to clean. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing razor. I have used Norelco for decades but this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I charged it when it arrived two months ago. I don&#x27;t shave every day (I&#x27;m retired) but more like every 36 hours or so. I have only had to charge it once since then. I can shave in about two minutes with it. I have a very coarse beard and my face is getting more wrinkled as I age so that a two-day growth results in hairs that a straight razor slides right past, especially when going over wrinkles around my mouth. Not with this razor. It&#x27;s sharp, efficient and a great find. I haven&#x27;t tried using water or lotion but I know from using other Norelco razors with that feature that it can result in a very close shave. Haven&#x27;t needed that with this one, yet, although I think that a replacement head after a year might be just the ticket to keep it as reliable as it has been so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW: Having used it for 9 months at about this same pace, it&#x27;s very dull. Needs a new replacement head and I can&#x27;t figure out which one to buy. It is taking a long time to shave (5-10 minutes) and I need to go over and over my beard in several directions. The charge still lasts a long time but the thing is only 9 or 10 months old and I shave only once every 36-48 hours. Downgraded from 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Gives a good shave and is easier than other brands an models to clean.</li>
    <li> the packing is too simple and humble</li>
