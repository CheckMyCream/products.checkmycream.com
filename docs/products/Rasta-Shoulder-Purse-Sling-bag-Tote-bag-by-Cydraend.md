<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Button came off 1st day...nice bag but in need of better tailoring</li>
    <li> I bought this bag for my girlfriend who does not want to carry a purse. It was the perfect size, has a lot of pockets and is very durable.</li>
    <li> Beautiful bag! My daughter will love it.</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these before and it was lovely so I ordered another for my friend and it was nothing like the first, the colors were badly faded. the stitching was very poor, the entire thing is a huge disappointment and my friend is very upset and cannot use it!!</li>
    <li> I love this item and it is just what I was looking for. I received this item in a very timely fashion.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipment!  Great for a tall person!  Strap is super long!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this bag for less than a week and the button popped off. I love this bag a lot except that part</li>
    <li> SUCH A CUTE AND DURABLE BAG! GREAT FOR PACKING UP MY THINGS AND WALKING TO WORK. I LOVE THIS BAG!!!</li>
    <li> Its a good bag but the only thing is the button. The button is already trying to fall off so I have to sew it back. Other than that, good bag.</li>
    <li> I got this product on the exact day that they said and i like it alot. Is is kind of cheaply made but what do you expect for that price. Over all i am happy with it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and she loves her purse.  Happy that we gave her this bag.  Very useful.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The bag is nice but,  it has to be worn across your body because the strap is so long.  I have gotten many compliments on it. There are no pockets on the inside and the botton fell off within a week... it&#x27;s a ok bag...</li>
    <li> We got this for our granddaughter because she is getting into the Rasta.  This tote was much bigger than I thought and it&#x27;s really nice</li>
    <li> The best! My daughter received this as a birthday gift!! She uses it for most of her school stuff! Its the perfect purse/ junk bag for her!</li>
    <li> Product  was received extremely fast. Description of product was dead on perfect. This was a birthday gift for a friend and she loved it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this bad for a few months and I love it, but when I first received it I noticed the strap was outrageously long so I had to safety pin it to make it shorter, and I&#x27;m even pretty tall!  Otherwise, the rasta colors have kind of faded and discolored a little bit, but nothing too major.</li>
    <li> This bag is extremely simple but nice. If you like rasta colors then you will love it. I like that it has a lot of room for many things and the outside pocket is beneficial. It fits nicely on the hip and feels comfortable.</li>
    <li> This bag is ugly. I was so exited when I ordered it. Its way to big. It only has rasta on one side of the strap. This bag is huge and bulky and ugly. Im going to have to try and sew it or something it is way to big. It&#x27;s really wide and doesn&#x27;t look good. I don&#x27;t like it. I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if I saw it in a store.</li>
    <li> i love it but its a bit bigger than i expected and the button fell off rather soon though i suppose i can sew it back on</li>
    <li> I received my bag and I love it!! Perfect size and shipping was very fast!</li>
    <li> The bag I love! The style and everything&lt;br /&gt; Two things I&#x27;m not happy about is an inside pocket and the fact I&#x27;ve only had it for maybe 2 weeks and it&#x27;s already coming apart. Like the stitching is coming undone. Maybe invest in better string?</li>
    <li> Somewhat thin fabric, but seems fairly sturdy. Gorgeous bag, haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to use it yet but i plan to! Rasta colors look bright and the bag is the perfect size. Large enough to fit a standard binder for school or work or whatever you need it for. Probably large enough for several, actually. Overall I like it!</li>
    <li> I bought this bag for my girlfriend, she loved it. She&#x27;s a Bob Marley fan so what&#x27;s not to love. But like everyone else the button did fall off within a few days. I got more upset than she did. Good thing we found the button she put it back on heslrself. I recommend this bag for but I also recommend if you do buy it might want to secure the button yourself. It will fall off.</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS BAG ON A WHIM AND I AM SO GLAD I DID. I LOVE IT, THE BAG IS THIN BUT IT IS NOT BAD FOR ONLY $13. IT&#x27;S REALLY CUTE AND THIS COLOR COMBO IS MY FAV!!!!! YOU CANNOT TELL IN THE PHOTO, BUT THE BAG HAS A LITTLE POCKET ON THE STRAP AND IT ALSO HAS A ZIPPER WHICH IS A PLUS</li>
    <li> Very well made. I didn&#x27;t like only a button holds it together; but I really like the way it looks.</li>
    <li> I love my bag, big, soft and also my colors! Again I just love it! Many compliments on it, too! BEAUTIFUL!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I expected better from it, it just feels kind of... cheap, for lack of a better word, The button fell off minutes after I opened the package and it&#x27;s close to impossible to find anything in the bag. I can see why certain people like this but the strap is much too big and it just doesn&#x27;t look as good in person than in the pictures. I&#x27;m still using it until I get a new one, it holds up pretty well but if it tips over literally everything will fall out.</li>
    <li> my bag got to me within a week of ordering it. the only thing i have to complain about is that it&#x27;s a little too long. i&#x27;m 5&#x27;2 &amp; it goes a little past my booty but it&#x27;s not that bad. a lot of the reviews said the button fell off shortly after using it but mine is still there after about 2 weeks. i am so in love with my new bag &amp; would highly recommend this to anyone else.</li>
    <li> Its nice but the pocket ripped after 2days. But other than that it was okay its really light and comfortable</li>
    <li> Shoulder handle ripped.</li>
    <li> I love this bag its easy to carry and very stylish...I get a lot of compliments on it.. the color are also very vibrant even after several washes</li>
    <li> Great bag, good quality, and great price!  What more could you want?</li>
    <li> honestly i cant say anything bad about this bag i kept reading the reviews and everyone kept writing that the button falls off in my case it wasnt true its still on ! im obbsesed with this bag amazing!</li>
    <li> very nice and has plenty of room in it !! love the stunning colors</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good if you like big bags. It&#x27;s very vibrantly coloured, arrived several days before it was estimated,and it also has several different pockets to keep small things. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this bag!</li>
    <li> Flimsy fabric/sewing job.</li>
    <li> Thank for my product that I purchased. I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Just like the title says...it was more than I expected. Buuut it could&#x27;ve been more specific on the details of the product such as that it wasn&#x27;t a zip bag instead a button. But in the end I am still satisfied.</li>
    <li> Holy thick strap.... jeez.  I love Rasta colors and haven&#x27;t had an issue with the button yet, but the strap is so thick...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandchild and she liked it very much  the kids are really into Bob Marley awesome</li>
    <li> The first day I received it the button came off</li>
    <li> Very cute, and the perfect size. Only complaint is that the little button on the front fell off the second day of using it, but it was very easy to sew back on. I love this bag :)</li>
    <li> Very sharp and stylish-but was a bit too short strapped for me.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved it</li>
    <li> This bag was exactly what I was looking for and I love the length of the bag. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4 and the bag stops right by my butt, which is where I wanted it for the boho look. I&#x27;ve had it for about 7 months, and will be purchasing another one soon.</li>
    <li> I loveeee love this bag, it holds so much stuff without getting all bulky, and it looks adorable,  especially if your short. Lol would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a good bag I really like it I have had no problems with the bag except the button falling off but it&#x27;s not hard to put it back on other then that this bag is great. Put to much stuff in it...it will get heavy so not to much stuff. But great bag!</li>
    <li> I really love this bag, it is of great quality and is a very good deal for the price, unique in character. Item arrived ahead of scheduled delivery time. Purse is much bigger than it seems, very room, decent length for shoulder strap even for a taller woman. strap is more so on the wider side but it is nice and does not seem to have potential to cut into shoulder as some purse straps can. Everything seems well stitched. has a top zipper that is smooth, also has a smaller inside pocket that also has a zipper. outside flap pocket on front of bag is nice, and there&#x27;s also a smaller flap pocket on the strap. colors are vibrant and really pop. very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> The button to close the flap was poorly sewn - after reattaching the button and adding a couple extra velcro strips to keep the opening on the bag from fallning open it was a pretty nice bag.  A gift for my 15 year old daughter who loved the bag.  but no points for the quality of the sewing the original button and lack of additional means of keeping the bag from falling open.</li>
    <li> Love my purse. Received product fast and as advertised.</li>
    <li> This bag is beautiful and it&#x27;s made to last for awhile. It&#x27;s big, sturdy, and i love the pocket on the outside of the bag.  I&#x27;ve had so many people ask me where i got this bag from. I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite bag in the entire world!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;And I want to buy like 4 more for when this one wears out haha</li>
    <li> Its a little on the cheap looking side</li>
    <li> I would really like one of these bags but there is no shipping to uk why is this :(</li>
    <li> I just got this purse today, and THIS PURSE is nothing but great! Whoever said there was something wrong with the button was very wrong, the button is good and won&#x27;t fall off. The material that it&#x27;s made of is strong but not rough or too thic. There&#x27;s a bunch of room &amp; if you like Rasta colours you&#x27;ll love this, it was an extremely great buy!</li>
    <li> i love this bag its so big &amp; im 5&#x27;2 so it kinda goes pass my butt haha but that&#x27;s OK&lt;br /&gt;its diff kinda hard to match clothes with it but i still love it i&#x27;m so excited to start using it (:</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my daughter. She loves anything Rasta and was very excited to receive this item. She started using it immediately. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I like my bag, but I was disappointed when the button fell off on the first day that it arrived.  It was disappointing.</li>
    <li> I really love it of rasta soulder purse sling bag tote bag so cool it. I sure love it. It&#x27;s really awesome..</li>
    <li> Started of great before i hand waashed it. ill say it again HAND WASHED. All the colors faded, the buttons feel off not to mention the zipper was busted from the beginning. Complete waste of money. Its a beautiful bag but not after breaking only 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Roomy and exactly as described. What a good deal! I will be buying another for my friend! Thanks for everything!</li>
    <li> I got my bag on time and so excited till I opened it!.. my bag looks like a arts and craft project from pre-schoolers! The stitching is crap the bag was dirty and the lion looks like it&#x27;s sad \\&quot;literally!\\&quot; It&#x27;s a waste of money I wish I never would of purchased it! I&#x27;ve never had a problem buying anything from amazon till now :( Purchase at your own risk but I highly recommend you don&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> Very nice! Well made and plenty of room.</li>
    <li> I love this bag. My very favorite. I have gotten new bags but always go back to using this one. I read the reviews about the button and it wasn&#x27;t sewin in very well so I just fixed that right away. No big deal at all. The bag washes up nice too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great purse, but I had it for a few weeks and the button fell off and the bottom liner on the inside started to rip. The rasta band wasn&#x27;t around the back like the picture. It lasted me a while but I ended up getting a new one.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it!</li>
    <li> I though this bag was crocheted instead of fabric.  I guess I did not read the description or something.  It is cute but the fabric was not what I&#x27;d expected.</li>
    <li> This bag is, like previous reviewers stated, way bigger than you realize. It is a full sized handbag. I was hoping for something small for weekend use, but I like it, so I&#x27;m keeping it. It is made very well and looks great. I haven&#x27;t used it enough to experience the button falling off issue that many reviewrers mentioned, but will reinforce it anyway.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.  Seems well constructed.</li>
    <li> not good for my pet....he doesn&#x27;t like it....too big for him. maybe I can find another use for it.&lt;br /&gt;just not good for me</li>
    <li> I bought this for my trip to Jamaica. The size is nice and large. There are also some handy little pockets to use. But when it got damp/wet, the colors ran together immediately. It was almost like a water based paints running together.Not impressed with that, but it did hold up otherwise.</li>
    <li> love it this was cool nice song and cheap  i think everyone needs this item you will love it i do</li>
    <li> This is more a bag the a sling purse. IT is pretty big. Has no pockets and the button fell off within min. great colors though</li>
    <li> Love this bag very well made and good material for the price.. Get a lot of compliments on the bag</li>
    <li> I love this bag perfect for what I use it for button did come off first day so I sewed a new rod style on it and it looks great</li>
    <li> The closure is a button that was not securely sewn on. Other than that it was ok for the price.</li>
    <li> The bag arrived fast. The item was just as the seller described. The strap is nice and long just as I hoped. The only problem is that the button for the closure fell off like day 2 of using the bag.</li>
    <li> Strangers stop me to ask where I purchased this bag. It is durable, made of quality material. I receive many complements.</li>
