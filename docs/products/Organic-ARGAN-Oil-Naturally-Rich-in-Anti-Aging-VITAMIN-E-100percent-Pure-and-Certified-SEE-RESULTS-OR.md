<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Im 40 and have long straight hair with lots of highlights. I go to the beach every weekend which is very bad on my hair, cause it gets very dry, frizzy and matte. I started using the argain oil and voila. My hair looks shinny and healthy. On the sking I have used too but it is hard to give a review do to the fact that I also use lots of other creams for my face but I definetly give a 10 to this product for the hair!!!</li>
    <li> argan oil, what else needs to be said.  For aging skin, it&#x27;s a little bit of the Fountain of Youth.&lt;br /&gt;This particular bottle was priced well and delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> Great product and excellent customer service. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The oil is great &amp; is helping me combat the dryness of the weather in Las Vegas. Highly recommended over other commercial brands.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Have been using on my hair and skin. Very moisturizing and has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Works great, I highly recommend argon oil. My 55 year old skin is soft and smooth. A little goes a long way with this small bottle, this oil will last much longer than those expensive skin care lotions.</li>
    <li> Great product, I probably used a bit too much so didn&#x27;t see full effect over time.</li>
    <li> So far I like it.. I haven&#x27;t been using it for long.... I like to try a product for about a month before I give a true review.. But, so far so good.. 😊</li>
    <li> Love it in my bath and through my clean hair. Delicious!!!</li>
    <li> Works great I use it with my essential oils and love it</li>
    <li> Every night before bed I apply a small amount of argan oil to my brittle fingernails ,my calloused heels, my &amp;#34;rusty&amp;#34; elbows, and my super-sensitive skinned face. I  am very pleased with the results I am getting.</li>
    <li> I give this product 5 stars .I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed the difference on my facial hair. I also put a few drops in my shampoo and my hair feels healthier and stronger. Not to mention the great assistance that the seller offers.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for all your help eve Hansen.</li>
    <li> 100% organic, nice results in a few days: Im finding less and less lose hair when I brush everyday.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s all I have to say: at any department or beauty store, there will be expensive Argan oil that has more red dye in it than actual argan kernel oil. This stuff is 100%, cheaper and I love it and will continue to buy it from this company! I use it as a facial moisturizer and it has really helped with my acne too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully on my face and my skin is glowing! I love this oil so much!</li>
    <li> The best product ever. Seriously!&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Fast delivery. Fabulous product. Have already reordered.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel smooth. Erases damaged</li>
    <li> I am so very happy I bought this product!   I&#x27;ve been using this product on  the skin on my neck for 3 years  (67 yrs young)) - It truly has kept  the creping at bay for the past years - and I woke this morning ( a dry winter day) to find my neck supple...(67 yrs young!) I tend not to believe the claims that &amp;#34;in just ten days....&amp;#34;  But, this worked for me  - and I am going to let my friends and sisters know about it.  I highly recommend it  - just try one bottle....  - I say WOW.</li>
    <li> Smell good. Work very well on my skin anyway</li>
    <li> I have  enjoyed the Argan oil very much. I use it everyday on my face and it is amazing. My skin is very sensitive and I have to be careful what kind of lotions I use. So I tried the Argan oil and for probably 3 weeks now and no breakouts. I am out of town today and I forgot my oil at home and I am missing it. My face feels really dry and I put on the lotion I normally used before I bought the Argan oil.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Would totally buy it again!</li>
    <li> Good Quality product, use on my hands, face and hair.</li>
    <li> Product is as described, Seller was in contact when shipping and also afterwards!  love this product!</li>
    <li> I had severely damaged my hair with going ombre and then wave perm; although I was happy with the look it was a bit much for the hair all at once. I always had had healthy hair due to minimal processing and rarely ever heat damage so I wanted to get it back to where it was as quickly as possible. I also live in a cold climate with heat sources that dry out my skin terribly every winter. So I thought Argan oil would be a great possibly to remedy these issues. I use the Argan oil on damp hair then braided every night and still do and the condition came back much faster than I had expected! I also put the Argan into my lotion as well as directly onto the driest areas like hands and it has worked wonderfully so far. I would absolutely recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Overview:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-So I originally bought this oil because it said money back guarantee. So of course it was worth a try. This is my first time using so called authentic organic argan oil. I&#x27;m Afro-Caribbean (Trinidadian) with naturally oily skin. I&#x27;m in my late twenties and want to start avoiding wrinkles as early as possible even though I&#x27;ve been told I already look young for my age. I&#x27;ve been using this product for months and I&#x27;m getting ready to buy a third bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-My face looks a bit more even toned&lt;br /&gt;-My face is definitely smoother&lt;br /&gt;- My pores actually look smaller (unless it&#x27;s mind over matter)&lt;br /&gt;-I used it on my &#x27;baby marks (stretch marks) and it is 10 times softer and less noticeable. I did also use eden&#x27;s garden essential oil on my stomach as a toner so maybe the two worked together&lt;br /&gt;-This works great on my natural hair to make it smoother when I&#x27;m flat ironing it&lt;br /&gt;- It absorbs really quickly&lt;br /&gt;- The smell is not overpowering, it&#x27;s like a light almost plain almond nut smell, not a sweet smell though&lt;br /&gt;- Worked okay on my nails, it helped my nails to heal after taking off acrylic nails&lt;br /&gt;- Packaged well, and prime shipping, felt like it actually came overnight the second time I ordered it&lt;br /&gt;- I actually like that it&#x27;s a dropper opposed to a spray or lotion type, it saves it for a slightly longer time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- I swear I&#x27;m breaking out so much more after using this that now I&#x27;m considering buying something for the mini pimples that randomly appear for the first time in years (but that could be because my skin is already oily...but even in winter when my skin feels dry, I started to get breakouts.)&lt;br /&gt;-Finishes way too fast even though a little can go a long way (maybe I just use too much though)&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s really oily but it does absorb quickly. In winter I sometimes used aveeno baby lotion after putting on the argan oil because it felt like my skin was dry even after putting on this oily substance. Weird...I know&lt;br /&gt;- A little pricey considering it lasts me about a month but I&#x27;m frugal sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m starting to feel it&#x27;s leveled off and I&#x27;m not seeing as many results as I saw before except my skin being smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to a friend, maybe there&#x27;s something better I didn&#x27;t try, but for right now, this works well for me until I get completely annoyed with the breakouts. Therefore, since I definitely didn&#x27;t get paid to write this review or offered a free product to entice my review....then this review is done.substance.

    <li> im giving 4 stars because of shipping it atrived later than the expected date 5 days later anyways the product itself deserves 5 stars first time i used it left my skin so soft and smooth with that silky feeling. its not heavy oil and it does not feel oily at all very happy with the product</li>
    <li> Product delivered on time, as described.  Very satisfied with purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a fake, is an imitation. Watch out!</li>
    <li> Very good product and excellent vendor. The product lives up to its promise and yields the same result as others 3-5 times the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not hesitate to purchase in the future. Thank you for the great, high quality product and  superb customer service.</li>
    <li> This product is just great!  It&#x27;s super hydrating, organic and it makes your skin glow.  What more do you need for your skin? I use it everyday &amp; everyday I get compliments on how great my skin looks.  Don&#x27;t even think about buying this product, just buy it!!  I promise you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Look too oily, nothing works</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter LOVE it.  Thanks for the additional tips.  I may use it too!</li>
    <li> My hair already look 100% better after using only a few time, so far.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product and great price!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this one that good it was ok! Will not reorder</li>
    <li> Simply a wonderful product</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Great service.</li>
    <li> My 18 month old granddaughter received a few stitches on her forehead and I was worried about scarring. After the stitches came out I put the oil on the scar three times a day. I can already tell a difference after a week. It&#x27;s healing wonderfully and is far less noticeable already. My daughter is also using it on her stretch marks and says they are starting to fade. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I ordered Argan oil for my hair. I have frizzy and curly hair and this product is doing magic. I have stopped using all the chemical filled sprays and products for frizz. Just few drops of Argan oil and coconut oil makes my hair beautiful. Love Argan oil!!!</li>
    <li> Mix a few drops in with my mosturizer after I take a shower and my skin is softer and almost glows.  I also put a drop in my facial moisturizer in the morning and at night.  My foundation goes on smoother and my skin looks dewey.  I really like this stuff!</li>
    <li> The winter plays havoc on my skin. This has helped tremendously! I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use this oil in some of my DIY skin care products.  Good quality and good service.  Would recommend product and seller.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely  amazing. Took my dry hair to healthy and shiny I love love it</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I make homemade bath soap and lotion for my son and me and argan oil has to be in it! It makes our skin very moist and silky smooth. I will definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product! Purchased after doing some research and was battling the DRIEST winter skin I&#x27;ve ever had - on my face. Not a derm condition, just dry and tight and I was feeling lost, flaky and alone. What the heck, face? Welcome to the mid-30s, maybe...? Anyway, I&#x27;ve used this oil at least daily, and the dryness is completely gone. My skin also feels much smoother! I even apply it before my makeup, but wait about 15 minutes for it to really absorb before doing so. That being said, this product absorbs easily and does not leave my skin feeling greasy at all. A little goes a long way. I live in a very dry climate above 5,000 ft. so YMMV, but I do recommend.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin so soft and it glistens. Love it.</li>
    <li> Does wonders for hair and skin not the greatest scent but works really well.</li>
    <li> This is really good stuff! Makes my skin feel moisturized and smooth AND no clogged pores. You only need a SMALL amount to go long way. I used it on my hair (on the dry ends) and it smoothed it wonderfully. I&#x27;ll keep buying it when I run out.</li>
    <li> I give it three stars because I can&#x27;t tell if it is working or not</li>
    <li> You will be happy with this product and the speedy shipment!</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with this oil! A little goes a long way. Makes my face look beautiful and moisturized. Also makes my hair shine. Love this stuff. I will purchase many more times after I use it all. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing, I suffer from eczema and acne and I used a expensive face lotion, when I received this I tried it on clean skin and omg I instantly felt a difference with this and store bought expensive lotion for sensitive skin. it is also the perfect makeup setter, it makes my makeup stay longer and fresher which is awesome. there&#x27;s no scent no irritation no flaws about this oil which I highly reccomend to everyone I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I am really liking this oil. It&#x27;s very helpful on my dry elbows.</li>
    <li> great a little bit greasy though !</li>
    <li> I put this product on my face. It doesn&#x27;t make me breakout, and it makes my overall face smooth radiant and healthy. I&#x27;ve recently started putting it on my hair as well.</li>
    <li> I added several drops into daughter hair oil. i apply to head and brush hair four times a week. I can see a difference. The hair is stronger. i love the product.</li>
    <li> Used in my home made hand sanitizer to preserve.  So far so good. Also keeps my hands from going dry.</li>
    <li> I use this in my homemade all natural lotion and it makes my skin feel soft all day even after I wash my hands which I do about 10 times a day because I have 2 little ones in diapers.  I swear it helps to make my hands look and feel younger.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Next time I will definitely order the 4oz bottle!</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my father... he absolutely loves it, so much in fact my mother is as well using it !</li>
    <li> Great customer service! The product took a little bit longer than I had hoped to arrive but once it did they were very helpful. They even gave me a very specific recipe, upon my request, to make a Shea butter/Argon oil lotion.  I can&#x27;t speak to the results of the product itself as I have only been using it for a couple weeks, and probably not as regularly as I should. But the price was right in the product seems to be a very good quality.</li>
    <li> amazing stuff! I use it instead of cheap store brand lotions. After I shave my face I apply 3 to 4 drops and im good to go. Once it settles your face is smooth but not greasy, which is great. I will be buying more once I run out. I have very sensitive skin and the Argan oil works like nothing else, leaves my skin with zero iteration.</li>
    <li> fantasitic product and using it every day and night. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase. I used it instead of facial lotion at night. I am 33 y.o and have braces! My skin around mouth gets really dry. I started to use oil on my lips and around ...but lately i apply it everywhere! I noticed how much softer and younger my skin feels and looks. I hooked up my husband as well. He has dry patches around his nose and lips. BEST part this oil doesn&#x27;t live your skin oily, it just gets sucked in the skin!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, and just as advertised. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it says it absorbs fast and won&#x27;t leave you skin oily, but I don&#x27;t agree. Maybe it&#x27;s the high humidity here in VA, but I find it stays pretty oily. I don&#x27;t mind as long as I&#x27;m staying in, but in this heat it makes my face sweat a lot. Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough yet to see any difference in my skin, but I&#x27;m hopeful!</li>
    <li> This is great for dry hair and face. I have been using for less than a week and have noticed a difference already. How did I not know about this sooner!</li>
    <li> I love this product and this brand.  I bought this one and then actually got a couple of other brands and I like this one by far the best.  It doesn&#x27;t have any weird smell and it goes on my face and absorbs so that I don&#x27;t look like an oil slick. It feels great and my skin looks terrific.  I&#x27;m 66 and don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, as in foundation type stuff, and this feels very natural but like i have some protection on my skin.  I&#x27;m just purchasing again as I&#x27;ve just run out.  Purchase this with confidence.  Very attentive seller also as they contacted me a couple of weeks after I&#x27;d received the oil and wanted feedback.</li>
    <li> Excellent oil. It&#x27;s helping me a lot with&lt;br /&gt;my old scalp itching. It&#x27;s after the 2nd&lt;br /&gt;application when I noticed my scalp was&lt;br /&gt;not itching too much. I&#x27;m planing to re-order. Keep on doing like that, Thanks.</li>
    <li> U will never regret if u buy it, it is really good product, i have little bit dry skin and it is great for me</li>
    <li> Product works great!  I normally use Vitamin E Oil on my skin and wanted to see the comparison.  I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of weeks and it seems comparable to Vitamin E Oil.  Although more pricey.</li>
    <li> The smell is horrible and it goes on like salad oil. You cannot put on any other cream or makeup after using it and it leaves grease on the pillow at night. I just did not like it</li>
    <li> These Argan oils are great! Whenever winter starts my skins get really dry and I have to use more lotion then usual. Replacing the lotion with the Argan oil it works much better. It keeps my skin moist longer and looks healthier and softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve Hansen has excellent customer service, A +++ They stand behind their words.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely do more business with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Eve Hansen!</li>
    <li> I want to advise that I am quite thrilled with the product and so far it serves to do just what it states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is glowing and marks are slowly disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for producing such a fabulous product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leu</li>
    <li> Light and not too oily.. Good for regular use. I mostly use it on my hair that was damaged due to coloring. Since I bought this product 3 weeks ago , I use a small drop of it on my tips every other night. It has become more smoother now. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> On time. Product worked exactly as it said it would.</li>
    <li> Product has a pleasant smell. Haven&#x27;t seen results yet, but haven&#x27;t used very long.</li>
    <li> this is a great product to mix with other lotions or to use alone</li>
    <li> Loving this argon oil. Notice an immediate different when I put it on. Also the company contacted me immediately after I bought it, via email, to give me tips to making the most effective use out of it.</li>
    <li> Eve Hansen Argan oil seems to reduce fine lines and soothe dry area on the face, lips and hands.  I bought some for my sister to put on her scalp as she grows her hair back after her chemo treatments. It seems to help her with the discomfort of her hair growing back. I have been very pleased with the results of the argan oil.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS OIL!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Have only been using a few days on hair, face and hands. So far I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for Vitamin E because I used it in the past for cut&#x27;s,blemishes and other uses, and I saw this Argan Oil, it has vitamin E in it and I have 3 teenage granddaughter and tough they could use it on scars from blemishes, to day was my first day using it so I will come back in a week or two to tell you who it worked, I know Vitamin does, my husband cut 4 fingers with the lawnmower, and a neighbor poured Vitamin E on it and then he had stitches put in to close the cuts,after he healed no scars from the cuts..</li>
    <li> Great product and service.</li>
    <li> This is working for me. I am allergic to so many oils that are petroleum based and this one is not so I am glad to finally find an oil that I can use.  I use it as an eye makeup remover and also put it all over my face, under my eyes, on my neck during the day to help with wrinkles.  I really like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Am using this amazing product to soften cuticles, as a nighttime moisturizer, on hair and around eyes in the morning (especially useful these days where there is no humidity in the air).  I have tried other similar products - this is really good quality at such a great price! - Coming back for more.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. My skin feels like silk....and it has no perfume smell or sticky residue on your skin. It is an amazing product and I highly recommend it. Also fast fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Never noticed any difference. I didn&#x27;t really gave it a full try. I added this oil to the skin around my eyes and around the mouth for small fine wrinkles. I heard that this helps with that. I used it nightly for about 3 weeks and didn&#x27;t noticed the slightest difference at all. I&#x27;m in my mid 20s so I&#x27;m just trying to prevent any future damage and I read that oil around the eyes at night can actually be bad and create bags under the eyes. Since I didn&#x27;t noticed any kind of improvement on my small fine lines, I decided not to add bags under my eyes, by insisting. Don&#x27;t know of any other uses for this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it every night.</li>
    <li> Completely worth the money! I&#x27;ve been using it in my homemade body butter and in my hair. I place a pea sized amount in my palm and then rub into the ends of my damp hair. Helps hold the curl in through out the day! Also, I use a little on my dry hair at night! Love it!</li>
    <li> I like this neutral smelling oil..it soaks in after a few minutes, the skin feels and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil should smooth out wrinkles..i will keep using it, the price is right..as only a few drops are necessary.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this to use in a balm recipe and it made a world of difference in the end result. The oil was shipped promptly, arrived in perfect condition, and very reasonably priced. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Used this argan oil for my nails and....GREAT SUCCESSSSSS</li>
    <li> It is amazing ! Used it on my face for just one week and people started complimenting me on my complexion ! Not at all greasy ! Applied just a few drops to my damp hair and its soft as silk ! It&#x27;s worth the cost ! I am a permanent customer now ! Just one flaw! The bottle had leaked a little when I received the package and the dropper did not fit snug ! Just replaced it with a new dropper that I had in my cabinet ! Nevertheless I would recommend this in a heartbeat ! Thank you Eve Hansen for making me feel as beautiful as Eve !</li>
    <li> Item arrived as described. LOVE this argan oil!!!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair shiny and smooth. It smells good as well</li>
    <li> Seller kept bothering me with e-mails to see how I liked it and to buy more even though I had just received it . Annoying . I did not respond and the e-mails finally stopped. Product is so so. Used it on my face and had some type of allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that I add in small doses to all the store bought products that I use. It makes my 50 year old skin and hair vibrant. This product allows me to buy very inexpensive products that suit my needs and provide me with the moisture my skin deserves. It has a nice subtle fragrance as well. When I run out, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to enjoy a rich, non-oily-feeling oil. I make my own Vitamin-C serum. Adding the Argan Oil created another dimension of softness and smoothness. Thank you...</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE and HOOKED on this oil.  I bought it initially for my face as a compulsive purchase really... BUT...&lt;br /&gt;Tried a bit on my hair after shower and WOW! I have a thick, full, curly and somewhat freezy black hair. Usually have to use a handsome amount of gel to keep it managed and have always kept my hair short.  BUT, after using this oil i&#x27;m stunned by how amazing my hair can be!  It will cost me more than gel in the long-run for sure, but it makes your hair so luscious that its border line criminal.  haha.</li>
    <li> Oh man, do I love this oil. I have extremely dry skin and I use this all over to help treat my dry, itchy skin from this winter weather. I like that it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell. It goes on very oily but is quickly absorbed into the skin. I wear it under my daily moisturizer and I believe it has helped improve my skin texture. I put a few drops into my hands and run it through my wet hair after a shower and it helps with static and flyaways.</li>
    <li> I use a mixture of this with other products for my skin and hair and I really like it. It mixes well and leaves your skin feeling very smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> it is great, i love it . it really works. it maks my hair moisture.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this oil is by itself because I added it to 2 other oils but all the oils I used are not greasy feeling at all and absorbs quickly. It also has no or very little scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and started using it right away I am not crazy about the smell but the product itself is amazing, I have eczema on one arm near my elbow and this oil has really helped me tremendously. I absolutely love it and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just argan oil, so the smell is a bit unusual, but works nicely for moisture- i use it for winter on dry spots and on neck/shoulders.</li>
    <li> Very good for hair and nails, but my face breaking out</li>
    <li> Just received my product, only states using it yesterday so I&#x27;m looking forward to this</li>
    <li> A little too thin..but its ok....</li>
    <li> I use this product nightly before bed on my face and it has never been softer! I also use it as a leave in conditioner (only 1-2 drops) and it leaves my hair soft, shiny, and silky! Absolutely amazing product!</li>
    <li> Good product at a good price. Great for face and nails.</li>
    <li> Love love love it... It absorbs quickly leaving the skin soft... I use it on my hair sometimes it makes my hair so soft n smooth... Definitely will repurchase...</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Bought it to lather up my hands before bedtime because our midwest winters leave my hands and cuticles so dry. It works wonders overnight!</li>
    <li> I have had a couple acne scars for a few months and they were not lightening up. After a couple weeks of using this Argan oil, the scars are noticeably lighter. My skin is also softer as well.</li>
    <li> This oil leaves your skin silky smooth. I love it!!! It moisturizes without clogging your skin. I find a little too thick for my hair but I love it on my face. I also use it on my belly to help my skin with stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I gained 30 pounds and have super intense strechmarks. After applying this oil daily I see a noticeable change in their color. They are because less red. Also I have a patch of tougher skin on my bottom lip from biting that spot. I have had this for at least ten years and with two small applications of this oil on my lips and face that sucker is gone.</li>
    <li> First, the customer service was amazing ensuring a customer for life, then the Argan Oil was excellent absorbed into my skin quickly leaving no greasy residue before applying makeup. I prefer to use natural product so the Argan Oil was a great additional for an anti wrinkle treatment, great results.</li>
    <li> A great product. I&#x27;m glad I ordered it to include when I make skin products at home.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using a lot of facial cream most of them branded but I ended up being disappointed because I didn&#x27;t see visible results. With this Oil, I started using it on June 16th. I could feel the smoothness of my skin. With the wrinkles, I&#x27;m yet to see the results in a couple of weeks.I&#x27;m truly satisfied with the product.it&#x27;s odorless, too! I will make more feed backs next time!</li>
    <li> Great product!!!  Very fast shipping!!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!</li>
    <li> Good quality oil.  Love using it on my hair and skin.</li>
    <li> Very soft and a non-greasy oil that blends well in my skin and hair, a definite overall improvement to the textures of skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I have used many times argan oil, but the organic oil is much better than any other. This is the best!</li>
    <li> I use this oil on my face every night before going to bed. It absorbs quickly and does not leave any residues on your pillows. My face looks like baby butt and I am 43 years old. Simply the best! I love the fact that it is an organic product.</li>
    <li> Feels great on skin, smooth, not greasy. Very nice product!!</li>
    <li> Really like this brand Argan Oil.  It soaks into my skin quickly and I really think fine lines are less noticeable.  Bottom line, my skin feels soft and very healthy.</li>
    <li> Used the Argan Oil to make all natural body butter.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Easily absorb by skin and hair giving a natural and healthy feel.</li>
    <li> I have dry hair. I put this on my ends after I style, on my hands, and face. Love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all been said in many, many reviews.  This Argan Oil is organic (no nasty chemicals!) and is good to use on my skin, my cuticles, my hair (those dry ends) and of course,it contains lots of Vitamin E, proven to help cell  repair and regeneration.  I also use it in homemade  body butter (along with shea butter, coconut oil and a bit of avocado oil).  For me, it is a toiletries staple.</li>
    <li> It smells a little funny but it does feel nice on skin and hair. The smell is not awful and it does disapate pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing.  It purely heals skin and face.  It absolutely does not clog pores or cause pimples.  Just buy it!</li>
    <li> I use this on my face. I just recently started the Oil Cleansing Method and this oil is a miracle!  My skin is so soft! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Started using this only about three days ago.  It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve used oil on my face.  It feels light and clean and I am very happy with it so far.  If I continue to be satisfied, I will probably begin to use this on my body and hair as I finish the other products I have on hand.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. We used it to make sunscreen and so far no burns.</li>
    <li> The product came in a timely fashion, and as advertised.  I love the fact that it&#x27;s organic.  I&#x27;ve used it under my eyes and on split ends. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> Love this organic oil does not have a greasy feel great product!!!!</li>
    <li> I like the product. Easy to apply, no-added fragrance, using to seal in face moisturizer lotion, feels pure and it works! Planing to reorder bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! I&#x27;m using it in my face serum that I make and it has already made a difference in how my skin looks in only 2 weeks!! My friend was so impressed she had me make up a batch for her!</li>
    <li> does what it says, i always apply to my skin before bed</li>
    <li> just a dropper full does the trick so it will last a while</li>
    <li> Best product ever bought it for my mom and she loves it so much and keeps flaunting her new skin to everyone haha great product highly recommend !</li>
    <li> light and silky I love this product I will be using it for my hair for my face and for my skin it is very light it glides on very silky it absorbs very quickly and I can already begin to see a difference in the wrinkle and the texture of the skin on my face I will continue to use and report back in a few weeks on the results</li>
    <li> Such a Great pure, product. It&#x27;s a dry oil so it NEVER clogs pores or leaves a filmy residue. It quickly penetrates and hydrates the skin or hair. I use at night for my face. My skin feels so soft, younger and supple in the morning. If you&#x27;re consistent with it, you&#x27;ll see more results and you&#x27;ll be happy :)</li>
    <li> This oil works very nice. I have curly hair, when I get out of the shower I put some on the ends to keep them hydrated. This oil really comes in handy once my hair is straightened to apply on any &amp;#34;fly-aways&amp;#34; keeps everything looking smooth and frizz free. Before bed I also add a dab in conjunation with my night facial cream to add some extra moisture.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price. I didn&#x27;t think the smell was bad at all like some of the comments are saying. Light and soaks in well. Overall a great product!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I was looking for some argan oil and it was delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this oil. I use it to mix with essential oils. It is very light and absorbs well. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This oil leaves my skin feeling smooth without that greasy feel. I even where it under my makeup. Will try again.</li>
    <li> Very good product.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t take a lot&lt;br /&gt;I have curly hair and it conditions well.&lt;br /&gt;I have used on my cuticles as well.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it more than a few times yet but the result has been quite satisfactory each time - especially in dry Colorado weather.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It really helped my feet and hands. Didn&#x27;t see a really big difference in my face skin though. I am halfway disappointed... I had really hoped it would help my face skin too.</li>
    <li> I love how this oil makes my skin feel. It absorbs quickly and is very non irritating even for my often sensitive skin.  There is no significant odor and it seems to be improving my overall tone and texture.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s doing wonders to my hair, nails, and skin. I recommend it to anyone who Is in need of luxurious soft hair and skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves my skin supple and is also great for my hair. I&#x27;m starting to notice the dark spots on my face clearing. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a new product for me.  I have not really noticed how it works....yet.</li>
    <li> This oil is great for the price and I love that it is organic. Goes on smooth and does not leave skin feeling greasy at all. One to two drops is all it takes. I usually mix it with my moisturizer and the results have been great. My acne seems to have gotten better and my skin looks healthier and glowing. I would highly recommend this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> quick shipping, great follow-up and great product.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I got it today- such fast delivery - I was pleasantly&lt;br /&gt;surprised. And I absolutely love it. Used couple drops on my&lt;br /&gt;hair and hands (cuticles). Amazing...thank you!</li>
    <li> VERY good product y using on my face and I can tell the difference my skin feel softer.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I wanted an organic product to moisturize, but this also delivers key nutrients, such as vit. E.  just a dab goes a long way</li>
    <li> Feels good on the skin but I&#x27;m not sure it helps fine lines.</li>
    <li> I like this product better than the oil I was using. Less greasy feeling!</li>
    <li> really fast shipping and good product</li>
    <li> Magic!!! I do love it so far )))</li>
    <li> I love this!  I use it on my face every day.  I put it in my heals at night and my feet are very soft which is amazing because I go barefoot when ever possible.  I have not tried it on my hair but I will this summer</li>
    <li> Excellent as described in the product description!!!!</li>
    <li> This oil is amazinggggggg. I originally bought it for my hair and have been replacing my leave in conditioner with it, soon I will be making my own leaving in conditioner with this along with coconut milk and a few other ingredients. It makes my hair so smooth and not greasy at all. That says a lot because my hair gets greasy very easily. I now use this on my face also, after washing before bed &amp; in the morning. I was using coconut oil but the argan oil is much better, less oily. I still use coconut oil instead of lotion for the rest of my body though.</li>
    <li> This oil has been great for my skin and hair. I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> A+ superb product! Happy again with a pleasant transaction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy. I don&#x27;t really use skin products. But as for my girlfriend, but I&#x27;m stealing it all the time. Been using a few drops on my face and it feels great. Living in Arizona, the skin gets dry so this is a good remedy. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Good product and shipped fast</li>
    <li> Well it did not come with any instructions how to use it????!</li>
    <li> Friendly transaction! Great product</li>
    <li> I purchased Argan oil on a whim about three weeks ago--and I am surprised by how much I like it.  My use of &amp;#34;beauty products&amp;#34; is usually limited to sunscreen and moisturizers.  Based on using Argan oil in the morning and at night on my face, neck and hands--the texture and softness of my 63 year old skin seems to have improved.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I use it to mix with my essential oils.  Especially for my face cream and first aid oil mixtures.  I don&#x27;t like to use Coconut Oil on my face.  I have normal skin and coconut oil just sits on the surface of my skin but the Argan Oil absorbs into my skin, of course I only need a little.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! I use this in my salt scrubs and body butter. Absorbs nicely into skin not greasy feeling like other oils.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ll definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Used this product for my buttocks and it gave me redness to my bottom I also applied this oil to my belly and back before I wrapped my stomach and it gave me a rash never have had a rash in my life</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my eyebrows and lashes for a week and a half and it appears that they are growing faster.  I&#x27;m not sure if my brows will completely fill in with longer use but so far I&#x27;m happy with the quality and the customer service follow up.</li>
    <li> I love this oil and it came with natural (not synthetic) vitamin e oil ta&#x27;boot! I use both in conjunction with a few drops of neroli essential oil at night and sleep like a baby without feeling like I have a greasy mask on. Great product, excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I use it on my hair and as a moisturizer. I like to use it at night because it is a little too much for daily wear. I would imagine someone with drier skin could wear it every day. It is less greasy than coconut oil which I used to use as my primary moisturizer. I still use the coconut oil to remove my make-up and for oil pulling, but I use the argan oil for facial moisturizer and a hair serum.</li>
    <li> “Great product. Seller provides lots of tips in how to use the product. Tips very helpful. ”  Used the product on my face, love it.  Not oily or greasey.</li>
    <li> Very nice. This oil absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel great. My makeup glides on very smoothly on top of this.</li>
    <li> WOW!! Can&#x27;t say enough about this product, love it, love it! Used it right away when it arrived and my skin was so soft couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it worked. Will definitely be buying more and highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Works good so far. Delivered as promised. Has helped with rough areas on skin and with calming my frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I found this Seller to be very courteous as well as knowledgeable about her&lt;br /&gt;product. Upon using this product, I noticed that my face felt softer and less dry.</li>
    <li> I see the difference in my 76-yr-old face!</li>
    <li> I tried this product cause I&#x27;ve been using Trilogy Rosehip oil for the past 2 years or so and I wanted to try something different. This brand seemed to have good reviews, much cheaper for the size...etc so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;ve tried Urban Decay Argan Oil before but it&#x27;s too expensive and sticky. This product is feels more watered down but seems to absorb to my skin well. I mix about 3 drops to my Hada Labo lotion because I have dry skin. It&#x27;s not bad for the price. I still like Trilogy cause it absorbs to my skin better but I&#x27;ve been pretty satisfied with this product as well.</li>
    <li> Before I tried Argan Oil, I used pure Macademia nut oil from a fair-trade independent grower in Guatemala as a similar all-purpose product.. Argan oil is even a touch lighter, amazingly versatile, and wonderfully effective. I use it instead of moisturizer under my sunscreen and at night, and treat my (short) hair with a little bit left over on my hands - and rub it into my cuticles at the same time. Ideal for travel - other than sunscreen and a little bit of powder and blusher, I don&#x27;t even need to carry facial toner or hair conditioner. And, it beats all those super pricey creams and &amp;#34;serums&amp;#34; any day! Great for mature skins and outdoor types like me (I&#x27;m a 72 year old nature photographer).</li>
    <li> I used the Argon oil on my pregnant belly, my hair and face. I like it so far, it moistures my hair without leaving it greasy after washing it. It feels good on my skin as well. I would recommend it. !!!</li>
    <li> OMG! And I really mean that!!  it is amazing.  It&#x27;s not a heavy oil either.  My skin seriously felt satiny, soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil! I have been using it for over a month now &amp; I will definitely purchase again. I have normal to oily skin with some adult acne. Going into my 30s has become a struggle finding something that&#x27;s ok for the oily skin but will help fight signs of aging (especially in the summer months). I have to say, I think this is it! It&#x27;s light on my skin but nourishes &amp; moosturizes just right without any breakouts. I&#x27;m even using it added into my coconut oil for stretch marks postpartum &amp; they&#x27;re already lightened up after only a few weeks of using the oil (I&#x27;m 13 weeks pp). I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was recently involved in a car accident involving surgery removing bulging disc&#x27;s and replacing with titanium ones leaving a scar on the front of my neck I purchased this product hoping to improve and heal my scar... It&#x27;s been 4 weeks and is still a work In progress.  Time will tell.  I do like the lid that has a drop tube and the texture of this oil.  So far I&#x27;m impressed..</li>
    <li> I have been using this argan oil directly on my face, neck and chest as a replacement for chemical filled face lotions.  Within a week my skin looks absolutely fabulous!  It smells amazing and I LOVE it!  My 3 year old daughter watches me use the dropper to dot my face and now she is in love with it too!  Great product and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used this on my face as a moisturizer. Works very well form my combination, acne-prone skin. I allso lighten my hair every 4-6 weeks, so you can imagine that it is prone to be dry and can damage easily. I have used the argan oil on the ends sparingly ( don&#x27;t need to use a lot as a little goes along way ) . I massage the oil on the ends especially in areas that are prone to breakage. It has improved the porous texture of my hair and makes my hair manageable.</li>
    <li> I usually use Moroccan oil on my hair it&#x27;s very curly and this product provided a nice change.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! Makes my face so smooth! Vitamin E oil is so good for your skin. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> i use it as a skin moisturizer, it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky or greasy like some lotions i have used in the past. I do not however use it in my hair - i have very thin hair and it does make it greasy.</li>
    <li> Love this! Leaves skin very moisturized. Looking forward to using for some DIY face lotions.</li>
    <li> Another great experience with Even Hansen. This is my 5th or 6th purchase from this seller. I love the free and fast shipping. I have only contacted them with compliments and they returned my emails in a timely matter. I also highly recommend the rose water and Sweet Almond Oil; they leave my skin so silky smooth. I look forward to my order of their lemon oil which is on its way to me now.</li>
    <li> I got this product to use in a lotion formula and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I like it,  I have dry skin,  it work for me.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I love this Argan oil, my hair is very delicate and this oil really protects and gives shine and body to it. Also for dry skin. The price was very reasonable, too. LOVE LOVE LOVE! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I thought I would try this product after researching what to look in terms of sourcing and list of ingredients (or in this case ingredient).  I was pleasantly surprised....I&#x27;ve used it on my hair (AA relaxed), my girls hair (AA natural) as well as my face.  I have sensitive, oily, adult-acne prone skin and thought it would make my skin oilier but is hasn&#x27;t.  I couldn&#x27;t find my normal moisturizer (Olay) and tried this instead.  No breakouts, no excessive oil, just soft skin.  I especially like using it on my girls hair since I&#x27;m trying to encourage them that AA hair is beautifully in its natural state.  They&#x27;ll ask me now to put the oil on their hair when I braid it, make pigtails or afro-puffs (I use it along with a WEN mist).  Yay us!!</li>
    <li> Mixed it in with some homemade shampoo and it does well!</li>
    <li> I have only used this product a few times so the results are not conclusive.  It&#x27;s a fine product abd may be used for many things. I use it for a scar.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! It only takes a small drop and it leaves your skin hydrated and with an amazing glow! I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in the texture of my skin!</li>
    <li> Wonderful!! No breakouts yet!! I was concerned because it is oil. Smooth and absorbs well!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It gave me amazing skin. I have been using it for 2 months straight now. Atleast once a day. I either put it on my face at night or in the morning before i put my makeup on or both sometimes. Just a few drops can go a long way! I love it because it cleared up really bad acne scars i had along with reducing redness i would normally have when i would break out. It also reduced the amount of time i would have a zit by days. Not only that my pores are smaller and my face is clearer! It also helped with darcle circles around my eyes and puffiness i would normally get in the morning. Its overall an amazing product.i love my skin more then ever. And im buying it again.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and find it to be fine.  I think I like this other one I bought better but I would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and hair and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> I have started using this product for my homemade soaps and lotion and have been very happy with this product. I love the fact that I could get this organic product for such a great price. I can&#x27;t wait to use it solo to really see the effects this product will have on my skin. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great quality oil, came quickly.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL for the skin and hair. It really enhances my hair and makes it soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Love it on my skin,hate it on my hair.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! my skin looks like a teenagers skin, and Iam over 35!!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice stuff, I use it for a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> feedback:&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, just turned 58 yesterday, my face is as smooth as when I was 20 years of age. I highly recommend this product to everyone by Eve Hanson, brilliant argon oil. Love it! I will keep coming back for this item. Sincerely,Rev. Karen Lee Samson</li>
    <li> Easy to use dropper makes it very easy to dispense the oil. To early to tell results but as of now very satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> Is very good. And Amazon&#x27;s service very fast. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I use it for my face and hair. So far I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> I am 71 years and this has done wonders to my skin, face, handstand body, greaseless and no odor. I will use Argan again once used up. Thanks for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> love the stuff specially for the hair.</li>
    <li> GREAT product! My skin feels velvety smooth after just a few days! This company has provided me with OUTSTANDING customer service and I will go straight to them next time I find myself in need of any of their products. I also put this oil on a scrape my son&#x27;s face and it seems to be healing very fast. I would highly recommend this product and this company!</li>
    <li> MUST HAVE miracle product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Pleasant smell, pleasant feel, pleasant customer service! No joke my husband literally commented on how smooth my skin felt after using this on my face for just a week. Good stuff! Buy this brand!</li>
    <li> Love this oil! I use it on my face and nails. It smells nice and a little goes a long way. I use a few drops on my face and neck. The residue I massage into my cuticles. The price is so reasonable and the delivery very quick!</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery. Excellent product and price. Highly recommend doing business with Eve Hansen.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really say I seem much difference, but I&#x27;m still using it.  Hasn&#x27;t done anything for my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Enjoying this product very much. Have been using on my face with no problems. Also a little drop goes a long way!</li>
    <li> my wife likes it for her skin</li>
    <li> this i use after a shower, and it is a nice feeling on my skin...</li>
    <li> The argon oil absorbs quickly into my skin with no greasy feeling.  I use it on my dry nails too.  Price was reasonable, delivery quick and the quality seems gooc.</li>
    <li> I apply this oil to my face and neck in the morning and again before bed. Had a cut on my arm, once I applied the argan  oil  the wound healed quickly and w/o a scar. The original plan was to use in conjunction with other ingredients for natural organic health remedies but have been enjoying it by itself.</li>
    <li> love it.makes hair,and skin feel like silk.really good for cuticals too.I will be back.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this review by saying that I was contacted by the company to write a review.. BUT they did NOT ask me to give them 5 stars, they just simply wanted me to write a review. So I am going to write an HONEST review. I get contacted by companies all the time asking me to write a 5-star review in exchange for a free product and that is unappealing and ends up making me question the product and the reviews I read prior to purchasing the product. But I must say, since using Eve Hansen&#x27;s Argan Oil I have been very pleased. Unlike Josie Maran and the popular Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil on Amazon, I find the consistency, quality and overall feel to be superior. I have sensitive acne-prone skin and if my skin reacts adversely to any new product I usually break out in tiny white bumps. However, my skin did not react poorly to this Argan Oil. I love the radiance and moisture this provides to my face. I apply a few drops in the morning with my suncreen and I don&#x27;t look oily, I just look like I have a healthy glow, which I love. The dropper is sturdy, the bottle is opaque protecting the oil from light, and the oil is reasonably priced. I will be repurchasing this brand Argan Oil. Thank you Eve Hansen for a lovely product! :)</li>
    <li> I use it on my face at night and wake up to softer skin. Now I started putting a few drops on the ends of my hair. It&#x27;s completely odorless and washes off hands easily.</li>
    <li> A fantastic product. .works wonders on d skin.</li>
    <li> This product has added shine to my hair.  Two drops one wet hands rubbed through wet hair makes it more manageable as well as healthier in appearance.</li>
    <li> I love this oil in my hair mask. It makes a big difference and I have already tried it with my day face cream too. Just adding two three drops of the oil so powerful and give me a very good sensation on my skin. I recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to supply the Vitamin E for some balm I am making and am pleased with the result.  Customer service is proactive and excellent.</li>
    <li> I love this Argan Oil.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and have sensitive skin.  I typically use all Kiehls products, but since finding out I was expecting, I wanted to switch to something more natural.  It has not made me breakout at all - I thought since I was slathering oil on my face that this would be the case, but not so! Feels nice in the morning and evening.  I wear under make-up and it&#x27;s fine to use with any powder or foundation.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!!! I put it in homemade salve I make or use it alone!  My skin and hair is soft!! It is a wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> The natural argan oil.</li>
    <li> Adds great moisture and great for hair and skin.</li>
    <li> Really great product, it feels great on the skin and the customer service is wonderful!  I have gotten email follow-ups with product usage suggestions and advice for when I reorder... which I will do!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product. My skin feels really nice after using it, but I think I will need to use it longer to get the positive effect I am waiting for.</li>
    <li> The oil is nice and not heavy at all. Soaks into the skin nicely.  Also I mix it with my hand lotion.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> Love this oil, I used it on my face and hair. It smells good and feels good on. Just recently started using on my face so hoping it will show results soon. When using on my hair it adds a nice shine and makes it feel softer, I naturally have thick dry hair.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes skin and leaves hair wonderfully soft.  Actually soaks into my skin and does not leave the hated oily residue. If using on hair, be very sparing until you know what works for you.  The first time, I would recommend setting time aside just to experiment and see how it goes in case you have to rewash your hair because you applied too liberally.  I highly recommend this product and will actually buy it again when I run low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying, I place one drop on index, middle, and ring finger.  Transfer some to other hand by placing same opposing fingers on the drops and then massage softly onto and into skin on face/neck/back of hand or wherever.  For me, it soaks in immediately, but I always wait approx 5 minutes before applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to purchase, I hope you experience the same results I have.</li>
    <li> Ship on time starting to see changes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair and lashes and have noticed a difference. My lashes are getting noticeably longer and fuller. Several people are commenting on them, wondering what I&#x27;m doing to get them so long. My hair is softer, shinier, and more manageable. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my skin, but only because I&#x27;ve been using it all on my hair. Definitely recommend and will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I use this oil on my hair after a shower and what a difference it has made. I love it and would highly recommend it. A few drops goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love this argan oil. I put it in my hair and at makes it shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> This is very hard. I&#x27;ve heard so about this oil but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.  I rarely use new products right away but I&#x27;m certainly glad that I have it.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for your quick response.  You&#x27;ve educated me about organ oil used for face and hair.  I do feel your organ oil is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used, as it relates to softening my dry face (I&#x27;ve used many brands.)  I&#x27;m 72 with a very dry face. Great product.  I&#x27;ve just ordered this product again.  I am very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great as a moisturizer. I had a small crack at the corner of my mouth and the Argan oil healed it quickly.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Not only makes your skin youthful look, it gives your hair a nice shiney, healthy feel. In addition to all of that, I noticed that this made my nails grow within days. I recieved this product quickly, I would most certainly purchase from this vendor for having a great experience. Thank you.😊</li>
    <li> Arrived slightly frozen (consistency of jam).  Thawed out and seems to be okay.  Be careful using it in your hair.  A little dab will do ya.  Too much and you&#x27;ll be headed back to the shower to re-wash.  I love this product mixed with some pure aloe gel to use on my face and body.  Nice results during this harsh, cold winter.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very pleased. Timely arrival. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> I am here to tell you Argan oil is absolutely the best product I have ever used. Trust me.. I have used a lot in my years. This helps with Dry skin, helps moisturize those wrinkles on your face, make sure your face is wet so it can absorb better. It also helps your make up go on smoother..lessens the redness and itchiness of rashes, dry scalp..and best of all it smells nice.. its not a strong odor. And I have only used it for a day! You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought it.</li>
    <li> I bought one bottle first to try it, its really good, I even stopped buying my Clarin&#x27;s cream for this, my skin is softer and even some dark spots on my face are vanishing. I recommend it</li>
    <li> Love this! I use it on my face and it leaves my face feeling so smooth!</li>
    <li> I just receive it, so I am not sure about the results.</li>
    <li> I like it.  Haven&#x27;t noticed the bags under my eyes going away completely, but it definitely makes my skin smoother.  It really helps my cuticles on my nails too.  I like this product and I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it! My husband and I use this daily now to moisturize and it helps skin remain supple. Don&#x27;t put too much on if you have oily skin, may cause some breakouts. I also purchased one for my mom and we&#x27;ll see how accurate the statement is that argan oil helps with wrinkles</li>
    <li> Everything I was looking for. Bought the oil for the nose of a show dog and it dies a great job keeping her nose moisturized</li>
    <li> New to essential oils, this one is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Had a super weird smell and a think texture. too impossible to run through hair.</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle about 6 weeks ago and have used it to strengthen my fingernails. It takes just a drop per fingernail and it absorbs very quickly. I have amazingly strong fingernails now. A friend admired my nails, so I bought this bottle for her to try. Service is great, as is the product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. I have a Hypo-thyroid and my skin and hair are very dry and this works GREAT.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice anything</li>
    <li> Excelletn product work in my skin perfectly</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It moistures my face without clogging my pores. It soften and illuminate my skin. It&#x27;s a must try.</li>
    <li> **update to update**&lt;br /&gt;I decided to keep the oil even though I thought it smelled different than the first bottle I ordered, as I went to several of my local health stores to smell/test  their Argan Oils. Turns out most have a similar scent (not sure why my first order had no odor at all) so I decided to keep it and use it a bit before reposting. This bottle feels the same going on and is light and silky, not heavy or greasy feeling. It feels soothing and I use it almost if not every day. I am happy to report that the oil seems to be fine and that the odor must be &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;.  I recommend this oil for the quality, price, quick shipping. It should be noted though that I never did get a response from the seller when I inquired about the second bottle of oil&#x27;s smell and difference from the first. Just something to keep in mind if you have a problem or question arise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this oil for daily use, mainly on my face, as I tend to have sensitive and dry skin, especially around my nose, mouth, and between my eyebrows.  The oil came quickly and packaged nicely.  The oil had no odor and very slight yellow tone to it.  It feels really lightweight and soft as silk going on.  It leaves my face feeling dewy soft glowing without feeling heavy or greasy.  I tend to get acne and this does not exacerbate it or make me break out.  It is very soothing and sometimes if I have a pimple I even put this oil on it.  Still not sure if it helps acne, but it definitely does not cause it or make it worse.  I use this oil every night right after getting out of the shower (I just put a few drops in my palms, and press into my face to let it soak in, and then add a bit extra around the eyes and frown lines (oh those dreaded grouch lines!!)  I also sometimes use it throughout the day, especially if I have chapped skin or lips.  I really am enjoying it as a soft, lightweight moisturizer.  Recently, I have started rubbing a few drops in the palm of my hands and rubbing it into the ends of my hair first, then massaging what&#x27;s left onto my hands into my scalp.  I have thin, flat hair but the ends dry out easily so i tried this before bed and rinse it out in the morning.  It would probably be fine to leave in if you  have thicker, fuller hair, but for me it just looks a little greasy if I leave it in.  It makes my hair nice and soft and not so dry on the ends.  Highly recommend this oil!&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** I liked this oil so much that I ordered the big bottle. It came quickly but I opened it to discover a strange odor that the first bottle didn&#x27;t have. It smells somewhat like a cheap olive oil and not at all like the first bottle I ordered, which had no odor at all. I wrote the seller about a week ago and haven&#x27;t heard back from them as of tonight. I will be returning this bottle and will give it another a try with a new bottle.  Hope it was just a fluke!

    <li> Love this Argan oil! It has a very light smell that is very pleasant. My skin instantly feels smoother and more moisturized. I have very dry skin but it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. It does everything it says it will. It smells&lt;br /&gt;nice and is so luxurious. I will definitely purchase another bottle when my 1st&lt;br /&gt;is gone.</li>
    <li> I love love love this stuff. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month and I&#x27;m already seeing improvements in my skin. I only use it on my face and it&#x27;s incredible. With only two to three drops my face twice daily; my skin is so soft, my complexion is evening out &amp;#34;with a glow&amp;#34; and my skin doesn&#x27;t get oily throughout the day like it used to. I wash my face with black soap then I apply two to three drops of the argan on and presto. I&#x27;ve been telling all my family and friends about it, and even they notice the difference in my skin. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!  The quality is great!</li>
    <li> Very nice light-weight oil. Absorbs quickly. I use it mainly at night. In the morning, my skin is radiant!</li>
    <li> My skin has done nothing but break out after applying to my face. My nails are now peeling even more after applying to my hands. Maybe I&#x27;m allergic to Argan oil? The smell - smells like when you get your nails done. Had to dump the bottle. Does nothing for me. Was really hoping this would work after reading all the reviews. :(</li>
    <li> My wife loves this oil.  She uses it on her skin and hair and particularly her nails.  This was a nice price and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Arrived on time.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer!!! Will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> Maybe I received a bad batch, but the odor of the oil was very bad, like feces or something decayed.  I could not put it on my face because of the smell.  I think Argan oil is to have a light odor, almost nutty, but this one had a very strong odor.</li>
    <li> I normally use one drop of this oil in my foundation, to create a more natural look on my face. It could blend in with many different foundations, and it would not block your pores. I also tried once using this oil to remove some coffee stains on my sweater, and it actually works! Only concern is the price, it&#x27;s a little bit high.</li>
    <li> High Quality and works very well on my hair. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Very nourishing oils, did not allergic to savor, but a straw cover when traveling there is a little leak.I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. First time I use argan oil and really like it, specially applying it on my hair, it makes freeze go away without making my hair greasy as with other kind on oils.</li>
    <li> I like this oil, makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, sweet seller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some small holes on my face because of acnes. I used this product every night before I put my softener. After one week, I can clearly see the holes are minimized and even flattened! Just can&#x27;t believe it!</li>
    <li> This oil is great. I use it as a moisturizer for my face at night,on my hands,and on my cuticle.This oil has no smell and it soaks into the skin VERY fast.And you only need a few drops to do it all,and your hands will feel silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone  that wants to use something that is all natural. And the price is right.</li>
    <li> Love this oil, I&#x27;m not sure if its really 100% vitamin E but I feel great after I apply it on my hands.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the Argan Oil!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and seems to be good quality. Makes my skin smooth but my hair is a little too thin so though really soft looks greasy. Very helpful seller!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this to make the creams and lotions that I want to yet but I have used it on my skin and it feels wonderful! Seems to be very good quality and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have used this on my face. It makes my skin so soft. When its cold outside this is very important. I&#x27;m going to try it on my hair a later time. I will review it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this oil to use as a carrier oil for my essential oils. I have found that it not only works wonderfully for that, but its amazing all by itself. This oil is hydrating without leaving any oilly residue. Quality.</li>
    <li> Great for adding to homemade skin care recipes</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s great on my face, it&#x27;s great on my hair and it&#x27;s great on my skin. You can&#x27;t beat the price and it lasts a while (a little goes a long way!) I would highly recommend it and plan on getting it from here on out.</li>
    <li> Excellant product. I have curly and dry hair plus I have  very hard water which damages my hair. Since I have used this my hair is soft and very managble</li>
    <li> Not satisfied with results of this oil...and it could have at least been pre packed with a small pamphlet with suggested uses or concoctions</li>
    <li> Great quality, I bought it for my wife, and she already looking to buy the bigger bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Try it. It really works.</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is pure, soothing, velvety soft, and exactly what I was looking for to use on my skin and hair!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS OIL,ITS SOAKS IN RIGHT AWAY AND NOOOOOOO GREASY FEEL EVER, ALSO I HAD A SUPER BAD BURN FROM A WOOD STOVE I PUT BURN LOTION ON IT,IT GOT INFECTED, CLEANED IT DRIED IT  AND PUT THIS OILL ALL OVER IT,IT IS HEALING GREAT AND NO SCAR I AM SO SURPRISE</li>
    <li> Lovely, rich Organic Argan Oil with replenishing nutrition for my face and hands.  I think it smells addictive and feels like silk on my face and hand.</li>
    <li> Is very good, I use this product for the skin around my eyes, I quit using very expensive eye creams that did not work the way this oil is working on that area, my eyes lid are getting more hydrated and firm with this nice oil, I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Argan oil has changed my hair for the better.  I live in the PNW where it&#x27;s cold and humid, which has always left my hair damaged and frizzy. I have long hair, almost to my rear end, and using a little in the bottom half of my hair everyday has eliminated frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is not to over apply and don&#x27;t shampoo or condition in the ends of your hair at all. Make sure to use a gentle chemical free &amp;#34;shampoo.&amp;#34; Brush a small amount of Argan oil, I use about four to six drops rubbed in my hands and applied as evenly as possible, into your hair for 3 minutes after a shower. Style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every week use a deep condition with raw Shea butter. Coat your hair, leave it in for at least 20 minutes and rinse ends while only shampooing the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You many notice in the beginning that your hair isn&#x27;t perfectly smooth all over, this is just your hair finally adjusting to not being stripped of needed oil from your usual products. My scalp used over produce oil and after a month of this routine it regulated to allow me to shampoo every 3 days. Argan oil is amazingly healthy for your hair and can replace conditioning altogether, allowing a simple hair routine with limited chemical exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband even uses a little Argan oil for shine and style instead of pomades now. He has short brown hair but it&#x27;s always touchable now and looks super healthy.</li>
    <li> I have a small dry spot on my leg that would not go away even with lotion. I&#x27;ve been using theVitamin E drops and its gradually disappearing!</li>
    <li> Came exactly as described and super fast! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin soft and shiny</li>
    <li> A very positive experience! The seller really cares about clients and makes sure to deliver the highest quality of services.Thank you!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Skin was noticeably softer after a week.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and the Eve Hansen co.  The company is very interested in how I&lt;br /&gt;received my package.  The product is not heavy and blends into my skin beautifully.  I am of a mature&lt;br /&gt;age and anything that gives my skin a more youthful feel and look is very important to me.  Plus anyone&lt;br /&gt;Other than an infant will appreciate this great feeling skin.</li>
    <li> Nice :) (sorry, Im lazy to type. It was really nice to use though.)</li>

    <li> Lightweight and easily absorbed.  Makes my skin feel like silk.</li>
    <li> Has helped with my damaged hair,makes it soft and shiny and healthy love it</li>
    <li> I added this to the bath salt that I made, along with my favorite essential oil, Epsom salt and dead sea salt.  It was the most moisturizing bath that I have ever had.  When I stepped out of the bath, I felt like I had just put lotion on.  I highly recommend this, especially in the winter!</li>
    <li> love the product I use in my hair and on my face and my face feels so soft after I use it. It is a great product and will buy again great customer service as well!</li>
    <li> Fake.&lt;br /&gt;This oily product didn&#x27;t bring any changes. All the reviews seem faked when I look at the dates and the way they are written.</li>
    <li> I&#x27; m not sure yet how I feel about this product. I found that applying it in the morning tends to make my skin very oily. I&#x27;ve been using it only before bed and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference except my skin feels softer.</li>
    <li> This oil really works on rough skin, especially elbows and cuticles.  Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Omg....when you see all the reviews about this oil making faces silky, soft, and smooth....please please please believe us when we say it. I received this oil today and used it shortly after on my face and I mean its so light and my skin has been feeling clean, soft, and smooth all day. I know I will be buying this.again, in the bigger bottle next time.</li>
    <li> I can not say much about this product because just a week ago that I&#x27;m using, but I have felt my skin softer, also has a very light texture and does not leave my skin greasy. Delivery was also very quick.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel soft and silky, not oily.</li>
    <li> I switched from emu oil to this to try it and I had to got back to emu oil.  Argon oil is good but beware it may make you break out!  It broke me out bad, emu oil did not break me out.  So those of you who are or want to use Argon oil you can just get the clear emu oil instead of the regular emu oil. Hope this helps you.</li>
    <li> This organic oil smells fresh and leaves the skin very smooth. Highly recommended for skin problems. You will see immediate results and using the oil for a long time will make the skin even better.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and absorbs quickly. It is now a regular part of my morning and nighttime routine.</li>
    <li> this is a good product. I have very dry skin and had hard find product that keep my skin moist. this product brighten up my skin and keep in nice and moist almost all day. I will purchase it again</li>
    <li> This is the most legit 100% argan oil I have found since I became obsessed in morocco. I love this stuff and use it for everything. This one is really 100% argan oil and not filled with other additives.  And it&#x27;s a great price. I love Eve Hansen and will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works I had a white spot on my face. I tried everything &amp; it would not fade . I tried it &amp; within 3 days it was gone.</li>
    <li> I think its the best teeatment fod my hair vich i ever have</li>
    <li> This oil is very light and definitely Not greasy! It makes my skin smooth and soft while healing dry areas such as; elbows, knees, feet and butt!</li>
    <li> Simple Amazing !  I just bought this oil a few weeks ago I been wearing it mornings and nights before bed time.  My skin feels more soft and with more hydrate. Even I am applying to my 8 years old little girl.  She loves it too.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  My skin is very soft when I use this.</li>
    <li> Very good oil my face is very silly and I noticed sun spots are diminishing</li>
    <li> Argan Oil is one of those unexpectedly versatile products. My hair Loves it and I&#x27;m now using it on my relative&#x27;s dogs for their horrific dry skin. Scabs and large flakes of dry dead skin have been shedding off regularly and all three dogs look great with barely a scratch from itching!</li>
    <li> This is a very convenient form of Argan oil. It is light and clear in consistency. It can be added to another product which is why I got it to add to my Shampoo. I did try putting this on my face and it did seem to give my skins under my eyes some smoothness after a few days... The oil is very greasy so you have to be careful not to apply to much directly as it is difficult to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Can mix with other product easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Messy if Spilled</li>
    <li> Great for dry winter skin (face, hands, and feet). Haven&#x27;t tried in my hair yet, but will probably do that soon.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. This is my first time using this oil and just can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. It moisturizes like nothing else I have ever used. Makes my skin look youthful and plump. I am 64 and I&#x27;ve seen lines completely disappear. Not just reduce, but be gone completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I recently got some oregano oil on my eyelid and it was burning like crazy. The only thing I had with me in my purse was this Argan oil. Just hoping it might dilute the oregano oil I applied one drop. I was amazed that the burning stopped immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just really love this oil and this brand. Tried one other one and didn&#x27;t like it as well. It was good, but this one is great.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I use it in face products and soaps.</li>
    <li> Actually,  I ordered it by mistake. But since I had it I decided to use it. It&#x27;s a little oily for my skin, but I mix it in the water in my hair mister (I have curly hair). It makes my hair shiny without being stiff or greasy. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product I use daily on face and on my hair after I wash it.</li>
    <li> I really liked this Argan oil.</li>
    <li> Love this argon oil. My skin feels amazing after using it and letting it soak in.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  I have been using it on a surgery scar with great success.</li>
    <li> I like the oil but I really have to use often on my hands because of excessive dryness. The winter weather is the worse for my dry skin. I have been using it for my hands, hair and mixed in with Shea Butter to add more oil and to help in moisturizing my skin. It is nice to mix some with some olive ,the (extra virgin olive oil  kind, as an moisturizer on the hair after washing and conditioning. It is less tangle and feels soft!</li>
    <li> My wife says this is a very soothing oil, great for rough, irritated skin.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. This seems to be a really good, quality oil and I use it constantly. A little goes a long way so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Great oil for hair!!!!! I am not impressed about the effect on my skin, but it is an amazing hair product. I leaves your hair with a nice shine and soft feeling. Just be careful not to apply too much product.</li>
    <li> Love this product - it&#x27;s very moisturizing</li>
    <li> Great product, love it! def worth it, and price great too.</li>
    <li> Awesome oil, noticed a difference right away with face and lips!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought it to reduce my stretch marks. It didn&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> It does help with dry skin,</li>
    <li> Great price, product, and shipping.</li>
    <li> Great for face and ends of hair by itself. I also made my own moisturizers with it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love the oil.  I used it in my home made lip balm as well as my home made hand sanitizer.  I wanted to use only organic, pure ingredients.</li>
    <li> The smell is horrible and just fishy and the consistency of the oil is good not too thick and not watery. Other than that its good</li>
    <li> Great addition to my aromatherapy bath scrubs!</li>
    <li> Great customer service, quick shipping &amp; good quality. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I dont know whether it would be miracle or not.  But it might have some good effect to your skin. I am hoping it to be a miracle</li>
    <li> &#x27;ve been using it on my face, hands, and feet to&lt;br /&gt;hydrate.  So far I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results.  I wish it lasted&lt;br /&gt;longer on my hands, but with washing them throughout the day, it makes it&lt;br /&gt;harder.  The customer service has been great and the package was delivered&lt;br /&gt;as scheduled</li>
    <li> Great! Feels authentic 100% Argan Oil. I use it on my face, hair and body.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Will purchase more. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels on my face. Feels silky smooth. I use it day and night. Love the results. Will be buying more!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Absorbs fast.  Leaves skin very soft.</li>
    <li> A small amount rubbed on a dry spot it goes away after a couple of times</li>
    <li> I love this oil, I use it after a manicure to hydrate my nails and skin. I will start using it in my DIY beauty products as well.</li>
    <li> I love this product, very good quality!</li>
    <li> I bought this because my friend told me how great argon oil is for everything. I really like this product. not just because  it is organic, but also it has improved my complexion. I have oily skin and this doesn&#x27;t make me break out or give more oil. I use at morning before applying makeup and at night after washing my face before bed. excellent on the hair too. im also testing this product on my eczema instead of the prescription given by the dr. So far there is no scratching, and it has improved my hands..</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase!! Thank you very much!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I received the Argan oil today. After opening that wonderful Amazon box I put it on my hands and...WOW...I fell in love! It&#x27;s amazing and I will be using it on my face tonight and tomorrow morning. Can&#x27;t forget my hands, they loved it too!  I will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works beautifully! Lots of product information! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Really makes my face and neck soft..better than using high priced face lotion. I will keep ordering this Argan oil over and over.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Since using the argan oil, I have noticed improvements with my skin and hair. Just a few drops a day is all I use on my hair and skin. My hair is gradually growing in spots that were receding.  My skin is smoother and I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my body oily. I love this product!</li>
    <li> This product came quickly and was as expected. I was impressed that the company sent several emails inquiring about satisfaction. Also, tips on how to use the product. I would recommend Eve Hansen to anyone.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and fast service.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Just started but I&#x27;m 61 and have been looking for something light, organic, fresh, something different than creams. I have always had oily skin in my younger days and now that my skin is dryer I&#x27;m hoping this is what I have been looking for. So far so good. But as I said, I&#x27;ve only just started using it on my skin. I have used it on the ends of my hair (I have shoulder length hair, naturally wavy/curly) not sure if I like the feel. Makes my hair flyaway, but then I&#x27;m in a very dry climate. Well, so far so good. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I just switched to using Argan Oil (with added drops of Lavender and Frankincense EOs) as my morning and night moisturizer for my face. It absorbs quickly, you only need a little, and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin tone evening out, pores getting smaller, even wrinkles diminishing. In trying to rid myself of hidden toxins in my skincare routine, I eliminated my cleanser and went with a body washcloth from Norwex (no soap required), then follow up with the oil. After years of using a foundation to blend the skin tone splotches, I haven&#x27;t had to wear any lately! I&#x27;m a happy customer. Will buy again! This product is for 1 fl ounce but should last me 3-6 months, or so I&#x27;m told, depending on what I&#x27;m using it for I guess. I also snuck a bit in my handmade foaming hand soap, to get the moisturizing effect during the dry winter. I can tell when I use the soap too. Hands are pretty smooth.</li>
    <li> It only takes a few drops and it has my hair feeling silky and soft.  I was amazed at how little it took to use.  I will use this in the future with no hesitation and will spread the word to all natural beauties.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t tell a differnce</li>
    <li> Such a fantastic product! Eve Hansen is great, I love all the products, makes my skin and hair look and feel 100x better. And it makes me feel good to know that I am using high quality products. And not some random stuff i got at the drug store.</li>
    <li> The Organ Oil arrived very quickly and was exactly as described.  Very happy with the seller.  I have had it just a short time so have not been able to use it a lot.  I did use it on my hair.  My hair was very dry and just a small amount made it very soft and shiny.  I have used it on my face and hands and like the results.</li>
    <li> Works great. I use it on scars from surgery and the scars are getting better over a few weeks time. Great price!</li>
    <li> I have used Argan oil for about a year and like the way it feels on my skin.  This is the first time I have used the Eve Hansen brand of Argan Oil, and I love it.  I will continue using only this brand from now on.  I am 75 years old and have seen a difference in my skin already.</li>
    <li> An excellent product without unwanted additives.</li>
    <li> works great for my hair</li>
    <li> I love this oil!  it is very light and it will make your skin feel softer.  Perfect for minimizing fine lines on the face and neck.</li>
    <li> My wife likes it. Says it&#x27;s not oily. You women! :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product - used on face and for stretch marks and it worked wonders</li>
    <li> Great product and price. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m looking better already! Thank you</li>
    <li> Love this oil is amazing what it does to your skin and hair. It quickly absorbs and deeply penetrates your skin and hair! Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Argan oil as a less expensive alternative to the Moroccan Oil I had been using on my hair. I swim in a chlorinated pool regularly and found that I needed the oil treatment, even with using a conditioner in the shower to control dryness and frizzies. Unfortunately, the Argan oil was NOT at all effective on my hair. The Argan oil left my hair oily and it clumped together with no bounce or movement. I may try the Argan oil on my skin, but basically I have concluded the oil is unusable for my purposes.</li>
    <li> First argan oil I&#x27;ve ever used, so I can&#x27;t offer brand comparisons. But I do know this stuff works as far as clearing the skin and imparting a glow. For whatever annoying reason, I was getting zits on my face occasionally (I thought I had aged out of this!), and I make them worse because I tend to pick. This argan oil healed the spots in record time and smoothed the skin so much that there was no roughness for me to pick at. A couple weeks after starting the argan oil (and after it had cleared my skin), I commenced using a retinol product, and though that product is marketed as a moisturizer, it leaves my skin too dry (typical of retinol products on dry skin), so I follow with the argan oil. That arrangement seems to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, Feb. 16: I&#x27;m still impressed with this product. And I speak as someone who is not the least bit &amp;#34;trendy&amp;#34;; I do not jump on bandwagons, and my reaction to change is usually reluctance. But I thought, &amp;#34;If it&#x27;s 100% guaranteed, why not try it?&amp;#34; I&#x27;m older, and I use more than the recommended two drops because my skin is so dry. But that regimen is definitely paying off; my skin looks better than it has in a very long time. I just ordered the larger bottle, which is by far the better buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, Dec. 2: Still working on the 4-ounce bottle I bought in February, and I have more than an ounce to go with twice-a-day liberal usage. I was at first struck by the oil&#x27;s healing properties, but now I&#x27;m impressed with its ability to smooth wrinkles. I didn&#x27;t like the retinol product I was using, so I dispensed with that but continued with this oil, and I think it&#x27;s the more effective of the two. The lines above my lips are not nearly as noticeable. I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of different moisturizers in my life, usually luxury brands with big price tags (I&#x27;m not wealthy, but my reasoning was, &amp;#34;I can always buy a new pair of shoes or a new dress, but I can&#x27;t buy new skin&amp;#34;). This products costs so little, and it beats my earlier products hands-down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, May 22, 2016: Only now is my 4 oz supply giving out. I went back to a retinol product and promptly broke out. I&#x27;m aware that&#x27;s a typical reaction, but I started mixing the retinol with the argan oil and found that to work better than applying them separately. Still a believer, and I&#x27;m about to order my second 4 oz bottle, which is even cheaper now than when I ordered the first bottle in February 2015!er products hands-down.

    <li> Very nice oil. I added it to the mineral foundation I made. I really like the feel of the oil on my face.</li>
    <li> Real 100% Argan oil, just too small of a bottle for the price..but hey that&#x27;s the price you pay for real Argan oil</li>
    <li> Have my soft feeling so smooth like a baby bottom. I gave it a 4 because of the size and the dip stick. It&#x27;s hard to get the product the dip stick.</li>
    <li> I LOVE you this oil! It&#x27;s a miracle worker. Use it on your face and see how much softer your face becomes. Use it on your hair and appreciate how shines your hair will be!</li>
    <li> My daughter, who lives in “humidity central” Oregon, swears by argan oil.  She uses it on skin and hair and calls it “the best ever.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, in “dry central” Texas, argan oil, a very light oil, fails the test on skin, hair, and nails.  After days of use, I still have cracked skin and cracked cuticles, so no matter how much my daughter loves it, I cannot agree. I assume that location has a big influence on the effectiveness of argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m giving this oil to my daughter who rates it “FIVE STARS,” while I rate it “ONE STAR.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Average rating: Three STARS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in homemade lotions and I put a few drops in my manicure soak.  It works wonders on my hands and cuticles. Definitely a good buy and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a face oil to travel with and refresh from &amp;#34;airplane air.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s very lightweight. I like to spritz a little rose water and then massage this into the skin.</li>
    <li> Blends in nicely with your skin. Doesnt soak in as dry and quickly as I thought it would. I also used it on my husbands excuma and it seemed to help some.</li>
    <li> I am amazed in the results of this product. It&#x27;s only been a week and I see changes! I use to use clinique and all these other company&#x27;s and I felt as if the chemicals made my face red and worse. I just use this now.&lt;br /&gt;I love how the seller even sent me ways to use this product as well asked if I recieved the product. 5 Stars! For product.</li>
    <li> I have noticed my eye puffiness and few wrinkles going away. that after 1 week of use</li>
    <li> Good. Feels like my skin is smooth.</li>
    <li> This argon oil is quite nice. Not overly &#x27;oily&#x27; on my skin. It tends to absorb pretty quickly with no unpleasant smell or feel. It also never irritates my overly sensitive skin which is great! Will absolutely be a repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> This oil was a great price. However it does not have any of the indicators of what good quality argan oil should have like a distinct scent or color. I will use this oil for making my vitamin C serum, but I&#x27;m not sure I will re-purchase it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my face for a few weeks  and am amazed at the difference!!  I had some very dry patches that are completely gone and my skin is so soft!  My colleagues gave even noticed the difference!  I am now using it instead of my usual night cream.  This oil has definitely become part of my permanent skin routine!</li>
