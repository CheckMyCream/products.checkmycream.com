      <li>So I am a satisfied customer!</li>

      <li>I love the color and love that I can curl this wig.</li>
      <li>I was so glad that I ordered</li>
      <li>I love love this wig.</li>
      <li>I love this hairstyle, I use to get my hair cut like this.</li>
      <li>Love the highlights in Champagne.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love.</li>
      <li>This is the BEST short wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
      <li>Matter of fact, it looked much better on her than me, so again it didn&#x27;t rock my world, but it will work on some.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this wig.</li>
      <li>I love the color champagne.</li>
      <li>The wig looks cute in the picture, but it must have taken quite a bit of manipulation to get it to look that way on the model&#x27;s head.</li>
      <li>Great product that works very well for my needs.</li>
      <li>This wig is weightless on your head, it doesn&#x27;t make your head feel hot, and it is a great fit.</li>
      <li>Easy to style.</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a beautiful wig.</li>
      <li>People constantly think it&#x27;s my real hair, and the fit is perfect with no front combs!</li>
      <li>I just doesn&#x27;t feel as secure as I would like it to be.</li>
      <li>My mom actually liked the Sensationnel Bump Wig Collection so much that she purchased the Vogue Crop and Feather Charm wigs from the collection.</li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>
      <li>If you have thick hair, this wig is not for you, as not even the best compression wig caps will be able to camouflage your style underneath the wig.</li>
      <li>Fun to wear!</li>
      <li>I first wore it on christmas and got soo many compliments.</li>
      <li>Since, my mother had such a good reception and experience with the wig, I will increase my intial rating from 2 to 4 stars.</li>
      <li>It looks like a quick weave.</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s a very reasonable price for a human hair wig, the fit could be much better.</li>
      <li>it was just right.</li>
      <li>I first saw this wig on youtube.</li>
      <li>I love them, i just need to find them in different designs.</li>
      <li>It looks and feels soft just like hh, but It will require a light product to give it life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>After manipulating the front I was able to rock the curls to the opposite side of the description on the package.</li>
      <li>I love this wig so much, I ordered a second wig in 1B.</li>
      <li>The hair is beautiful &amp; easy to style, however it was a little short in the back</li>
      <li>Perfect little short cut, fits very well and is definitely something you should have for the hot summers.</li>
      <li>Would recommend to anyone who was interested in a new sassy look!</li>
      <li>In the end I really do like this wig.  </li>
      <li>Next day delivery which I was so excited about.</li>
      <li>I was able to curl, cut spike do all sorts of things include shave it down a bit using my clippers with gaurds on.</li>
      <li>I received my package fast and in regular packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like this wig, the price, the color (although a bit too shiny for human hair even after washing), the style capabilities etc.  </li>
      <li>and there was a considerable amount of gray hair in the wig instead of the color it was supposed to be.</li>
      <li>I used a few hairpins in the front to secure it</li>
      <li>This wig looks so natural.</li>
      <li>Hairline doesn&#x27;t line up with your natural hairline.</li>
      <li>I am going natural so</li>
      <li>I am natural and I was looking for a change.</li>
      <li>its not to friendly with winter nor heavy wind.</li>
      <li>My only issues besides the shiny factor is that there&#x27;s no front comb, its a bit tight in keeping it secure.  </li>
      <li>I hope my second wig is in good condition otherwise I will be one angry customer.</li>
      <li>I thought the unit fit small compared to my other units.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To make a long story short, I didn&#x27;t wear this wig out of the house and generally wouldn&#x27;t recommend this wig.(Too</li>

<li> Out the pack: This unit looked very dry, dull and flat no curls or uumph at all!</li>

<li> I wear it almost everyday.</li>
<li> I usually wear a 27 piece quickweave tapered down for those of u that know what that is and its always on point.</li>

<li> NOT SURE IF I would buy it again, maybe.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I received my wig and like the style of the wig. However, in the front of the wig there was a track piece hanging down. I immediately called Amazon and requested a replacement wig. Amazon apologized since it was shipped via third party. I know it wasn&#x27;t Amazon&#x27;s fault at all. I hope my second wig is in good condition otherwise I will be one angry customer.</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s a very reasonable price for a human hair wig, the fit could be much better. I have thick hair and even it I cornrow my hair under neath the wig it still moves quit a bit. I just doesn&#x27;t feel as secure as I would like it to be. But I love the color and style!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wig. The shipping was on time, fits and feels good. I love the color and love that I can curl this wig. Great buy for a great price.</li>
    <li> I am natural and I was looking for a change. I was worried about it looking wiggy. This wig looks so natural. This wig is a must have! I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> Perfect little short cut, fits very well and is definitely something you should have for the hot summers.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product. The coloring was not as  Shown and there was a considerable amount of gray hair in the wig instead of the color it was supposed to be. In the example of the product it showed a nice cut and nice coloring. The wig I got looked nothing like the example.</li>
    <li> Out the pack: This unit looked very dry, dull and flat no curls or uumph at all! It looks and feels soft just like hh, but It will require a light product to give it life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Styling: I decided to purchase this wig after reading/watching reviews. After manipulating the front I was able to rock the curls to the opposite side of the description on the package. The unit was very short in the back so I used my micro flat iron to rebump it and my reg size in the front. It did shed with the initial brushing, but hasn&#x27;t shed since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort/Size: (Small) This unit only has 1 comb in the back at the nape of the neck with 2 adjusters. I thought the unit fit small compared to my other units. Hairline doesn&#x27;t line up with your natural hairline. I found myself constantly re-adjusting it felt like it was going to slide off. I used a few hairpins in the front to secure it the following day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied Customer: I am happy with my purchase so I will wear this in between styles. I received my package fast and in regular packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it a 4 rating for the small sizing and lack of combs in the front.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a short style without cutting my hair. I usually wear a 27 piece quickweave tapered down for those of u that know what that is and its always on point. well this gave the same results if not better without having to use damaging glues. I first saw this wig on youtube. I got it in a color champagne it was just right. I was able to curl, cut spike do all sorts of things include shave it down a bit using my clippers with gaurds on. I first wore it on christmas and got soo many compliments. I have since ordered another for me. and my coworkers had me to order them two. I have washed it  twice it falls back in place. hope they keep making this one</li>
    <li> On time delivery an the wig is just as described. So I am a satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> so far so good. I wish a came with a cap. but oh well I&#x27;ll be one. its best for spring and summer. its not to friendly with winter nor heavy wind. other than that, I LIKE IT NOT SURE IF I would buy it again, maybe. I love the color champagne.</li>
    <li> item came just like described, no discrepencies noted. I love them, i just need to find them in different designs.</li>
    <li> Very cute wig. Fun to wear!</li>
    <li> I love this hairstyle, I use to get my hair cut like this. Now I have this, I can wash and curl as a stand bye.  I hope Amazon continues to sell.</li>
    <li> The hair is beautiful &amp; easy to style, however it was a little short in the back but this was due to my natural hair. My hair is shoulder length so I braid it before wearing the wig which made it rise in the back. It still looked great &amp; I had to use trimmers on the nape of my neck. Overall it&#x27;s a beautiful wig.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig in Champagne. Love, love, love. I wear it almost everyday. Easy to style. The streaks are perfect. The only con about this wig is that the edges appear to be a big &#x27;hard&#x27; to me, meaning depending on how you part it, it looks like the stocking cap underneath. I just comb it over the edges so that you can&#x27;t see the hairline. Next day delivery which I was so excited about. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this wig, the price, the color (although a bit too shiny for human hair even after washing), the style capabilities etc.  My only issues besides the shiny factor is that there&#x27;s no front comb, its a bit tight in keeping it secure.  I cut the front myself to make it short.  In the end I really do like this wig.  I am going natural so its been my every day go to hair while I grow my own out.  I get lots of compliments on it.  Get it and see for yourself.</li>
    <li> I love love this wig. It looks like a quick weave.</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this wig I get several compliments! I was so glad that I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;There are others styles from this same line that I would like to try but choosing a color is unclear; the site should give a guide for the color codes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this wig everyday to work for the past 3 months and it&#x27;s still a beauty! People constantly think it&#x27;s my real hair, and the fit is perfect with no front combs! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> The cut of the wig is extremely ackward and is longer than what appears on the model.  The wig cap is also uncomfortable after a while.  I would not recommend the porduct</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the color (champagne) when it arrived but once I put it on, I fell in love!!!! This wig is weightless on your head, it doesn&#x27;t make your head feel hot, and it is a great fit. I love this wig so much, I ordered a second wig in 1B.</li>
    <li> The wig looks cute in the picture, but it must have taken quite a bit of manipulation to get it to look that way on the model&#x27;s head. Out of the bag I attempted to coax the fringe bang to match the picture, but it looks as if the model&#x27;s unit may have been trimmed in the front (I didn&#x27;t have time for that). While the wig is roomy, when it is on your head it seems to show a bit of lumps with flat braids. If you have thick hair, this wig is not for you, as not even the best compression wig caps will be able to camouflage your style underneath the wig. Also, the hair did not feel like it was 100% human, but maybe had a few synthetic fibers blended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short, I didn&#x27;t wear this wig out of the house and generally wouldn&#x27;t recommend this wig.(Too bad I&#x27;m stuck with a wig I didn&#x27;t wear. :/ )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update!!! I did pass this off to my mother and she loved it! Matter of fact, it looked much better on her than me, so again it didn&#x27;t rock my world, but it will work on some. My mom actually liked the Sensationnel Bump Wig Collection so much that she purchased the Vogue Crop and Feather Charm wigs from the collection. Since, my mother had such a good reception and experience with the wig, I will increase my intial rating from 2 to 4 stars. Lesson learned: Buying a short wig for my thick, semi-long hair is going to be a struggle.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST short wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Love the highlights in Champagne.</li>
    <li> On time with great packaging. Everything was as described. I love the wig, get great compliments. Would recommend to anyone who was interested in a new sassy look!</li>
    <li> Great product that works very well for my needs. Thank you for offering a great product at a great price.</li>
