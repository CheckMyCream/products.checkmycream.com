<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this beautiful cologne.</li>
<li> /&gt;the scent is just right...not too strong, not too subtle.</li>
<li> , is that the scent does not stick around long enough.  </li>
<li> maybe it as been exposed to the sun for too long.</li>
<li> It did not smell the same, also the packaging was not right and the perfume liquid has floaties and particles in it.  </li>
<li> I usually wear this perfume and what was delivered in a Ralph Lauren box with the Blue name on it is not the actual perfume.  </li>
<li> I found that the cost is less on Amazon compared to other places I have purchased Blue.</li>
<li> I would not have expected this from Amazon.  </li>
<li> The perfume that I spent $50 dollars on has no smell.  </li>
<li> , I haven&#x27;t smellt any other perfume like it before.  </li>
<li> I use other scents when I am in the mood for a change, but this is MY smell.</li>
<li> Really unhappy as its a huge waste of 80.00.  </li>
<li> I really think I received fake perfume</li>
<li> I spent 80.00 on this, its a complete fake, My mom and myself have worn this for years.  </li>
<li> I have read a few negative feedbacks on buying Blue on line..</li>
<li> Not too flowery and not sweet.</li>
<li> This bottle has very little fragrance.  </li>
<li> I find myself reapplying once (at least) a day.  </li>
<li> I will not use any other perfume, EVER!!!!</li>
<li> The only downside was that the packaging was atrocious.</li>
<li> (even from feet behind).</li>
<li> There is nothing worse, in my opinion, than to be overwhelmed by someone else&#x27;s scent.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Brilliant service for a wonderful fragrance that sadly is not easily found on the shelves anymore.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my mother to give as a mothers day gift and she loved it. the price was so much better than the department stores. I was very happy with the price, free shipping and how quickly it arrived.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my mother.  She just now (Sept 2nd) informed me that this product was a counterfeit.  She said it started to lose it&#x27;s fragrance after a month.  She wrote to Ralph Lauren and was told to return it.  Of course, since it was a gift, she couldn&#x27;t do that.  She then talked to a local merchant that carried the product and was told to bring it in. It was at that local merchant that she was informed the product was a counterfeit.  So, I&#x27;m out the money and she&#x27;s out the gift.  She was also informed that counterfeit fragrances can have dangerous chemicals.  I would not have expected this from Amazon.  Guess no place is safe to shop these days.</li>
    <li> I have read a few negative feedbacks on buying Blue on line..Maybe I should keep my mouth shut and then there would always be an abundance of this product for me to wear.I love this parfume and dont start my day without a spray. I started wearing this when it first was offered and it has remained my favorite ever since!.and more often than not people will stop me and ask....What is that you are wearing? Both men and women.I love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best perfume I have ever purchased.  Every time I wear it, people comment, and I absolutely adore the scent!  It also arrived quickly and was well packaged!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I shopped and this was the best deal that I could find. It was delivered on time with no problems, exactly as described.</li>
    <li> This product contains the most volume for the best price. The vendor sent it promptly and I could not be more satisfied!</li>
    <li> This scent is very suble but effective.  I have had several compliments on the fragrance.  It is not a strong scent but very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing ralph lauren blue ever since my ex bought it for me for Christmas three years ago. This would be my third 4.2 oz bottle of it! I have tried finding a new scent to call my own, but I keep coming back to Blue. I use other scents when I am in the mood for a change, but this is MY smell. One of my best friends won&#x27;t even buy it because it seems like my smell :)   Its so unique, I haven&#x27;t smellt any other perfume like it before.  Not too flowery and not sweet. But somehow, YUMMY! :) Which is why my ex adored it more than any other smell!  Its one of those smells that makes a statement. I&#x27;ve had random people ask me what I am wearing or tell me I smell amazing. (even from feet behind). At the same time it is never overpowering nor headache giving. Even when I&#x27;m drenched in it, its somehow never TOO much.  Its almost like the smell of the ocean or something. Give it a chance. Chances are you will love it. All my friends of all ages seem to think it smells good.  (oh and the bottle is SOO beautiful! Blue glass and a silver top)  Go for blue!</li>
    <li> I smelled this perfume in the store, and immediately thought of one of my friends who was looking for a new scent. A gamble on my part,but I loved it so much,I was almost sure that she would too. I was right-she absolutely LOVED it. Now, she won&#x27;t wear anything else! It really is spectacular.</li>
    <li> Great Item!! Love Ralph Lauren Blue for women. This is the real Eau De Toilette Spray. You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells sooooo goood! I love it and have worn it for years now. Everyone compliments me all the time on how good I smell. I wouldn&#x27;t wear anything else. Plus not only does it smell good, the name fits me as I love the color blue.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this perfume! &lt;br /&gt;i always get compliments on it. &lt;br /&gt;the scent is just right...not too strong, not too subtle.</li>
    <li> I am one of those individuals who cannot wear any scent I may be drawn to because most give me headaches.  Of the few I can wear this is one of my favorite!  It is light and subtle, not powdery, and not overbearing so that someone needs to be right next to you to beaware of your fragrance.  There is nothing worse, in my opinion, than to be overwhelmed by someone else&#x27;s scent.  I even wear this when I&#x27;m staying-in because I enjoy the fragrance that much.  My only criticism and reason for 4*&#x27;s vs. 5, is that the scent does not stick around long enough.  I find myself reapplying once (at least) a day.  They need a body oil or lotion.  I haven&#x27;t tried the gel yet but maybe layering it with that would help it last.</li>
    <li> More compliments when I wear Ralph Lauren Blue.  Mild, clean scent.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this beautiful cologne.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT! I&#x27;ve been wearing it since it debuted several years ago. My sister in law just had to have some when she smelled it on me. I get so many compliments on it and it works in all seasons.</li>
    <li> I am very upset that it is a knock off</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff!!! Smells divine.</li>
    <li> My absolute Favorite :)</li>
    <li> I bought RL Blue in  2003, the fragrant floral smell remind me of a street I grew up in. It had rows of Michelia Alba trees along the sidewalk. This fragrance smells settle and not too over powering, it is a perfume that you spray and walk into. I get stopped all the time asking what pefume I&#x27;m wearing? I love it!</li>
    <li> smells great! shipped quickly</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not the real perfume. I didn&#x27;t like it. maybe it as been exposed to the sun for too long.</li>
    <li> I have been using this perfume for about two weeks now and am very disappointed.  I usually wear this perfume and what was delivered in a Ralph Lauren box with the Blue name on it is not the actual perfume.  The perfume that I spent $50 dollars on has no smell.  I will never buy perfume from Amazon again.  I really think I received fake perfume</li>
    <li> I love it been using for over 10 years!</li>
    <li> Great Christmas gift.  Wife wears it and I enjoy the scent.  Also good for keeping us closer together if you know what I mean....</li>
    <li> Amazon never disappoints! ! Have been faithful household for years!!</li>
    <li> The Mrs. favorite. The price was better than anywhere else I found in stores or on-line. The only downside was that the packaging was atrocious. It&#x27;s a testament to the post office that the bottle didn&#x27;t break in transit.</li>
    <li> smelles gooe on the wife</li>
    <li> My all time favorite perfume. I get compliments all the time. Very &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Love me some Ralph Lauren!!</li>
    <li> My mom loves this perfume. Only 4 stars because I personally can&#x27;t stand the scent.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. It is light and isn&#x27;t overpowering. I receive many compliments when I wear this.</li>
    <li> Love it. My favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> Never got the item waited a couple of weeks then finally received and email saying this item was on back order and the consumer was unsure of when it was going to be available</li>
    <li> I spent 80.00 on this, its a complete fake, My mom and myself have worn this for years.  It did not smell the same, also the packaging was not right and the perfume liquid has floaties and particles in it.  I tried to return for refund, but its not allowing me to.  Really unhappy as its a huge waste of 80.00.  Would give 0 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! Smell is clean and last all day long. I get compliments constantly.... I will not use any other perfume, EVER!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using Blue since it originally debuted and loves it.</li>
    <li> Both my daughter-in-law and I wear and love this cologne.  Light fragrance.  I found that the cost is less on Amazon compared to other places I have purchased Blue.</li>
    <li> I have worn this cologne for several years.  This bottle has very little fragrance.  I am very disappointed.</li>
