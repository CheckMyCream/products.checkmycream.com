      <li>love the scent of this product</li>
      <li>I love the smell of it, and I wish they sold it in stores.</li>
      <li>I love everything about it.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Products are satisfied.</li>
      <li>just wish the company would listen to customer requests and make a larger bottle...32 ounces would be ideal!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
      <li>So all of you who haven&#x27;t tried Olbas; they also make a great Inhaler too: I highly recommend you do so.</li>
      <li>This product is perfect after long workouts as well as for body aches from flu and colds.</li>
      <li>Also helps soothe aches and pains when used in a good hot bath.</li>
      <li>Only two capfuls to a full bath creates the most herbal wonderful aroma imaginable.</li>
      <li>IT IS AROMATIC AND ENLIVENING, AND I ALWAYS FEEL CLEAN AND REVIVED AFTER USING IT!  </li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I have been using it since the original importer (Goodman&#x27;s Pharmacy) started importing into the US.</li>
      <li>I love it so much, I have a routine delivery!</li>
      <li>Other products in this line are also great for muscle aches, head aches, and allergy problems.</li>
      <li>8oz is only good for about 2 baths, but when you need relief, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>and I am still a huge fan that recommends to all interested parties.</li>
      <li>My friend first told me about Olbas, and now I preach about it to everyone I know!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend you try this!!!</li>
      <li>After my first use I was a Olba&#x27;s fan for life!</li>
      <li>sure you don&#x27;t get it in your eyes, and be careful around more tender areas until you get used to it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally, it infuses the whole bathroom with a clean, fresh herbal scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the product, but unless it comes in larger bottles</li>
      <li>Add a squirt to a hot bath and your muscles will thank you.  </li>
      <li>I was pleased I could find this Herbal Bath on Amazon, as my local Whole Foods market stopped carrying it</li>
      <li>It really relaxes my muscles and mind while clearing any stuffiness and congestion from my head and chest.</li>
      <li>As a chronic allergy and asthma sufferer, it&#x27;s a real life</li>
      <li>You can dump the whole bottle into a bathtub and notice virtually nothing.</li>
      <li>The pricing and delivery of this was as expected and I am luxuriating in this fabulous aroma every time I bathe!</li>
      <li>I know this is mainly for colds and stuffy noses, but I use this all the time.</li>
      <li>Also the rosemary aroma is great for opening up a head cold.</li>
      <li>Helps clear your head and soothes aches and pains.</li>
      <li>It cools the skin and if you feel overheated from gardening outside, it really refreshes you.</li>
      <li>I pour a cap full in my bath water and it encourages deep breathing and relaxation in a long soaking bath.</li>
      <li>The Weleda people is a religious community who are located in Spring Valley, New York.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it does or does not contain the Olbas oil because it pretty much odorless and hardly produce any foam.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the product, but unless it comes in larger bottles I don&#x27;t think that I would order it again. It doesn&#x27;t make sense.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. There is nothing else that compares with it. Except maybe if you include Biokosma Foot Cream. I have been using it since the original importer (Goodman&#x27;s Pharmacy) started importing into the US. That is 40 years ago. Little known is that this product  is available on the German Health Food Market, which is notoriously hard to get into. Also aside from being a great aromatic, it is pain relieving, tension relieving, and great for after exercise, not to mention it lowers body temperature so it is perfect when you are ill. Olbas Distribution was eventually taken over by Weleda which also use to distribute Biokosma, before Caswell Massey took over and eventually gave up importing Biokosma. The Weleda people is a religious community who are located in Spring Valley, New York. And they still put out the greatest Pain Relieving Massage oil (Arnica Massage oil) [[ASIN:B000OS131S Weleda Arnica Massage Oil, 3.4-Ounce]], which I have also been using for 40 years. It goes great after a hot bath in Olbas. So all of you who haven&#x27;t tried Olbas; they also make a great Inhaler too: I highly recommend you do so. Anybody I&#x27;ve ever referred this to has thanked me profusely. All I can say is Ahh! What a great relief it is {:-).</li>
    <li> looking forward to using this. I love the products.</li>
    <li> Best product ever for a stressful day or dealing with the misery of colds or flu.  Buy it!!</li>
    <li> This product is perfect after long workouts as well as for body aches from flu and colds. Words cannot say enough as this product is standard in my bath products and used daily.</li>
    <li> This Olbas Therapeutic Herbal bath always occupies a space in my shower. I use it for several things: one the menthol and herbs clears out my sinuses when I have the sniffles. Just a little on your chest, and it&#x27;s fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, it is great on sore muscles, and works as a foot soak too. De-ordorizes those tootsies and eases the aches of a long day on your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it infuses the whole bathroom with a clean, fresh herbal scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you don&#x27;t get it in your eyes, and be careful around more tender areas until you get used to it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this herbal bath. I use it not only when I&#x27;m sick, but after a hard workout or just a stressful day. It really relaxes my muscles and mind while clearing any stuffiness and congestion from my head and chest. As a chronic allergy and asthma sufferer, it&#x27;s a real life saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the company would listen to customer requests and make a larger bottle...32 ounces would be ideal!</li>
    <li> With a wonderful eucalyptus fragrance that is exhilarating, as well as the bath is relaxing. I was pleased I could find this Herbal Bath on Amazon, as my local Whole Foods market stopped carrying it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it does or does not contain the Olbas oil because it pretty much odorless and hardly produce any foam. You can dump the whole bottle into a bathtub and notice virtually nothing. Hard to explain all the 5-star reviews, must be a placebo effect or worse.</li>
    <li> You can use foam that also sheds a lot of healing feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Products are satisfied. We want to again repurchase.</li>
    <li> I tired it for the first time 30 years ago and I am still a huge fan that recommends to all interested parties.</li>
    <li> This works wonders on aches and pains. Highly recommend you try this!!!</li>
    <li> love the scent of this product</li>

    <li> This is great when you are not feeling your best and want a soothing bath. Helps clear your head and soothes aches and pains.</li>
    <li> Best bath soak for aching body ever!</li>
    <li> I know this is mainly for colds and stuffy noses, but I use this all the time. I pour a cap full in my bath water and it encourages deep breathing and relaxation in a long soaking bath. One bottle lasts a long time. Sure it is good for colds and allergies. Why just use it then? It cools the skin and if you feel overheated from gardening outside, it really refreshes you. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely my favorite bath soak. I love it so much, I have a routine delivery! It helps you relax, and it&#x27;s invigorating to the senses all at the same time.</li>
    <li> this stuff is absolutely amazing.</li>
    <li> Whenever my wife gets a cold, she takes a bath with this in the tub and for the next half hour feels like a normal person. 8oz is only good for about 2 baths, but when you need relief, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product....I would recommend it ....</li>
    <li> This has become a family staple for cold and flu season - comforting, helps sinuses and aches and pains. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love everything about it. The smell, the healing properties (aids in breathing, calming). I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 years and it&#x27;s still my bath of choice.</li>
    <li> Add a squirt to a hot bath and your muscles will thank you.  Also the rosemary aroma is great for opening up a head cold. Other products in this line are also great for muscle aches, head aches, and allergy problems. It is a nice alternative to menthol.</li>
    <li> Only two capfuls to a full bath creates the most herbal wonderful aroma imaginable. It transforms a regular bath into a European spa, Highest recommendation. Also helps soothe aches and pains when used in a good hot bath.</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly in my bath.  I provide energy healing and sessions to my clients and use this as an addition to an Epsom salt bath to refresh myself, cleanse and feel great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. I always have some on hand, I just keep it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Very refreshing body soap/ rinse (great for cooling off in the summer months).&lt;br /&gt;-Amazing natural green cleaner for the shower walls and tub (non-toxic)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. So relaxing and smells wonderful. I have psoriasis and my skin appreciates this product.</li>
