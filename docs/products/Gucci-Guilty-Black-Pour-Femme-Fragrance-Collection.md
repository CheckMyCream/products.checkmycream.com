      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure that wars will be stopped by the skillful application on the pulse points with this aerosol</li>
      <li>I will definately buy more of this one.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance in the women and men version.</li>
      <li>Love this smell.</li>
      <li>Sexy and sensual tones...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a sexy smell without being overwhelming.</li>
      <li>love the smell</li>
      <li>Such a great value too!  </li>
      <li>Need I say more?  </li>
      <li>and I think its a fragrance that would wear well on most for evenings out.</li>
      <li>First off - I received this on time and in good shape.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent of this perfume, and it has great lasting power.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as those in department stores.</li>
      <li>( that&#x27;s the sound I make when I walk...</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d get it next for her for sure!!</li>
      <li>This perfume is the original version no knock off.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had the original</li>
      <li>After my Euphoria, although I loved it, I wanted to try something different.</li>
      <li>This one has a sugary smell that I love yet still so sexy at the same time</li>
      <li>Smells fantastic and is so much cheaper than buying it in stores!</li>
      <li>love this perfume, and it&#x27;s one of my husband favorites, this product is not strong and stay just like it said - 1/2 day...still love this elegant and mystic smell.</li>
      <li>It is my new favorite.</li>
      <li>Mothers hand me their  children to kiss, old men stop and kiss the top of my palm, a fortune teller asked me to read HER palm ...</li>
      <li>I spritzed again, and  I was at my first day at family court as an intern, and instead of being yelled at by an over zealous judge-</li>
      <li>It is as advertised, in a big lovely bottle.</li>
      <li>Very musky</li>
      <li>Instead of being overcome with a sense of quixotic lust, I felt like walked day care facility.</li>
      <li>I love, love the scent and am a long time Gucci parfume fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star off as I wish the scent lasted a little longer.  </li>
      <li>It looked like such a sexy and mysterious fragrance.</li>
      <li>If one were to buy the smaller size in stores, you&#x27;d still end up paying more than on amazon for the larger bottle.</li>
      <li>Might be a slight difference, less musky than in the ad, but still great.</li>
      <li>It is soft, subtle, yet full bodied and sexy.</li>
      <li>It made me happy and sad all at once.</li>
      <li>It smelled like new pack of diapers and baby wipes.</li>
      <li>I used many perfumes in the past, from Victor &amp;  rolf&#x27;s Flower bomb to Calvin Klein Euphoria.</li>
      <li>I had researched the product prior to ordering, so was aware of the quality of the perfume.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m saying is that one whiff of this turned all of my questionably painful life experiences into ones of pure joy and elation.</li>
      <li>I even smelled coffee beans to clear my nose and tried smelling it again...</li>
      <li>The perfume bottle was not as appealing as bottles purchased in the past, but the scent made up for it!</li>
      <li>Everyone asks it me...and I proudly say GUILTY!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if its really the real deal or not because it didn&#x27;t last as long as the one I paid 95.00 for in the store, but for the price I like it a lot!</li>
      <li>It came in its black box that was entirely wrapped in bubble wrap, and it seemed secure and protected.</li>
      <li>Very feminine with dark amber undertones.</li>
      <li>First off, I actually smelled the little magazine insert before actually purchasing the product.</li>

    <li> The best fragrance in my life.&lt;br /&gt;Elegant and charming fragrance!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance!  Such a great value too!  You get a lot for your money.</li>
    <li> Its Gucci...Need I say more?  Excellent fragrance w/o being overbearing to those around you.  Sexy and sensual tones... I rec&#x27;d a bottle as a gift, wore it one afternoon with my mother, 71yrs old, and she adored the scent, and did not have any allergic side effects that she usually gets, so I purchased this bottle for her.</li>
    <li> I had researched the product prior to ordering, so was aware of the quality of the perfume. The perfume bottle was not as appealing as bottles purchased in the past, but the scent made up for it!</li>
    <li> My sometimes  insignificant other purchased a gift for me from Sephora, the LaVanilla  Grapefruit and Vanilla scent that I had subtly been hinting about for months. ( I put samples in his coat pockets, newspaper clippings in his Xbox games etc...you know subtle) So he got the message and ordered it for me. in the box came samples and one of the samples was...GUCCI BLACK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moment I smelled it I knew I found the one fragrance on this wide wide world that I wanted to be forever associated with me.&lt;br /&gt; It made me happy and sad all at once. I inhaled it and experienced time travel. All of a sudden I was taken back to prom 1994- and instead of my class looking like rejects from a house party movie....everyone looked like extras in a Calvin Kline commercial.  I spritzed again, and  I was at my first day at family court as an intern, and instead of being yelled at by an over zealous judge- I was Ally McBeal ( but with boobs), and the jury was singing &amp;#34; oh happy day!&amp;#34; and the bailiffs broke out into the electric slide!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m saying is that one whiff of this turned all of my questionably painful life experiences into ones of pure joy and elation. Never has such a mind altering chemical so skillfully passed under the radar of the FDA. And ...the name, the name says it all.&lt;br /&gt;When I wear it this is what happens.&lt;br /&gt;Me: Doo bee doo be dooo ( that&#x27;s the sound I make when I walk...just go with it)&lt;br /&gt;Unsuspecting Citizen: Ms....that smell, that fragrance,  is it you?&lt;br /&gt;Me: ( Turn dramatically, bat mink eyelashes furiously)  GUILTY!&lt;br /&gt;I get stopped in the street, on the train, and on the bus. Everyone asks it me...and I proudly say GUILTY!  Mothers hand me their  children to kiss, old men stop and kiss the top of my palm, a fortune teller asked me to read HER palm ...Why just the raising of my wrists in the air stopped a fight at a crowded mall last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now every time I stand outside on the balcony at work-  instead just feeling nauseous like I did when I was wearing Juicy couture-  I now  immediately feel like Evita!  Especially when the crowds gather below me and ask &amp;#34; That smell...that glorious smell...is it you?&amp;#34; And I answer &amp;#34; YES YES I am GUILTY&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure that wars will be stopped by the skillful application on the pulse points with this aerosol ambrosia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the paraphrased words of Eva Peron ( or Patti Lupone  if you saw the play)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Don&#x27;t spray on me other perfumes, the truth is I never liked you,&lt;br /&gt;Ill wear no more now, theres only Gucci&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t call me crazy......just call me Guilty &amp;#34;st feeling nauseous like I did when I was wearing Juicy couture-  I now  immediately feel like Evita!  Especially when the crowds gather below me and ask &amp;#34; That smell...that glorious smell...is it you?&amp;#34; And I answer &amp;#34; YES YES I am GUILTY&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure that wars will be stopped by the skillful application on the pulse points with this aerosol ambrosia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the paraphrased words of Eva Peron ( or Patti Lupone  if you saw the play)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Don&#x27;t spray on me other perfumes, the truth is I never liked you,&lt;br /&gt;Ill wear no more now, theres only Gucci&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t call me crazy......just call me Guilty &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift and my wife loved, there are fragrances she owns which I love more, but this stuff smells great!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so good!</li>
    <li> I can always count on Gucci to make a wonderful perfume. It is my new favorite. I will definately buy more of this one.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s Gucci..love the smell</li>
    <li> I used many perfumes in the past, from Victor &amp;  rolf&#x27;s Flower bomb to Calvin Klein Euphoria. After my Euphoria, although I loved it, I wanted to try something different. I tried every sample I can see and ran in to this one. This one has a sugary smell that I love yet still so sexy at the same time so it doesn&#x27;t feel like I worked in the candy store all day. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this smell. Bought it for my lady for her birthday because she kept dropping hints about how good it is</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell authentic. It doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as those in department stores. Should have spent a few extra bucks at department store</li>
    <li> My granddaughter was with me in Yonkers shopping and she liked this fragrance.  I decided to get this for her for Christmas as a gift.  She likes it.</li>
    <li> First off, I actually smelled the little magazine insert before actually purchasing the product. Might be a slight difference, less musky than in the ad, but still great. Very feminine with dark amber undertones.</li>
    <li> more or the less the same smell of usual guilty even lovelier.. and cheaper</li>
    <li> I was so excited by the new ads I saw for Gucci Guilty Black! It looked like such a sexy and mysterious fragrance. However, once I smelled the fragrance I couldnt believe it. I even smelled coffee beans to clear my nose and tried smelling it again... it was terrible! It smelled like new pack of diapers and baby wipes. Instead of being overcome with a sense of quixotic lust, I felt like walked day care facility.</li>
