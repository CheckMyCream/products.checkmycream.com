<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awsome for use as a drawing sav no complaints. Haven&#x27;t tried it on my face yet but I will, if it draws so well I am just afraid it will draw everything out of my face...lol, I think it would be great for teenagers, I will update if I use on my face....LOL</li>
    <li> Excellent for bath, foot soak and facial mask</li>
    <li> Absolutely AMAZING!! The stubborn in my skin whiteheads, after years of trying everything, are out!! I have just two weeks using the product and though I have been doing more than once a week, my face looks completely different.  Must try it!!</li>
    <li> I do not know how I ever lived without this! I mix 1 part clay and 1 part apple cider vinegar (and let me tell you, that has made all the difference!) Especially since I am normal/oily/acne prone. I of course would recommend taking it slow introducing the ACV with mixing half amount of water to ACV just to get used to it and eventually move up to 1 part clay and 1 part ACV. I recently just stopped using water after maybe a month or two of taking it slow using water and ACV. You can even add essential oils to the mix, maybe 1-3 drops depending what oil. I use tea tree when I&#x27;m breaking out and I recently just bought lavender oil so I am gonna start adding that! The mask with ACV will make your face throb (in an awesome kind of way) and maybe even feel hot! But, after you take off the mask and the redness fades away (because it will circulate the blood in your face), my face is clean and glowing. So much that you can even see the little blonde hairs on my face which you usually can never see because I have visible pores on my cheeks and sometimes tend to be oily. Safe to say this mask gives me a baby face. A hundred times more than with just water and clay. I personally didn&#x27;t see much of a difference using just water and clay. And if you feel the same way, try it with apple cider vinegar before tossing it away. I leave this on usually for 15 minutes, or just a few minutes after it has dried. Sometimes I&#x27;ll take it off in the shower, or just with water in the sink or with a microfiber cloth. Depends how I&#x27;m feeling.</li>
    <li> Used it as a deep cleansing clay mask for my face. Really cleaned out my pores. Be sure to thoroughly moisturizer afterwards.Great stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> Wow made a real difference with just one use! My skin on my face feels really smooth and soft!</li>
    <li> It was hard to mix. Would like better if was already mixed together. For me, it caused my face to itch. After 10 minutes I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it off. Not a fan for general face application but excited to use it for other things that I&#x27;ve read about (big bites, burns etc)</li>
    <li> This clay is perfect to always have on hand because it does so many different things. It pulls the toxins out for faster healing, deep pore cleansing and detoxifying. It revitalizes the skin and leaves it feeling soft, smooth, clean and glowing. It relieves sore muscles quickly and even relieves bug bites, cuts, bruises and stings. You can use this on just about any skin condition and it works well! I mainly use this as a facial mask and it has shrunk my pores in half already. It helps with acne and pimples as well. I&#x27;m excited to have recieved this for my review because it is so easy to use. You simply mix ut with water as directed and apply. Let it dry and it washes away easily with no left over residue. It left my skin silky smooth and brightened my skin tremendously! How easy is it to use this once a week! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived on time and packaged nicely. I have been using it for a face mask and I have seen an increase of the quality of my skin and my acne (I&#x27;m 19) is easier to manage.</li>
    <li> This was fun to use. I was able to paint both my other half, and my friend. They said that even with their beards, their faces felt better after using it. I can&#x27;t wait to use it again! My face was so very smooth!</li>
    <li> Used the clay for kidâ€™s eczema areas, it helped soothe the itchiness. It has a nice cooling effect on your skin when used in summer.</li>
    <li> Helped with discoloration in my face. I do reccomend to others. Felt my a spa day at my home :)</li>
    <li> I was lucky to get a full sample of this to review and then to order another. I use it as a mask and it is wonderful. You can add some essential oils and/or coconut oil to it as well. It definitely cleans my skin and makes it soft and healthy. There are dozens of DIY recipes you can use with thei Indian Healing Clay. A little goes a long way so it is an excellent buy. I have several new recipes that I am going to try this week! It is a standard DIY ingredient.</li>
    <li> I used the Indian Healing Clay as a foot soak. I poured four spoonfuls of the powdery substance into water and I mixed it together until I started to have a thick consistency (muddy appearance).  I placed my feet in it for about 30 minutes. After I rinse and wash everything off, i rubbed off the dead skin with a foot stone and my foot was smooth and soft.  After a couple uses of this, I no longer would have to go nail salon for my pedicures. I recommend everyone to try this product.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised! I can feel it tightening and pulling at my pores in my face. When you wash it off you feel like your face is truly clean and oil free.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I use it to make my own deoderant and for a facial mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Nice size jar with top quality clay in it. This comes in a powder form and you add a little bit of water. I find you can just mix it in your hands- but if you want to be mess free- put it in a bowl and brush it on. Really sucks the impurities right out of your face. I only need to use this once a week so this size jar lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I have oily combination skin, after using this, the oil is under control, I don&#x27;t want to dry up my face totally, some oil in your face is good and prevents aging. Left my skin soft. I would recommend adding pure raw honey, it&#x27;s much easier coming off and honey is good for your face, I use it once a week, good price and it will probably last you a year.</li>
    <li> going to try it as  facial mask!</li>
    <li> Majestic Pure is quickly becoming my addiction.&lt;br /&gt;I was wary of this mask as I have dry, sensitive skin, but I mixed as directed. I made way more than I needed while spending the weekend with my parents so I made my mom and dad use it with me haha! It is a little clumpy, but it evens out pretty well. It dries to a tight mud, and my dad was so confused that this is normal for a clay mask. We used a washcloth and warm water to buff the mask off, and omg. My skin was so soft! My mom noticed her skin was noticeably more &amp;#34;blowy&amp;#34;, and my dad said his skin felt clean/pores looked smaller. I will say that if you have dry skin, you will need to moisture after using the mask; but it wasn&#x27;t bad. My mom has since hijacked my jar of this mask, so I might have to get her her own! Really enjoyed this mask, and I will definitely be using regularly.</li>
    <li> I love this mask and could quite literally use it every single day. Saw great results as soon as I removed it. I have a sensitive skin and this did not flare up my skin, instead it calmed it while tightening it too. Love it! Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I am now a firm believer in using Indian Healing Clay. So far I have only used it once, but even a couple of days later my skin still feels extremely soft and healthy. I did have a hard time getting it to the correct consistency, but from other reviews it seems like this is more of an experience issue than a product issue. That and when I used it, it still worked great so I am perfectly happy. You can&#x27;t expect to get it perfect the first time right? I also was surprised at how little you need to use at once! I barely needed a teaspoon (even that was too much) to do a face mask. For how much you get and how long it will last, this product is definitely worth it! If you have not tried Indian Healing Clay before, I highly recommend doing it and this is a great company to get it from!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it is wonderful although I haven&#x27;t used it yet.... ðŸ˜ž  I am a DIY er...will be using it for making toothpaste... As soon as I use up my present stash...I will update as soon as I use it ....ðŸ™Œ</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel real smooth. Love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff has basically saved my life. I was just using it as a face mask but then I sprained my foot (pretty badly) and found out people use the clay as an anti-inflammatory. So after a few days of struggle I put the clay on my foot, wrapped it in cling wrap, and left it on over night; in the morning my foot was 80% better. The day before I could barely walk and now it was basically fine as long as I didn&#x27;t over extend. I&#x27;ll always have some in my house. (P.S. it&#x27;s also a great face mask, basically dissolves blackheads away)</li>
    <li> I love this! It leaves my skin so soft!</li>
    <li> This clay mask is great! I mixed it with rose water bought from GNC in 3:1 ratio (3 rose water to 1 clay). It cleanses my facial skin deeply and opens up my pores. It is easy to blend and apply as well. I really like it and I would definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I have purchased this product with an introductory discount. My review is honest and unbiased.</li>
    <li> I have several cuts on my hands due to harsh weather and constant hand washing, so I used the powder to wash my hands with, but I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see significant changes. Next, I used it to make a facial mask following the instructions using three parts water, one part clay and made a paste which I applied on my face for half the time required. After I washed and dried my face I had some redness, but it went away fast and didn&#x27;t create discomfort or any rash. I did use a moisturizer after this treatment. I am not much in facial masks, but I will continue to do some on and off, plus I am eager to use this Clay Powder in the tub for detox. The container is quite big and will last a long time for different uses,</li>
    <li> Great product, skin looks and feels great afterwards.</li>
    <li> I was asked to write a review for the Bentonite Clay. If you can get past the actual &amp;#34;mixing&amp;#34; of the clay, it is a wonderful product. Be careful opening the container because the dry clay product tends to escape on its own. Once mixed and applied (I used it on my face), it really liked it. I will definitely continue to use this product. Thank you</li>
    <li> I recommend this brand highly! It is a great price and even better product! I just used it for a bath soak and feel soft and rejuvenated. I&#x27;ve used it for a detox bath as well as a facial mask. Currently using it on my feet for the possible cold I have coming on so hopefully the toxins will draw out in my sleep! I ordered a second jar today!</li>
    <li> Kind of messy.. I haven&#x27;t used it consistently enough to gauge any positive effects. I guess my rating would be for ease of use then.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my fiancee. She likes it and thinks the clay works well. She will likely buy more. Shipping was fast, also.</li>
    <li> This was everything I was expecting. Received it quickly, well packaged and as described. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The product was awesome it left my face so smooth. The only bad thing was that when i opened it i got powder all over my shirt lol and also i was unsure on how much piwder and water i was suppose to use. Over all i liked it would Defenetly buy again</li>
    <li> Okay so I am a full-time poor college student, I don&#x27;t work out, I don&#x27;t follow a strict diet, I drink almost every weekend (I&#x27;m unhealthy I know), and I ALWAYS break out a few days before I start my period. I have scars around my mouth and in between my eyebrows from past breakouts. My skin tends to get dry and just looks fatigued and has an uneven tone. THIS PRODUCT WAS SENT FROM THE HEAVENS. I just bought this product with the apple cider vinegar (smells like s**t but so worth it), and I have only used this twice in the past week and my face has done a complete 180. The first time I kept the clay on for the recommended 20 mins and was so amazed at how you can actually see the dirt being sucked out of your pores. HERE&#x27;S WHERE I JUMP FOR JOY: I used this again last night, I repeat LAST NIGHT, and this morning there was a HUGE difference in my face. Now, the trick with this is to leave it on longer than they say. I left it on the second time for 40 mins and moisturized with coconut oil after. The coloring in my face is even, my scars have already started fading, my skin looks hydrated and well taken care of, my breakout (from pms) has subsided significantly, and my face just feels tight and perfect. My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear since I was fresh out of the womb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could give this clay more than 5 stars I would. LIFE CHANGING!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t jump to write my review immediately because I wanted to give this product a real chance. And I&#x27;m glad I did. After 20 some odd years of buying high end hair and skin care products I honestly didn&#x27;t think I would get the results promised. The Indian 100% pure sodium bentonite Indian healing clay delivered, for me, on what it promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let&#x27;s note that this comes in a powder form. You need to mix with water at a 3:1 ratio. The directions, as far as I can see, do not say how much to use, not even an estimate, to get a facial mask. I started with 1 Tablespoon of powder to 3 Tablespoons of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed this with a regular spoon and could not get it smooth. I added 2 more Tablespoons of water and it was still kind of chunky but I could get it on my face. This ratio made a LOT of facial mask. After applying to my face I also applied it to my elbow and hands and left it on the amount of time it said for regular skin instead of sensitive skin. I wanted to see what would happen as I do have sensitive skin and I wanted to be able to give a review from using it both ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin or even suspect you have sensitive skin, follow the time allotment for sensitive skin! The bentonite clay is powerful. The first time I used it and then rinsed my face, first with warm water and then with cool water, my skin was irritated with significant redness. THIS is NOT the fault of the product! Please note that! I wanted to see what results *I* would get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, immediately a blemish popped up on my face. This is to be expected. The bentonite clay is meant to pull toxins OUT of your skin. If you have a lot of environmental or chemical toxins in your skin this may happen over several uses. Therefore I recommend that when you use the mask once a week you do so on a day when you do not need to be somewhere important the next couple of days. The blemishes/pimples are going to come out, this is the intention of this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had more of the mask leftover after applying to my face, hands and elbows so I put it in my foot soak with some hot water and rubbed it all over my feet and let them soak about 30 minutes. I have very rough skin on the bottom of my feet and pumice every other day. After just two treatments with the bentonite clay I find I only need to pumice once a week. All I did was apply some of the mask I made up to the bottom of my feet. I filled my foot soak basin with hot water, as hot as I can stand. I mixed in another tablespoon of clay into the water and then plunged my feet in and let them soak. After 30 minutes I rinsed my feet and used my pumice stone. I rinsed again and then applied coconut oil and slipped my feet into white cotton socks for the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hands -- I&#x27;m over 40 and my hands are getting a wrinkly &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; look to them. After using the clay on them for 2 weeks they are starting to look less wrinkly.&lt;br /&gt;My elbows -- the skin on my elbows during the winter months is coarse, scaly and dry. After using the clay on them for 2 weeks they are starting to look less scaly the skin isn&#x27;t quite so coarse and they are not so dry.&lt;br /&gt;My face and neck -- my skin is clear. The second time I used the mask I used it the amount of time suggested for sensitive skin. No redness or irritation at all. I rinse my face first using a soft white cotton washcloth and warm water and then splash with cool water. The 2nd time I used the clay I did have a blemish pop out in the exact same spot as the first. The third time no blemish. My skin feels soft and I noticed that the dark circles under my eyes are dramatically reduced after the third use. I don&#x27;t know if this is typical, but it happened for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading more and more about Bentonite Clay I decided to use it on my hair. I washed my hair with my regular biotin shampoo and then I sprinkled the powdered clay directly into my hair, perhaps 2 Tablespoons (my hair is chin length)and worked it around all the way into the roots and gently combed it through. I let it sit about 10 minutes then rinsed and washed my hair again with the biotin shampoo. After rinsing well with warm water I towel dried my hair and applied my weekly keratin treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have color treated hair and it did not pull out the color and my scalp felt great after the treatment. The next week I had my appointment to touch up my roots and the color took faster than usual. Whatever toxins or build up was in my hair and scalp were pulled out. I seem to need less shampoo to wash my hair and less conditioner after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do NOT need a lot of clay to make the facial mask or to use in the other ways I have used it. A tablespoon mixed on more of a 4:1 ratio with water is probably more what you are looking for. It doesn&#x27;t mix easily and it probably won&#x27;t be completely smooth unless you have a specific cosmetic tool to achieve that result. But don&#x27;t worry about that. The product works. Play around with the clay to water ratio a bit to achieve the desired consistency you think it should be as there really is no exact way it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Indian Bentonite Clay from this seller. It went above and beyond any expectations I may have had and above and beyond any other similar products I have used in the past. I have spent thousands of dollars over the years on products for my hair and skin and this one is by far one I will use over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I have not bored you with this review. I hope it was informative and helps you to use our purchase of bentonite clay to its best possible advantage for you. I liked it so much I bought some for my mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I received a sample of this product (either free or at a discounted price) in exchange for my honest review.

    <li> This is one of the best products I ever used! My face feels so smooth after I wash my mask off. I will re-purchase this product from the seller again. My order arrived on-time and I can&#x27;t believe how good of the quality this clay is.</li>
    <li> I mainly use this clay for my back to get rid of the annoying acne that I get there every time. This clay is really easy to prepare, just add water and mix. I evenly and liberally apply it on my back (with the help of my husband) and I let it dry for 15-20 mins. I did not felt any stinging sensation or whatever. I rinse it afterwards using lukewarm water, and it easily takes off. I would instantly feel that my skin is softer than before. I have yet to see if it helps with my back acnes (backne), my facial skin is very sensitive and this product is so potent that it might irritate it. Over all, I love it. It&#x27;s scent free and easy to prepare. It feels like a spa treatment at home. I purchase this product using a promo code for testing.</li>
    <li> I have tried many cleansing products for my face over the years. It&#x27;s different from what I normally get as a clay mask, really no scent, just a gray color. After using it, my face felt a little dry, but a simple moisturizer helped. My face felt clean afterwards, no residue left. I would recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**this product was bought with the intent to review</li>
    <li> You have to mix this powder with water well, preferably with a metal spoon, but it makes a nice paste. Very economical! You don&#x27;t need much at all! Really helps clean up oil &amp; dirt, soften &amp; exfoliate the skin, and tighten the pores! People with sensitive skin probably only need to keep it on for half the time - 10 minutes. My skin is a bit sensitive, so I tend to take it off pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> This stuff has many, many uses. It is awesome for purifying your skin but is almost a little uncomfortable when you use it. It feels like your face is pulsing when it is drawing out all the impurities. I just mix it with water but some people mix it with diluted ACV. I found that to be way to harsh on my skin. Definitely one of my favorite acne products ever.</li>
    <li> a great tightening mask...  I had a little trouble getting the water/mixture quite right for me, but that&#x27;s trial and error.  I leave it on for about 10-20 minutes....my skin feels so fresh and clean when I&#x27;m done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was nice to be able to try this by getting a discount code, too!</li>
    <li> This is a nice product. I really did like it . I did receive this to review.</li>
    <li> I have tried every method I know to dissolve this product into the &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; like consistency suggested for use. Warm water, cold water, hot water, reverse osmosis ...even distilled water...combined with endless stirring, shaking, mixing ...even with an electric mixer ...and have never been able to eliminate the mass of lumps and clumps it produces when water is added. Any suggestions on how the excellent reviews were accomplished would be greatly appreciated.</li>
    <li> So far, it hasn&#x27;t made much of a difference in my skin.  In fact, I use a bi-Pap machine and the mask causes rashes on my face.  I used the clay on it and it just made it worse.</li>
    <li> Love love love this makes my face feel wonderful Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Was definitely impressed with this clay and would recommend to a friend. My skin feels smoother and tighter!</li>
    <li> Wholistically good stuff</li>
    <li> Me and my daughter used this for masks and let me tell you it works amzing. I plan on using it for a bath soon, but life hasn&#x27;t let me take the time to do so. It has no real smell. and a little goes a looooooong way</li>
    <li> Using it for facial mask, love it.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have really oily skin and this helps! After using it as a mask, my face feels so soft:)</li>
    <li> I am new to face masks.  I had my first facial in May and fell in love.  I immediately went home and started to research facial products for DIY facials at home.  This product had good reviews so I tried it.  I live the way it works.  I have used it twice so far and it really seems to clean my face and get into the pores very well.  I definately recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had was mixing it.  I have never mixed facial clay before, and the first time was such a disaster I had to throw out the first batch.  I quickly realized that you only need a very small amount of powder to water.  This tub will last FOREVER!  Here is my technique that seems to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put about 2 tbs of water into your mixing bowl, while stirring continuously slowly add very tiny amounts of the powder until you get a good thin &amp;#34;lotion-y&amp;#34; consistency.  I found that it is nearly impossible to mix water after the powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and enjoy this mask!!</li>
    <li> This was the first time I used this and it worked great for several different things. It comes in a messy powder form and when I first opened it I got powder everywhere . But this was great for insect bites.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT AND ESPECIAL QUALITY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bentonite is one of the most effective and powerful healing clays. It can be used externally as a clay poultice, mud pack or in the bath and, in skin care recipes. This is a good quality Bentonite grey/cream in color, very fine, velveteen feel and is odorless and non-staining because it came from aged volcanic ash. I use it in my skin because bentonite has strong negative charge when hydrated which bonds to the positive charge in many toxins, heavy metals, impurities and chemicals, absorbing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it as well you can do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply a past of bentonite clay and water on any skin irritation like blemishes, insect bites, cuts, skin itching, or burns. I leave it on until it dries and wash off after several minutes. This is said to be especially calming to skin itching from eczema, psoriasis, viral rash, active acne, etc.&lt;br /&gt;For smooth and healthy face skin, leave on for 20 minutes and wash off. I typically do this twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes add about 1/4 cup of Bentonite Clay to a bath for a relaxing detox bath that softens skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A slight redness may appear after removing the clay. This is normal and will disappear in approximately 30minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But which is better, sodium or calcium bentonite?&lt;br /&gt;Sodium bentonite expands when wet, absorbing as much as several times its dry mass in water. So, to remove dirty stuffs this is the best&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calcium bentonite is a useful adsorbent for fats and oils because the main active ingredient of fuller earth, so for oil skin take it for you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, take the chance to improved you skin and health</li>
    <li> Love this, so glad to review it. Natural and many uses! Fabulous product. I love natural products that have many uses and this is a winner! Huge jar</li>
    <li> Works very well on acne, just a bit on each spot overnight. Very happy with, recommend making a bit each week and storing in the refrigerator so not to waste any product after mixing. Thank you for the discount to review product with my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> made my skin look and feel younger than it has in a long time. LOVED IT!</li>
    <li> I have been amazed how well this works.  I have used this to help with ant bites, cuts and sore muscles.  I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product and awesome sellers.</li>
    <li> Very messy to use, and difficult to rinse off. Need to give it a few more tries.</li>
    <li> I got this stuff on a good discounted price.This stuff is the most powerful clay for detoxfying the impurities. I love how it made my skin feel super clean and fresh. My skin has really improved a lot and it feels really smooth and clear.</li>
    <li> So far I like this product.  There is a small learning curve with regards to mixing it if you, like me, have never made a face mask starting with pure powder.  I have never had sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t break out easily.  That being said, this did start to itch the first time I used it as it dried, after about 10 min.  The directions say to leave it on for 20 min or less time for those who have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most clay masks it tightened a lot as it began to dry, and it itched where it was the driest where it started to crack.  I did not wait for it to dry completely because it was itching my forehead.  I think this comes back to the mixing... I had places where it was thicker/chunkier, and other places it was like a thin mustard/ketchup, or thick milk consistency, and those areas dried much faster and thus tightened quicker and therefore began to itch a little sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd &amp; 3rd time using:&lt;br /&gt;After using this a few more times, I like it more and more.  My face definitely felt tighter and smoother after using this product.  I&#x27;ve found that about 1/3 - 1/2 a teaspoon is all I need to mix with enough water to cover my whole face.  I&#x27;ve been able to get it to be a thicker milky consistency and chunk free so it dries very evenly which is really nice - I think this contributed to it not itching (it itched a little the first time I used it but I haven&#x27;t experienced this again).&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a clay mask or any face mask that you leave on and let dry.  It really makes your skin feel tight and new after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The one image of the ingredients is a panoramic pic because I had difficulty displaying all the ingredients in one front picture :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Epic Business Services Online&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon.com LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 7 days after order date&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:  I ordered 2 tubs and both were tightly sealed with the lids taped down on one side, and these tubs were loose in a larger box with other items.

    <li> This clay tightens pores and clarifies skin.  If you apply a thick coat, it requires many rinses to remove.  I&#x27;m experimenting with the application and mixture with apple cider and water.</li>
    <li> This makes a lovely, very smooth clay mask. A little goes a long way, but I love what it does for my skin.</li>
    <li> Bought by accident, glad I did.  It is great for clearing up acne and reducing poors.  A little goes a long way and the product will last for years,</li>
    <li> I had a pretty bad allergic reaction to this product. I&#x27;m not sure what exactly I would be allergic to in the ingredients especially since its all natural but it did not agree with my skin. I would recommend a dead sea mud mask over this. I also don&#x27;t like that its a powder that you have to mix with water. I&#x27;d rather have one already made and ready to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my hair like a mud mask and yasssss! I put it in after shampooing, and put on a shower cap and sat under the dryer. Rinsed and deep conditioned. My hair felt stronger, thick, and soft. My hair air dried shiny. Love it!</li>
    <li> Works great. Dries quickly unlike some other masks. It is easy to remove without rubbing my skin too hard!</li>
    <li> I love Bentonite Clay.  I don&#x27;t like to use a lot of chemicals and this stuff is awesome since its 100% clay and it&#x27;s amazing for a lot of things like acne.  You can use it as a mask or take a bath with it.</li>
    <li> I been reading a lot about the Indian healing clay and I hope it&#x27;s great like I been reading. It feels great on my skin but I haven&#x27;t seen much difference yet.</li>
    <li> Love this clay it calms my Skin and after I wash it off my skin lightens up its good use only once a week tho</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very annoyed by false statements such as these. It says INDIAN clay but comes actually from the USA. The next thing that bothers me is all these false reviews. Lots of these reviews were paid for or received the product for free to write a review. Spend your money on an honest company but not a company that works like that.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I use for soap and as a face mask</li>
    <li> This helped so much.  My brown recluse spider bite is soon to be a bad memory -- this clay helped draw the poison from the wound.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I feel like I created my own spa in my home. I used a plastic bowl and spoons to make my mixture. I followed the directions and used 3 parts water to 1 part clay but you need a little more clay to make it a thicker paste for my face mask. I left it on until the entire mask dried and then for a little after that. This stuff feels awesome on my face, I canâ€™t describe how amazing this makes my skin feel. I recommend buying this!</li>
    <li> Great quality product. I like the smell  as well.</li>
    <li> I love the way this feels on my skin and I love even more how it feels when I take it off. This is a great product and I feel as though it really works unlike most masks. I recommend this if you want nice skin....</li>
    <li> Great mask. It goes a long way - I put little too much powder and I had more than I needed. A little goes a long way. It helps to use a small bowl so I can wipe the left over so I don&#x27;t wash the unused portion down the sink. My skin felt cleaned, tighten, and fresh. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed by the fact that I can use less of this clay (sodium bentonite) to get the same volume compared to calcium bentonite.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful mask for cleaning your face..has such a great feel on you skin..love how it makes your skin feel and how then when done how moisturizing creams go on the skin well sink right in..love it..great product..</li>
    <li> My skin feels great.  Perfect once a week mask!</li>
    <li> This bentonite clay comes as a powder.  This is a good thing.  The clay is activated by water so you don&#x27;t want it coming to you already mixed.  Plus you would be getting far less product if it was already made into a paste.  As a powder, you are able to add ingredients to it in the amounts that YOU want for whatever use you have for it.  I personally like to mix with half water and half apple cider vinegar.  It is not too strong and give me a better consistency than water alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And speaking of mixing, it does not mix as easily as other clays because it is so absorbent.  That is why it works so well as a facial mask and detoxing agent.  It may be helpful either mix in a plastic baggie or add the clay to the water, rather than water to the clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Best product for oily and sensitive skin...</li>
    <li> You have to mix this up but my complexion feels better.  I mixed more than I needed the first time and was scared that I had wasted it but I put in a jar and it is still moist.  Seems to be working.</li>
    <li> It is a high quality super fine clay powder. Notably, Sodium Bentonite not Calcium Bentonite, this makes it therapeutically more effective, to my understanding.</li>
    <li> Used twice and like it a lot. Makes my skin feel soft</li>
    <li> LOVE HEALING CLAY Fantastic Products from This company. I love Desert Essence &amp; I&#x27;m an Esthetician!</li>
    <li> One of my jars came with powder all down the side and all over the bottle. I question its freshness now because of the powder that leaked out....</li>
    <li> I had never heard of Bentonite Clay, but a freind of mine was raving about it, talking about how it made her skin so soft and smooth, and how it helps soothe her aching feet after a long day. I was interested because she truly does have amazing skin, and this is the brand she uses so I ordered some. The first thing I want to say about this amazing, miracle clay, (yes, it&#x27;s that good!) is that it truly is a healing clay as well! When I read the container, I thought this was just another name for the clay, but it truly heals! The second day I got this, my husband sprained his ankle at like 2 am. He was in pain, and his ankle was starting to swell. I did not have any bandage wrap in the house, he refused to go to the hospital that late, and of course the doctor&#x27;s office was closed, so out of desperation to help at least stop the pain, I pulled this out and mixed it into a paste and rubbed it on his ankle. 2 hours later (after we watched a movie), He washed off the clay and we were amazed to find that the redness and swelling were gone, and so was the pain! I insisted he still go to the doctor, but of course he did not (he is a man!) but he assured me his ankle was fine and did not look or feel sprained anymore and I was reassured because it looked better and he was jumping around the house with ease! It&#x27;s been almost two weeks and he is still fine! So this was my first experience with bentonite clay. I was sold just from this! Besides this, I have used it for a facial, once, and it completely revitalized my skin, making it supple and smooth, plus it took away the &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; look from my face, it gave my face a little more lift. So I was impressed. I also used it for a foot soak once, I have flat feet that ache easily, and I have 2 toddlers, so I am on my feet all day! The foot soak was amazing! I&#x27;m completely addicted to this stuff now and plan to continue to use it.</li>
    <li> A friend recommend this product to me, saying it helped clear up her acne and make her skin feel great. So I did a little research and Indian Healing Clay has been around for Centuries. Over 1800 years ago, Cleopatra used clay from the Nile River as part of her beauty ritual. I also read several reviews about Indian Clay and found them very informative. I mixed the clay with organic apple cider vinegar since it seemed to be what most people were using. I tied my hair back, mixed the solution in a baggie for easy clean up and applied generously to my face &amp; neck. Within minutes the clay began to dry and I could already start to feel my skin tighten up. After 20 minutes I used pre-moistened facial wipes to remove it because I did not want to clog my drain since it is, after all, clay. I was amazed at how soft my skin felt and I hadn&#x27;t even put moisturizer on yet. Once my skin was free of all the clay &amp; I rinsed with warm water, I applied Vitamin C serum. After only a couple applications I can already see a difference in the appearance of my skin. I&#x27;m hooked! I absolutely LOVE this stuff! Also, this product was delivered to my door a day early! This is a great company with an awesome product! Just read some of the reviews like did &amp; you will want to try this stuff out asap, I guaranty it!</li>
    <li> Wow!! This has definitely made me feel like I did my own spa treatment. I am serious that is how I felt for about 30minutes lol. I have seen this circulating the internet on tutorials and reviews regarding Bentonite Clay Indian mask. I wanted to try this because of all the great benefits and deep pore cleaning this product has. It comes in powder form so be careful when opening I had little dusts of clay powder fall out of the cap. I used plastic bowls &amp; spoons to mix my mixture in. 3 parts water to 1 part clay is what the directions prescribe, but I had to put a little more to make it more of a paste. It feels really nice on your skin, I have big pores near my t zone area and I love that this helps DEEP clean your pores and face. I left mine on an extra ten minutes and rinsed well in warm water and ladies I have to tell you how good I felt afterwards. My face felt super clean and my pores looked clean as well maybe even minimized in appearance (at least it did to me). I love that it is all natural I will definitely be buying another can when I am close to running out. I also managed to talk my Husband into letting me apply this on his face lol. He has very big pores and I know he can benefit from this. He was really impressed at the results his face was much cleaner looking and so was his pores. I definitely recommend you trying this for yourself or significant other or anyone for that matter. I will definitely be using this as my ultimate face mask cleaner. I also recommend you applying your moisturizer to your face afterwards.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something for my skin which will cleanse and  detoxify my face. I have so many pimples on my face and which leaves the marks. I use this clay mask and it cleanse my face. The result is amazing. My skin looks so clean, fresh and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;The container comes with the clay and you mix it with the water. Dont use any metal to the mask. The clay swells and when you mix it with the water. Then apply on the face and leave for few minutes according to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;This clay mask is generally useful for the people who have oily skin because it takes the oil away. It treats the acne and breakout. It unclogs and shrinks pores and exfoliates your skin. If you keep using this mask it will prevent blackheads. I am in love with this clay mask.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for an unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Have any of you tried a clay mask before? I am sure many of you have, but I have not tried one in years actually. I received Indian Healing Clay in exchange for this review and I have enjoyed using it. Using a clay mask is like having a spa treatment at home, except at home I can watch a movie while it sits on my face, or while I have a foot soak in it.&lt;br /&gt;After I used the clay on my face I had my husband feel my skin and it said &amp;#34;it feels rubbery&amp;#34; to which I was pleased, in fact the elasticity in my skin had increased after just one use! That &amp;#34;rubbery&amp;#34; feel is what any &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; woman would love to have back! Needless to say I did not point out to him that he had become used to my saggy lifeless skin. I wonder if it works on boobs!? Don&#x27;t think for a moment I won&#x27;t try this - I am going to! So you mix 1 part clay with 3 parts water. It did not say exactly how to measure so I did 2 teaspoons clay and 6 teaspoons water. It was way too much. I could have done three facials with that, or one facial and my boobs. Suffice to say, I would go with one or even a half teaspoon clay to three or one and a half teaspoons of water, unless you plan to do your chest area too. Just note that a little goes a very long way, and with that said, this is a great deal ladies because you get a ton of the clay powder in the tub, and it is not expensive at all!</li>
    <li> We have a houseful of girls and they love trying new spa treatments. This product was put to use as soon as it arrived. A couple of our girls read the directions which were easy to follow:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;For facial, mix 3 parts of water to one part clay well to a smooth paste. Apply to skin and let dry for about 2o minutes. Wash with warm water to remove clay. Use it once a week to keep your skin beautiful and refresh.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clay did take a little bit of work to get it into a smooth paste but once applied it dried nicely. Both girls said they could feel the clay drawing up as it dried and that their face tingled a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the clay was removed, the girls had smooth, pink skin. This product received a thumbs up from my crew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We ordered this product with a discount coupon to try.</li>
    <li> Love this clay.  I&#x27;m used to using calcium clay on my kinky-curly hair and it works great.  Tried sodium after someone raved about it.  I mixed with water, applied, and threw on a plastic cap for a couple of hours.  My hair was amazingly soft and curly after rinsing.  My hair&#x27;s not so soft after using calcium clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the Indian healing clay. It is very efficient is taking out toxins from the skin. Make sure to follow instructions and mix the powder with enough water so that it has a paste consistency. A little goes a long way as you cannot re use the mixture when it dries. My face felt tighter instantly and felt radiant after.&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product but my views and reviews are honest.</li>
    <li> Great for bug bites!  I work at a summer camp that is home to billions of ticks and those little critters leave nasty red marks.. Sometimes those marks last for several weeks!! I have noticed that when I put this healing clay on them (After recommendation of a customer going through our camp) they only last a week or so!! PLUS this stuff stops the itching almost instantly and keeps the itching away!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i cant comment on other uses but for ticks and bugs! BUY THIS STUFF</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mud twice since receiving it last week.  The first time, I had a moderate&lt;br /&gt;break-out. After the second use, my skin is absolutely glowing.</li>
    <li> I have only used this so far for making my own deodorant.  I am going to consider using this on my face and hopefully replacing part of my  skin care regimen with this.  This sounds like a wonderful product and the price was right!</li>
    <li> a strong simple effective but abrasive product you cant mess it up, just dont wear it longer than 10 or 20 mins (fair and or sensitive skin) 10 dark skin hispanics or african americans etc 20 or 18</li>
    <li> I have used for a facial and it works great. I recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I have the calcium bentonite clay as well as this one and i can truly say that rhe sodium bentonite clay is more powerful in lifting dirt and etc. i leave rhe mask on dor almost an hour (due to the thickness of the layer i put on). If you let the mask sit on your face/body until it is nearly or completly dried after you wash it off and use Witch Hazel to mositurize and close pores you will NOT SEE any trace of dirt on the cotton ball/pad. Thats how effective it is in cleaning your skin. I am just amazed. You dont have to use a lotion afterwarda. Use a good witch hazel. Remember witch hazel does moisten the skin and  tightens pores.</li>
    <li> This was a okay product for me.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have a ton of money to spend doing a facial at a spa, this is a great alternative. I mixed with warm water, put it on and left for the allotted time. Once I washed it off- my skin was smooooooth! I&#x27;ll be using it weekly!</li>
    <li> Majestic Pure Indian Healing Bentonite Clay - got this on a product promo to review and try - I love all natural skin care and this is a great cleanser and mask. It leaves your skin soft and clean and minimizes pores. I mix a fresh small batch each time. Super healthy!</li>
    <li> This is a superior product all the way around! I purchased this product for natural hair naturalistas as a deep cleanse for scalp and for curl definition and it&#x27;s amazing! Orders for this product are up because it truly works and it&#x27;s multi use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, 100% recommended.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and I&#x27;ve finally used it for my first Bentonite clay face mask.  I have to say it was great, the product does what it says.  Good price and no issues at all.  When I run out I will definitely purchase from them again.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product and I have a lot of experience with professional skin products, using them everyday in my career. This clay is extremely effective for deep pore cleansing and soothing skin. You can use it on your face, chest and back!</li>
    <li> Nice consistency. Pleasant smell. Worked well.</li>
    <li> This is a very good face mask!</li>
    <li> Feels healthy I use it every week for my feet and face, and daily for bathing so good I feel special.</li>
    <li> you can feel it tighten the longer you have it on its amazing! For this price and you get alot of product I think this is a great deal.</li>
    <li> My review will be somewhat unusual but my veterinarian recommended using it on my horses leg to help with a sarcoid she has on it.  It tends to slow the growth of this type of tumor if used repeatedly.  It was used before and the tumor has remained the same size so am going to restart treatment using this product.</li>
    <li> Product for review: mixes like says on package. Product makes your face feel clean and smooth.  I would highly recommend this company and product</li>
    <li> Great product! A little goes a long way. It makes your skin fresh and clean. I use it weekly for a deep anti- aging regimen.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! I use weekly and after each use my skin in quite soft and noticeably clearer. Such a great beauty treatment for such a crazy low cost! If you have never tried clay before, definitely order this one on Amazon... also, their companies customer service and follow-up has been awesome. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Loving this and cannot believe I&#x27;ve went this long without it..so many other great uses other than facial..any skin ailments like insect bites and sunburn..I love the way this makes my skin feel! Ok BUT one thing..the smell isn&#x27;t the best but it&#x27;s from the earth so no chemicals that&#x27;s a great thing.</li>
    <li> Love this masque.  My face is so soft.  My daughter and I had a spa day.  We both loved it.  Our faces are softer than baby bottoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it so much I bought my cousin a bottle as well.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> makes my skin feel soft</li>
    <li> Hard to mix and get the right consistency.  Also hasn&#x27;t done any wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple weeks but there&#x27;s a noticeable difference in a reduction of breakouts and smoothness of skin.</li>
    <li> One word: INTENSE! You can feel the clay going to work the second you put it on. The tightness this clay achieves is amazing. You can feel it under the tightness, tingling and do whatever it does. I left it on for about 20 minutes or so. Upon removing the mask, my skin was red but definitely felt different. Felt refreshed and skin stayed taught feeling. I took a before picture and after picture. Will take another next week when I do it again. Definitely something going on though. Received this product for review.</li>
    <li> When I first applied this on my skin I could feel my pores opening up immediately and the dirt and toxins being drawn out. My skin did not get irritated, and it was easy to clean off. This is deifnitely going to be a part of my pampering weekends when I have the house to myself.</li>
    <li> This clay is so soothing and healing I love putting it on my skin!</li>
    <li> I used the product for my hair to cleanse it. It definitely worked as a cleanser. I also read other reviews in regards to the product defining your natural curl pattern. After applying the product, I did like my curl pattern; however, I believe that the added products didn&#x27;t help with my pattern. I still love the product and will try other added products to get my desired look.</li>
    <li> Love this product mixed with some coconut oil felt unbelievable after.</li>
    <li> So far I really like the effects of this product.  I&#x27;ve used it once as a facial mask and immediately noticed that my skin was smoother and fine lines were reduced. I have also used the clay with a bit of coconut oil to spot treat blemishes and rough skin on my knees and elbows, which produced terrific results.</li>
    <li> A good quality clay powder. Needs some attention in the mixing to avoid clumps.</li>
    <li> Works amazing I use it as a spot treatment on my pimple and it dries them out fast! Good for acne!</li>
    <li> Dries quickly, tightens pores, face feels overall softer and healthy. GREAT as a foot soak too!</li>
    <li> Wow!! This has definitely made me feel like I did my own spa treatment. I am serious that is how I felt for about 30 minutes. This bentonite clay really does detox my skin and I have noticed the blackheads are gone. . It really does help with your complex and how you feel in your skin.one of my favorite facial sacks.</li>
    <li> Today is my second mask, and I felt the difference in my face already!  A lot really does go a very long way with this clay, I would suggest using about 1 tsp and 4 tsp water in the mix for one mask(at least this covers my face)  Easily washes off, and makes my face feel great!</li>
    <li> I live in central Oklahoma and I&#x27;ve been bitten by spiders (Brown Recluses and others), and other similar critters more than a few times.  Unlike some people, I do not react strongly to the spider&#x27;s venom, but I DO take a long time to completely heal, sometimes as long as six months.  The wound will slowly grow in size, ooze plasma, itch, and look pretty nasty during the healing process.  I usually just clean the wound often with hydrogen peroxide and apply a Band-Aid. The largest one of my bite areas has ever grown was the size of a nickel - some people react strongly and their wound can grow very quickly to become as large as a dinner plate and eventually require skin grafts! My wounds will close up and heal in time, leaving scar tissue behind.  An interesting note:  I&#x27;ve read some research (yeah, on the Web, so a grain of salt is in order), that suggests that the aggressive wound and large area of damage from some spider bites is not due to the spider&#x27;s venom but due to the flesh-eating bacteria on the spider&#x27;s fangs, and that the bacteria is injected along with the venom.  That seems somewhat logical since the amount of venom injected is tiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, a couple of weeks ago, as I was working at the computer, I idly scratched at an itch on my right index finger near the knuckle.  Whoa!  A piece of skin about 1/4&amp;#34; by 1/2&amp;#34; came right off and underneath was the telltale sign of a Brown Recluse bite: raw, red exposed flesh, somewhat bumpy, itchy, oozing plasma, etc. etc.  I had some activated charcoal powder and herbal extract liquid from a &amp;#34;Brown Recluse Bite Kit&amp;#34; that I had ordered years before.  The kit&#x27;s instructions said to mix up a poultice and apply to the bite site, replacing the poultice several times a day.  The charcoal mix WILL work to draw out the venom, but it is quite messy and somewhat slow.  I decided to try the Sodium Bentonite approach touted by several websites.  I jumped up on Amazon and used my Prime membership to order the Majestic Pure Sodium Bentonite Clay powder and a 2 oz. bottle of Colloidal Silver (natural anti-biotic) to mix with the clay to make a poultice, for a total of only about 20 bucks.  In just a couple of days I had the goods, mixed up a batch of clay + silver solution (looks like grayish-green mud), and applied it to the bite site.  As with the charcoal poultice, I washed the bite with soap &amp; water, cleaned it with hydrogen peroxide, and applied fresh poultice and a Band-Aid several times a day.  In just three days, the wound was very much improved - shrinking in size, less oozing, less redness, and notably faster healing than with the charcoal.  After 12 days the bite site was completely closed over - no more oozing, no itching, and not red but only slightly pink.  I&#x27;m convinced!  Sodium Bentonite clay will be in my medicine cabinet from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may be wondering why I didn&#x27;t go to my doctor.  I DID see my doctor the first time I was bitten years ago.  He told me that medical science doesn&#x27;t really have a good treatment for festering spider bites, other than to prescribe pain killers and surgically excise the rotting flesh, as was done for my son.  As for me, I&#x27;ll use the clay + silver treatment whenever I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will leave positive plus feedback on Amazon this weekend when I have more time.  Thank you for a great product at a very reasonable price.Majestic Pure Sodium Bentonite Clay powder and a 2 oz. bottle of Colloidal Silver (natural anti-biotic) to mix with the clay to make a poultice, for a total of only about 20 bucks.

    <li> Use this for eczema and it helps with rebuilding the skin if you are able to not scratch it.  I used this with less water to make it stickier.  It would get very itchy but I have found leaving it longer than 20 minutes helped.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not magic, but my skin is super soft after using it.</li>
    <li> Product is great...I saw results immediately. It&#x27;s not harsh on the skin like most abrasion products. The delivery time was excellent. It arrived much earlier than I expected. I will keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> I APPLY THIS ABOUT TWICE A WEEK.  MY SKIN FEELS SO CLEAN AFTERWARDS.  I GET BLACKHEAD VERY OFTEN AND THIS HAS GOTTEN RID OF THEM.  I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR ACNE PRONE SKIN AS WELL.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I am very happy with the results. Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Thanks so much</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get all the great reviews. The product is hard to mix so it&#x27;s very clumpy even if you follow directions. I used it for about a month once a week and I haven&#x27;t seen a change in my skin besides the irritation while it&#x27;s on. Other than that nothing happened I still have acne. I&#x27;ll keep using it and will write another review but so far no change.</li>
    <li> Great product, my skin felt great after the first use!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely amazing stuff! It gives my face such a deep cleansing refreshing feeling and visibly reduces the size of my pores! I received this as a sample to try and I&#x27;m definitely impressed!  This will now be a weekly face mask routine for me.</li>
    <li> So far I like this product.  Skin feels smooth and soft after use.  It should come with better mixing instructions as it is really hard to mix.  A little bit goes a long ways.  Clumps quickly so plan on spending a lot of time mixing.  Use VERY little.</li>
    <li> THIS MASK MAKES YOUR FACE SO SO SOFT1!! dOES NOT IRRITATE MY SENSITIVE SKIN! highly RECOMMEND IT FOR A CLEAN SOFT FACE!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t mix with the water no matter how many ratios I try to make a paste. Wish I had my money back.</li>
    <li> I was happily surprised by just how much product you get for your money with indian healiing clay.  This tub can easily last you a year or more.  The natural face mask can not be beat!  After trying countless face masks over the years and spending who knows how much money on similar products, I am happy to say I found this product.  As the clay drys on your skin, you can feel it pulling out impurities.  My skin is left feeling soft and revived after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product can also be used as a detox for other skin areas besides the face; I have mixed it with apple cider vinegar and water then used on underarms as a detox.</li>
    <li> What a great product this is I love it.  Your skin will feel as soft as it has ever been in your life with this.  I mix it in a container with a lid and make enough for a week this way you don&#x27;t have too mix it everyday.  Also very fast shipping what a great product this is .</li>
    <li> This product is messy, does not mix easy no matter how much I try or how I try and I saw no change in my skin.</li>
    <li> I like this product, a little bit is more than enough. I try it in my arms and they feel very soft.  It actually works but remember a little goes a long way. Trust me. Oh and it came on time.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading tons of great reviews. I have cystic acne on my chin and neck that I never had when I was a teen. I have tried EVERYTHING and thought maybe this could help. I tried the clay by itself and didn&#x27;t notice any changes. I started using ACV with it which I read could help but still no real results. I read that my acne would get worse before it got better. It did get worse so I thought maybe it was going to work but it never got better and I probably have more acne now than I did when I started using it (probably caused by it pulling the toxins out and bringing underlying acne to the surface). I read to use it for two weeks every night for cystic acne and then start using it just once or twice a week so that is what I did, but nothing. It did feel like it was working when I would use it, my face would get red like other reviewers stated and it felt like my pores were clean afterwards but other than that nothing. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I use it for my hair to cleanse as I am no poo now and it works great and leaves your hair so soft.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> Healing clay can be used for bug bites, acne, breakouts and reactions to other things that causes itching. The mask is cooling and easy to use. There is no heavy scent. Be careful of the amount you use. A little goes a long way. Keep the jar tightly closed so you do not lose any clay and children do not decide they want to make a mud pie in the bathroom. I tired this product at discounted price for a review.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
    <li> Would recommend Pdf directions be included with the product but I was very pleased with the results of this mask. Still perfecting my mixing technique but the results of the first 2 uses were quite amazing to me. First time face was quite red so be sure to use it when you are not planning to go out for a few hours. Second use: face not near as red. Redness subsides within 2 hrs. I would say and maybe faster with each use. Highly recommend facial pores visibly tightened and skin glowing.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my face and hair. I mix it with ACV and olive oil. I will most definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Essentially dry Borghese &amp;#34;Fango&amp;#34; sans the scents and herbs.  Fantastic for face &amp; body.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this Healing Clay! It has so many soothing uses. Love it as a face mask and so soothing on my legs after shaving. I have very pale skin and it easily scares but this clay makes them soft and light. My 16 year old daughter tried it and now loves it too. Told all her friends it&#x27;s better than stuff at Sephora Store.</li>
    <li> Shipping was SUPER fast and was delivered on a SUNDAY! I was impressed. Purchased for the maximum hydration method and this clay is so much better than the calcium bentonite clay. 100+ times better! I have 4c/4a apl hair and I mix 1-2 tsp w/ ~4 oz milk and 1 tsp honey 1 tsp EVOO (measurements never precise...) mixture yields the amazing ability to detangle my coils with conditioning softness! I can never go back to calcium bentonite clay now. The difference is REAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Majestic Pure for the follow up emails --great customer service! Will most certainly purchase again</li>
    <li> I got the clay to use on a rash on my chest and underarms.  I think it is helping; the rash is better, but not gone.  I will continue to use it in hopes that it will heal my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a face mask once a week and I love it. I can literally feel my face tighten as it dries. The first time I used it, I broke out for a few days since it pulled all the toxins to the surface, but now my skin looks great. I will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> Anyone looking for a healthy approach to detox your skin... fire ant stings???? This is a wonderful remedy to soothing and pull out such grief!!! I use this as face mask once a week for beauty regimen, foot soak, sun burn relief.... A very little in a bowl add three parts water, stir to combine, let sit, *in fridge!!.. Then use paste and smooth on to skin... Let dry (15-20 mins) according to your comfort level (face), remove when ready! Warm cloth, place over to soften and gently wipe! ~ smooth, refreshed, soothed!ðŸ˜Š</li>
    <li> This clay is amazing!!! I will buy this again when I start to run low. I just used it for the first time and I can already tell a difference in my skin. I used it on my face, neck, feet and toes. I feel wonderful ðŸ˜Š</li>
    <li> Good size container of bentonite clay. I use this as a mask to refresh my skin twice a week. I usually add a few drops of rose hip oil but I&#x27;ve recently been adding orange blossom water and jojoba oil and this makes the mask smell amazing and feel great. This brand of sodium bentonite clay is exactly the same as the previous brand I bought. It came packaged well and should last me quite some time. If you want some recipes for masks look up wellness mamma&#x27;s blog or just search for bentonite clay masks. The company also e-mailed me a pdf file with tips and uses for the clay so that might be a good place to start if you haven&#x27;t used this type of clay before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I really like this!!!  It&#x27;s just quite messy.  Mixing it is somewhat of a pain, but it&#x27;s still a great product!</li>
    <li> love this natural clay very good sensation tingling in the right amount and beautiful results. my skin is smooth and much less blackheads after use. i did receive this product in return for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for....I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I used this on me and my daughter.  My daughter is a teenager and after she said Mom my skin is so soft.  This is a great product and glad I was able to purchase at a lower price.  I will continue to use this and she who of course gives me a hard time about everything said when I use it to remind her so I can also use on her!  Love this!  I have very sensitive skin and this truly did not irritate my skin at all.  This is a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel soft and it&#x27;s evident how great it cleans by the radiant glow on my face after use.</li>
    <li> Love the way this feels. I mix one spoonful with a little water and mix well. Keep adding a tiny bit of water until you get the perfect consistency for you. Goes on smooth and after about 15 mins rinse it off. Leaves your face feeling clean and tight. We use it once every week and love it.&lt;br /&gt;16 oz of this product at this rate should last for a year or more!  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Have been using this once a week with my daughter. I love it so much.  My skin feels smoother and cleaner and has a glow people notice. I&#x27;ve even used it on my feet. It is great for detoxing the body. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing! Any blemish is gone within 24 hours after using this one time!</li>
    <li> I did not honestly think this product would work but wanted to try due to dry skin on my feet and legs. I was so impressed and loved the way it made them feel that i began using it on my face and arms. WOW love it... a must try and you will be hooked.</li>
    <li> I used it three times and it does have a very soft finish to your skin after its washed off. My makeup has a flawless look, my tiny breakouts is no longer pronounced as they seem less visible. I must say this is a big jar so it would last awhile; be careful though as its very powdery and could make a mess, settle the jar before opening.. Other than that its dose what it says, I would recommend a good moisturizer after using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the results of this mask. Used on a regular basis, I feel it will be very beneficial in dealing with those pesky, teeny, tiny blackheads in the t-zone.</li>
    <li> Regardless of what it does for the face, I hate that you have to mix your own paste.  Convenience is important to me, and this is not.  It makes a huge mess and is difficult to get into a paste and on the face.  It&#x27;s slippery and clumpy.  The powder falls everywhere, when I&#x27;m mixing it clumps drop all over the sink, and then it drips everywhere as I poorly attempt to get it to stick to my face.  Having to clean up my bathroom after using this makes me avoid it and use my other masks instead.  I would greatly prefer a clay that is already in paste form, and will look for that in the future.  I&#x27;m not really sure if it helps my skin or not, but I can say it&#x27;s insanely itchy as it dries.</li>
    <li> Omg! I used this on my kids sores that got infected they had staph!! The next day the sores looked a lot less inflamed and the kids said they were not as itchy! Mind you the were also on antibiotics! But the itch didn&#x27;t ease until I used this!! I also use it as a facial and it has made my skin look so much more vibrant and soft!!! Love it</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Packaged clean and protected. I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, and I absolutely love it. I&#x27;m always on the look out for a miracle cure for my acne, and I&#x27;ll probably never find it, but this definitely makes a difference. My skin is so much smoother, so much softer, much less oily and greasy, a noticeable difference in blackheads and pore size. So glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very good, soft skin. Love it.</li>
    <li> I mixed the clay with a little apple cider and applied the mask . It works wonderfully . Leaves skin clean and shiny . Great product !! Worth the price .</li>
    <li> I have been nothing but please with this.  I have used it for my teeth, hair, face and body.  It has been wonderful!  I have already recommended this to many of my friends and they too are very pleased.</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my skin feel!!!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin look 10 years younger,</li>
    <li> I really liked this facial mask. It helped minimized my pores without it breaking my face out. I also had no side effects. My 16 yr old daughter uses this also it It works great on her also. Love it</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick and the product is amazing. It makes my skin silky smooth. Thank you.</li>
    <li> When I first opened the package I was a little disappointed since the canister had obviously been opened previously and taped shut - I wasn&#x27;t certain if this was because I received the item in return for a review or not. But when I opened the canister itself I was pleasantly relieved to see it was completely full.&lt;br /&gt;I have used different bentonite clays in the past, mostly for making toothpaste. This one is far more &#x27;powdery&#x27; than the others and I really like that. It will make for a much smoother toothpaste - you don&#x27;t want something too grainy that might eventually scratch tooth enamel. To that end it makes a very nice face mask! It was very smooth and set-up very easy (not a lot of clumping issues). After rinsing off my face my skin felt very refreshed and clean. I am looking forward to the weekly treatments to see any long-term benefit.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel wonderful after every use u don&#x27;t need too much product the smell is not strong. It has a lot of product in it. I recommend you trying this product to benefit you are any other person.</li>
    <li> This mixed with apple cider vinager works well for drawing out acne.</li>
    <li> This item arrived to me with nothing more than a piece of clear tape sealinh it closed. The item was dirty and I was completely put off by the outside. I kept an open mind and removed the clear tape to open the jar. Because of the lack of box or plastic wrap I expected a peel back seal on the inside, but there was nothing. It opened to reveal a jar of gray powder. I was so disgusted with the packaging and complete lack of a proper seal that I refuse to test the product inside. For that reason only I&#x27;m giving 3 stars instead of zero.</li>
    <li> When I went to mix it stuck all together couldn&#x27;t get it to be a paste. So couldn&#x27;t say it f it works well.</li>
    <li> This was everything I was looking for,it was a little hard to put on.but I liked the way it left my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Great product! Thank you! I use it a lot on my face! Excellent</li>
    <li> Best quality! I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this one is the best by far.</li>
    <li> This clay is so amazing! I&#x27;ve been using it since the second it arrived and I&#x27;m so pleased. Nothing&#x27;s ever cleared out my face just in three days of using it. I know it says to use it once a week, but I wanted a faster result. I let it stay on my face  for 5-10 minutes depending on how much time I have in the morning before I leave for work. It&#x27;s my forth day of using it and I&#x27;m going to take a break from using it for maybe a week. I can finally go a whole day without the need to touch up my make up every one hour because my face used to be extremely oily. I pertuse a lot on amazon, and don&#x27;t really care about writing reviews, but this stuff literally changed my life for the better and I want others to feel amazing about their faces even without any make up.</li>
    <li> This is the weirdest stuff! You literally feel like you&#x27;re mixing up a cup of cement and then slathering it on your face! And as it dries, it solidifies your face, further convincing you that this COULD be cement. But never fear! It really will wash off with only water (and a little scrubbing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little tough mixing the dry mud powder with water. The container says 3 parts water to 1 part powder. That&#x27;s a little thick actually, so you just dribble in a little extra water and mix, and mix...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the effort is really worth it. After just one use, there is a noticeable reduction in pore size and, surprisingly, a big reduction in redness and pimple inflamation! I&#x27;m actually pretty excited to try this regularly.</li>
    <li> Worked well, although the first time I used it I left it on for 15 minutes and had some irritation. 10 minutes works best for my sensitive skin. Skin feels really soft and clean after using, and helped improve the appearance of the sebaceous filaments on my nose. Skin tone was more even the next day after using, I have a bit of redness on my nose and cheeks that this mask helps with.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping... Love the product</li>
    <li> Amazing purchase at a great price ($8.50 at the time of writing!) I&#x27;m a huge beauty junkie so my drawers are filled with products, but I have to say this clay mask is the best one I have tried. This jar is HUGE and substantially heavy, and considering you don&#x27;t need to use that much each time, this jar is sure to last you months. I look forward to using this each week - it&#x27;s kind of like a spa getaway within the comforts of my own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using, I clean my face with a Konjac sponge to clear my face of any particles or residue that might prevent the mask from being completely smooth. I mix the product with water from the faucet, apply the mixture to my face once it comes to a good consistency, and leave it on for 20 minutes. The most difficult part about this process in my opinion is cleaning off the mask, only because it can get pretty messy. I usually wipe as much of it off with my hands as I can, then use a washcloth to clean off any remaining parts of the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face always feels incredibly soft and smooth upon cleaning off the mask since this mask helps to exfoliate the dead skin cells and thoroughly clean out pores. Previously, my skincare routine consisted of an exfoliator followed by a mask, but this product has allowed me to combine those two steps into one. I have acne-prone skin and I definitely feel like this has cleaned out my pores to aid in reducing acne breakouts. Love this product and often recommend it when friends ask how I have been managing my acne breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.</li>
    <li> OK..will not purchase again. Too messy and cleanse the same as apple cider vinegar... I purchased for my natural hair hoping to get a slightly different results than my apple cider vinegar regiment.. And I did not.. Maybe great for someone else.. Not me</li>
    <li> It was disappointing to say but it is even not a mask which can not out on the face. It can not stick, not hold on the face. How it is supposed to work and recovery from all face problems.. No wayyâ€¦  it was just waste of my moneyâ€¦ I can not use ti now and I just threw it to the garbage.</li>
    <li> I have been using many expensive skin products to correct my skill after my teen years but last time i had irritating to my skin and had to go to the hospital.&lt;br /&gt;This product have used it twice this week and i can notice a BIG difference ! My girlfriend has been asking what is my secret and your face looks really different !</li>
    <li> Item as described, immediate shipping. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Love it, it is one of the best face masks I have used. I use it once a week and I can see the results on my face.</li>
    <li> Purely amazing, virtually transformed my face over night. I followed the mask with Oz Naturals AncIent Orient Rice Enzyme (scrub) to remove all the stubborn blackheads that have invaded my skin this summer!</li>
    <li> I originally got this for reducing the pore size of the pores around my nose and on my chin.  It works great for that.  But I wanted to mention something else in my review.  A couple of days ago, my neighbor was stung by a bee.  She must have some kind of mild allergy because the skin on her arm became very hard under the sting.  It hurt and stayed hot.  She was so uncomfortable and nothing seemed to work.  I thought about this and asked her if she wanted to try it.  She was ready to try anything.  We put the healing clay on her arm and left it one for about 25 minutes and then she washed it off.  I left the jar with her and she put more on right before bed.  The next day, the sting was so much better.  I&#x27;m glad I had this for her!  Yesterday my son had a very itchy mosquito bite and we did the same thing.  It was much better after just one treatment.  Although this is a great treatment to have around for your face, it is also good for the medicine cabinet to treat bites and stings.  I really like that the healing clay is from Wyoming.  I love domestic products :)</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling so soft!</li>
    <li> very clean and effective, really enjoyed my home facial.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife. She says it is great for cleaning her skin.</li>
    <li> I broke my nose shortly after buying the clay and used it to help with the bruising and swelling and it worked wonders, the bruising didn&#x27;t spread and healed VERY quickly and I noticed a distinct lowering in swelling every time I rinsed it off. I also love it as a regular mask now that my injuries have healed!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I mix it with Apple Cider Vinegar and use it approximately three times a week. Great price, too. I will buy again...</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel superrrrrrrrrrr soft!!! I use this once a week and I think it has controlled my oily skin. You only have to use a tiny bit because you mix three parts water and one part clay. And trust me if you&#x27;re using this only for yourself you only need to use a quarter-size amount of this each time. Gonna last me a long time!&lt;br /&gt;-Karina</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the Indian Healing Clay.  I made a facial mask and it really tightened my pores and gave me a fresh, clean, smooth face!  The clay has a nice, light scent.  A little goes a very long way.  My first batch I had leftovers that I quickly applied elsewhere on my body.  I can&#x27;t wait to start experimenting and getting detoxified!</li>
    <li> This is great! I can visibly tell and feel the difference in my skin! Firmer and smoother!</li>
    <li> I have always heard that clay masks are the best but have never tried any until now with Majestic Pure Bentonite Clay and I must say I LOVED IT! I may have used a bit too much due to the fact that I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure how much to mix and the portion that I mixed I used all of it on my face (I didn&#x27;t want to waste any) and it irritated just a bit but other than that I loved the way it left my face extremely soft and for a couple of days to boot! Not to mention, that it shrank my pores like I&#x27;ve never seen them shrink before :-)  I would have gave it 5 stars if there was a more clear measurement given, I hate to waste good product :-) Thank you Majestic Pure!</li>
    <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve come across is that it doesn&#x27;t spread very well so it can be hard to get an even coating. Otherwise it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This stuff works so great on my skin!! I notice a difference in clarity afterwords in my skin tone, and the day after! Great quality for a low price! It&#x27;s my skin&#x27;s secret weapon!</li>
    <li> I have been using this clay mask to exfoliate my face and to exfoliate my underarms with a little bit of apple cider vinegar. The results are amazing! It&#x27;s leaves my skin feeling so soft, but most importantly it really does the job exfoliating and cleansing. Great  for clearing zits, blackheads, and shrinking pores. I highly recommend this product! There are so many great uses for this clay mask!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I&#x27;m giving myself a facial while writing this. Tightens up pores and skin feels so soft afterwards, very refreshing.</li>
    <li> I like it but it is messy and did not benefit my skin too much.</li>
    <li> Great product. Used it for the firs time and I can totally see the difference. My pores and skin felt and looked smaller and smoother. So glad to have bought it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have acne and this product is proving to m\be amazing.  I use it just as it tells you to do so. Great product for deep pore cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is the best clay mask I have ever had the pleasure of using. The consistency and feel is that of a high end spa visit. I also used some to make facial bar soap. The limits to which this clay can be used is endless. So if you want to pamper yourself, or others, at home for a fraction of the price of going to a high end spa I would buy this! Love it!</li>
    <li> My skin feels clean and bright after using it. Will recommend to friend and family.</li>
    <li> This is a healthy easy way to take great care of your skin and spoil yourself without leaving home</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with blackheads on my nose for about 20 years.  It felt like it worked well as a facial mask.  I am hoping that this is my answer. I will continue to use it and update again later.</li>
    <li> when i first tried this I thought I measured it out correctly but made it too thick of a paste to apply. tried it again and wow I must say after the second try this stuff is amazing on the face.. It pulled out stubborn blackheads that my biore nose strips overlooked.. my skin felt so soft and hydrated once i washed it off.. this is for sure a new part of my weekly skin care routine. How did I not try this before now.....</li>
    <li> I purchased this Indian Healing Clay to use as a mask to deep clean my pores around once a week, which it definitely does. My teenage daughter has also used this product on some problem areas on her face where she has had an acne breakout and I do have to say that it has indeed helped her skin in regards to that issue. A little of this powder goes a long way, this jar that I received will last for a long time. I want to suggest though adding some honey into the &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; it goes on thicker and you get the added benefit of the antibacterial and moisturising honey as well. Please note that you do not want this mask to dry on your skin. That is very important. When the clay first goes onto the skin it is wet and magic begins, minerals go into the skin, the toxins come out and blood flow is increased. As soon as the clay starts to dry it  begins to draw out the moisture from your skin. This can cause some redness and skin irritation. Once the warm weather comes around I will be trying this out for those pesky bug bites.</li>
    <li> I have kinda bad skin little pimples on my cheeks and whatever... I&#x27;ve seen improvements in the first week using this mask. Def gonna order again. :)</li>
    <li> Very nice. bigger container than I anticipated. It can definitely last you a long time because you don&#x27;t need much powder for one use. It made me feel very refreshed and my skin felt nice and tight afterwards. I recommend following up with a toner or a serum/moisturizer afterwords because it can make you feel a little dry afterwards. I use this at night so it better absorbs. I will definitely repurchase this product once I&#x27;m finished with this one.</li>
    <li> I really like using these clay masks. This was my first time buying it from this company. i got it because it was discounted. They&#x27;re supposed to be kind of heavy duty and really clean out your pores. you mix the clay with water and apply a thick layer on your face. then you wait until it&#x27;s solid (like most masks) and wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;I have blackheads on my nose, and this really cleans out my pores. this is my second time purchasing an indian clay mask.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife, but here I sit with my fifth treatment of &amp;#34;Indian Healing Clay&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m having my doubts, though. Not that my wife doesn&#x27;t like it, or me for that matter... But I&#x27;m 97.9% sure that this is actually dark magic mud. Call it Indian Healing clay, sure that&#x27;s fine. But I think I know what&#x27;s really going on. Here&#x27;s the thing - we both break out a lot, she worse than I. I suppose now I should say USED TO break out a lot. Thanks to this witchcraft goop, we&#x27;ve seen significantly fewer breakouts, and amazingly healthy skin. When it&#x27;s first applied, it feels weird. Maybe that&#x27;s just me, never used this stuff before. After it dries, it&#x27;s a pain to wash off. My wife assures me that this is how all face mud is, but whatever. AFTER all that is where you see the results of the dark incantations. My skin is sinfully soft, and I can never go back. I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a week. I like this product because it didn&#x27;t make my face feel irritated like other masks have before. My skin felt soft for a few days after I used it. Mosts masks usually only make your face feel noticeably soft for a few hours so I thought that was cool. On top of that I use light dabs of powder on my face before I go out so my face won&#x27;t look oily and it works great. Additionally the tub is pretty big; it&#x27;s meant to be used once a week so I know it will last. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I used the clay for my husband foot soak and his feet felt so nice after. I recommend this product for the variety of uses, next is my face mask.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it works really well.</li>
    <li> worked great healing some blemishes and cleaning pores.</li>
    <li> I used the mask and it made my skin feel very soft and clean. I really like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> So Impressed! First off, you dilute this 3:1 with water so you actually end up with 48 ounces of clay! So this is an excellent value! I made the mask and applied it to my face. The instructions say that it needs to dry for about 20 minutes, but I found that it needed a little more time - probably another 5-10 minutes. When I washed it off, I expected my face to feel refreshed and tight but it also felt really moisturized and healthy, which I didn&#x27;t expect. I really liked it and I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try it!</li>
    <li> This clay powder comes in a plastic 16oz jar with instructions to reconstitute it with 3 parts water to one part powder which is a light grey. I received this item free* to try and review and when I first opened the jar I was surprised that it was a powder and not pre-mixed. That is my bad for not noticing it, it does say powder in the description but my brain just didnâ€™t catch it. That is fine with me though, it means it will last a lot longer than other types of masks I have tried and will always be mixed to the consistency that you like since you are doing it yourself. I know there are times when I have bought various other clay or mud masks and they either dry out faster than I can use them up, or they donâ€™t stay mixed together so when you go to use them you have to remix them anyways. Powder also means that it will last a lot longer and could be used different ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way I have tested it is on my face as a mask, but Iâ€™ve been reading up on it and there are various other uses for it that I might like to try some day. Using it as a mask you really should test this out on a small patch of skin first, even more recommended if you have sensitive skin. This does say it is safe for sensitive skin, but I ignored the instructions and found that it is only to a certain point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what I did was read the instructions that let sit for 20 minutes for regular skin, half that for sensitive skin. I used tablespoon as my parts, and it made way more than I needed for just my face so I put it on hubbies and my sons just to use up what I had mixed up the first time. It actually felt really good on my face, so much so that I thought ohh well this isnâ€™t bothering my sensitive skin so I will go ahead and leave it on the full amount like for normal skin. Iâ€™ve used clays and muds in the past that had something in them that would just make my skin burn as soon as it was applied so I took no pair or irritation as a good sign. Hubby and my son washed theirs off first and said it made their skin feel clean, but didnâ€™t bother their skin, which looked fine and normal. Then I rinsed mine off, it came off really easy with a bit of warm water. At first I was okay and went about my business, but then a few minutes passed and my face started warming up. After a few more minutes passed and it felt like my face was getting even hotter I went and looked in the mirror and my face was sooo red, like cooked lobster. Super red and on fire, I rinsed my face again just to be on the safe side and then applied some plain aloe gel. It started cooling down and feeling normal after about 20-30 minutes but did stay various shades of red for hours. By the time I went to bed that night my face was back to normal but it did scare me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited about a week and gave it another try. This time I didnâ€™t go by parts, I just put a few pinches in a dish and kept adding water and mixing until it was a consistency that I liked. I applied it to my face and left it on between 5-10 minutes, rinsed it off and all was right in the world this time. My skin felt clean and I did not look like a lobster. I think I was very cautious and used both less time and a thinner mixture with more water less clay. This is why I recommend testing it out on a patch of skin. You might need to alter your times or amounts just a bit for your skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I did like the way the mask made my skin feel clean (though on fire the first time felt very clean) both times and do want to continue using it with more caution now. I did not see that it made my pores look any smaller or changed the overall look of my skin but maybe I need more time using it to see those types of results? I did mark it down one star because they promote it as being safe for sensitive skin, but the only real advice you get on the bottle is to leave it on half the time. I think a bit more caution for sensitive skin should be labeled on the container and in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*regardless of getting this item for free this is my 100% honest opinion.egardless of getting this item for free this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this Indian Healing Clay. I have to admit I missed the part about it being in powder form.  Be carful when opening or you will get powder everywhere!  This was my first experience mixing a clay mask. The others I have tried have been ready to use.  That being said, the first attempt did not go well.  I mixed it 1 part clay and 3 parts water but I used way too much and it was a big clumpy mess.  This was totally due to inexperience on my part.  The second time I used it, I used 1 teaspoon powder with 3 teaspoons water.  It took a bit of mixing but I did get a smooth product.  It has a very nice, natural, earthy smell to it.  I am very sensitive to artificial fragrances so this is a big plus for me.  I applied a thin layer of the clay on my face and let it dry for 20 minutes.  I could feel it tightening on my face and working it&#x27;s magic..  It washed off easily and left my skin feeling smooth and soft with a healthy glow.  I am very happy with this product and am looking forward to trying it out on the kids bug bites in summer and my sons acne as well as other uses described in other reviews.  I was given an opportunity to try this product during a promotion for a  discount.  All opinions are 100% honest and my own. I took off one star because I wish it had more detailed instructions but am otherwise very pleased with the product.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I have been using this as a face mask and it works great. It makes my face feel super clean it cleans out my pores and it looks like it has cleared up all my black heads as well. I feel as if it takes all the harsh chemicals out of my face and detoxes my skin. Afterwards my face is a lot smoother and softer. I have extremely sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t cause any irritation or adverse effects. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using it.</li>
    <li> this is a great product. It goes on easily and leaves the skin toned and very smooth. In thirty minutes you are finished. I will use more that once per week.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use it because I have a very sensitive face and my face stayed broke out.</li>
    <li> I always read about the product before purchasing  it to get a full view of what exactly what I will be receiving.  Clay is for Hair,  Healing Clay helps Acne Scars, I tried it and I applied it just as the directions stated and left on for the full amount of time.  It washed off pretty easy with some rubbing around with my fingers. After the first use I could tell a difference with my skin. My skin felt much softer. I have oily skin so it took away all that oil. It lasted the rest of the day with hardly any oil buildup on my face. Will definitely recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Mix great works good left my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed in the fact that nothing was given on how to use/ mix for the different purposes.I can&#x27;t rate if I haven&#x27;t got to even use.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for making face masks and homemade cosmetics. Great quality product, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It makes my skin smooth, but it does nothing for my acne and it&#x27;s rough to apply. It always clumps up and it&#x27;s extremely difficult to apply. Using apple cider vinegar makes this easier. I will still keep using it, but I was ultimately disappointed with this product (since it had amazing reviews) and will not buy again. I mainly bought this to help my acne problem, but it barely had an impact, even after a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> I saw results after the first time I used it!</li>
    <li> Love it! The best facial mask, wish I&#x27;d learned about this product earlier;  wouldn&#x27;t have spent so much money for over the counter products which doesn&#x27;t provide the benefits the Indian clay has. The follow up emails from this company to ensure I was made aware that the product was shipped and to further inquire if I received it was top notch and we&#x27;ll appreciated,  thank you.</li>
    <li> My acne isnt severe its something that tends to happen when I start my period or I go to sleep with no pimples and wake up with acouple already forming. For years I been searching for products to help. Ive tried proactiv for years and that didnt work as good as I thought it would since it was expensive and I used benzoyl peroxide wash and that didnt help. I came across this item with great reveiw so I had to try it. I think I found the product I been searching for! Lol I use this once a week and for two weeks straight since I purchased it, I havent had a break out during my period or off!!!! I love this product :-)</li>
    <li> This is used to help to remove toxins from the body. This product comes grey which I&#x27;ve read means it&#x27;s really good quality. When mixed with water this clay turns into a sponge that soaks up all the toxins from your skin! This also does not stain which differs from some of the charcoal masks!</li>
    <li> I had a lot of fun using this o my face.  I loved doing facials when I was younger but it&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve taken the time myself to take care of it!  I sat down and put it on - it didn&#x27;t seem to heavy on my face so that was nice.  When it was all washed off, I felt very refreshed!! Can&#x27;t wait to do it again!</li>
    <li> I liked it. It&#x27;s description matched what I received. Got it the day after it shipped.</li>
    <li> Great seller. I love their high quality products and their prices.&lt;br /&gt;The product works really well.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.  Who says good beauty product has to be expensive!</li>
    <li> Nice product. I use it once or twice a week as a mask. I also put a little in my facial powder each day. Helps control any oils.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product!  I used it on my face the first night and it felt so smooth.  I used it on the back of my arms and elbows which tend to be dry and rough and they are so much better now.</li>
    <li> Love the ingredients in this mask. Made me feel very pampered.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very gentle even for my sensitive skin. And, it really work!  After using  the clay, all the blackhead came out, and the skin was soft.  Overall, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> does what it is advertised to do - but I have a little trouble getting a smooth mix- I guess this takes practice.  It is a benign cleanser, it appears to be effective,  and I suspect I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Love this clay.. My skin is so soft!!!</li>
    <li> I Love this Healing clay. I&#x27;ve had problems with blackheads since I was in High school, but this clay really purifies and cleans my pores. I only use it once a week like directed. I might dilute it a lot more instead of 3 parts water its been working as one TSP and 4TSP&#x27;s water twice a week.</li>
    <li> Product can be very messy.  Hard to mix with water.  I will have to play around with the mix.  Afraid to put leftover down sink because it will clog.  I say this by trying to wash off the bowl and spoon.  But as for product working. I liked the feel of my skin.  I will continue to work with the clad to see best way to mix it</li>
    <li> I thought this would work as a very good cleanser for skin mixed with apple cider but it wasn&#x27;t really working well (thinking that it would have great effects) but it doesn&#x27;t i was disappointed because all the great reviews and the money back guarantee only last for 30 Days so if you don&#x27;t like this within the first 3 weeks try to get your money back ASAP bottom line not the product for me .</li>
    <li> I have rosacea on my face, I used the healing clay and after the first use I seen a major improvement in my skin.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone struggling to find something to treat problem skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my face feel and look amazing.</li>
    <li> Love Bentonite clay! It&#x27; fantastic! Highly recommend the product . Mina</li>
    <li> I see many people saying it&#x27;s too thick or chunky. Please mix with a little apple cider vinegar first to make the mask smooth then add a little water.  It will be thinner and smooth and apply much easier. This is an excellent product.  Cleans and shrinks pores and lifts out the deep down dirt and helps with white and blackheads.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple weeks and enjoy it. I use it on my face and recent scar from a broken leg of about 5months ago. My face is smooth, soft, brighter, and almost no pores! Plus the dryness and oils seem to be balancing! Nothing helped my leg much, but this clay is helping my scar as well as my leg muscles aching less. I am really liking this product!</li>
    <li> Tingling clean sensation. Love it. Hope it will calm my bumpy skin. No side affects. Happy. can&#x27;t wait til next week</li>
    <li> This product is excellent! My complexion is glowing!</li>
    <li> I have heard about Indian Healing Clay for a long time, so when the opportunity to test it out and review it came up, I was excited. Having never used bentonite clay before, I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect or how to use it. The clay itself, as it comes, is a dry gray powder. Following the instructions, I mixed it with some water  and tried to get a good consistency. That&#x27;s where my inexperience came into play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After mixing, I was left with a still chunky mixture which didn&#x27;t apply too well. I gradually added more water until I achieved a somewhat usable consistency. Also due to my unfamiliarity with the substance, I made much more than I could use at one time. I did some research online afterwards, and it seems the best method is to make it in bulk, and let it sit for a day or two in order for the clay to absorb all the water. I assume this would give you a better consistency. I have the rest still sitting at home, so I will try again to see if sitting helps out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t fault the product for my inexperience, just something you need to learn before you mix it. No big deal. I currently have some sunburn on my face, so it was actually a good time to try this product. After the 20 minutes and cleaning the mask off, my face had a clean, smooth, &#x27;matte&#x27; feel to it. I experienced no side effects or irritation and I have somewhat sensitive skin. A lot of the dead skin that had started to peel from the sunburn came off as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking to improve their complexion and skin. In my research, I found that there are a ton of beneficial uses for bentonite clay and with the amount that comes in this jar, it seems like it would last me a lifetime!</li>
    <li> OMG! That was my first reaction after using this clay mask. This product is really good. There are many picture I found online - before I really used this product showing before after, such as brightened or tightened skin and I was thinking, &amp;#34;Really? Is that real?&amp;#34;. After I used this product just for one time, I am a believer! This product gives you an instant brightening for your skin, right after you wash off the clay mask. It is really awesome. I don&#x27;t feel any tingling or anything during the application, but it does tighten your skin after it is dry. Again, this is an awesome product and I will highly recommend it to everyone who looks for brighter skin.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just love this mask!! You can see and feel the difference with every application. I do it once a week.That&#x27;s all it takes!!</li>
    <li> Love this it&#x27;s great. It has helped tremendously with the dry skin on my feet. This item has definitely been perfect for me</li>
    <li> The best facial mask.  I have only been using it for a couple of weeks but I can see that my pores on my nose have shrunk.  The mask leaves my skin feeling smooth.  I am also using it on my legs and that is making them smoother as well.  This is a quality product at a great pr5ice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an skincare professional so when I saw this, I had to purchase it! I love using it as a face mask, You apply a thin layer and wait till it&#x27;s completely dried (about 20 minutes) and then just rinse off. It&#x27;s a powder and you&#x27;re supposed to mix it with water. I personally just add a gel mask to it as well. It&#x27;s a pretty good size as well. This might last me a few months especially if you use it about 2 times a week .</li>
    <li> I used this product as a mask after a warm shower for my whole body &amp; face 2-3x a week. Just use moisturizer after if you feel  your skin is so tight &amp; dry after. I have oily skin &amp; I sometimes use it with my powder brush to dab on oily parts of my face. It mattifies &amp; absorb oils. At first I don&#x27;t know how much clay &amp; water is good to make a thin paste. I&#x27;ve experimented a bit and found out you really don&#x27;t have to use a lot of the powder clay to make a mask.I use like less 1/2 teaspoon of clay with like 2-3 tbsp of water. Even though its looks watery and not pasty , you&#x27;ll notice you have enough once it dries on your face.</li>
    <li> Comes as a powder, is easy to mix (suggested to use with good quality water. eg. spring or distilled), also helps to lightly scrub away dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;Try rinsing face with warm-hot water to open pores, then mixing the healing clay with refrigerated water to cool and soothe the skin and close the pores back up. Mix only one batch at a time to prevent bacteria from building in sitting clay mixture.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful clay. I use it once a week to exfoliate  and tighten my skin. I look forward to using this product and will reorder this when I get low on it. The service is fast and I have it at my doorstep in 2 days. Marilyn Alcorn</li>
    <li> It is a good product. the packaging is good and tight. the clay itself is very find and easily mixed. I have been using it now for three weeks and I can see the benefits!. I mixed it with yoghourt, lavender and rosehip essential oils and honey. I defenitly will purchased this product again.</li>
    <li> so great!!! I love it! my skin has never looked this good ever! it is glowing!</li>
    <li> This really works!  I read the reviews of this product as well as a few other clay products and decided (1) to trust the difference between sodium bentonite and sodium calcium and (2) to avoid the product telling you to mix the clay with apple cider vinegar or water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product twice in three days but decided to use it every four or five days in the future, perhaps eventually stretching it out to once every six or seven days.  So far, I have not needed to use a moisturizer afterwards but that may change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything changes, I will add to this review or submit another one.  In the meantime, I&#x27;m happy to have found a product that really does what it says it&#x27;ll do!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Thought since it was a powder it would be a pain to mix, but it&#x27;s so easy and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Just have to make sure you don&#x27;t leave it on longer than recommended. My skin felt so soft afterwards and noticed a difference in the appearance too.</li>
    <li> Works greak as face mask....used one time n all blemishes dissapeared n skin felt smooth. Sooooo much in container it is a great value.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using Indian clay for long time for deep skin cleansing and detoxification. She also uses for soothing and healing skin.  She really admires the product and prefers sodium Bentonite over Calcium Bentonit due to it&#x27;s detoxification power.  It comes in powder form and you mix it with water until you get a watery paste. Apply on the face, wait about 20 minutes and then rinse...But ends results are superb.... Strongly recommended</li>
    <li> I love natural products and this Indian Healing Clay does what it promises.  I followed the directions and the results are amazing.  I plan to use this product once a week forever!!  For the price, you get a nice size amount and it is easy to use. Not harsh, but very effective for pore reduction.  A great find...</li>
    <li> This is a good clay mask but a little difficult to spread on my face, just apply thickly and it works very well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have bought several different clays and this one is amazing. What a great product. I will be repurchase it again.</li>
    <li> My skin feels renewed from using this healing clay. I have yet to perfect the mixing process so as to have as few lumps as possible :) I typically have combination skin...Since using this product, my skin feels more balanced. Thank you for providing a good product.</li>
    <li> I had received this clay about a month ago, and my acne was terrible! As a teenager, my hormones are all messed up, bit this clay helped a lot.  At first application, I experienced a little break out.  After 2 weeks, my face cleared up! I used this about twice a week and leave it on for about 25 minutes.  I have oily skin around my t-zone, but really dry skin every where else.  Plus my skin is very sensitive.  This healing clay does not irritate my skin ( which I am very surprised!!!) After I finish this jar, I am looking to repurchase this item!!</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Leaves my skin feeling clean and less oily for days. And I also use it as a a hair mask. My hair feels full and clean all day.</li>
    <li> I usually buy Kiehl&#x27;s clay mask, but this might just be my new favorite.  I whipped up a mask using the clay, water, and some coriander essential oil, and my pores have never been cleaner.  There was so much product I gave half to a friend.  I think it&#x27;s gonna last forever.</li>
    <li> Wow!! This has definitely made me feel like I went to the spa.  I have seen this circulating the internet on tutorials and reviews regarding Bentonite Clay Indian mask. I wanted to try this because of all the great benefits and deep pore  detox this product has. It comes in powder form so be careful when opening I had little dusts of clay powder fall out of the cap. I used plastic bowls to mix my mixture  3 parts water to 1 part clay is what the directions prescribe, but I had to put a little more to make it more of a paste. It feels really fantastic on your skin - I love that this helps DEEP clean your pores and face.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I used any Clay at all, and I have already started experiencing the smoothness of the skin. A great product.</li>
    <li> This is a lengthy process but it was definitely worth it! After one application I was able to feel a difference on my face. I could see a difference as well, my face felt smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe that you need to add just a little extra water than it states on the package. I definitely recommend buying this as you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Wow, you notice a difference right away in your pores.  Wonderful product at a great price.</li>
    <li> This clay is very good! I like using it for baths and face masks.</li>
    <li> this is a very interesting product, I think you will like it</li>
    <li> We use this 2x a week. It&#x27;s just like the stuff we buy at Whole Foods. We mix some raw apple cider vinegar and clay together, then it&#x27;s spa time. 15 minutes of application time seems to be the best for us. I would use the mask for less time if you have delicate skin. We only make clay masks but will be trying a foot bath soon..</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase of Indian Healing Clay, and so far I like it. I add ground turmeric, honey, and essential oils like lavender to the clay, and make a smooth paste using bottle water. I like to wear this mud mask to remove toxins from my skin. It also helps dry out pimples.</li>
    <li> I lOVE Clay and I absolutely think this is amazing. I put in on my face for about 40 minutes took it off and after I feel like a whole new person. I also put it on my arms and made my arms feel not as sore... It makes your face and whatever you put it on like my arms feels nice and smooth. MY opinion you use 1 part clay and 3 parts water. I prefer a thinner texture and build it up with two coats when applied with a foundation brush. It dries quickly and does what it says it will do,  My face has never felt so clean or looked so good! I think I am going to put it o my feet right now..  I recommend this product 100%.</li>
    <li> I had read a lot of information about the detoxifying and healing effect on the skin from Indian Healing Clay. It helps removes skin impurities and enhances the overall elasticity. I made the paste with one part clay and 3 parts water. I have sensitive skin and the clay mask caused no problems. My skin glowed after using it and my pores were much smaller. The 16 oz jar is a great size and will last a long time. I even applied a bit to a mosquito bite and it helped relieve the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I was able to bet this during a promotional period ti review and give my honest feedback.</li>
    <li> I have to be fair and state that I did not give the product the full benefit of working.  I brought it for the purpose of using it on my feet as I was told it would help with arthritis.  However, the preparation was very messy and therefore I found it difficult to use.  I will try it in the future ......for other uses.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once, but it seemed to help with the itching on my sons mosquito bits.  I&#x27;ll update more later as I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Tried it last night with my sister and I we were pampering ourself it dried fast and tightened I was like wow left on 20min as stated rinsed off face was smooth and silky will be using once a week you must buy it will last along time jar size excellent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in Texas, and the mosquitos here are out of control! I bought this product specifically to use as a paste to take the sting out of bug bites... and it works!! I&#x27;m so glad that something NATURAL can get the job done, as opposed to the chemical laden products lining grocery store shelves. Next I&#x27;m going to try it as a face mask, as I hear it can help with pimples!</li>
    <li> It does tighten my pores and I love that.  So far so good.  My husband even uses it.</li>
    <li> Really does leave your skin feeling amazing and it even helps with my boils..</li>
    <li> I was never a face mask person. Just an end of the day water and face soap gal. I came across this and thought I would give it a try. A few days later and my face feels so soft! I&#x27;ve always had pretty even complexion but this stuff is magic. I&#x27;m not sure what is in it, but after one use your skin feels refreshed.</li>
    <li> Spend a little more and get a clay mask that&#x27;s already mixed.  It&#x27;s a mess</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this mask. My cousin told me about it and bought me one for a gift. I&#x27;ll never not use this as long as I live. It drastically has improved my acne and blemishes. It also has faded my acne scars. You can just feel it working while wearing it. After its rinsed my face feels so soft, I&#x27;ve never had my face feel so incredibly smooth. I absolutely love love love it!</li>
    <li> Great for mud masks, both for skin and hair (mix with a wooden or plastic utensil to avoid leaching metals into your mask).  Bentonite clay pulls toxins out of skin and hair, so this is a GREAT clarifier for hair that has product buildup.  I also find that it helps define my curly hair and help it better absorb product afterward.  I have enlarged pores on my cheeks, and I find that they appear refined and tightened after using this as a facial mask.  It doesn&#x27;t need much to make this clay into a mask (I just mix with apple cider vinegar- ACV helps it mix more smoothly), but be aware of a few things: 1. you may feel a pulsing sensation (this is normal); 2. your skin (or hair) will be thirsty afterward.  Follow up with a quality moisturizer, your skin will be extra receptive after this.; 3. This is not food-safe, so do not ingest.  Some bentonite can be ingested to use as a detox, but this is NOT one of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  If you found this review unhelpful, please leave a comment telling me why.  I&#x27;d like to improve the quality of my reviews if they&#x27;re not providing value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product; it is comparable to the product I typically use.  I deducted a star because this is not food-safe and because the price is higher than my go-to bentonite brand (Aztec Secret- http://www.amazon.com/Indian-Healing-Clay-Aztec-Secret/dp/B00N528HIC/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1436204839&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;bentonite+aztec).  If you&#x27;re looking for an all-in-one powder, I recommend Living Clay (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCWIP48/ref&#x3D;as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;9325&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B00BCWIP48&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;gutsy00-20).</li>
    <li> I loved this healing clay. It may just be in my head, but it seemed to bring blood flow to my face. I could feel my pulse in my face. Left my skin feeling smooth and soft. A little goes a long ways. I used a TBSP of the clay powder and probably only needed a couple of TSP to cover my whole face.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I am trying to use more natural products, I am glad I did.  My face felt great after the mask.</li>
    <li> This product dramatically reduced the size of breakouts on my face. So happy I found this!</li>
    <li> I had really bad adult acne, black heads and white heads on my face, I needed something to detox my skin on my face without the harsh chemicals and peels. I heard about the bentonite clay and how wonderful it is for skin. I tried this and noticed a change in my skin. This bentonite clay really does detox my skin and I have noticed the blackheads, whiteheads and acne going away! After using the clay my skin feels so clean and so much softer. I recommend everyone men and women to use this and detox your skin on your face. It really does help with your complex and how you feel in your skin. My husband was somewhat stand offish when I wanted to use this on his skin, after he used it and notice a change, he asks me when will we do the clay mask again. His pores were big and had skin damage from the sun from when he was a truck driver. Now his pores a smaller, his skin looks lighter and clean.</li>
    <li> The internet seems to be all the buzz about healing clays so I was excited to review this product to try it for myself and give my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a 16 oz container of powder and with the fact that it suggests 3 parts clay to 1 part water, this is going to last quite some time and is a good buy for the Amazon price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very interested in trying this as a &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; because I have skin that can be oily at times and dry at other times.  I mixed the appropriate amount up in a disposable bowl and applied it to my face.  I jumped in the bathtub then and washed it off of my face about 25 minutes later.  My skin felt so smooth and nice that I couldn&#x27;t believe it; it felt like I had already put lotion on it.  Even when I woke up the next morning, my face didn&#x27;t feel all icky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that there is no smell to this product and that it&#x27;s all natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to try this out next summer, on bug bites.  I spend a lot of time at the lakes and am hopeful that this is going to help with mosquito bites as mentioned on the packaging.  This seems to have multiple purposes so I will continue to find new ways of using it!</li>
    <li> Leaves face feeling amazingly soft and smooth. I really feel my face tightening up when I use this :)</li>
    <li> I am personally always drawn to Indian products. I have some indian in my family. I know they use some of the old folk ways to take care of themselves. This is a powder healing clay. What does that mean to you. If you want to use it on your face you need to use 3 parts of water to 1 part of the powder and then blend into a nice paste. I then applied it to my face with my finger but you could use a brush. It is known when applying it with a brush it can relax you. After you have applied it wait 20 mins for it to full work or if you have some sensitive skin do it 5 or 10 mins. I had no problems and used it for the full 20 mins. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! Once the 20 mins were up I used a warm wash cloth and water to take it off. Now what is intriguing me. Is you could mix up like you were for your face but double the batch in a nice clean bowl and apply to your feet. If you do that then i would cover it with saran wrap. That way it keeps the moisture in and heat too. I will be using this again. After I used this my face felt refresh and had a glow about it. As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Indian Healing Clay can be used as a face mask as well as a foot soak. The magic behind it, is removing toxins and impurities from your skin. Mixing a small amount to create the mask is simple and quick, as is application. Let it sit for a bit, rinse clean and enjoy gorgeous skin! I plan to keep some on hand all the time, as you can also use it to help relieve insect bites and stings!! Deep pore cleansing and acne treatment are also great benefits of using Indian Healing Clay</li>
    <li> I have used multiple mask and this is my new favorite. I tried it as directed with water but did not really think one way or the other. My daughter suggested using with one part Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar and two parts water as she uses it this way. I of course did not have this brand on hand and used what I had. Again I really did not care one way or the other. I ordered a bottle of Bragg&amp;#34;s Vinegar and the third time is the charm.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Not lverdrying, ill sometimes use it as a spot on treatment and I do think it speeds healing.</li>
    <li> I am a skincare junkie, and I have used MANY types of facial clay mask type of products over the years. I was very excited to try this one out because I had yet to find a clay mask that really worked well for my skin, and that didn&#x27;t stink to high heaven. I have used this Indian Healing Clay a couple times now, and I feel I can give my true honest thoughts with everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really surprised when this arrived and I opened it to see that this comes in powder form. I have never had a clay mask come like that. With this, you mix 1 part clay with 3 parts water. I absolutely love this idea because I have had numerous clay masks arrive dry, or dry out within a few uses. Some will also start to go rancid, and become icky. With this, I can take out the amount I want to use, and use it right there on the spot. It won&#x27;t dry out, and it won&#x27;t go bad on me before I can use up the jar. This to be is a genius idea. The next factor that I like is that the natural scent of this clay isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as others I have used in the past. This one does have a natural type of scent, but nothing offensive. And finally I really like just how soft this clay leaves my skin feel. Clean, fresh, moisturized, and fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a good amount of time to get the mixture at the right consistency. I followed the directions perfectly, and even used a table spoon measure to evenly mix the parts. 1 part clay to 3 parts water. Simple. However each time the clay just didn&#x27;t come together quite right, and I&#x27;d have to start over. It was always too dry, so then I&#x27;d add a tiny bit of water, and I couldn&#x27;t for the life of me get the water to absorb and thin it out. Finally after 5 attempts I got a decent thickness, and was able to use it. I think this takes a bit of trial and error to know just exactly how much to mix together to make it just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, I really do like this. Compared to other clay face products, this has to be in my top 10. By far one of the best clay masks I have used thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.ar one of the best clay masks I have used thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> Sooo wonderful for even the most sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Its soothing and tightening.  I&#x27;m really enjoying all the many uses for this!</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing.  It leaves my face feeling super clean.  I usually put the container in warm water for a few minutes because sometimes it feels super cold going on. I always feel like I&#x27;ve been to a 5-star spa after using this product.</li>
    <li> I received my clay with super fast shipping, it was well packaged and exceeded my expectations. I am very satisfied with my purchase. I am so satisfied that I would love to try any other products if available in this line. I am in my 50&#x27;s but I had a horrible breakout of cystic acne after using a high end anti-aging and skin care regime bought from a home shopping show. The breakout was so bad that I was embarrassed to go out in public-I actually canceled a job interview as I felt my appearance could be detrimental to my getting hired. Thankfully the combination of stopping that other product and using my clay has been beneficial, and I am no longer ashamed to go out in public! I first used the healing clay the day I received it. As it dried I felt a tingling sensation which I appreciated as I knew it was working its magic. When I rinsed it off my skin felt so firm, smooth and clean. I noticed improvement in my skin condition that very day. It has been 5 days now and my acne is almost completely gone, and with no further eruptions of new cysts. I plan to continue to use this on a maintenance basis as I love the way my skin feels after a treatment. I wish that this would have been available to me back when I was a teenager, and I recommend this for anyone suffering from acne. I highly recommend this product. It is inexpensive and did more for me in one treatment than any high end expensive product ever did.Love it-I am a fan and I will be going into the rescheduled job interview this week with my head held high!</li>
    <li> Makes a great mask, leaves skin feeling tight and smooth</li>
    <li> So I tried this on my brother&#x27;s head and he said his scalp feels clean and it does not itch.  This morning I tried this on my face and so far my face looks and feel softer. I will see how my acne prone, oily, sensitive responds in the coming days.</li>
    <li> A little hard to mix by shaking. I used my hand held  Cuisenart to get it smooth. Clay works well as a face and body mask</li>
    <li> leaves me with glowing skin!! :)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Works as described. Makes my face feel clean and soft. I don&#x27;t have that many problems with my skin except some acne scarring on my cheeks and that seems to be fading. I&#x27;m also using doterra brand frankincense mixed with fractionated coconut oil after I wash my face.</li>
    <li> after using this a couple times. My face looks smoother, you can&#x27;t see my pores as much and my face is practically glowing. I have a couple of small scars on my face and this has made them less noticeable. It also works great on cuts. I scraped my arm pretty good the other day. It was scraped raw and I put some of this on it and it looks 100% better. I thought about going to the hospital for stiches. Something like that could take weeks to heal and with 1 application it&#x27;s almost healed. When I opened it I noticed it was a powder that you mix with water. Which is great because you can make up any amount you want just add water. I would reccommend this to every one. I think it is truly amazing. 1 jar will last you a long time. It&#x27;s very inexpensive for the quantity you get and you will thank yourself for buying it. I just turned 50yrs 2 weeks ago and when I went out today after using it twice. my close friend noticed my face looked firmer, almost no lines around my eyes and lips and asked me where she could get herself some of that. she saw me 10 days ago and then today and she could not believe the difference. TRY IT!!!!:-):-)</li>
    <li> This one works so much better than the Aztec one that they also sell on Amazon. However, it does get really chunky and the powder doesn&#x27;t fully becomes fine mud. Otherwise, the product itself displays very nice results.</li>
    <li> I have never used a product like this before and was amazed just how smooth my skin felt after using the Indian Healing Clay. I&#x27;ve only used it the one time, but could already feel the difference. I&#x27;m pretty sure it will shrink pores, but I need to use it more. I would highly recommend this product based on how my face felt after washing the clay off. I love it!</li>
    <li> I use this at night as a facial mask to deep clean my pores. As I have gotten older my pores look larger, since using this they look smaller and my face looks amazing. I was given this product to review for an honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product for my face for some time. I have very sensitive skin. Did not have any problems and skin is nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I am always a little nervous to try new products as my skin can be sensitive but I have heard alot about this product and wanted to try it especially after reading reviews and researching the product and it&#x27;s ingredients. Luckily I was aware it comes in powder form so was careful to open. After mixing with water I applied it to my face I only kept it on 10 minutes the first time just to be sure as I was taking it off in a word wow it felt amazing. You can truly feel the difference. I have since left it on for 30 minutes I find it hard not to make faces and keep still while on as I have 3 kiddos but still came off well and felt amazing. There are many uses for this product which makes it even more appealing. Love love love it</li>
    <li> Arrived quick, I am happy with this product, so far it has my face feeling soft and lovely  and  yes i just to it off with ease, usually I&#x27;m not fond of using the new products on my face because of my sensitive skin I took a gamble with this product and it turns out to be very good, I definitely recommend this product! so far I give it 5 starsÂ </li>
    <li> Where do I begin?  OK well we decided to do another spa day at my moms..... I mixed this up and we applied it to our faces&#x27;.  Then we waited.  Now I have very sensitive skin so I was careful.  We left it on as directions say and then rinsed.  I was a little pink wen done rinsing, but that went away quick and y face felt great!!!!  My mom likes it so much she wants to do every week....lol.  I said yes of course.  Thank you so much.  Not only does this mask work great but I get quality time with mom too!!!</li>
    <li> Just like everyone else I&#x27;m happy with this product. I found it to really feel like it was doing something when I used it. I don&#x27;t really have problem skin or sensitive skin but I like to do a mask every now and then just because. I used this and really enjoyed the effects. It was not over drying to my skin and it dried in a reasonable amount of time so I didn&#x27;t feel like it took all day while I hid in my room. There is also so much in this container that I feel like it is going to last a really long time. One more thing I loved was the scooper in the container! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I really did like this product! It made my skin feel ALOT smoother after!! The only things I disliked about it was how tight it makes your face feel during the application and my skin was pretty dry afterwards. Other then that I will definitely use it again! The jar is pretty big which is great because you get many uses out of it!</li>
    <li> Satisfied! Good product and service! Thanks</li>
    <li> This item was purchased using a discount/coupon as I jumped at the chance to try this product. I have always heard of this clay but I I was so afraid of buying it, in case Im that one person it does not work for. As part of the Natural Hair Community clays have become the one number source of deep conditioning. I found a recipe on one of the hair boards and prepared as instructed. DO NOT USE METAL TO PREP THIS CLAY. I applied as I would a color from a mixing bowl, waited 30 mins, and rinsed with warm water. My hair is thick and tangles easily; however this left my hair feeling clean and soft.</li>
    <li> Product is okay and serves it purpose.</li>
    <li> I have heard so much god abut this clay that I was excited to get a good deal on it for review! I have been experiencing severe breakouts on my face. After using this, my breakouts are well under control and my skin is so smooth! I don&#x27;t think I have EVER had another mask make my skin so smooth. It was a little more to use it than anything I have tried in the past since it is powder and has to be mixed, but it is absolutely something I will use over and over again.</li>
    <li> The reviews for this item was great. I&#x27;ve only tried it once, but noticed that it did leave my skin feeling really soft. My skin didn&#x27;t have any negative reactions and I will continue to add this mask into my weekly regiment.</li>
    <li> I love this clay! Since receiving a jar of this I have been reading and researching the different ways it can be used... holy mackerel!! This is a do-it-all kind of clay! It can be used in so many ways. For the body, for the garden, for plants and trees... I have to remember this in the Spring! I mixed up a small amount into a paste and applied it to my hands because they have been dry, my cuticles were cracked and split and so were my nails. After just two times they feel so much better, softer and my cuticles looks much better. Now I know why mud baths were so popular in some cultures! I must feel great to submerge up to your neck and  just soak for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I love the size too. it doesn&#x27;t take much for most applications and uses so 16 ounces will go a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this product. After using this my skin was my smoother and it opened up my poors so I could better clean out the dirt. This comes as a powder so you must mix with water to create a paste to apply on desired area.</li>
    <li> I am a face mask junkie. You name it and I have it. Well this is one product I have heard So much about for acne prone skin. I researched the two different kinds of the bentonite clays. Then on you tube I saw a Dermatologist use the sodium bentonite instead of the calcium. For acne patients she felt she got better results with the sodium bentonite. Ok the first time I mixed this was an epic fail. Then the next time I used it I read the directions on the package which I didn&#x27;t before and I got my mask. I did use apple cider vinegar with mine. My results after two masks now are amazing. My skin is smooth soft supple and most importantly my acne has disappeared!! The first time I had a minor breakout. Which I believe that the clay brought the clogged pores to the suface. Now Wow!! I can&#x27;t wait to use my mask tonight. My skin is just getting better. I have never used the calcium bentonite and never will as my personal results with this clay are amazing!! I recommend this to anyone who has acne uneven skin tone etc. I highly recommend you use the apple cider vinegar. It smells like you are putting vinegrette on your face but the results are stunning!! This is my new best friend. I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long to try it. I cant wait to try it as a hair mask. This will forever be in my beauty routine. I am so enthusiastic about this product that two of my best friends bought it!!</li>
    <li> I have not had this very long but so far am pleased with it. I&#x27;ve used it in cosmetics and as a facial mask and it&#x27;s worked very well.</li>
    <li> Better than jIexpected, great product</li>
    <li> This stuff is seriously amazing. My skin feels awesome!</li>
    <li> Great love how it cleans pores.</li>
    <li> I live in this now. I use it weekly. Helps my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this clay for my face mask go to for years. I also use another brand that is for internal use as well. Its awesome!! People with oily skin or acne try mixing with apple cider vinegar. It makes your face a little red after, but it literally shrinks pores and your skin will never look or feel better!!! I love Anything that I can use that isn&#x27;t made in a lab.</li>
    <li> This clay feels like wet clay when you put it on, almost like a raw egg. It is a different feeling at first, but it hardens up quite nicely, after wards I feel like  I got out of some luxury spa treatment! My skin looks and feels radiant, The only thing I can say that I had trouble with was mixing the right amount of powder to water, I think the directions could be clearer. I still had clumps in mine, even after altering it a few times. I was close to bringing out my hand mixer! Sample received for review.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say if this has made my face much clearer or not, but I do like it.  I have gotten my boyfriend to like them as well.  The most that I like about it, is that it is all natural.  I am not putting some chemicals on my face.  Plus a little of this clay will go a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a few times and I believe it&#x27;s been helping purge my skin by bringing all the junk underneath to the surface. It also helps with acne that is already at the surface decreas in size or helps elevate redness.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It fixed the random dry spots on my face. Don&#x27;t leave it on to long I did that and it made my face really red but went away quickly.</li>
    <li> I love using products that are natural and from the earth. That was definitely something that struck me when I saw the promotion for this, I knew I had to get some. I am so glad I did too. I use it 2x a week, because if I were to use it more I&#x27;m afraid I would dry my skin out. In my opinion it took me a few times and tries to finally get it to the correct consistency for my satisfaction. I like to use it on my legs, feet and my face for cleansing/detox purposes. In my experience it&#x27;s also good to use for removing splinters, blemishes, and anything that would need to be drawn out of the skin. I am happy with this product and it&#x27;s many uses. I&#x27;m hoping to use it this summer to help soothe sunburn, I&#x27;m guessing/hoping it will be a cooling affect and assisting with drawing out the heat.</li>
    <li> This jar is HUGE and a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  First I got it the next day after I ordered it so super fast shipping.  Second it makes your face feel amazing after you use it.  Paid to test and Review it.</li>
    <li> I love this clay, A new way to stay rejuvenated after a hard work day. A little goes a long way. My concoction is 1 tsp of clay+ 3 tsp of water (can be 4 drops). It is enough for my face and neck. It&#x27;s supposed to detox your skin in someway. Also, I would help to narrow spores, noticeable in 2-3 uses. I do this mask about 2 times/week...really relaxing. I purchased this product at promotional cost and will again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of weeks now and I really like it. It&#x27;s a pretty good sized container. I use it as a face mask. After the first use I could tell a big difference in pore size and blemish reduction. You may go through a tiny outbreak afterwards but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s pulling out all your toxins to the surface. This will go away and you&#x27;ll be left with great skin :)</li>
    <li> I am a senior citizen.  I have always taken great care with my skin.  This is a SUPER product.  Gives me very smooth soft skin.  Pores are so less visible!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but I liked it. It didn&#x27;t have a bad smell, it started drying in less than 10 minutes and it was easy to wash off. I will update once I&#x27;ve used it more!</li>
    <li> I sprinkle this in my bath, use it as a face mask, put it on bug bites. effective and natural. I love this clay</li>
    <li> This is a fairly large tun chalked full of pure powdered bentonite clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening it I was surprised to find how full it really was and that it was a dry powder (so beware when opening to tap it first and open on flat surface to avoid spilling)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wet my face and made the powder into a paste and applied. It&#x27;s very silky soft and does not burn or smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my face felt really clean and soft. I&#x27;d recommend this product to friends and family&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a promotional discount on this product, however, my reviews are always honest and unbiased regardless of price I paid.</li>
    <li> This is a powdered clay so it is a little tricky to mix it yourself.  It does help heal skin and it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. Makes good facial masks.</li>
    <li> Works great. I have sensitive skin so I don&#x27;t leave it on as long as recommended.</li>
    <li> Works surprisingly well,very good product</li>
    <li> my face has been getting clear and smoother since i started using it</li>
    <li> This clay is superb. I really did notice my pores tighter and skin smoother. Beautiful. I only had to change water proportions, as instructions write 1:3 ratio (1 tsp clay and 3 of water), but that was like wet concrete, impossible to steer, let alone smear on my face, so I added 6-7 tsp&#x27;s of water to get smearable paste, and I also added few drops of Vit E. 20 min later washed off with luke warm water. Magic :). A little goes a long way - 1 tsp and that much water to dissolve it will make a lot of paste. My hands got a mask, too. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help clean and shrink my pores. It takes a bit of practice to mix it to the proper consistency, but goes on nicely and seems to really pull the junk out of pores while tightening skin. I use it about once a week and make sure to use a good moisturizer immediately afterward.</li>
    <li> This stuff is messy but amazing. My son had a terrible skin condition on his arm, chest, back and face from time he was 13 he just turned 18 and it has never let up. Nothing worked on his body and prescriptions worked just a little on his face. We tried dermatologist and holistic docs and treatments. After a month of 2-3 times a week treatments with the clay his chest and back are 90% clear and his face is clear.  He uses African black soap everyday...I bought the clay and soap at the same time.  It&#x27;s amazing stuff! My teen daughter and I use the soap and clay and our skin has never felt softer. I used it to clear poison ivy on my husband too. Usually he requires cortisone to clear that up.</li>
    <li> My skin feels great as soon as I put it on...hate 2 have 2 wait a whole week b4 I use again</li>
    <li> I did as directed and used 3 parts water to 1 part clay in a plastic bowl and plasic measuring spoon.  It took a bit of mixing but finally mixed in.  lol I felt like a kid making mudpies.  Once that was done I applied as a facial.  I left it on for 20 minutes as directed and could feel the tightening and toning.  i had it a bit thick in some spots so I was waving a magazine at my face and man did it feel COLD.  Can just imagine how soothing this would be on a hot summer day and cant wait to try it then.  I havent tried the bath yet, but cant wait to do so.  I think that&#x27;ll be great in the summer as well!  The jar is a nice size (1 pound) and will go a long way.  I mixed up a bit too much for the facial and stored it, but have not had opportunity to try it on a burn or boil yet.  I think w/the way it cools it would be very soothing on burns.  Washing off was a bit of a chore but once it was off my skin felt amazing.  All of that dry winter skin that had been flaking for months was gone.  My poors were smaller and my face felt so soft and clean.</li>
    <li> Cleansing,  tightening, rejuvenating.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I use it as a facial pack or like a cleanser.  It works wonders on my sensitive acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to follow the instruction and don&#x27;t leave it on too long if you have a super sensitive skin. I usually use it as a cleanser and leave a thin  layer on for about five minutes and wash it out. And it still works great.</li>
    <li> I have had this for 3 days and I LOVE IT!! I read a lot of people saying its hard to mix with water, use apple cider vinegar with it, its fantastic!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used clay before and the INDIAN HEALING CLAY is one of the best on the market - very pleased with the quality.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical when I purchased this but it really is fantastic.  I&#x27;m not a purist or super hippy, just a regular woman/mom from middle-class America.  Used it as a facial mask and my face felt GREAT!  Really great!  I&#x27;ve tried other clay masks and they don&#x27;t compare.  Also decided to try it for treating burns and my SUPER skeptical husband couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked.  He thought I had lost my mind when I offered it to him for a burn on his hand.  Fifteen minutes later, he was sold.  Days later he was still amazed that the pain had not returned, no blistering.  So, for regular skincare and minor emergencies, I can&#x27;t say enough about this clay!  I also appreciate that this comes from the USA!  P.S. don&#x27;t use metal to stir this up.  I didn&#x27;t realize that the first time around.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product once but was very impressed from the first time. It&#x27;s easy to mix and was gentle enough on my sensitive skin (I left it on half time as instructed on the pot). My skin immediately looked radiant and refreshed after use. Will definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Really great stuff! My son is a mosquito magnet and this stuff healed his legs right up! I was amazed how fast the bites shrank and was so much better after one use. I will defiantly buy it again...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any differences, rather good or bad,  will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers an mixed mine in a ziplock bag, this way I can make a good size batch to use for a couple of weeks. It works really well on blackheads and leaves your skin feeling so smooth.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly &amp; safely.  Haven&#x27;t had it long, but think I&#x27;m really going to like it.  My skin feels and looks so much cleaner  after wearing this mask.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll just keep getting better with longer use.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my skin softâ™¡&lt;br /&gt;Just be cautious not to clog your sink, it is clay after all.</li>
    <li> This is a finely milled grey powder/clay.  One uses it once a week and leaves it on for 20 minutes.  I have found it to be quite soothing.  As, it is below freezing here, I haven&#x27;t gotten to try it on insect bites, but I sure wish I had had it when I was in Ecuador.  (loads of mosquito bites).  I appreciate that it is derived from the US and has no additives.  I recommend this product.  sample</li>
    <li> I was a little surprised that this was a powder when I opened it. I didn&#x27;t realize that and obviously didn&#x27;t read it. I actually like tha tit is a powder cause I can make it as thick or thin as I desire. IT feels great on my face when I apply it and gives me a slight cooling sensation. And just to get that few minutes of relaxation is a needed thing for me. No one wants to bother me when I have my mask on. I especially like to use it for spot acne treatments. This is a secret I have always used clay masks for. It works great to pull out the yucky impurities and helps with healing my skin much faster than it would have been without using it. I actually mixed a small amount in a small container where I can open it and use it as spot treating . It is great cause I don&#x27;t have to worry about it drying out or loosing it&#x27;s efficacy. I was sent this for reciew, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions.</li>
    <li> I am loving my new face mask. I have been wearing it every night before bed. My pores seem to shrink and tighten even more after every use. This mask is well worth the money because there is a ton of it. You don&#x27;t need that much to make a good mask.</li>
    <li> I am usually one who likes to try out new products, but I do become skeptical when it comes to using it on my face. I first began using it on a foot spa type treatment and am very pleased with the results. A lot of illnesses and germs are actually spread through your feet believe it or not. So, I gave this a try and was very impressed with how well it felt during and after. So I gave it a try on my face. I didn&#x27;t have any unusual breakouts and my face felt so clear and clean. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to try out the healing clay!</li>
    <li> it will make your face smooth we put it on everyone in the house the night we got it, and few of them liked it</li>
    <li> Very messy to use the powder.</li>
    <li> Love the way your skin feels. .pretty fast shipping. . Just have to play with mixing</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:37529a914bdad689b9524296089b485a]] I have been wanting to try Bentonite clay powder for quite some time, so when given the opportunity to try the Majestic Pure Indian Healing Clay I jumped on the chance! With so many uses this product is a great value and something I will forever have in my home from this point forward! First of all I tried the clay on my face...I mixed one part clay powder and three parts water together in a bowl ( do not use metal spoons or bowls ) and realized a little goes a long way, though so far the leftovers have stored well in a jar! I applied it my face and left it on for around ten minutes. My skin is super sensitive so I didn&#x27;t leave it on the twenty minutes recommended. The mask became tight as it dried and a teeny bit uncomfy, but not too bad! I washed it off after the ten minutes and while I had a bit of a red face ( it wasn&#x27;t surprising...I have rosacea and just about everything makes my face red. ) but my skin felt super smooth and very clean! My pores looked much smaller and clean! It helped my rosacea bumps shrink in size and look and feel so much better! After this I applied a bit of fractionated coconut oil also from Majestic Pure! It re-hydrated my face and made it feel very nice after both treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying the clay on my face, I decided to give it a go on my infected super sore finger...I applied the clay, let it dry and left it on for around 20 min and washed it off, I did this twice in a day and the next day I woke up with my finger feeling SO much better and miraculously starting to heal at a rapid rate! I am very impressed with this and am super excited to have it on hand when the next booboo, sting, bite or boil happens! I am absolutely in love with this product and am so glad that I was able to try it out !</li>
    <li> Awesome product. My skin is noticeably smoother and firmer.</li>
    <li> This product has a myriad of uses, from shrinking pores on your face, to treating boils and acne. It comes in powder form and a little goes a long way. This product will last several months. Loving how soft the mask makes my face feel after applying and easily washing off! I received a great deal to try this product to share my honest and unbiased opinion, and am so glad I did! I am amazed at the the different uses this clay provides.</li>
    <li> i love this as a face mask! works great!</li>
    <li> I could see improvement after couple of uses</li>
    <li> Delivered just as promised at a great price too ðŸ™Œ</li>
    <li> This product is awesome...you don&#x27;t need a lot of it, I use a little less than the recommendation and you have to give it time to work...a little more than 20 minutes. I use it every Saturday morning; my skin feels awesome!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It comes in powered form and you have to add water. To make it a paste. Then you can put it on your face. A thin layer should be good enough. I made the silly mistake and put a thick layer On my face. So don&#x27;t do that. Lol</li>
    <li> I think bentonite  Indian healing clay is an excellent product . I love using it as a mask on my face , you can feel it working tightens the skin. when u wash off the mask your face feels nice and clean and has a brighter look to it.</li>
    <li> I am a 26 year old female with sensitive and I oily skin on my t-zone area. I suffer from the occasional breakouts but my biggest problem are my blackheads and clogged pores. I have blackheads/clogged pores all over my face, but the worst are on my nose and chin. When I began this product I was not satisfied. I used it once a week and followed the directions with 3 part water and 1 part clay (I do tablespoons).  I saw no improvement for a month. I didnt want to waste a whole tub of clay, so I did some research. I had found a few people who mix the clay with apple cider vinegar for a face mask, and I just happened to have a bottle in the cupboard so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try.&lt;br /&gt;After one use of the apple cider mask l saw results! Now, all my blackheads aren&#x27;t completely gone, however majority of them are, especially the ones on my nose! Most of my pores look smaller and most are unclogged, and my face has an all around glow.&lt;br /&gt;Advice for if you try the cider mask: your eyes might get watery and irritated due to the strong odor. Almost like cutting an onion, so be careful when applying around your eye area. And your face will be red and feel tight (if you have sensitive skin) after you wash the mask off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my clay mask routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash face with warm water, just water. This is so my pores will open.&lt;br /&gt;Mix 1 tablespoon of clay with 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and 1 part water in a tupperware bowl with lid.&lt;br /&gt;Apply lid and shake bowl till clay and liquid are mixed completely.&lt;br /&gt;Apply to face and let dry.&lt;br /&gt;Wash off with warm water, or cold.&lt;br /&gt;Pat dry and use witch hazel toner.&lt;br /&gt;I use benzoyl peroxide lotion to prevent future breakouts. It dries out my face so then I apply jergens after.</li>
    <li> My face feels super clean after I use this clay for a deep facial cleanse.</li>
</ol>
