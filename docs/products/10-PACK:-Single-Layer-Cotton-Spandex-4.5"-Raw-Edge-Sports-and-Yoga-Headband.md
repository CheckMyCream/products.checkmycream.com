      <li>Could also see these working great to wash your face, run, cycle, etc.</li>
      <li>Great value</li>
      <li>These aren&#x27;t great quality.</li>
      <li>Colors are great.</li>
      <li>These work great as sweatbands.  </li>
      <li>I love these things!!</li>
      <li>They fit well, wash up perfectly, and are very comfortable and light-weight.</li>
      <li>Love them!</li>
      <li>I like the colors and was really pleased with the price!</li>
      <li>Honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to be this way.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping they stay this good after I wash them :)</li>
      <li>Love these for working out or washing my face.</li>
      <li>For the most part they stay put when running.</li>
      <li>I guess I should have read the description a bit better.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Love the colors, but the band roll up after you put it on.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re ok.</li>
      <li>I love love LOVE these!&lt;br /&gt;Okay</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>They are SUPER cute too if you just want to wear them during the day and they wash up nice.</li>
      <li>most importantly, I have a big head, so shopping for headbands is not always easy, so when I put these on they fit PERFECTLY!</li>
      <li>LOVE THE VCOLOR AND THE FIT.</li>
      <li>They fit well and stay in place.</li>
      <li>I wear it everyday they are awesome</li>
      <li>These are just cheap pieces of t shirt material cut into headband strips.</li>
      <li>They look fabulous.</li>
      <li>and I can honestly say I am very surprised</li>
      <li>Colors are cute, and they are pretty wide, I really liked that</li>
      <li>THEY ARE VERY WELL MADE AND COMFORTABLE.</li>
      <li>These are colorful, but they&#x27;re thin and not the best quality.</li>
      <li>I think they were definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>Probably best suited for a curly haired individual but my hair is smooth and (especially after working out) gets greasy quick, especially in my bangs area.</li>
      <li>But other than that the product is good</li>
      <li>These bands are are the right size and variety colors enable me to match with attire enhance my appearance</li>
      <li>They also slip right out of my hair.</li>
      <li>I just hang dry mine and they still look good as new!</li>
      <li>I am extremely pleased, I don&#x27;t go out of my way usually to leave reviews but these headbands are worth it :-)</li>
      <li>Would rotate them so they get washed regularly - make-up and sweat will inevitably deteriorate these, but easy and cost effective to replace every 6 months to year, depending on use.  </li>
      <li>I like the look and the edges on this product; they&#x27;re exactly as described in the title.</li>
      <li>Bought these for hot yoga to keep the sweat off my face.  </li>
      <li>I will defiantly be ordering more in the future!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
      <li>, so first of all, I received them a day after I ordered them, so kuddos for the shipping!&lt;br</li>
      <li>main reason I purchased these was because I also sweat A LOT, and after I was done with my workout, the headband absorbed all the sweat (yay)</li>
      <li>I like these headbands but they are a bit on the large side.</li>
      <li>Got these as a gift from a very considerate person, but they&#x27;re just not for me.</li>
      <li>They also won&#x27;t really stay in place when my hair is up or when I am sleeping.</li>
      <li>the whole time.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The quality of the fabric leaves a little be desired (they are really thin, kind of look cut off funny) but they really do hold my hair back incredibly well.</li>
      <li>Cute color combos and boyfriend loves the black one.  </li>
      <li>I spent most of my yoga practice refixing my hair after this slipped and slid off my head completely and also requires lots of fiddling with even when I&#x27;m seated at my desk.</li>
      <li>I use mine mainly just for working out.</li>
      <li>and they need to be sewn to make them the normal size of a head band.</li>
      <li>Great for the gym or casual</li>
      <li>And while it is a t-shirt material, again as described, I&#x27;ve been wearing the same one for about 2 weeks now, almost every day for several hours and the elasticity is staying strong and the material is holding up well.</li>
      <li>They are very wide and look cheap</li>
      <li>They work fine for when I am washing my face but fall off when ever I lay down with them on.</li>
      <li>I could do that with the sleeves of an old shirt!</li>
      <li>Look a little cheap</li>
      <li>She loves the soft feel on her head while working out.</li>
      <li>I really thought that these would fall off of my head based on the mixed reviews.</li>
      <li>Good colors really tight though and wide wish it was double and not so big</li>
      <li>/&gt;*I do want to note though, I have a really small head and these fit snug on me</li>
      <li>They stay in place much better than thin elastic headbands.</li>

<li> /&gt;*I do want to note though, I have a really small head and these fit snug on me</li>
<li> They stay in place much better than thin elastic headbands.</li>
<li> I feel like a peasant woman when I wear it flat.</li>
<li> , I did not get no headache from being on too long, I did my work-out after an hour or so wearing them and it stayed in place</li>
<li> The big wide look is not for me, I can&#x27;t make it work.</li>
<li> I won&#x27;t be using these for a long time, but for the price I can see this purchase paying for itself if you have curly or textured hair as they seem durable with plenty of stretch.</li>
<li> They are easily adjustable to be wide or thin headbands, and soak up sweat when you are working out!</li>
<li> Trust me, I ALWAYS have problems with headbands just sliding off the back of my head, and these headbands stayed on for an entire half marathon run.</li>
<li> i open them and they are like 5 inches wide!</li>
<li> Definitely will buy again in the other color scheme.</li>
<li> They are not only a little loose but very very wide.</li>
<li> My wife said they do not fit as they are supposed to, won&#x27;t stay in place on her head and are pretty useless.</li>
<li> Also, I feel like I have an average sized head</li>
<li> Super thin, no seams, poor material and construction.</li>
<li> The only thing is that the fabric is a little thin.</li>
<li> Here&#x27;s the key - they&#x27;re wide enough to stay on your head, foldover or scrunch, as you like, and don&#x27;t have that annoying silicone bead/band to make it grippy -</li>
<li> Waste of money!</li>
<li> too - yoga studio sells a narrower name brand version for 2.99 a pop - hard to argue with the value here.  </li>
<li> Horrible, I donated them, maybe someone out there will enjoy it.  </li>
<li> These have yet to fail me!</li>
<li> Disappointed in this product.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s what it does on my head to so annoying.</li>
<li> Also I hate how it looks if its not folded over three times.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These are colorful, but they&#x27;re thin and not the best quality.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting...They are basically just cut pieces of fabric, I could have done this myself.  But still they worked for what I needed them for, (working out).  Nothing fancy but for the price they worked.</li>
    <li> Love them! For the most part they stay put when running.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok. Look a little cheap but they work.</li>
    <li> Good colors really tight though and wide wish it was double and not so big</li>
    <li> These are just cheap pieces of t shirt material cut into headband strips. My wife said they do not fit as they are supposed to, won&#x27;t stay in place on her head and are pretty useless. She is using them as sweat rags in the gym instead of headbands.</li>
    <li> Piece of garbage! No decorations around the corners. It&#x27;s just a piece of clothing skit in piece! I could do that with the sleeves of an old shirt! Wanted to give it a zero but it&#x27;s not a choice!</li>
    <li> I like the look and the edges on this product; they&#x27;re exactly as described in the title. And while it is a t-shirt material, again as described, I&#x27;ve been wearing the same one for about 2 weeks now, almost every day for several hours and the elasticity is staying strong and the material is holding up well. I think they were definitely worth the price. Great for the gym or casual outfits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I do want to note though, I have a really small head and these fit snug on me so I would be nervous ordering if your head is on the larger side.</li>
    <li> I needed a wider headband. These did the trick! They keep the hair out of my face.</li>
    <li> These work great as sweatbands.  They fit well, wash up perfectly, and are very comfortable and light-weight.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE VCOLOR AND THE FIT. THEY ARE VERY WELL MADE AND COMFORTABLE. GOD BLESS AND TRY THEM.</li>
    <li> Honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to be this way. I feel like I got fabric to sew myself and make it into a headband. If you look closely in the picture you can see it rolls. That&#x27;s what it does on my head to so annoying.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price you pay for them. The only thing is that the fabric is a little thin. But other than that the product is good</li>
    <li> I guess I should have read the description a bit better. They are unfinished. i open them and they are like 5 inches wide! Unfinished edges. I do not like them. and they need to be sewn to make them the normal size of a head band. I</li>
    <li> I like these headbands but they are a bit on the large side. They are not only a little loose but very very wide. I always have to fold them when as I put them on. They also won&#x27;t really stay in place when my hair is up or when I am sleeping. I got these to keep my hair off my face for when I am washing it or sleeping. They work fine for when I am washing my face but fall off when ever I lay down with them on.</li>
    <li> They fit well and stay in place. I like the colors and was really pleased with the price! I like the bigger width to keep sweat off my face too.</li>
    <li> they work but you have to keep them pulled low on your brow or they slide back into your pile of hair!</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE these!&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so first of all, I received them a day after I ordered them, so kuddos for the shipping!&lt;br /&gt;The Colors are cute, and they are pretty wide, I really liked that&lt;br /&gt;BUT most importantly, I have a big head, so shopping for headbands is not always easy, so when I put these on they fit PERFECTLY! that was awesome, so I decided to leave the headband on for an hour to see how comfy they&#x27;d be and I can honestly say I am very surprised, I did not get no headache from being on too long, I did my work-out after an hour or so wearing them and it stayed in place the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I purchased these was because I also sweat A LOT, and after I was done with my workout, the headband absorbed all the sweat (yay) I am extremely pleased, I don&#x27;t go out of my way usually to leave reviews but these headbands are worth it :-) thank you to the seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m hoping they stay this good after I wash them :)</li>
    <li> I love these things!! I use mine mainly just for working out. They are easily adjustable to be wide or thin headbands, and soak up sweat when you are working out! I do Shawn T&#x27;s Insanity program, and you sweat a lot! These have yet to fail me! They are SUPER cute too if you just want to wear them during the day and they wash up nice. I just hang dry mine and they still look good as new! I will defiantly be ordering more in the future!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I have been looking for. Tighter headband that allows you to pick your thickness. Stays on well.</li>
    <li> Good headbands, I use them to work out and they stay perfectly. I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. They look fabulous.</li>
    <li> They keep my hair out of my face when I work.</li>
    <li> Love the colors, but the band roll up after you put it on. Have to keep adjusting them.</li>
    <li> I wear it everyday they are awesome</li>
    <li> These bands are are the right size and variety colors enable me to match with attire enhance my appearance</li>
    <li> Horrible, I donated them, maybe someone out there will enjoy it.  Super thin, no seams, poor material and construction.</li>
    <li> These are t-short strips cut and sewn together. The ends are not even finished. They also slip right out of my hair. Disappointed in this product. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> Love these for working out or washing my face. Keeps my hair back and doesn&#x27;t fall off.</li>
    <li> Bought these for hot yoga to keep the sweat off my face.  Works beautifully.  Here&#x27;s the key - they&#x27;re wide enough to stay on your head, foldover or scrunch, as you like, and don&#x27;t have that annoying silicone bead/band to make it grippy - that inevitably causes my headbands to fall off when working out.  Cute color combos and boyfriend loves the black one.  Great value too - yoga studio sells a narrower name brand version for 2.99 a pop - hard to argue with the value here.  Would rotate them so they get washed regularly - make-up and sweat will inevitably deteriorate these, but easy and cost effective to replace every 6 months to year, depending on use.  Could also see these working great to wash your face, run, cycle, etc.</li>
    <li> Got these as a gift from a very considerate person, but they&#x27;re just not for me. Probably best suited for a curly haired individual but my hair is smooth and (especially after working out) gets greasy quick, especially in my bangs area. I spent most of my yoga practice refixing my hair after this slipped and slid off my head completely and also requires lots of fiddling with even when I&#x27;m seated at my desk. Also, I feel like I have an average sized head but the band is way too big and pops out in the back if I don&#x27;t fold it over once or twice unless its sitting on top of my ears  and pulled below my hairline (v. uncomfortable). Also I hate how it looks if its not folded over three times. The big wide look is not for me, I can&#x27;t make it work. I feel like a peasant woman when I wear it flat. I won&#x27;t be using these for a long time, but for the price I can see this purchase paying for itself if you have curly or textured hair as they seem durable with plenty of stretch.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the headbands. They stay in place much better than thin elastic headbands. She loves the soft feel on her head while working out. Colors are great.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t great quality. They are very wide and look cheap</li>
    <li> These are perfect. I really thought that these would fall off of my head based on the mixed reviews. Trust me, I ALWAYS have problems with headbands just sliding off the back of my head, and these headbands stayed on for an entire half marathon run. I love them. The quality of the fabric leaves a little be desired (they are really thin, kind of look cut off funny) but they really do hold my hair back incredibly well. Definitely will buy again in the other color scheme.</li>
