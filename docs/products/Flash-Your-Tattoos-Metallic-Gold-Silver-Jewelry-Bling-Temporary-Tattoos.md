      <li>it&#x27;s totally unnoticeable (until someone compliments them :) )</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; when first applied but after it dries and moves with your skin</li>
      <li>so many different styles!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast, and the gold compliments my golden brown skin..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this product! Great quality and easy to use. Also arrived as scheduled which is not always the case when ordering stuff to Hawaii.</li>
    <li> Really cute! Can&#x27;t wait to wear each and every one- wish I could just where them all at once! Very pleased! Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> WOW!! These temporary tattoos from Satori Loka are just GORGEOUS!!! Seriously. This is temporary art for your body. I love using temporary tattoos because I&#x27;m a wuss when it comes to needles and getting a real tattoo just doesn&#x27;t appeal to me. But with temporary tats, I can have my cake and eat it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And these aren&#x27;t just your run of the mill temporary tattoos either. These are shiny foil and bright colors in Egyptian, turquoise, feather, peacock designs. Honestly, they look like body jewelry when applied. And so easy to use. Just choose the design you want, cut around it, leaving a bit of margin, apply it tattoo down to clean dry skin, press a wet sponge or towel onto the paper backing, wait about thirty seconds to one minute, then gently peel off the paper backing. If you&#x27;ve soaked the paper well enough and long enough, the paper comes away clean and the design stays in place on your skin. Voila! You&#x27;ve got a temporary tattoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they last a pretty good while, too. I can keep mine on for days, enjoying them the whole time, even in the shower. If you need to remove it, that&#x27;s easy too -- just a little baby oil will have the tattoo off in no time. Temporary tattoos are such great fun. I love to share them with my sisters and friends for a tattoo party. This kit is great because it comes with five sheets of beautiful, shiny tattoos. That&#x27;s enough for a bunch of friends to share, or will last you a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and bonus! It also comes with some Indian bindis! Lovely colorful little stick-on jewels to make your body jewelry even more beautiful. I can&#x27;t wait to try these with my new bathing suit this summer!</li>
    <li> So cool and fun to wear. Got tons of compliments!</li>
    <li> These temporary foil tattoos by Satori are very pretty. They are perfect for summertime and are so fashionable. Some of the designs are very unique. I really like the ones that I can wear as jewelry and feel like they add pizzazz to whatever outfit I am wearing. The other thing I like is that there are some tattoos that have turquois colors to them and tattoos from other companies that I have seen were just in gold, silver and black. I am very pleased with the quality of these tattoos and they are so easy to apply. I have had tattoos last for 4 days even after showering several times. Personally I think a couple of the tattoos are rather big but they are all very pretty designs. They are very easy to remove I just put baby oil on a cotton ball and they come off. I did receive this product at a discount to provide an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> LOVE these temp tattoos!</li>
    <li> Beautiful tats!! Shipping was fast, and the gold compliments my golden brown skin.. Love them! So fun for the summer!</li>
    <li> These came packaged very well and the tattoos are gorgeous and look high quality but I&#x27;m currently waiting for an occasion to wear some. As for the bindis, they are very pretty as well but I am not Hindu and I&#x27;m not for cultural appropriation so I&#x27;ll be giving those to my Hindu coworker.</li>
    <li> So pretty an fun. I&#x27;ve researched and bought a number of metallic foil temp tats and in my opinion, these were the best deal and quality. They are easy to apply, and they last a long time (the ones I used so far lasted 3 days including running and showering each day). They also come with 5 jewel bindis that are beautiful!</li>
    <li> Thank you!!  Love the tattoos!!!</li>
    <li> I love them! I&#x27;ve been wearing then on the beach. They&#x27;re so easy to use that even my 7 year old knows how to get them on herself! 😊</li>
    <li> I love these. these are so much fun. I love to wear this in the summer at the beach pool: you won&#x27;t loose these like some jewlery... Super easy and fast transfer, and these last for a pretty long time: at least 3-4 days, it depends where you put them on of course, I put some on on my fingers, because I love nail art and temp tattos are part of my nail looks...of course on the fingers these are faster to come of, since I wash the dishes a lot...I love that these have some pop of color, I am actually saving some of the pretty bracelets ones for summer when I get mt new turquise bikini... Ang you also get a bonus with the tattos - Designer Bindis..which are verry pretty! Actually you can use the foil tattos for nail art as well: just put a base color polish(any color) let it dry, like completely dry and apply fragments of the tattos on the nails as you would on your skin...then just top it with top coat, and cool, easy salon many at home! I received this product at a discounted price in return for my honest and unbaised opinion.</li>
    <li> These are so much fun. The Temporary Tattoos are placed on the foil in a way that makes it easy to cut them apart any way you want. I have had one on my dominant wrist all day and it has not faded or rubbed off, despite the fact that I am constantly rubbing my wrist against my clothes and laptop. I have even gotten it wet and it hasn&#x27;t smudged or faded at all. The sizes that the tattoos come in make is easy to fit any body part you are looking to accentuate.  They are really easy to put on, and move from the foil to the skin quickly, but easily. Most cheap Temporary Tattoos smudge and get a little messed up when transferring them to the skin, but not these ones. They are ideal for anyone looking to add a little fun to your outfit.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased for the purpose of review.</li>
    <li> Hi Y&#x27;all! I&#x27;ve been obsessed with temporary tattoos since I was a kid but haven&#x27;t found adult appropriate, stylish temporary tattoos until now! You guys rock! These are beautiful, high quality, easy to apply and last! The gold/silver combo is perfect for adults! And free bindis! And they will be a perfect gift for birthdays, bachelorette parties, stockings, party favors and more! Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> awesome collection of designs! I didn&#x27;t even know they had more than one collection, but it turns out they also have an Isis and Shakti pack. The feather tribe one is super cool and last a while! I work in a kitchen so sometimes jewelry isn&#x27;t comfortable to wear, but these add a lot of style in a lackluster uniform :) They feel a little...&amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; when first applied but after it dries and moves with your skin it&#x27;s totally unnoticeable (until someone compliments them :) )</li>
    <li> This package has a nice assortment of tattoos perfect for summer festivals or any time you are feeling funky. The quality is the same as the less expensive tattoos, but this pack has cooler designs for sure.</li>
    <li> I have ordered numerous temporary tattoos from other companies before. This company&#x27;s temporary tattoos have the nicest designs, but the least amount of sheets. Most of the others have at least 6 sheets. The colors in this one is very vivid. My niece and son had a field day with them. They tatted themselves and everyone in the house with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> Loved these! They stick well and packaged very nicely! Good price too. I got these because they were prime eligible. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Very cute, grownup way of adding bling to your ensemble without permanently getting inked!  I LOVE that the colors of these tattoos are so Sparkly!  Perfect for this girl who likes gold, silver, bronze and any other colors that are sparkly in nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the wide variety of tattoo patterns available, and I can attest to the fact that these tattoos last for at least 4 days once applied.  Mine would have lasted longer, but my wrist got wet and was itching, and I grabbed a towel to rub the itch.  I rubbed my tattoo away, but I fully admit I was rubbing vigorously since I was itching quite badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bindis that came in this tattoo set are just gorgeous!  I am saving them with a few of the chain links to make a bracelet for a wedding I am to attend soon, but the cool thing about these tattoos is they go just as great with a pair of jeans and tank top as they do with a fancy dress!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******Disclaimer:  I received product in exchange for review.

    <li> I received these tattoos in a timely manner, and I was soo excited. I opened the package they were beautiful, I can&#x27;t wait to wear them for my trip in June. After they were delivered, I received an email from the owner of Satori Loka, thanking me for my purchase and it stated to let her know if there was any damage during shipment. I haven&#x27;t put them on yet, but they are gorgeous and look pretty durable compared to the other gold foil tattoos that I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> very nice . Quality is good compare to others. nice packaging</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, just in time for a lovely weekend gathering. Perfect unexpected accent to simple dress for a friends  wedding. They look like gold leaf paintings. My daughter loves them too, she appropriated them almost immediately so I ordered more!</li>
