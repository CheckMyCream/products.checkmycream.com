<ol>
      <li>Great service!</li>
      <li>Was my signature scent at the time, unforgettable !</li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll be the perfect Christmas gift!</li>
      <li>but this is not the best</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still as beautiful now as it was then.</li>
      <li>; a  superb retailer, President of a wonderful company (Neiman Marcus), he was a wonderful and caring human being.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But Good.</li>
      <li>Loved the aroma.</li>
      <li>AND IT HAS BEEN A FAVORITE SINCE THE 60&#x27;S. GREAT BUY.</li>
      <li>They deserve more than five stars!</li>
      <li>I love that I found this!</li>
      <li>The perfume smells nice, but it does not smell like the Jungle Gardenia that my Mom used to wear.  </li>
      <li>While it is a nice floral fragrance, it doesn&#x27;t come close to the JG by Tuvache</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve inquired about it at many department stores and no one has even heard of it, so</li>
      <li>I would purchase more again.</li>
      <li>I thought, what better Christmas gift &amp;#34;for myself&amp;#34; than a bottle of Jungle Gardenia, and went to the internet</li>
      <li>I have worn Jungle Gardenia for many years</li>
      <li>Since then, Jungle Gardenia has been my favorite fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I love this perfume</li>
      <li>I used to love it</li>
      <li>In the 1960&#x27;s when  worked for the President of Neiman Marcus, Mr. Stanley Marcus, in Dallas, Texas, many years ago, &amp;#34;Mr. Stanley&amp;#34; gave us secretaries Jungle Gardenia perfume for Christmas.  </li>
      <li>Wife and I and others love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>if u love gardenias</li>
      <li>sometime even affordable sample sizes--what ever happened to perfume samples makes sense more folks would shell out 50-bucks</li>
      <li>/&gt;The fragrance IN NO WAY resembled the original scent and indeed did not smell like any kind of flower</li>
      <li>I will probably use up the bottle very quickly.</li>
      <li>I took a chance hoping the fragrance would be like the original.</li>
      <li>Not being familiar with what the original smelled like, I purchased it based on all of the reviews.  </li>
      <li>My mother is an original Jungle Gardinia fan.</li>
      <li>the original.</li>
      <li>It did not smell quite right, nothing even close to the original Jungle Gardenia.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving this a five star because the company is one of those rare exceptional companies that actually care about the customer.  </li>
      <li>My mother in law has been looking for this original brand for a few years and will be very excited I am sure</li>
      <li>The scent is the same as the original by Tuvache, but it doesn&#x27;t have the longevity and fades very quickly.</li>
      <li>Jungle Gardenia smells great but is not exactly the same as the Original perfume.</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t have purchased if I could have tested first.</li>
      <li>When it first comes out of the bottle smells like chemicals.</li>
      <li>$50 is too much to pay to not be able to smell it later.</li>
      <li>Was a stronger scent then really stuck with you.</li>
      <li>However I really do like to wear it</li>
      <li>This product does smell very similiar to my memory.</li>
      <li>I think this Jungle Gardenia smells better than other brands.</li>
      <li>This scent is very close to what I remember of the original which I still have left in a very old bottle.  </li>
      <li>I received my perfume on a timely basis so I can rate them highly for that.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend in High school wore this.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s probaly too late to ask for a replacementeven though that would be nice.</li>
      <li>But, in my opinion, this fragrance is not remotely close to the original, and should not be sold under the same name / label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I understand that new (Fed Law banned some chemicals)</li>
      <li>but wow at this price.  </li>
      <li>It smells like its old and</li>
      <li>WOW...</li>
      <li>This is the same Jungle Gardenia I have buying for my Wife since we were Sweethearts in High School (1972).</li>
      <li>The perfume smelled nice but it was a little heavy for me.  </li>
      <li>This was a huge disappointment from the original and I sent it back.</li>
      <li>She even couldn&#x27;t smell it on the exact spots where she sprayed a little later.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I received my perfume on a timely basis so I can rate them highly for that. I have worn Jungle Gardenia for many years and I know the fragrance well.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance IN NO WAY resembled the original scent and indeed did not smell like any kind of flower I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I went to the post office and returned said item. I still have the receipt and tracking number but have yet not received&lt;br /&gt;any credit. The charge came through on my card but as yet no credit has been issued.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed in the perfume. It was definitely not as good as the old version though by the same company, Tuvache or at least that is what was advertised.</li>
    <li> In the 1960&#x27;s when  worked for the President of Neiman Marcus, Mr. Stanley Marcus, in Dallas, Texas, many years ago, &amp;#34;Mr. Stanley&amp;#34; gave us secretaries Jungle Gardenia perfume for Christmas.  Since then, Jungle Gardenia has been my favorite fragrance.  Not only was &amp;#34;Mr. Stanley&amp;#34; a  superb retailer, President of a wonderful company (Neiman Marcus), he was a wonderful and caring human being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ann Vastagh Struthers</li>
    <li> The fragrance is not quite what it&#x27;s suppose to be.  It smells like its old and the smell has changed!  I used to love it but this is not the best</li>
    <li> The perfume smelled nice but it was a little heavy for me.  Not being familiar with what the original smelled like, I purchased it based on all of the reviews.  I&#x27;m giving this a five star because the company is one of those rare exceptional companies that actually care about the customer.  They let me return the perfume after opening it and trying it and not only gave me a refund for the cost of the perfume but my shipping also.  I wish all companies operated this way.  They deserve more than five stars!</li>
    <li> Has the small fragrance from 50 years ago.</li>
    <li> The perfume smells nice, but it does not smell like the Jungle Gardenia that my Mom used to wear.  Wouldn&#x27;t have purchased if I could have tested first.</li>
    <li> It is not the same fragrance it once was, but it was close.</li>
    <li> ONE OF MYFAVORITE PEFUMES, I LOST THE STORE THAT I USUALLY BUY IT FROM BUT NOW THAT I KNOW IT IS ONE THE INTERNET...WOW...I USUALLY WEAR THIS PERFUME , COLOGNE WHEN I GO OUT AND IT HAS BEEN A FAVORITE SINCE THE 60&#x27;S. GREAT BUY.</li>
    <li> This product is different from the Jungle Gardenia I once bought back 35 years ago.  I had that memory in mind and this does not meet that standard.  I also bought the spray bottle because that it is the only one offered.  I usually prefer a bottle without the spray attachment.  In that way you can control the amount of fragrance you use.</li>
    <li> The scent is the same as the original by Tuvache, but it doesn&#x27;t have the longevity and fades very quickly. I will probably use up the bottle very quickly. Valiant effort, though.</li>
    <li> This is the same Jungle Gardenia I have buying for my Wife since we were Sweethearts in High School (1972). The only problem is that the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work.She just started using it so it&#x27;s probaly too late to ask for a replacementeven though that would be nice. I guess we will see what happens.</li>
    <li> This was a huge disappointment from the original and I sent it back.</li>
    <li> My mother in law has been looking for this original brand for a few years and will be very excited I am sure</li>
    <li> Not the fragrance I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Jungle Gardenia smells great but is not exactly the same as the Original perfume. However I really do like to wear it and it does smell like gardenia. I think this Jungle Gardenia smells better than other brands.</li>
    <li> This scent is very close to what I remember of the original which I still have left in a very old bottle.  I would purchase more again.</li>
    <li> Finally found it for the wife which his her favourite.We have been looking for the Perfume for a very long time.</li>
    <li> My mother is an original Jungle Gardinia fan. I love that I found this! The minute it came, I sprayed it and was instantly taken back in time!! As a little girl, this was all my mom ever wore and she was crushed when she could no longer buy it. It&#x27;ll be the perfect Christmas gift!</li>
    <li> Not quite as I remembered from the 70&#x27;s. Was a stronger scent then really stuck with you. Was my signature scent at the time, unforgettable !</li>
    <li> Wife and I and others love this fragrance. Hard to find in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Not even close to the aroma or fragrance that you might remember from years ago. I understand that new (Fed Law banned some chemicals) recipes and formulas could result in slight deviations from the originals of years past. And the sellers even point this out in the sell ad...  But, in my opinion, this fragrance is not remotely close to the original, and should not be sold under the same name / label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is so different, they should have just named it Gardenia &amp;#34;something&amp;#34;... But using the name &amp;#34;Jungle Gardenia&amp;#34; was an irresponsible, and misleading use of the term.</li>
    <li> I remember my oldest sister receiving Jungle Gardenia from her boy friend when I was about 13 (I&#x27;m 56 now), I would ask for just a little splash and sometimes not even ask. I&#x27;ve inquired about it at many department stores and no one has even heard of it, so I thought, what better Christmas gift &amp;#34;for myself&amp;#34; than a bottle of Jungle Gardenia, and went to the internet and there it was. It&#x27;s still as beautiful now as it was then. You will be hearing from me again.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Katherine Calvert</li>
    <li> if u love gardenias then this is for u just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey a sale or discount sometime even affordable sample sizes--what ever happened to perfume samples makes sense more folks would shell out 50-bucks if they know what they are getting.</li>
    <li> I took a chance hoping the fragrance would be like the original. While it is a nice floral fragrance, it doesn&#x27;t come close to the JG by Tuvache I remember in the 60&#x27;s. Sadly I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this years ago. A 8 oz bottle was 13.00. I love this perfume but wow at this price.  It needs to come back to the malls as it once was.</li>
    <li> It did not smell quite right, nothing even close to the original Jungle Gardenia. I would not recomend it if you think it smells&lt;br /&gt;like the original.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife (as she wore it in college when we were dating). She said that it smells the same as the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; smell use to be BUT once you sprayed it on, you never smell it again. She even couldn&#x27;t smell it on the exact spots where she sprayed a little later. She was very disappointed. $50 is too much to pay to not be able to smell it later. She wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product unfortunately.  ;-(</li>
    <li> My girlfriend in High school wore this. Loved the aroma. This product does smell very similiar to my memory. One thing the spray bottle. When it first comes out of the bottle smells like chemicals. Takes about 15 minutes to smell like Gardenas. But Good. My wife likes it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for Jungle Gardenia perfume for sometime.  I&#x27;m also looking for any Evening in Paris Vanity Collections. Great service!</li>
    <li> Reminder of the 50s. Lucious.</li>
