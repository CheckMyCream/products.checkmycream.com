<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received a free bottle of this through RetailMeNot. I LOVE this lotion and i&#x27;m the type that hates all lotion because of the greasy feeling. Seems like a lot of lotions that aren&#x27;t greasy also don&#x27;t hydrate either. This is not greasy or shiny. It feels like it really sinks in and isn&#x27;t just laying on top of the skin.  It is very thick, which I don&#x27;t mind because it feels good on my skin. I have very dry skin and this is the first winter that my legs don&#x27;t look dry and scaley. I use every couple of days. I&#x27;ve used other lotions like aveeno and aquaphor daily and not gotten these results.</li>
    <li> Totally awesome! Fantastic smell, leaves skin soft and sinks in quickly. Smell is so good that I double checked label to look for fragrances added. Did not see any. Smell comes from the natural essential oils. No problem to get out of bottle if you store it upside down and simply unscrew the top. I would rather have to do that with a quality, thick lotion than have a watered down lotion that comes out with ease. Will definitely purchase again. I have used the similar lotions available at Target which are good, but this is definitely my favorite.</li>
    <li> Great Christmas gift!</li>
    <li> i get this for a friend and she loves it so much, she gets it for HER friends !</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  My all time favourite!  Makes my skin smooth and silky and the smell is succulent and sensual. It&#x27;s really thick so sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get the lotion out of the bottle but the thickness is what makes this lotion potent and effective.</li>
    <li> This lotion feels/looks pretty greasy when you put it on, so I suggest you do what I do and just use it at night if you&#x27;re using it for your face. I don&#x27;t understand how something so greasy can clear up acne--but as soon as I get a pimple, I put this stuff on and it disappears within a day or two. It&#x27;s seriously like magic. I swear by this lotion for nightly face moisturizing. It&#x27;s the only moisturizer I use.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I have found this super moisturizing lotion! A friend just recommended this to me and I was skeptical at first. I mean, there are a lot of lotions in the market and I thought, what the hell is Nubian Heritage. Well, she was able to convince me and I&#x27;m so happy I tried it. It took all the dryness away from my skin, literally. I am very well-pleased with my purchased, extremely well-pleased!</li>
    <li> I love the light scent it leaves.  My boyfriend also likes the smell.</li>
    <li> I should have known I wouldnt like the smell, since I am very sensitive to all smells, but this one gave me a splitting headache within 10 minutes.  Other than the smell, it feels great!</li>
    <li> I really liked the soap (traditional bar soap) of this same brand and scent, so I thought I would try the lotion. It has a pleasant and bright scent that I find soothing and calming. The lotion also has this scent initially but can often put off an odd after-scent, if you get what I mean, as if the undertones of the primary scent are all that&#x27;s left after some hours of having put it on. The quality of the lotion is great, thick and creamy, very moisturizing without being greasy. It has restored my skin&#x27;s suppleness and smoothness, in a very short period of time of using it. Great price for the product, overall natural ingredients. Item arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Makes my skin soft and smooth all day long and smells fantastic. A nice clean scent and not overly perfumed.</li>
    <li> We love Nubian Heritage&#x27;s coconut papaya soap, so we tried this lotion. For us, the scent is way too strong. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a really nice product - feels great. Offer one with minimal (naturally occurring and no perfume added) scent and you&#x27;ve got 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This stuff feels and smells amazing!!! The reviews do not lie! Feels so good on the skin too. Worth every penny. I will be a fan of this stuff for life :)</li>
    <li> Love Nubian Heritage. . .have tried several fragrances and have loved them all!</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells nice</li>
    <li> I love the way this lotion feels but I&#x27;m not so sure about the scent. It&#x27;s very sweet.</li>
    <li> I constantly get compliments on how great the fragrance is.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I have very sensitive skin and this is so thick and creamy my skin loves it! That said, I&#x27;ve gone through 3 bottles, and 1 of them was so thick I had to take the cap off and dig the lotion out, it wouldn&#x27;t squeeze through. A problem I will gladly deal with to not have dry, irritated skin. I have tried the Honey and Black Seed, and the Coconut and Papaya scents. Both are wonderful! Honey is a little more perfume-y and the coconut is fruity and sweet.</li>
    <li> This does not smell exactly like the Honey and Black Seed Soap.  It&#x27;s creamy and a good emollient on the skin, but the smell is off somehow from the soap.  Still okay but maybe because the product is a lotion as opposed to a soap, it cannot be made to smell exactly the same. It seems too strong in some ways, but again, maybe it&#x27;s because I was expecting the exact same smell as the soap.</li>
    <li> OK I got this for my husband how has real bad dry skin,  and he hates lotions all together. I tried it and OMG this stuff is amazing. It like puts a layer of moisture on your skin. It didn&#x27;t wash off or anything my skin looked and felt very moisturized. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I freaking love this lotion. It is really thick and soaks into my skin really well. The smell stays with me all day and keeps my skin hydrated all day.</li>
    <li> Love this product...delivered in a timely manner. Will continue to use for many years.</li>
    <li> very thick lotion, and a bit greasy.</li>
    <li> perhaps, this lotion has many good ingredients and good for your skin but i tried it once and can&#x27;t use it anymore. I have to change my sheets after applying it last night - the smell is overwhelming. It did not disappear overnight. It&#x27;s sweet and exotic - probably some people like it (reminds me Old Spice one of my co-workers uses, but this is 10 times stronger). It&#x27;s a shame i can&#x27;t return it and get about $10 refund from this seller (drugstore.com allows it for many cosmetic items).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for years it was very easy to order for this place a in a good amount of time packaged well</li>
    <li> (My favorite scent is Killian Back to Black, just to give perspective)&lt;br /&gt;Oh wow....the smell is AMAZING! It smells rich (luxurious) and distinctive. The consistency is reminiscent of a heavier body cream but it applies evenly and is absorbed quickly. I purchased this from Market Street and applied it for the first time this evening. I have never reviewed any product this quickly. This will be a permanent fixture in my arsenal of must haves.</li>
    <li> This is a luxurious lotion! It smells good and feels creamy and rich. I love it!</li>
    <li> Thick,rich, smells good and stays with me all day.</li>
    <li> The is excellent. It is very thick according to other Lotion. The scent is strong, but that the only disadvantage. But, it does have healing properties, and work for circulation. I put some on my brother Edema legs, and we could see it helped lower with his water retention in his legs.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion. Perfect consistency and only thing that helps my problem skin. Scent is just so-so to me, but I get compliments from people on how good it smells all the time.</li>
    <li> Works great but smell was overwhelming, love the soap but as far as the lotion,  im gonna stick to the coconut and papaya lotion and mix it with their raw Shea butter hand balm.  Now that&#x27;s a match made in heaven but at the end of the day the lotion was great minus the smell! !!</li>
    <li> I keep coming back.  I purchased this several years visiting a marketing in NY.  At the airport and on the plane home several people commented on the frangrance.  It is sweet and mysterious and spicy and natural.  LOVE IT!  When I have purchased, it was soo thick that I had a difficult time getting to use it all.  I had to cut the bottle open and move it to a small jar.  One post said it is a little thinner.  I think that will be good.  It might also last longer.  I never tried to thin it out.  Getting some today.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, but I DOES NOT squeeze out of the bottle almost paste like, I wonder if I got 2 bad bottles :( disappointed. No one likes a struggle trying to get lotion out</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin hydrated,smooth and it smell good. Has a friendly scent...(light).</li>
    <li> Nubian Heritage has such quality products, especially black seed oil and honey bath wash. Unfortunately I have not received either the lotion or bath wash. Normally 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Nubian Heritage is a great line .Love the scent! Love the feel. It leaves my skin hydrated without being greasy!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It smells great, isn&#x27;t greasy and leaves my skin soft throughout the day. Its really thick which works good on rough skin but can be difficult to get out of the bottle when its towards the bottom half of the bottle.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a great smell and works wonders on dry skin. I have been using it for over a year now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this scent in the body butter and loved it, but didn&#x27;t like the greasy feeling it left. So i bought this lotion to get the same scent and it&#x27;s amazing. the reason for four stars is becuase it&#x27;s so thick it&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely wonderful moisturizer.  Great from your face to your feet.  Natural ingredients, non-greasy and smells wonderful.  You skin will never feel better!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this lotion and the lingering fragrance.</li>
    <li> Best smell i&#x27;ve come across. I use the body wash to, similar smell to that.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! So sad I can not buy it local. The scent is Devine and it is the only lotion that gets my skin through the harsh New England winters</li>
    <li> I rally would enjoy useing this product, if I could get it out of the bottle!  It is so darn thick, the only way I have been able to get it out is to microwave it.</li>
    <li> This is really one of the main products I use typically from nubian heritage. The honey &amp; black seed shea butter soap was the very first thing I used by nubian heritage and became an instant fan of it ever since I began using their products in 2009 and since then, my eczema has been under good control. The black seed oil which is one of the main ingredients is very beneficial for all sorts of ailments and can boost your immune system when taken with a teaspoon of pure honey.</li>
    <li> Smells like YUM! Winnie the Pooh would love it! Really thick, natural lotion with no chemical or petroleum based additives. I mix this lotion easily with various other products to &#x27;spread the smell&#x27; and it adds luxurious quality to any natural shea salve.  Nubian Heritage is the most amazing natural shea product line I&#x27;ve encountered. I do make all my own salves for healing various skin maladays and allergic reactions but keep coming back to NH for their lotions and soaps. This is my only store-bought lotion now. It smells amazing..drives my boyfriend crazy..heals eczema and psoriasis...heals ingrown hairs and razor bumps..is an amazing facial moisturizer (though I choose NH honey or vetiver Salve for my eczematic face), and prevents skin drying out from construction work, gardening, sawdust, concrete...basically it is just awesome and will replace everything you have for moisturizers in the future. Try the soap and salve too!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> hard to find lotion without coconut oil or mango or some other nut oil ... which i am allergic to ... this one is great! smell fresh and feels great!!!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, it smells wonderful , is very thick and creamy, absorbs quickly and is so moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This lotion has really help my dry feet. My feet have never felt so soft. I love the smell of this lotion.</li>
    <li> This product smells great, people literally have sniffed me and couldn&#x27;t stop(no joking). I love the smell. It moisturizes and all that good stuff. I definitely recommend it. Love sir products in general.</li>
    <li> Love it.  The ingredients are organic and the smell is wonderful.  It reminds me of cherry tobacco with a hint of almond.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to squeeze out, but once you do---wow! Smells gorgeous and it is so moisturizing. I smelled this on a friend which compelled me to purchase. I should have got it on 125th street in Harlem, as it was a bit cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love this product along with the body shampoo</li>
    <li> The  lotion smelled good , but it was too thick to use from the bottle it came in.</li>
    <li> I really love using Nubian Heritage&lt;br /&gt;Body lotion. It is a little thick but it has a wonderful smell and my skin really does feel softer.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t even felt the need to even wear perfume....it smells really different and wonderful</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and the smell is heaven.</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion. I have incredibly dry skin and this has really helped keep it under control. The scent is great and I love how thick it is. It&#x27;s a bit expensive for lotion, but well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! The first thing i noticed was that it had shea butter as the first ingredient, when most other lotions water is the foremost ingredient and that impressed me. I also loved everything else in it so i decided to give it a try and i&#x27;m so happy i did. I really love it. I&#x27;ve had a problem with dry skin and this stuff moisturizes it so well!! It is thick and creamy and it smells great. I will definitely be buying more of this and also trying the other one&#x27;s as well.</li>
    <li> This lotion is so thick and rich that it should be called a cream. It&#x27;s fragrance is delicious, and I&#x27;m stopped all the time by people who want to know what it is. There&#x27;s nothing else that I&#x27;d use on my hands and body. Fabulous!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells so darn good!!! I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling my wrist after I initially tested it lol Its a great moisturizer as it keeps the ash away all day. Has a rather thick consistency but I like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product locally before and loved it. The smell is wonderful, and I love the way it moisturizes. However, the bottle I just recently received was extra thick and nearly impossible to dispense from the bottle. I think a lotion this thick needs a different sort of container. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll ever be able to get this stuff out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I am in loooooove with this lotion! Yes, the price is a tad high for lotion, but it is so worth it. I have sensitive skin, and the nubian heritage line has always done well for me. The scent is pleasing, the formula is thick, non greasy and moisturizing, and the ingredients are simple, which I like. The brand is also cruelty free, which is a great thing to invest your money in.</li>
