      <li>I can&#x27;t handle strong, overpowering scents or when people wear a lot.  </li>
      <li>It always gets noticed, but not for being strong and abrasive.</li>

      <li>its definitly worth the price.</li>
      <li>Not crazy about scent</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> alittle to strong for using at work</li>
    <li> This is a body spray. It smells fantastic. A must have. My sisters and I alway give each other one  for Christmas if we are out of it. Sad to say I didn&#x27;t get my daughter one this Christmas she told me too late. But will order her one for her birthday.</li>
    <li> I really like the Morning Glory aroma. It isn&#x27;t too heavy for a very hot day especially here in Texas where the temperature has been very HOT this year.  It gives you a nice cool feeling with just the right amount mist to make you feel good all day!</li>
    <li> Beautiful aromatic fragrance !!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE Morning Glory!!!  Found it one time in WalMart, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it again!  They are always out!  It&#x27;s light and refreshing - stays with me all day long!!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this for over 10 years and get compliments DAILY about how good I smell....who needs a designer fragrance when you can get this for under $10 a bottle!</li>
    <li> Used this fragrance for years. Love it :)</li>
    <li> Calgon Morning Glory spray seems to be the only product that protects against the sand gnats that are prevalent on the coasts of Florida. Besides being an effective repellant, which is NOT the primary intention of this product, the light fragrance is pleasant and not overpowering. Calgon Morning Glory spray is suitable for both males and females as a fragrance, especially when OUR main objective is keeping the \\&quot;No See &#x27;Um\\&quot; bugs at bay.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 body mists and they came quickly but one oof them was missing a top and leaked in the box a little bit .</li>
    <li> For me this is the best Calgon Body Spray available. I don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t have it in stores any more. Such a good product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about scent</li>
    <li> this didnt smell as nearly as good as the one i purchased in the store.  awful.  Not sure if it was the retailer or the product itself but this is usually a very crisp clean smell and it certainly WASN&#x27;T.  I wont use this product and im sorry I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.. but couldn&#x27;t get it in any store, love it. will re order next time</li>
    <li> love it, its light, florid and fresh. Men and women alike love it.  Better than perfume or cologne, lighter and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I love Calgon Morning Glory! It is the most wonderful refreshing scent.I gave a bottle to my sister because she loves it too, and she is always stealing mine.</li>
    <li> I used amazon prime shipping for this product, but it took 4 days to arrive. When I first smelled it was very clean smelling, something my grandmother would wear. I will probably not use this as body mist because of the lack of sweetness, but I​ may use it for bathroom air freshener.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and it came in perfect condition  and smells great! 5 stars ☆☆☆☆☆</li>
    <li> Very nice quick service from prime</li>
    <li> Lots of fragrances out there...but this one has been my go to for years!!  I get so many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;Got tired of searching around town for it so buy in bulk at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this, I usually go for floral/fresh fragrances. This smells very chemical to me and I won&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> This smells really nice... People always ask me what perfume I wear and they get surprised when I tell them it&#x27;s this...</li>
    <li> Great fresh clean smell - easy to use - lasts all day.  Difficult to find in stores.  Would recommend as it is a great product.</li>
    <li> It smell different then the one I purchase 2 yeats ago</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and it smells pretty good! Not an AMAZING scent as I&#x27;ve heard some people describe it as, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; either. It&#x27;s a nice, fresh fragrance.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent! I travel for a living, and this is ESSENTIAL in the hot summers. This smells like I just took a fresh shower, not that I doused my sweat in perfume and am trying too hard! Hope they do not stop making this scent. Wish they made it in travel size. I have to put in travel containers, no big deal.</li>
    <li> LOVE this scent! It smells wonderfully fresh and clean! Great price too!</li>
    <li> A trusted and loved scent for many years but for some reason stores in my area stopped stocking this Calgary product line. I am excited to find it accessible for purchase on Amazon. I kept one in my car an one at home.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and how fresh it makes you feel.the freshness stays with you all day.it is refreshing all day!</li>
    <li> This is just the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; smell I was looking for.  After a shower or on a hot day...&lt;br /&gt;spray a little here and there.</li>
    <li> Hey, what can I say. This scent has been rocking since the 90&#x27;s when it came out. It&#x27;s still good!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It is hard to find anymore so when I find it, I buy it. It is very light and I put it on after a shower. Everyone always asks what I am wearing and it is funny to tell them Calgon.</li>
    <li> I get lots of complements from people that I smell very nice all the time.</li>
    <li> I am a collector of perfumes.  Out of all my expensive brands of perfumes, this one is the absolute best.  I work serving food so I have to be careful what I wear.  This smells like you just jumped out of a bubble bath and into your clothes.  I have the lotion as well to match and love it also!!!  No compliments as of yet but I will update later if and when I do.</li>
    <li> nice for hot summer days, would buy again</li>
    <li> A co worker was wearing this one day and I loved it.  Couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the stores so I came straight to Amazon and was thrilled it was available here!  I can&#x27;t handle strong, overpowering scents or when people wear a lot.  This does not affect me in a negative way and I love the scent.</li>
    <li> Love product&lt;br /&gt;Great service</li>
    <li> Received in time promised. very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Not too god in the nose. Air freshener in our bathroom smells better than this!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Has a very pleasant scent and it will linger and last throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I love how the fragrance just smells so refreshing. It&#x27;s not an overpowering scent. The price is affordable and I think it smells so much better than those high cost perfumes from celebrities that are in a itty bitty bottle. I used to wear this back in high school all the time but couldn&#x27;t find it anymore when I would go shopping. I was surprised that I found it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t seem to find this in the stores and I love it.  Nice clean fresh scent almost like the smell of good shampoo.  I need to find a body lotion then I&#x27;d be set.</li>
    <li> Calgon, of course, has a good reputation for its products. I purchased this for my wife because of the really good fragrance. Morning glories really have no fragrance or it is so faint it cannot be detected. The scent used by Calgon is not overpowering, but it is light and floral. The blue bottles go nicely with a bathroom decor, also.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find the scent anywhere in the stores anymore and I have always loved it. This is just as I rememnered. Shipped super fast!</li>
    <li> Love it! it&#x27;s light yet you don&#x27;t loose it as quick as with other body sprays. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> love it till I found it for half price at Walmart</li>
    <li> It is such a beautiful smell. I got a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> This fragrance as been a favorite of mine for years. It always gets noticed, but not for being strong and abrasive. It&#x27;s a nice soft scent that lasts all day. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this product. I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this product to my friends. Maybe a different fragrance from Calgon might have been better.</li>
    <li> I go back to this scent every few years. It works well with my chemistry, and draws compliments from the fellows. This is an unusual, clean scent, great for the office and for play.</li>
    <li> this is my signature sent. it has a very fresh smell and the ladies love it. its my secret when they try to ask what is it. its definitly worth the price. Keeps the ladies close to me.i hope they never stop selling it. furthermore, its not that easy to find so i try to conserve it as best as possible. its also an amazing air freshener.</li>
    <li> Very glad to have finally found this!!!!!! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Yes, this is an inexpensive body spray-- and I don&#x27;t much like the other Calgon scents-- but Morning Glory is refreshing, soft, beautiful, and (per spouse and kids) beats many of my more expensive perfumes. It smells like a great floral soap or shampoo, but not in that sharp or cloying way that so many \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scents seem to do. It&#x27;s a no-brainer, feel-good scent that just might become my favorite despite the money I&#x27;ve spent on Lauder and Chanel.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. It stays with you through the day. I put it on after my shower in the morning and I can still smell it in the evening when I come home from work.&lt;br /&gt;I also like it because it doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze. It&#x27;s a gentle mist that is not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> As a smoker, I was always looking for something to cover the smoke but not a strong perfume. I found it in this product. I serve food and after I have a cigarette, I give one quick pump and I&#x27;ve never had a complaint. On the contrary, I&#x27;ve had many comments how good I smell. Makes me laugh !! It&#x27;s not overpowering , because I don&#x27;t wear perfume at work around food. This is so clean , And it&#x27;s not too strong, with only one pump !!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance, light and airy, not sickeningly sweet like many now being sold at B&amp;BW.  Too bad it is no longer available in stores.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom and she loved it, it smells so good. :)</li>
    <li> I love this scent a lot, good purchase.  Unfortunately I do have one complaint, there was a small bug floating around inside the bottle. yuk.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product. I haven&#x27;t been able to find this body spray in WalMart and I love it!!! Only thing is the bottles were delivered without tops?! They were just taped up?! But in all this is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
    <li> Lovely scent! I love this! I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
    <li> Light and airy just what I need on a busy morning off to work</li>
    <li> I try out several different body mist scents each year and ever since finding this one, I have stuck with it because it smells so good and the scent lasts for hours. I&#x27;ve bought several of these bottles because I don&#x27;t want to run out. This really does have the best scent of a body mist I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
    <li> love this spray couldnt find it in stores so had to go online exactly what i wanted shipped fast and enjoying should have bought more</li>
    <li> Smells AHHHHmazing!!!! And I got a great deal as an add on!!</li>
    <li> Been wearing this for decades. It&#x27;s the same as always.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll smell shower-fresh all day!  The fragrance is light, refreshing and not the least bit offensive even to those who are sensitive to scents.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this body spray for many years now and I always receive compliments on it. It is a light fragrance, not too heavy. It does smell just like Morning Glories!! Thank you for carrying such a great product.</li>
