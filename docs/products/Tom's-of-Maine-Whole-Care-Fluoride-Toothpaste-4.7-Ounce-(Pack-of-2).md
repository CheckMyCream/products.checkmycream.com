      <li>I thought I was buying a natural toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Plus they don&#x27;t contain SLS and are all natural.  </li>

<li> I don&#x27;t like mint flavors, and the spice flavor is not overwhelming.</li>
<li> When I do use the artificial stuff I get slightly grossed out.  </li>
<li> There is no pain after I use it, with every other toothpaste there&#x27;s been pain, cotton mouth, and the unpleasant flavor.</li>
<li> I hate the endless synthetic mint flavors.</li>
<li> I like that Tom&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t use artificial sweeteners.  </li>
<li> I hate sugary and overpowering toothpaste.</li>
<li> Very disappointed...</li>

    <li> Excellent natural toothpaste.Love the all natural ingredients and it really does a great job cleaning your mouth.</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying a natural toothpaste. I guess I didn&#x27;t read the ingredients carefully before purchasing. I like the taste and will continue to use it up till it&#x27;s gone, but then I&#x27;ll search for something with less harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s is a great product and only thing I use.</li>
    <li> Love this CLEAN, natural product!! TASTES GREAT and is REFRESHING!  My teeth don&#x27;t get whiter with it, if that&#x27;s a concern of yours.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed... This toothpaste contains carrageenan</li>
    <li> Was pretty disappointed in this one... had hoped for a nice cinnamon flavor and clean feel...instead, it tastes like a mouthful of cloves and leaves an odd feel.</li>
    <li> Love it. Tastes a lot like the old teaberry gum from years ago.</li>
    <li> Not too sweet and great flavor.</li>
    <li> Toms is great stuff, I not concerned what people say about that sodium lauryl sulfate, there is no proof that it is harmful. I believe that it is safe, besides, you spit it out, you dont swallow it. Im sure small amounts wont hurt you.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste for almost 3 decades.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste that tastes like cinnamon and cloves</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste. I don&#x27;t like mint flavors, and the spice flavor is not overwhelming. This DOES have fluoride, which I want.</li>
    <li> I hate sugary and overpowering toothpaste. I hate the endless synthetic mint flavors. This toothpaste is neither of those things. It tastes like real cinnamon and a hint of clove. There is no pain after I use it, with every other toothpaste there&#x27;s been pain, cotton mouth, and the unpleasant flavor. None of that with this. And it has fluoride, so it fights cavities!!!</li>
    <li> I like it but, it lacks that strong, fresh, clean mouth, punch.  It needs more cinnamon flavor.  It is mild.  If that&#x27;s what you are looking for, this is a good choice.  It is a good toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste!  I tried to go the inexpensive route and purchase name brand toothpaste super cheap with coupons but both my husband and I were seriously missing our Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste.  Both of us feel that this brand is worth any extra money you may need to spend on it.  It is not fake sweet like the others.  It completely refreshes my mouth.  The dental checkups show that it works really well too.  If you are just switching over give it a week or so for your tastebuds to adjust and then you will never go back.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD! exactly as it was supposed to be.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste.  I wish the flavor was stronger.  I still need mouthwash to get a really fresh feeling.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really make your mouth feel that clean. Gotta brush repeatedly.</li>
    <li> I love this flavor.  I like that Tom&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t use artificial sweeteners.  When I do use the artificial stuff I get slightly grossed out.  This is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> This seems to clean our teeth nicely. We alternate between buying the clove and the mint versions. But we tend to get the clove more. The flavor is not too powerful. I don&#x27;t notice the cinnamon in there.</li>
    <li> This tastes awesome.  I bought it because mint  flavored toothpastes  lately make me a little nauseous.  I don&#x27;t have that problem with cinnamon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; However, I actually prefer the much lower cost Crest cinnamon gel toothpaste.</li>
    <li> The only toothpaste we will use.  Love the cinnamon taste.  Not harsh &amp; burning like alot of the minty types on the market.  Using this for years</li>
    <li> Not only is this a natural product, which is a must for me, but the flavor is great. I really hate mint and most toothpaste is some type of mint flavor...yuck! This cinnamon clove flavor is a refreshing change and I just love it. Thanks, Tom&#x27;s of Maine!</li>
    <li> Gives me canker sores, contains SLS.  Tastes great and makes breath fresh but if you are prone to canker sores avoid this toothpaste, I switched to NOW brand Xyliwhite, they have a cinnamon one and the tubes are much larger and cheaper then Tom&#x27;s.  Plus they don&#x27;t contain SLS and are all natural.  Check out Amazons listing for it.</li>
