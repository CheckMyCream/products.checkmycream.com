      <li>I love these!  </li>
      <li>I faithfully apply this at night as part of my routine and wake up happy and ready to apply makeup</li>

      <li>SUCH a great investment and bang for the buck!</li>
      <li>So comfortable!</li>
      <li>Love these...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how I lived without these, but I am glad I found them now</li>
      <li>my forehead is smooth!</li>
      <li>The best part about these patches is that they are affordable, you can travel easily with them and they are a natural way to diminish fine lines.</li>
      <li>:) I have been worried about fine lines on my forehead and started using these every night.</li>
      <li>I just got them and so far and happy.</li>
      <li>They come off easy when you peel them off in the morning.  </li>
      <li>They are easy to peel off and stick on.  </li>
      <li>I have 3 fine lines on my forehead since I was 17.</li>
      <li>but luckily they have a patch for that too :)</li>
      <li>When I wake up I see a HUGE difference...</li>
      <li>Wake up looking alllll smooth.  </li>
      <li>My forehead&#x27;s texture has improved significantly.</li>
      <li>I still use them for the 11&#x27;s as they are tried and true -</li>
      <li>I love that Furlesse has come out with the complete range of projects.</li>
      <li>To me, they are well worth the time and money.</li>
      <li>These are worth the money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Furlesse for a long time and was so happy to discover the new forehead product.</li>
      <li>Every night I combine the ROWS + ELEVENS and I can&#x27;t believe how my fine lines are completely smoothed out in the morning!!</li>
      <li>and they stay on great even if I&#x27;m a little oiler at certain times.</li>
      <li>That takes a month&#x27;s supply (30) to a 2 week supply (15) which makes this less of a good deal for my $$$$.</li>
      <li>Would be good if they were a little longer to cover all of forehead.</li>
      <li>so I moisturize first.  </li>
      <li>From the first application \\&quot; YOU WILL SEE A</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to start using them in addition to the other products.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much I loved them until the next morning when I woke with the same frown lines I&#x27;d gone to bed with.</li>
      <li>My skin appears better the next day (fine lines gone), but it is obviously not removing wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>The first patch, besides frownies, that I really like.</li>
      <li>so I could use one large sheet on my forehead.  </li>
      <li>These patches work very well.  </li>
      <li>They stay in place all night too, not matter how much I move (which is a lot) or sweat.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think its worth the fuss, but I might regret that later ;)</li>
      <li>The only thing that would make them better is if they were larger</li>
      <li>I think it creates new lines instead erasing the existing ones.</li>
      <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t make the area look worse, but I think it does make the area look a lot better.  </li>
      <li>I was excitied about just getting forehead stickers in clear.  </li>
      <li>I ususally alternate usage - brow furrow and forehead - and this combo has worked really well for me.</li>
      <li>Frownies are less comfortable and glaringly obvious, but at least I wake up with a nice flat forehead.</li>
      <li>Not sure if this would be a problem for someone with very oily skin, but they could always try these with an oil-absorbing product first and see how it works.  </li>
      <li>They are clear which is nice since my husband didn&#x27;t noticed these for months until one day when he had his glasses on while I was wearing them (no glasses, unable to detect).  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much after one month of use and I only have one single not very deep line that concerns me.  </li>
      <li>They are old fashioned and not very attractive, BUT they adhere much better and are half the price for 144 patches.</li>

<li> Now when I use them I am VERY careful.</li>
<li> Yes, bad forehead lines and they do seem to smooth them out.</li>
<li> DOWN  </li>
<li> I cut these in half and use them in that spot even though they are meant for the forehead.</li>
<li> I use them nightly, and I slightly overlap them.  </li>
<li> I use these in combination with the elevens which is the only other one that I have tired that I feel works well on me.  </li>
<li> They actually have decreased my frown lines!</li>
<li> You will not be disappointed with this product and I highly recommend giving them a try.</li>
<li> you seriously wake up plumped...</li>
<li> I have been using the patches for a month and the visibility of my wrinkles is decreased by almost 80% at least.</li>
<li> I like the frown line patches, but this one seems too thin.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t broken out from the adhesive which was a concern of mine.</li>
<li> I tend to furrow my brow when I am a sleeping, usually because of bad dreams or not feeling well.</li>
<li> So disappointed!</li>

    <li> I use these in combination with the elevens which is the only other one that I have tired that I feel works well on me.  I use them nightly, and I slightly overlap them.  They are clear which is nice since my husband didn&#x27;t noticed these for months until one day when he had his glasses on while I was wearing them (no glasses, unable to detect).  They are easy to peel off and stick on.  They come off easy when you peel them off in the morning.  My skin is a bit dry so I moisturize first.  If I don&#x27;t wait long it enough for it to dry, the product does not adhere well.  As long as I give it a few minutes, they stay on all night without any problems.  Not sure if this would be a problem for someone with very oily skin, but they could always try these with an oil-absorbing product first and see how it works.  These patches are only a temporary fix.  My skin appears better the next day (fine lines gone), but it is obviously not removing wrinkles.  It certainly doesn&#x27;t make the area look worse, but I think it does make the area look a lot better.  I use them daily, but I would expect if I went without them for a few days, the cosmetic improvement would be gone.  To me, they are well worth the time and money.</li>
    <li> So comfortable! So unobtrusive! I couldn&#x27;t believe how much I loved them until the next morning when I woke with the same frown lines I&#x27;d gone to bed with. Thinking it was user error, I tried again and again and again. Frownies are less comfortable and glaringly obvious, but at least I wake up with a nice flat forehead. So disappointed!</li>
    <li> At 55 I still have no Botox in my forehead as I have used Frownies for 11&#x27;s for over 10 yrs.  I still use them for the 11&#x27;s as they are tried and true - BUT I now use these for the other lines above brows.  I cut one in half and raise the area above brow UP with my hand and then place this on the smoothed out area.  Wake up looking alllll smooth.  That&#x27;s the way these work for me. These are worth the money.</li>
    <li> Every night I combine the ROWS + ELEVENS and I can&#x27;t believe how my fine lines are completely smoothed out in the morning!! My forehead&#x27;s texture has improved significantly. Furlesse works. When I found out they came out with the ROWS I was thrilled to start using them in addition to the other products. The best part about these patches is that they are affordable, you can travel easily with them and they are a natural way to diminish fine lines. You will not be disappointed with this product and I highly recommend giving them a try. I have tried a lot of fancy creams and Furlesse works the best!</li>
    <li> These &amp;#34;stickers&amp;#34; help me. I tend to furrow my brow when I am a sleeping, usually because of bad dreams or not feeling well. This helps keep the area between my eyebrows (the 11&#x27;s) at bay. I cut these in half and use them in that spot even though they are meant for the forehead. I haven&#x27;t broken out from the adhesive which was a concern of mine.</li>
    <li> I like the frown line patches, but this one seems too thin. I think it creates new lines instead erasing the existing ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 50+, at any age you have to start using this product.  From the first application \\&quot; YOU WILL SEE A DIFFERANCE!\\&quot; wish this product was arroung about 15 years ago.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!! Would be good if they were a little longer to cover all of forehead.</li>
    <li> Yes, bad forehead lines and they do seem to smooth them out. I think the lines return by end of day (i wear them to bed) but we will see . I just got them and so far and happy.</li>
    <li> I was excitied about just getting forehead stickers in clear.  However, they are too slim to cover my entire forhead.  Each sticker really only covers a line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to flatten a line, but do not really care about immobilizing your forehead, this for you.  I had to use two stickers and I still could move my eyebrows around.  That takes a month&#x27;s supply (30) to a 2 week supply (15) which makes this less of a good deal for my $$$$.</li>
    <li> I saw these advertised in a magazine so I thought I&#x27;d try them.  They were \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.  Didn&#x27;t stick all that well.  In morning was peeling off.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer \\&quot;Frownies\\&quot; brand.  They are old fashioned and not very attractive, BUT they adhere much better and are half the price for 144 patches.</li>
    <li> These patches work very well.  I accidently got a corner on my eyebrow.  When the patch came off, so did the corner of my eyebrow.  Now when I use them I am VERY careful.</li>
    <li> I love these!  The only thing that would make them better is if they were larger so I could use one large sheet on my forehead.  I reuse them about 3 times also.  The first patch, besides frownies, that I really like.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much after one month of use and I only have one single not very deep line that concerns me.  Besides it left me with a rash as you can see in picture below.</li>
    <li> These are awesome!  I wear them while I sleep.  I wish I would have known about these sooner.  They actually have decreased my frown lines!</li>
    <li> I have 3 fine lines on my forehead since I was 17. I tried the  product and I could not believe after one night all the lines were gone. BUT the lines do come back during the course of the day. I have been using the patches for a month and the visibility of my wrinkles is decreased by almost 80% at least. I am about to buy it again but I wanted to make a review before purchasing :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!!! I don&#x27;t know how I lived without these, but I am glad I found them now :) I have been worried about fine lines on my forehead and started using these every night. When I wake up I see a HUGE difference...my forehead is smooth! They stay in place all night too, not matter how much I move (which is a lot) or sweat. I just turned 30 this year so this has been a helpful tool in the prevention of lines on my forehead and I also have a concern for my \\&quot;elevens\\&quot; (lines between eyebrows) but luckily they have a patch for that too :) I faithfully apply this at night as part of my routine and wake up happy and ready to apply makeup...line free!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Furlesse!</li>
    <li> I suffer from both the &#x27;1&#x27; between my eyebrowns AND the parallel lines of life on my forehead. I&#x27;ve been using Furlesse for a long time and was so happy to discover the new forehead product. I&#x27;m thrilled with the results and am feeling great about my forehead. I ususally alternate usage - brow furrow and forehead - and this combo has worked really well for me. I have combination skin and they stay on great even if I&#x27;m a little oiler at certain times. I love that Furlesse has come out with the complete range of projects. I have them and love them all! SUCH a great investment and bang for the buck!</li>
    <li> If you furrow in your sleep it is helpful. I don&#x27;t think its worth the fuss, but I might regret that later ;)</li>
    <li> Love these...you seriously wake up plumped...well your wrinkles are plumped...and that is a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves them, too!</li>
    <li> OF ALL THE PATCHES THIS IS THE BEST ONE IT STAYS BETTER BUT IT TOOO LIFTED AND I KEPT PUSHING IT BACK DOWN  NO RESULTS FROM USING IT</li>
