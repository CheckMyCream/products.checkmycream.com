<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very thin hair and lament it every day!  Recently, my hairdresser mentioned henna products, versus typical over the counter hair coloring products I&#x27;ve  been using.  Boy...am I MAD...that I didn&#x27;t know about Henna 40 years ago!  It makes my hair seem fuller, I get better coverage and the color looks natural.  I love HENNA!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year. This is a great product if you are trying to give your hair a break from harsh chemical dyes. Ships very fast. Recommended it to friends. They love it too.</li>
    <li> Needed a product that would not trigger an allergic reaction. I was very skeptical about using ANYTHING. Followed the directions and I am SO HAPPY. Covered my gray and gave me gorgeous shiny dark brown hair. This is the hair I used to have before using traditional hair dye. I only wish the semi-permanent color would last as long as a semi-permanent traditional hair dye. But it&#x27;s easy enough even for the busiest and not too messy.</li>
    <li> This is a disappointment ! I ordered it new...!!!  Box was crushed, directions were clearly all crumbled up on one side... Don&#x27;t know if it was tampered with will most like return it &amp; try one more time - maybe?</li>
    <li> I have think dark hair. it doesnt die my hair thoroughly,even though I slept overnight with it.</li>
    <li> WOW! I am still shocked. I loved the product. It was very easy to use. Color is pretty strong in a good way and it makes me happy that it is natural. I have tried powder henna before (the most natural Iranian henna to find) and the results would give me reddish-auburn results since my natural hair color is light brown and not dark or black. I always wanted to have natural black or at least dark brown hair but without dying it was not possible. We all know that dyes of major brands put too much chemicals in and therefore they are of serious harm. Henna is two in one: dye and food for the hair. The only bad thing i have to say about the product despite its coloring effectiveness, price and nature, that it was very hard to wash out. Some say they lost results after so many washes. I haven&#x27;t lost the color but i constantly see dark water dripping off my hair. Every time i wash my hair (and i have 3 times since dying process) i have seen some dark water dripping off my hair. It is not a big problem; just use dark towel to dry your hair and dont wear any whites if the rain is expected. LOL</li>
    <li> Surya Henna Cream vs Lush Henna&lt;br /&gt;I will update this in a week or 2, as its hardly fair to judge it on first application. I have naturally dark brown hair (almost black) with over 50% grey. For the past few years I have died it using a strong semi permanent at a salon. My hair was very dry and I was spending a fortune, so to economise, I remembered using Henna in my student days, and tried Lush Caca Brun mixed with Caca Noir. Process: grate 2 blocks Caca Noir and 1 Caca Brun pour over a shot of strong coffee, add boiling water, lemon juice and a glug of cider vinegar and stir vigorously (needed all the extra bits to make it take better - otherwise the effect on grey was minimal). Apply very quickly to hair, wrap in cling film, wrap head in a towel, leave overnight. Wash out with plain water and loads of conditioner.  This had the effect of a reddish brown on my new grey growth. The colour faded to a lighter more orangey red. The condition was amazing. Drawback was the lingering, overwhelming smell - really like compost and very strong. In any heat, the smell intensified, even a week after dying my hair. Also the colour wasn&#x27;t strong enough, but I reckoned I could try more black henna. I cant say it was a pleasant experience, but was far cheaper than salon, better for my hair and I liked the shine (friends started saying such lovely things about the colour and body - must have been a total state before). Trouble was I did kinda dread the whole palaver, and so left it too long between treatments (over 3 weeks). I was still toying with the idea of going back to the salon and getting lowlights to blend the new colour in better (bit of a challenge to my hairdresser, as henna penetrates the hair and makes it infinitely harder for other dyes to stick).&lt;br /&gt;Then I discovered this product. First off, it is a doddle to apply, and has no real smell. The gloves and hat in the kit are stupid - bin them - but for god&#x27;s sake use your own disposable rubber gloves. I ended up wrapping my head in clingfilm as the cap made everything more difficult. It wouldn&#x27;t drip very much, so I expect you could use an elasticated shower cap and it would be fine. Faffing around with the cap took too much time and my hair kept slipping out, EVERY part of skin it touched  - only for a minute while I wrestled with the cap - became STAINED. The stain took a fair bit of scrubbing with soap to come off! I left it for 2 hours or so rather than the recommended 30 minutes while I did chores. I thought this should be OK, as it is what they do in the salon with chemical dyes. It rinsed out well - I used a colourmate shampoo (by mistake - I was reaching for the conditioner) and then conditioner. My hair was not as beautifully conditioned as with the Lush Henna - I could feel that when I touched it even while it was still wet, but I dried it as normal, and the effect is lovely! It has better, darker grey coverage, it kind of sparkle glistens, and it is really shiney and full of body. It smells OK.&lt;br /&gt;I would advise anyone trying this product to go around their hairline with vaseline - particularly around the ears - as it is a very strong fast acting dye. The effect is semi permanent, so I am expecting it to fade gradually, so the &amp;#34;skunk line&amp;#34; everyone is talking about will be less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;This is really not a natural product - their are lots of chemical colourants in it, and some chemicals that are not good for you, so this is not the product for you if you are looking for something really healthy (such as the powder or block henna). However, if you just want a strong semi-permanent dye, this one works. It took far better than the over the counter semi-permanent dyes I bought in the pharmacy (L&#x27;Oreal) which only darkened my grey a little.&lt;br /&gt;I will come back to this review and update, and will probably upgrade the score. It is 3 stars as it is a chemical product rather than a natural one and the gloves and hat weren&#x27;t just useless, they were totally counter-productive, and because I don&#x27;t know yet how it&#x27;ll took in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to just for Men.  All natural,easy on the scalp and adapts to my brown hair</li>
    <li> washes out too soon.  It does not last more than a week or two.  If you wash your hair, it bye hair dye.</li>
    <li> I loved this henna dye it is awesome.  I&#x27;m pregnant and wanted to darken my hair but didn&#x27;t want to use a dye with harsh chemicals like ammonia and such. This stuff was perfect.  It barely had a smell at all.  I loved the color I used the dark brown and I had dark blonde hair before. The color came out beautiful, it made my hair dark brown with awesome highlights.  It wasn&#x27;t just a flat dark color that some hair dyes leave you with.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best grey coloring treatment that I have ever used. The product leaves hair soft and smooth. Worked well on natural tight curly hair. The results shown on the box are very exact. Long lasting color.</li>
    <li> Henna is good but hair will loose color after washing your hair 3 times</li>
    <li> This product is stupid. First, the instructions are not good, and then I hoped that the product would be good. But even the black hena just makes your hair a little gray or brown at best and fades away in a week. Am I supposed to apply it every week because that would be ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this henna cream for years and I can say that I am very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M  USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS AND VERY HAPPY. PRODUCT  CONSIST FROM NATURAL INGREDIENTS AND DON&#x27;T DAMAGE THE HAIR</li>
    <li> I have used it twice and love the results.  I have black hair and some gray.  The Black tone covers the gray and the color stays on a long time.  Looks natural aa grows out.  Hair is glossy and silky because of conditioners.  Since first time some hairs didn&#x27;t take,  I left it on 1.5 hrs the 2nd time and added a hat and heating pad.  Looks darker.  Safe for those with PPD allergies, like me.</li>
    <li> I am new to hair color except for some teenaged experiments with temporary dye capsules and the occasional youthful peroxide streak. My dark brown hair finally has too much gray, mostly in the front, so I bought the Surya Dark Brown thinking it would be safer than the usual boxed products. In reading up on it in here after I already used it, it became apparent that it&#x27;s a box of chemicals (albeit mostly naturally-derived) that happens to also contain henna; but it is not a pure henna dye. This matters.  I had a bad reaction yesterday just after doing a section in the front of my hair above my ear -- I developed the shakes and dizziness and felt short of breath for a few minutes. I had not had a lot of skin contact with the product, but I had noticed an odd chemical odor like a solvent, and I&#x27;m wondering if I reacted to something that I breathed in from the product. Has anyone else had this problem?  A week earlier I had done the skin test on my wrist and had no reaction and noticed no odor. Using the same bottle 2 days ago, I colored a small section of mostly gray hair on one side to see how it would come out. Since I liked the results, I used it again on the other side yesterday to cover some gray hair around my ear in front, and that&#x27;s when I noticed the odor and then had the dizzy spell a few minutes later. It was very scary and I was very close to calling 911. I washed the sections a couple of times to get some of the product out (although I really don&#x27;t want the gray back), drank about a liter of water, and then cut some of the hair that I&#x27;d dyed (I now have long bangs. My hairdresser will be pissed that I messed with her work, but I didn&#x27;t want the dyed hair to fall under my nose while I sleep.)  So, my verdict: My hair definitely looked better with this stuff in it. It didn&#x27;t give me 100% coverage, but it was a really big improvement. But use at your own risk if you&#x27;re someone who has chemical sensitivities. If I hadn&#x27;t had the dizzy spell, I would be a regular user, but now I&#x27;m afraid to try it again. Also, not that this matters given everything else, but I can&#x27;t figure out why people describe this product as smelling good. It seemed to smell like not much of anything until the bottle had sat around a few days after having been opened. Then it had a chemical smell to it.</li>
    <li> First time using Henna.  This was easy to use and my hair came out looking and feeling healthy.  My hair was previously professionally dyed but I&#x27;m trying to grow that out.  This covered very nicely!!  Super quick delivery also.</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing if you&#x27;re allergic to hair dyes. However, please do a test first. I made that mistake of not testing a DIFFERENT product that was labeled henna. I had to visit the er at the hospital the next day. So, please be cautious with whatever you chose.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I had started my henna project about a year ago and used some thing that was a green powder. It was more difficult to put on and took longer. This is so much better being a cream based product. I first bought it at a store and loved it so much that I stocked up through Amazon. The color holds for me about a month. I have grey roots to deal with and as time goes by that part of my hair will get a little lighter. But it really is more like highlights. At least I like to think so. I will continue using this products. The ease of use combined with the end result cannot be improved upon.</li>
    <li> I have died my hair with henna for several years now and I love how much healthier it leaves my hair than \\&quot;commercial\\&quot; dyes. It is however, a messy and time consuming task. Until this. If you want to try henna this is definitely the way to go! Hair feels great and looks great! Truly the best dye I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost a decade and have never been disappointed. Once, the supply once ran out everywhere. It seems a certain plant extract was unavailable for a short time, which held up production. At times, the texture of the product is more liquid than cream; the product seems to work best when the consistency is creamy. If you follow the directions, there are no stains, and the color lasts very well.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. I have a dye allergy but can use this so I am a happy customer.</li>
    <li> The color came out really natural! My natural hair color is light-medium brown, and the color came out a darker medium brown with a warm reddish tint. I love the color. It lasted only 2 and a half weeks for some reason. The item description really didn&#x27;t specify how long it&#x27;s supposed to last... But! the coloring looks natural, it&#x27;s easy to use, natural and no animal testing! I bought two boxes initially. If you are looking for something permanent, I&#x27;d stay away.</li>
    <li> I tried this las week for the first time and I absolutely love it.  It covered all my gray hair.  I have a lot in the front part, and it bothers me a lot.  I read in the instructions it´s got some chemical products, but I can take it! compared to the 100% chemical ones I have been using to cover my gray hair, this is the best.  Doesn´t smell, doesn´t fill funny in my sking and it removes easily from my skin (forehead and ears) and from my tub and sink.  Love it totally recomend it.</li>
    <li> This covers whites while maintaining a natural hair color. Super easy to use. I have shorter hair so have enough left for one or two more applications. Doesn&#x27;t smell and isn&#x27;t as toxic as other dyes.</li>
    <li> I made a mistake when I chose the product, because I never had used it in cream, only in powder.  I tryed to cancel the order but it was already sent.  Thank god that was not possible, because the product in cream is excellent, I love it.  Not smell, not dirty.  Cover grays hair excellent.  Great product.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is certainly NOT henna! Henna can only stain hair in one color: red-orange. Real henna comes from the Lawsonia Inermis plant and it only comes in powder form. Its ingredients are Lawsonia Inermis leaf powder and NOTHING else!!! This is purely compound henna, which is not henna at all and it does contain metallic salts which are carcinogens. I definitely do not recommend this product as it is not henna, but just an advertisement. If you want to buy henna, make sure that it is in powder form and that the ingredients list Lawsonia Inermis. Anything other than Lawsonia Inermis leaf powder if NOT henna!!!!</li>
    <li> This product does what it promises and I will never go back to hair dresser or drug store hair dyes again. It is totally chemical free, does not smell as bad as drug store brands, and is not abrasive on your hair. It leaves my hair nice and shiny. I have tried the powder form and prefer the liquid as it is easier to apply and sticks to the hair follicle a lot better.The only downfall is that is washes out with each shower - as evidenced by the tinted shower water. This is true of all Henna dyes and is not specific to this brand. On the upside, unlike drug store/hair dresser brands it can be reapplied as often as needed and you do not have to wait the typical 4-8 weeks.</li>
    <li> Dark brown gives you nearly a BLACK head of hair.  And, yes the instructions were followed to the letter and the hair was wrapped in plastic for not less than one hour - ewwwww uggghhhh</li>
    <li> This is the safest way to color your hair and it&#x27;s so easy to use. Hair color from the store is filled with chemicals and makes you hair dry out and feel like straw after a while.  Henna is actually healthier and safer for your hair. I also use it to boost my eyebrows.  I&#x27;ll never go back to salon or OTC hair color.  It&#x27;s about the same price as in the health store and the shipping cost is not too high.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for basic, simple hair dying. It doesn&#x27;t try out your hair like conventional products, and it&#x27;s easy to clean up after you&#x27;re done. You just need to let it soak in about 45 minutes to an hour after applying. A bottle is good for about two uses.</li>
    <li> I have been using this henna for a couple of years now. It is easy to use and the color is great! I have been using Chocolate, which is a nice brown with some red. It does get more red after several washes. This time I used Dark Brown and mixed a little of the Chocolate in. The color is beautiful! I have short hair and can get about 3 colorings from one bottle. Saves me tons of money doing this myself. Plus tipping money!!  My stylist who cuts my hair says the color is beautiful. If my hair feels a little dry i use a small dab of organic coconut oil after rinsing out color and when it is almost dry. Coconut oil is such great stuff....Surya Brasil and Coconut Oil. Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I will upgrade to a 5 star after a couple of weeks of using the mixed colors and it still looks good.</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use and covers gray well. I get multiple uses from a single bottle. Also because it is henna, there are no toxic chemicals.</li>
    <li> I use this in between my Powder form henna applications, does a good job and the color lasts for a month</li>
    <li> Great hair product! Gentle, easy to use and it delivers its promise of covering grey hair the first time you use it.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost two years - I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I discovered Surya hennas several years ago.  Started with Chocolate and have tried various colors to try to get my hair just the way I wanted it.  Smells good, easy to use, my hair was shiny, healthy, vibrant.  Very unfortunately, after using it sooo long it has turned my hair, more or less, permanently orange.  From what I&#x27;ve read lately, that&#x27;s what happens with prolonged henna use.  I can&#x27;t color over it, nothing &#x27;takes&#x27;.  I can&#x27;t get it washed all the way out, it just turned brighter orange :~(  So, for the time being at least, I&#x27;m no longer a brunette I&#x27;m trying to except that I have become a Red-head.</li>
    <li> Easiest application of henna, though dark brown didn&#x27;t cover gray as thoroughly as I would have liked and price is too high to me.</li>
    <li> I love the color and it was a very easy process. Clean up was very  easy, no stains on my skin or my sink. My only complaint is that I feel the color chart is a bit misleading.  My natural color is darker than that of the henna results color pictured on the chart, so I doubted this would have much effect on my hair.  It gave me a beautiful rich brown color.  Surya also left my hair feeling soft and healthy.  It was just a lot darker than I would have guessed based on the info in and on the package.  I will definitely order this product again, I just thought that warning was worth posting.</li>
    <li> Favorite.  Totally non-allergenic, can be used frequently.  Have used this a few years and will continue.  Good color chart, not a hideous red at all.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This ingredient, propylene glycol, is in Surya Henna which is listed as one of the top five toxic ingredients</li>
    <li> Tried this today for the first time, and I&#x27;m simply floored. Premature gray plagues my family, so, up until three years ago, I had been chemical salon dyeing for over 10yrs. Enough was enough, and I stopped for my pregnancy. After the awful growing out phase, I thought I would just embrace the gray. Well....that was until I discovered this product at the local Sprouts. I gave it a try and I&#x27;m sold. Even with chemical salons, my gray was stubborn and difficult to conceal. The neon white  coarse shaft rejected traditional dye, and I had to sit under heat for 90min. This henna color makes my gray look like high-end perfect blend highlights. There&#x27;s no nasty smell. My hair is silky and shiny. I keep going back in the mirror to look at it. Its really an excellent product. Oh, and I had never dyed my hair at home before using this. It was straightforward and easy to use. I put some lotion around my hair line and ears to protect my skin from staining. I read that tip somewhere else. Also make sure to wash your hair well before applying it. No oils or conditioner, or the product won&#x27;t work. Overall, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I do wish this lasted longer. It&#x27;s gone from my hair in about four to five washes. I wash every other day, but I feel that for the price of the product, that gets more steep than I&#x27;d like to pay. That&#x27;s a little more than two boxes a month. It&#x27;s not totally breaking the bank, but I can see that this would only get more expensive for longer/thicker hair (I have armpit-length hair at its longest point, very fine and thin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the conditioning effects; my hair feels like silk. It also feels just a tad thicker (this product does coat, after all). This color (Dark Brown) is gorgeous after the first wash - the very first application is a bit &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; (one-dimensional) and nearly black, but I have found that&#x27;s standard for any temporary color I&#x27;ve used. Afterward it&#x27;s just lovely. It does lighten a bit with each wash, but it&#x27;s an even lightening, never patchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch out for the color &amp;#34;running&amp;#34; after you wash your hair. I wear a dark towel until my hair no longer drips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind the frequent reapplications, this can be a very good product. Do note (as others here have stated) that it is not an &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; product.</li>
    <li> Very easy application, doesn&#x27;t damage hair,looks very natural. Nice break from harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> Lasts about 6-8 shampoos</li>
    <li> (EDIT: 2? Years later:) less enthused with this product. Color was good for 2 washing cycles. Could go 4 days btwn washing with dry curly hair and conditioner cowash but got sick of dying q two weeks. Having more grey (1/3?) now it just isn&#x27;t straightforward any more. Husband says stop it-- there is blond grey, red tinges in the older hair that remains after the dark brown fades, and if I look at the back of my hair, I see that. Looks like changing at this point to a permanent dye would be a risky chemistry project. Just got a bob cut to shed as much older hair as possible, 2 months since last color. Done with this product. May work for some. Temporarily if greying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(ORIGINAL REVIEW:) After 8 years of temporary coloring, I have settled on this product. I have dark, dark brown hair with resistant grays, and have tried henna powders (Light Mountain), henna bars (Lush), all natural henna cream (Logona), and the less-toxic than usual varieties of Clairol and Garnier temporary dyes (Natural Instincts, and something with bamboo that I can&#x27;t find anymore). Henna powders and bars are messy and time consuming. Logona henna cream didn&#x27;t work on my resistant grays, and the mainstream temporary dyes made my face itch and my scalp numb after using them for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, this product seems to strike a balance between pure henna and the mainstream temporary dyes. Yes, it has hair dye in it, but it does not have the worst ingredients that usually go with the dyes. I don&#x27;t react to it, and it doesn&#x27;t smell toxic or offensive. It works about as well for me as the Natural Instincts, and yet it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like straw the way the Natural Instincts does before slathering on that magic conditioner that sort of fixes the damage for a little while. In terms of toxicity, EWG Skin Deep Database rates it a 4/10, whereas other henna products rate 1-4, Light Mountain rates 0 (best rating possible), and Natural instincts rates 6. No, this isn&#x27;t for the absolute purist, but it may be a good match for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Avalon Organics Lemon Clarifying Shampoo prior to coloring and kept it on for the 60 min recommended for resistant grays.olute purist, but it may be a good match for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Avalon Organics Lemon Clarifying Shampoo prior to coloring and kept it on for the 60 min recommended for resistant grays.</li>
    <li> This did not irritate my skin like other hair colorings, but it washed right out the first time.  Didnt even last a day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used henna before and have found that it hasn&#x27;t covered my gray hairs. I have dark brown afro hair, with lots of white hairs. However,  with an allergy to permanent hair dye my options for coverage are limited. I took the advise of a fellow reviewer and shampooed my hair with lemon juice to clarify, then used a regular shampoo, towel dried my hair, applied half a bottle of the henna cream (I have short bobbed hair), left it for 40 mins, then hey presto after conditioning and blow drying NO GRAY HAIR! Plus no run off of dye onto my white cotton pillows. Very pleased with the product and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured fast delivery</li>
    <li> This product far surpasses the conventional hair dyes I have been using all my life.  I wish I&#x27;d have known about henna a long time ago.  The longer you leave this product on your hair, the more the conditioning properties can do their job.  My hair and scalp have never been this healthy, shiny AND, while I was experiencing hairloss BEFORE I started using this product, my hair is now growing back!  I am truly amazed by the benefits I have received from this product.  Everyone I have told about it, that have tried it, are now \\&quot;hooked\\&quot; too!</li>
    <li> This product is really great...it is easy to apply (you must wear gloves) and covers grey hair well.  I have a small portion of grey on the right side of my head underneath the hair (but it is really noticeable...) and this is the only henna product that covered it!  I have tried many other hennas, but this is the best.  I had to reapply after 5 weeks, and probably could&#x27;ve waited a bit, but I wanted my hair to look good for a wedding.  It also shines the hair and keeps it looking great.  I have longer than shoulder length hair and got two uses out of the one bottle.  It does bleed a bit in the shower when you wash (for a couple of times) after coloring. It also doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Love it!!</li>
    <li> The product is easy to use but it does not cover gray hair.  I have a lot of gray at my temples.  I tried this product 3 separate times.  I left it on over an hour and re applied warm towels over it and still the gray hair came out red.  The color was not a pretty red either, it was a Bozo the clown red color.  Absolutely horrible!!!    I&#x27;m so disappointed.  I was really looking for a natural, easy to use product to cover my grays.  This is NOT it!</li>
    <li> The product arrived as described.</li>
    <li> I had to use henna powder to cover the grey hair, because I have a very bad allergy to chemical dies.  It was a very messy process.  I was so happy to find this henna cream that I don&#x27;t have to keep on my hair for hours to get the coloring effect, like I did with powder.  Syria is a wonderful product: it colors quickly, with no mess and no damage to the hair!</li>
    <li> It looked good the first day I colored my hair.  After that the color completely washed away.  Very disappointing!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m highly allergic to every other dye out there and this is the only hair color I can use. I love it</li>
    <li> I was very surprised that this product works so well.  I&#x27;m about 30% gray and yes it does cover the gray in a deep rich dark brown color.&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo and work into hair.  I left mine on for 1 hour and then rinse out. I&#x27;ve washed it 6 times now and it seems to still be holding its color with no gray showing through. I&#x27;m amazed. It is watery though so it takes practice to not use too much.  I think if I&#x27;m careful next time I could get three applications from this bottle.</li>
    <li> Love it. Quick and natural way to dye my hair. Yes, no henna in it but i do not care much about it, it does not take hours to look good again. Be prepared to apply it every week though. My hair looks shiny, soft, color is rich, no red shades.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0007DHMH4 Surya Henna Dark Brown Cream 70 ML]]&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product.  This is an update to my earlier review 3 years ago.  I&#x27;ve now been using this product for over 5 years.  Yes, 5 years.  I use it per the instructions.  I leave it on for only 30 minutes.  All my grays are completely covered.  I have to use this once very 4 weeks.  Spending $10 and 45 minutes of my time is much better than the $85 I was spending at the salon.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product to hide her gray hairs and swears by it. Hides her age very well, even though I know how old she is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly a year and was fairly happy with the color and the coverage.  Two months ago I received a new shipment of 8 bottles (I can get it cheaper this way online) and suddenly there is no longer any gray coverage, or practically none, even after a  little more than an hour on my head.  Also, my hair has started breaking in all kinds of strange places and falling out in large amounts, as if there has been damage to the hair itself.  I may have to get all my hair cut off it is so frizzy and uneven, when I never had frizzy hair before.  I followed the directions to the letter.  Anyone else having these kinds of issues?  Did I get a bad batch? I don&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite hair dye.  It&#x27;s not very stable, that&#x27;s true, however the hair is very healthy after it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for years already and not going to change.</li>
    <li> Using this product in regular basis.  Color is rich and even!!  Easy to apply, fast shipping!  The price is quite expensive.</li>
    <li> I love the way this covers the gray, but I have run-off color for the first 7 - 10 washes.  It&#x27;s easy to use and the color is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years on my medium curly hair. My hairdresser was uncomfortable applying henna on top of all the chemical dye (and bleach) she had been using on my hair for over a year to cover gray. I switched to henna on my own after a few months&#x27; hiatus from permanent dyes. Trying various types (forget the powder-it&#x27;s too messy and iffy for color), none of the hennas caused adverse effect to my hair. Surya Henna was the only henna that covered all my gray immediately. My hair was fabulously shiny! Once a month treatment keeps my gray at bay (approximately the same amount of time to touch up chemical dyes for my hair). Rinse color out of hair well to reduce staining on your pillow. But it is easily washed out of anything that gets stained. If you use a clarifier before shampooing your hair (like lemon juice and water) the henna connects with the hair better, and there is significantly less runoff of color. This is temporary color, so each time you wash your hair henna will rinse out as well. If for nothing else but shine, a once a month treatment will do wonders for hair!</li>
    <li> This product is a great alternative to the powder kind that must be mixed together.  It&#x27;s easy to use and looks great.  I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I really like this.  I&#x27;ve used it once so far, so I will report back only if I change my mind, but I do like this product so far.  I had to stop using any and all forms of hair dye because I developed an allergy and my scalp got extremely irritated.  Therefore, I searched and researched to find henna.  I have been using powder form and mixing it, but the results are different from application to application.  This went on very easy and I liked the coverage on my very gray roots, more than the powder kind.  To keep my color lasting longer, I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, but am fortunate to only have to do it like every 4 days.  Also, I&#x27;m trying only using a conditioner to wash my hair, so we&#x27;ll see how that fares in terms of the color lasting longer or not.  I read the others reviews and some say that this doesn&#x27;t rate well on the cosmetic database website.  Actually, I live by that site and this product didn&#x27;t show up.  So I looked up each ingredient and only one was like a 5.  The rest were safe.  Compared to how toxic hair dye is, I don&#x27;t care about one thing in it.  I know this is way safer.  Like I said, I liked this better than powder.  Seems to cover better and is easier to apply.</li>
    <li> This is the best henna product out there. Trust me, I have been using henna for years and years and I&#x27;ve tried every brand. This is the best because:  -it has the same benefits as normal henna, natural dye thats good for your hair and helps it grow  -it has the same texture as no drip hair dye as opposed to the make it yourself messy mud that runs and glops all over everything! great coverage  -it has an amazing smell thats nothing like the hair or manure smell of the green mud  -instead of turning my white hair hot pink or scary orange it actually covered 100% dark brown  -my hair feels and looks amazing, I think it even helped my split ends  -it is cheaper!  I will never use another product on my hair ever again. I am hooked! Surya, thank you so much for an awesome product.</li>
    <li> reliable product  safe  and organic  highly recommend  better than ammonia products  tried in past  does not dry out hair  natural&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ingredients  help hair health  and scalp</li>
    <li> Love this product for now on is the only hair dye color i am going to use. Commercial colors dry always my hair, no this one, all natural with the benefits of henna and many super natural good herb. Did I mention it cover/blend well greys! The bottle is quite small though I will say first user with roots to cover should get bottles, for roots only one is enough.</li>
    <li> The trick to making this stuff cover your greys is to leave it on for a really long time. I have to leave it on my hair for 2 to 3 hours. Others have told me they leave it on for 1.5 to two hours. I met a sales rep who works for Surya who says she leaves hers on all night while she sleeps and washes it off the next morning. So you really have to leave it on a long time. Otherwise, I strictly follows the directions Surya provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO - right before applying the cream, wash and rinse your hair twice with warm water and shampoo (I like to use the Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treat) but do NOT use conditioner or any other product on your hair. Towel dry your hair, then apply henna while hair is still a bit warm and slight damp/towel dried from washing. If you have any product on your hair it won&#x27;t work well at all. So shampoo twice to make sure your hair is totally clean, towel dry, then apply henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long (a few inches past my shoulders) very VERY thick medium brown hair with lots of grey coming in (I&#x27;m almost 40 years old). I used to go to salons, or I would do box color from the store. My scalp started itching the last few times I colored (both salon and box), so I began to worry that I was developing an allergy to the toxic chemicals in conventional hair color. I was especially concerned about the PPD in conventional hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I began looking around for alternatives. I was in a health food store and met a sales rep who was demo&#x27;ing this Surya henna hair cream. Her hair was beautiful, she said she had greys like mine, and she was much older than me but all her greys were covered. She let me touch her hair and it was so smooth and silky. So, she sold me! I bought two boxes thinking that my hair was so thick and long I would need two. The sales rep said I would probably do OK with one, but I figured I&#x27;d rather have too much than not enough. Also, the cream keeps, so whatever I didn&#x27;t use I could save to touch up the roots or use later. The sales rep recommended the dark brown color for my hair, but I was afraid it was going to be too dark so I opted for light brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went home and colored my hair for the first time with the surya henna cream in light brown. And she was right - I only needed one box. :) I loved the way it made my hair look and feel, and I also found it really easy to use. My scalp did not itch at all, in fact it felt nourished and clean, and also it didn&#x27;t smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continued to use the light brown Surya henna cream for several months. I really liked it, but it didn&#x27;t cover my greys completely even though I did do everything I mentioned above (wash hair twice, no conditioner, left it on for at least two hours, etc.). It covered them, but they were noticeably a different shade of brown than the rest of my hair. For some people these might be attractive highlights, but I didn&#x27;t like how it looked on me after 4 or 5 days. (I shampoo every day. If you can shampoo less frequently then the color would not fade as fast as mine.) Also, as the product started to fade - and this product will fade faster than conventional hair dye - the greys actually started to take on a sort of pink&#x27;ish color which was weird. So anyway, since I&#x27;m one of those people that really needs to wash my hair every day, the color faded fast on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was actually really happy with using the Light Brown Surya Henna Cream once a week. It is just as easy to use as the box color you can buy at the grocery store, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all and it also actually conditions your hair. Every weekend I would color my hair with the surya. I&#x27;d wash my hair twice, towel dry my hair, apply the surya cream, wrap my head with the hair cap that is provided for you in the box, then I would wrap my head again with an old towel. Then I would sit and watch Netflix or a movie for two or three hours. Then I would rinse out the henna cream, condition with a Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treatconditioner that I really love, then I would towel dry my hair and then I would blow dry my hair. The sales rep lady had told me that if you blow dry your hair the color won&#x27;t get on your sheets and pillowcases and clothes and stuff after you color. I have found this to be true. Once dried, my hair is silky smooth and so soft and the color is refreshed and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did that every Friday, once a week, and my hair looked great. But recently I decided to switch to the dark brown color instead of the light brown color to see if the sales rep&#x27;s suggestion would be a better choice. And it is. :) The dark brown lasts two weeks on my hair, and covers my greys much better, and the color doesn&#x27;t fade as fast on me. So I&#x27;ll be doing the dark brown surya henna cream from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing that I forgot to mention: right before you apply the henna cream, put some face cream on (or sometimes I use jojoba oil or olive oil) especially around the edges of your face and on your ears. This helps keep the color from coloring your skin. :) I forgot to do this once, and so I had color on my ears and around the edges of my face for about a day. It does wash off easily, but that&#x27;s just a tip that works well. :) Vaseline or unpetroleum jelly or something would probably work well, too.conditioner that I really love, then I would towel dry my hair and then I would blow dry my hair.

    <li> This product works; it is the best of the natural dyes! It will indeed make hair dark brown (red undertone) when combined 1/2 and 1/2 with black.  Will fade; you need to use this product every 2-4 weeks to maintain the richness.  If you have well water, wash out the minerals first.&lt;br /&gt;Conversely, &amp;#34;Palette by Nature&amp;#34; is at the bottom of natural hair dye; no dye effect whatsoever except to turn your scalp blue for two weeks.  It was ultra-drying as if my hair had been treated with peroxide... and it costs double!  The company was untrustworthy.  Buyer beware.  I am so happy to be back with Surya Henna!</li>
    <li> i applied 2 days in a row and went over the recommended application time to make sure it was in there. followed all steps. looked great right after application, but it seems to just wash out very quickly if you are going to be brushing or combing at all, which i assume most are. ill have to find another product instead.</li>
    <li> Does not work on grays at all. I would leave it on for hours and hours...guess what, gray hair is still there.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive on my scalp and thought I could not Dye my grey hair ever again-It was devistating I was not ready to go grey. I found this hair dye and it saved me and my hair. I get my grey covered and my scalp stays Healthy.</li>
    <li> ThisGREAT product is wonderful  easy to use and I have great results and my hair looks awesome! GREAT GREAT GREAT</li>
    <li> Love this Henna Cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I buy the chocolate and dark brown. Both are beautiful colors and they really change your hair texture and make it super soft and shiny. It&#x27;s like a rescue for your hair. I use it more as a treatment. This product has saved my hair from chemical hair dye mistakes. I find that after years of using this product, the best results are to keep the cream in your hair for the full 60 minutes but 45 is fine too. I think the color lasts longer and it&#x27;s shinier and richer.</li>
    <li> Had to blend with black to get good coverage...love the product, but the dark brown fades very quickly if used alone.</li>
    <li> Love Surya products. My hair looks and feels great after every dying.</li>
    <li> I no longer use this product.It did cover my grays, but replaced them with a red color that I did not like. As it oxidized the red got brighter.  6 months  later the hair is still red. The dye  does not wash out completely and I have brown hair with gray and red stripes. If you like  the colors that Henna will produce in your hair, then this is an easy product to use. It did to not cause the allergic reaction I used to  have to ordinary hair dyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using Surya Cream Henna for about six months. It is the best color, ease of use and non damaging hair color I have found that for at home use. It beats $80 dollars at a salon every three weeks and in my opinion far superior to any box dye I picked up at the local super market. My husband has noticed the texture/softness of my hair continues to improve. Is it perfect? Nope. Close enough for me.</li>
    <li> Liquid Henna hair color &#x3D; genius! No grit, smell or mixing needed AND still chemical free. This is the best hair color I have ever used and I highly recommend the product. I have short hair and one bottle is enough for two applications. My hair is healthy and shiny and there is minimal color transfer post.</li>
    <li> By far the worst hair color I have used for the past 15 years. A couple of days after my wife applied it per instruction, my color started to fade and in a matter of a couple of weeks, I can see my grey hair is starting to take over the dark brown color of Surya. Will never buy nor recommend the product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> An awesome products that fullfilled my requirement.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for two reasons: Lush&#x27;s henna is expensive, and it takes three, four hour applications to get the shade I want. I checked the reviews and Surya seemed pretty awesome, only an hour and it comes premixed. Hell yeah. I&#x27;m allergic to permanent and semi-permanent chemical dyes, so I&#x27;m limited to what I can do.&lt;br /&gt;Cut to six months later: No other dye will stay in my hair. Nothing, Lush, not even Manic Panic will stick to my strands. I&#x27;ve washed with cleansing shampoos, and I even tried Pert, and this stuff is still slowly bleeding out. I wasted 3/4 of a block of Lush trying to get my hair back to one color.&lt;br /&gt;So until I either shave it all in an uncontrollable rage, or the last remains of this dye that Satan himself must have spawned seep out, I&#x27;m stuck with black ends and mousy brown roots.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not even joking. This has been the worst thing I&#x27;ve put on my head since animal placenta.</li>
    <li> This is the best henna ever!</li>
    <li> The &#x27;dark brown&#x27; product produces an allergic reaction while the &#x27;light brown&#x27; does not.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s natural and works well.</li>
    <li> I loved it because it wasn&#x27;t as messy and I didn&#x27;t have to mix anything into it and I didn&#x27;t have to have it  on my head for 6 hours. 30 minutes and I was done. The plus is it is henna and has nice shine to it.</li>
    <li> My Mother had used other kinds of Henna years ago but stopped because it was too time consuming and messy!  So when I spotted Surya Henna Cream on line, I phoned her and she said she&#x27;d like to try it out.  She Loved it and recommends it to anyone who wants to gently color their hair.</li>
    <li> Love...Love ...Love this product!!! The coverage is amazing and my hair has never  looked healthier!! I am always getting  compliments about how shiny,and beautiful my hair is. I have been using this product for about a year and I will continue to use it. By far the best color I have ever used!!!</li>
    <li> I like Surya BrasilCream because it coats my hair and leaves it shiny and silky smooth. Over the counter colors always make my hair feel this and brittle. I like that it is natural and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. Always a nice color.</li>
    <li> This product will not last long. You have to color your hair every four to five weeks.</li>
    <li> Coloring and treating your hair!</li>
    <li> I use this mixed with the black version (1:1 ratio). I follow the instructions and it gives a nice shine and if sort of like a treatment. I can&#x27;t speak to the coverage as I don&#x27;t have grey hair. I use this every 6-12 months in get into practice once I do have some greys peaking through</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this henna for years. I love it. My very stubborn greys at my temple require a treatment every 2-3 wks but otherwise once per 6 months is adequate.</li>
    <li> ...it lasted longer. I have been using for about six months. But have to refresh every week. Aside from that, it does leave my hair soft and full of body. The color has a slight reddish tinge in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;As of 5/12, I do not see the dangerous ingredient she mentions on the package. The list of ingredients may have some non organic dyes, but no where is there listed the dangerous ingredient she mentions, and I have looked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the black henna for about a year. I&#x27;m very satisfied. I&#x27;m a black man with about twenty-five percent gray and I&#x27;m allergic to chemicals. This product works better than anything else that I&#x27;ve tried. And it&#x27;s so simple to use. I only wished it lasted longer especially for facial hair.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this for decades. First discovered it to replace color that made her sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She receives many complements on the natural look. Color lasts a week. Uses half bottle each time. She does the coloring at home and says easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this at my local health food store. I have white hair and had been using a permanent dye to color my hair dark reddish brown, almost black. My purpose for getting this was to let my hair grow out without a &#x27;line&#x27;.     The dark brown cream gave my roots a deep reddish brown color (not quite as dark as I had it, but pretty close to what the box showed), so the roots aren&#x27;t noticeable unless you&#x27;re looking for it. I&#x27;ve washed it once so far and it hasn&#x27;t washed out. I left it on twice as long as what it said to.    I like it that I can reapply this at any time and it made my hair very soft.</li>
    <li> I did not believe in Henna and I have changed my mind after this product. it is easy to use and looked great on me. Planning on using this regularly.</li>
    <li> the only reason i give it 4 stars is because it stains your skin and quickly. beautiful color, and great grey coverage. also made my hair silky. i love this and will never chemical dye my hair again inshallah</li>
    <li> I love the product and it was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 2 months now. I used the organic premanent color and experienced hair loss! Regular hair color (root touch up) burned my hair! On the box it tells you how your gray will be covered. It will not be dyed the color of  your hair but one or two shades lighter. I don&#x27;t mind because I don&#x27;t have that much gray, just some around my temples. The product covers them and they look like highlights in my hair. It also leaves my hair soft, silky and shiny. I wash my hair with shampoo, then rinse with a combination of vinegar &amp; lemon juice before I apply the henna.  The color seems to hold longer. I also avoid washing my hair with too hot of water. This makes the color rinse out sooner. You can also avoid  haviing to color sooner than two weeks by leaving it on longer and washing your hair only once or twice a week inbetween coloring. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> The good news, the product left my hair really soft and in good condition. The bad news is that it left my gray hair at the roots orangy-yellow. If I try the color again. I would try black for just my roots.</li>
    <li> nOW IS NO GOOD AS BEFORE MY HAIR IS SO RED NOT IS DARK BROWN ANYMORE I AM NOT BUY IT ANY MORE I DONT LIKE RED HAIR</li>
    <li> First of all let me say that the only reason I started using Surya ( I use the Black shade) is because ( after many years of using traditional hair color ( not henna ) ) I developed a severe rash to  PPD. I was in a panic because I was not ready to &#x27;go gray&#x27; and I didn&#x27;t have a clue what I was going to do. The first time I used Surya I was not pleased with the results as it didn&#x27;t cover the gray. However, I re-read the directions which says to shampoo your hair before applying  the henna and after applying wrap it up in a plastic cap, and let it sit for a few hours, which I did. Then you simply rinse it out, but do not apply any conditioner! I don&#x27;t know if the directions say this, but it has worked for me as I think the chemicals in the conditioner may affect the color in someway. Also I use a natural shampoo ( Aveda). I have been extremely pleased with the results. My hair has grown! I have ethnic hair and I do relax it, but my hair is such I don&#x27;t have to relax it often. The relaxer did affect the color, so I wait to relax my hair when the henna color has faded and of course wait a few weeks after the relaxer to continue coloring my hair... I also use a flat iron on my hair which of course for ethnic hair the heat can damage the ends with conditioner, so I use a product called Savannah Beeswax for Hands ( which I apply just a dap on my hair, right at the roots and a bit on the ends as I flat iron and like I say my hair has grown. But the best part is that I have not been ( knock on wood ) allergic to the henna to which I&#x27;m very very grateful..&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dark and the henna black color does give it a redish tone, and I can live with that, however  I&#x27;d like my hair to be a dark brown, and I did use the dark brown, but I didn&#x27;t like it...  and while Surya may not be all natural like some of the comments made, I haven&#x27;t had any allergic reaction to it, so it has worked wonderfully for me....</li>
    <li> I love that it covers my gray, but gives a natural look....not flat looking like the permanent colors, where the hair looks the same color throughout.  The grays come out with a lighter tint of brown (deep honey blonde), like I had my hair streaked!  And the ingredients are mostly natural, so I am very happy with it.  I have been using it for several years now.  There is not much of an odor either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried using the powder henna, which was terribly messy and time-consuming.  However, if I loved the results, I would have continued using it, but my hair kept getting more and more red with each successive application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I went back to Sureyea and am satisfied.  The other thing that is nice about this dye over other semi-permanents, is that even when it washes out, it never washes out completely.  It still leaves a tint to my hair, so that my greys never look \\&quot;grey.\\&quot;  They look more honey-blonde.  So you do wind up with \\&quot;roots\\&quot; as you do with permanent dyes, but it is not such a strong line of demarcation .  I touch up my roots around 4 weeks with the Suryea, so that I can go longer without doing the whole head of hair.  However, doing the whole head does give you more depth to the rest of the hair, as well as more life and luster.</li>
    <li> Really easy, no-mess way to dye my hair. I bought this to cover up my old highlights as they grew out. Left it in for about three hours. The color was great and the conditioning made my hair look amazing shiny and smooth for a good couple of days. It was a nice, subtle transition from my natural black to dark brown. Unfortunately it gradually washed out and 3 weeks later, my highlights are showing through just like before. It&#x27;s also annoying to see spots of leaked henna on my towels and clothes every time my hair gets wet. I know henna can be temporary, but at this price I was expecting more longevity.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and much better for your hair than mainstream commercial dyes. But the last time I bought from this vendor it came watered down. I assume that saves them money but it didn&#x27;t last as long and made application messy. Since the bottle isn&#x27;t hermetically sealed I assume they can water it down as much as they want. Good product when store bought. I will have to try another online vendor to see if it was just a one time quality problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now after I developed sever reactions to the Chemicals found in Hair Colors. While I&#x27;d rather still be using my favorite hair color... this product works and insures that I don&#x27;t look old before my time.</li>
    <li> I bought this henna cream after having two months of out-of-the-blue intense sensitivity to every product I used - whether new, or tried and true. My face just suddenly \\&quot;rejected\\&quot; my makeup, face wash, moisturizer, etc. and in the end, I developed eczema for the first time at 58 years old! Through all of this, I decided to seek out beauty products containing less allergens and chemicals, to try to avoid the same type of hyper-reaction, with natural shampoo, soap and the like.  Although I hadn&#x27;t had a reaction to traditional hair dye, I decided to try this to avoid that altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surya henna cream is fantastic!  It&#x27;s as easy to use as regular hair color.  The process is the same except for the timing - this stays on for 60 vs. 35 minutes with hair dye. I&#x27;m using Dark Brown and the color at first is extremely dark, though not black, but it&#x27;s fine with me. I wash my hair every day, or 2x if it&#x27;s a gym day, so it lightens daily. I&#x27;ve been doing it regularly every 2 weeks but could stretch it to 3 if necessary. One of my pet peeves with hair dye is the brassiness that occurs after a few weeks. So far, I haven&#x27;t seen that with this product!  I do get some reddish highlights, and I think my grays might be the red ones, but I never get that horrible orange color as it wears out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given up conditioner because the henna makes hair very soft and more conditioning makes it too soft to style. I&#x27;m happy with the grey coverage too; I&#x27;m also more forgiving if a few greys peek through seeing as how I&#x27;m not putting potentially harmful chemicals on my head. All in all, I&#x27;m 100% happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after using a few months: I switched from Dark Brown to Chocolate (one shade lighter) because there seemed to be some cumulative increase in the darkness of the brown, where it was more black for the first week, rather than brown. Tried the Chocolate and it did the trick.</li>
    <li> This has been the best organic hair dye for my Mom. Looks great on her and covers the grey</li>
    <li> Love the quick delivery of this great product. I am allergic to other hair dyes. This one works great!</li>
    <li> Hi, I used this product several times and followed as directed.  This is definitely not a replacement for drugstore hair dyes as it does not work.  If you shampoo your hair the dye simply comes off.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for those of us allergic to black/dark hair dyes! Smells good and leaves hair shiny. Be warned that it does wash out over a few weeks as it is not permanent. I use sulfate free shampoo to slow that down and don&#x27;t shampoo every day.</li>
    <li> easy to do at home and doesn&#x27;t damage your hair</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the negative reviews! I am VERY picky about my hair. I have an absolute ton of dark, wavy, super thick hair. I began going gray early and then I found out I am allergic to hair dyes and gluten. I was desperate to find something to help me not look like a grandma when I still have babies. This product WORKS! And it is NOT full of dangerous ingredients! And the bottle is NOT tiny! I get two applications out of every bottle, and believe me when I tell you, every time I get my hair cut I am told I have more hair than anyone they have ever done before. I use this once a month. Yes with each wash, it probably rinses out a little bit more until you need to use it again. But it certainly doesn&#x27;t wash out immediately. My gray is covered and I don&#x27;t need to use it again for another month. And I do have almost 50% gray at this point. I use the dark brown. It has no awful odor, I actually like the smell. I leave it on for 60 minutes every time. I start at the roots and pull it down through my hair with my fingers. I use half a bottle each time. My hair is not pink, and certainly not dry!! In fact, it&#x27;s softer after use so I actually prefer my hair when this is on it. It makes my hair shiny, soft and feels even thicker actually. This product is not permanent hair color. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, then go purchase some. But for those of us that cannot use permanent hair color unless we want to wind up in the hospital, this is a great product. I have been using it for FOUR years before leaving this review. So I feel I am familiar with it enough to recommend it.</li>
    <li> nah. does not live up to claims.</li>
    <li> I skipped this product before based on a review that was written in 2007 that it had all these chemical ingredients. I decided to buy it now based on the comments and reviews that the chemical ingredients are no longer in the product and the formulation has changed. The new reviews and comments were right and I&#x27;m glad that I took a chance. I have long past shoulder, thick dark brown hair, straight with some little curls, and flyaways when it&#x27;s dry and unstyled. I used to get salon highlights every 6 months and root touch ups using clairol. I stopped all that and I haven&#x27;t used any hair dyes or highlights on my hair for 4 years now. But my grey hair has been showing quite a bit especially on the front and it&#x27;s now 30% showing. So moving on to using this product, I did a 30 minute skin test although the instructions said to do the skin test for 24 hours. I would do the 24 hours skin test if you&#x27;re unsure and just to be on the safe side. I haven&#x27;t washed my hair for 3 days and I used kiss my face whenever shampoo to wash my hair. I toweled dry my hair and dumped half of the already premixed henna bottle into a plastic bowl. I used a hair color brush to apply the henna and concentrated on my grey areas. I also didn&#x27;t want the henna to go on my scalp so the brush helped in controlling the application. The henna was slightly thick so there was no dripping problem. The product came with a plain bag to cover your hair after the henna application. I used a shower cap instead because I prefer the elastics on the shower cap to hold my hair together. I waited for 60 minutes and rinsed my hair with cold water. My grey hair is 95% dark brown now. The rest of the stubborn grey is light brown which is still not bad. My hair also has a nice shine when it dried. Overall, a good product to cover grey hair with natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Plan on not washing your hair for several days after applying. Color blended perfectly but I will be trying something different soon.</li>
    <li> My mom and I have been using this product for quite some time. It&#x27;s a great natural cover for grey hair and very easily used. It comes with gloves and head wrap but you will need a comb to separate your hair when dying. You may also want to get tighter/fitted gloves and a shower cap instead.&lt;br /&gt;The dye spreads easily, the instructions are very clear and easy to follow, the color penetrates well and works as a semi-permanent dye with natural grow out. All henna dyes are reddish in nature, even the dark brown and black have a reddish tint. You can often find cheaper prices at natural food markets or area specialty stores but the convenience of amazon delivery can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I have always brought this item and never had a problem but the last product i bought it was watery it looks like it was watered down it wasn&#x27;t the creamy product i normally buy from amazon. what happen to this product i dont know but i threw it out</li>
    <li> A bit messy but worth the trade off not to be using chemicals. Easier to use than the typical henna that comes in powder form and you don&#x27;t need to keep it on as long as the powder kind.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use,  and it really works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this same brand&#x27;s mahogany color of henna dye for about 3 years now. Decided to mix it with dark brown for a more auburn look for winter. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed, the hennas mixed without a problem and the color turned out beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;Fair warning: this color will turn out very dark at first, almost black. After a few washes it will lighten up to dark brown. If you want to avoid this, I would recommend mixing with conditioner and saving the remaining dye for root touch-ups.</li>
    <li> This product is so awesome!  I am graying so I used it to cover the grey.  Works incredible for being an a natural coloring product. Colored my hair and not my skin which was night since I did it in the shower.  Lasts about 4 weeks  AND it is NATURAL</li>
    <li> I bough this product because i have developed allergies to regular hair color in the market i was looking for something natural. However, this product is not natural and contains many chemicals.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, covers gray hairs and looks natural. I don&#x27;t have to touch up because the color rinses off gradually. Lasts 4-6 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have been using Surya for years. It works well for me. I ordered several boxes from Amazon only because my local store was out and could not get more for 3 wks.  I do not know if the boxes I received were too old? had been left in an overheated truck or warehouse where they baked??  or were perhaps left in some extended freezing cold?  What I do know is that the content in the bottles were curdled. There were several lumps that would not mix.  Nothing I did could get them to dissolve. The consistency of the hair color liquid should flow like olive oil. What I got was in the direction of cottage cheese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself when I do use a \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; undamaged one, I am pleased with both its ease and color. My hair comes out smoother than usual and not dry as other reviews have mentioned. I am trouble and rethinking the use of this product specifically because it does have some harsh chems, tho fewer than most  other hair coloring treatments. For now, Im still hooked on its great texture, ease of application and the color itself. But I will start sampling other, completely healthy hair products next month.</li>
    <li> I am about 60% gray, and color my hair professionally every 5-6 weeks. I was sold this henna cream by a lady in Whole Foods convincing me that it was all natural and I would love it!  I asked if it was ok with color treated hair, and she reassured me that it was. She said it would naturally wash out showing my natural highlights I already had.&lt;br /&gt;I AM DEVASTATED at what it did to my hair!  My hair stylist said the PH of my hair is ruined and she couldn&#x27;t add my usual permanent color to my hair because it would burn my hair. My hair is already fried and so damaged!!  From the first time I did my hair after using the Henna cream, my hair was fried and stuff. It would literally break/rip off when I tried to comb it. I am very very sad!  DONT USE THIS PRODUCT!!  Wish I would&#x27;ve known.  Now my hair must grow out new hair before it will be normal again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product.  Leaves hair soft and manageable.  Easy application with no drippy mess.  Color looks natural and lasts 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t rate things but I&#x27;m in love. Not only does my hair feel amazing it smells amazing as well.</li>
    <li> Hate it, washes out quickly and does not cover grays long enough. It&#x27;s messy and although it&#x27;s organic, it just doesn&#x27;t last</li>
    <li> excellent product; covers the gray.</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling soft and shiny</li>
    <li> I adore the glow and the shine this will give me. But it&#x27;s pretty much done after 2 weeks, and the gay hair coverage isn&#x27;t the best. I still like to apply when I&#x27;m about to go on vacation, or have an event coming up, as the color is really pretty. Oh, one thing I adore about this is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a line when hair grows, it just fades evenly away.</li>
    <li> YES THE PRODUCT DOES CONTAIN:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HC Blue 2&lt;br /&gt;HC Yellow 5&lt;br /&gt;HC Red 3&lt;br /&gt;HC Yellow 2&lt;br /&gt;HC Yellow 4&lt;br /&gt;HC Red 1&lt;br /&gt;Disperse Violet 1&lt;br /&gt;HC Violet 14 D&lt;br /&gt;Disperse Black&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT YOU MAY COMPARE IT TO FOOD COLORING BUT FOR THE HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;THEY USE THE MILDEST DYE OF ALL DYES IN THE PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;WOMAN WHO ARE PREGNANT, OR HAVE SENSITIVE SCALP OR ARE ALLERGIC&lt;br /&gt;TO SPECIFIC ELEMENTS ARE STILL ABLE TO USE THE PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CREAM: MORE OF A DEEP CONDITIONING TREATMENT (LASTS UP TO 7-10 SHAMPOO WASHES)&lt;br /&gt;POWDER: MORE FOR COLOR (LAST UP TO 20-30 SHAMOO WASHES)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR BETTER RESULTS - LEAVE IT IN A LITTLE MORE LONGER - ABOUT 20-30 MIN MORE</li>
    <li> It does my hair wonderful, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I have been using it now for over a year. I have a severe allergy [pus on the scalp, sores, whelps on the skin, swelling on the face] to the chemicals in hair color. When I found this product it took me two months to try it as I was very afraid of what would happen. When I finally did I was not only surprised that I had no reaction but the color is beautiful. If you have allergic reactions to regular hair color you must try this product, it changed my life. I was using pure henna before this. If you have used henna you know what a long messy process that can be. It covers my gray in one application and I have quite a bit of gray in the front and around the edges.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t color my hair at all.  I tried it for the first time &amp; followed all directions exactly, but color didn&#x27;t stay in my hair.</li>
    <li> Nurishing for my hair.  adds shine covers few  grays that I have</li>
    <li> I love this product it&#x27;s brilliant and exactly that I wanted!</li>
