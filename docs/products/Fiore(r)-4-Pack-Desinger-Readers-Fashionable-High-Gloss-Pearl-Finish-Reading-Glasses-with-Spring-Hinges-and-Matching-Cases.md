<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the glasses and the colors!! Reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> Very festive and attractive.  They make getting old and needing reading glasses look very cool.</li>
    <li> Best deal on Amazon. Glasses are sturdy and fun. I have received many compliments. I now have a pair in my purse, my office, upstairs and downstairs</li>
    <li> High quality readers!  Fun colors go with everything.  Nice quality hinges and sturdy design.  Enough pairs to have at home, work, purse &amp; car.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The glasses are of high quality and fashionable.  I highly recommend them because they are a good value and they are quite the statement that I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have bought many readers through the past few years as my eyes have changed.  Some have such poorly made lenses that I cannot see anything through them.  These glasses seem to have a well made lens.  They are easy to see with.  They are well made and hold up to my abuse.  Also, they are comfortable to wear and perch nicely atop my head when not needed.  I love the varied colors in order to have a pair in multiple places and know where the pair in my hand belongs just by its color.  THe stripes are very stylish and I have had many compliments on them.</li>
    <li> Order arrived promptly and my wife loves these glasses (they were a Christmas present).  I was surprised that the cases were color coordinated with the glasses.  They look good on my wife no matter what color of clothes she has on.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> Pretty much what you expect out of readers. Comfortable and good quality glass. I don&#x27;t think the colors look as different from each other as they do in the photos but I like them.</li>

I recommend this product - high quality frames, exceptionally clear lenses.  I use mine everyday and I am very impressed with the quality and the price of this product.</li>
    <li> High quality, nice colors, power exactly right per my eye Dr.  I love the 4 pack as there is always a pair nearby. My only suggestion would be to vary the designs within the 4 pack. That would warrant 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Fun glasses! Fast service!</li>
    <li> Totally love my glasses I will be sure to order from you in the future.  Thanks so much</li>
    <li> I love these glasses.  So fun!  If you need them, at least enjoy wearing them!</li>

    <li> I went shopping at CVS for a pair of reading glasses, and found one pair that looked ok, and the price was 27.99. After coming home I thought, why didn&#x27;t I check Amazon? That is where I found these glasses, 4 different colors, for less than the one pair I found at CVS. When they came, I was thrilled with the quality, and now I have reading glasses all over the house.</li>
    <li> Love these!!! Colorful and they seem to be put together well.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about ordering these because I have gotten low quality readers from TJMax that looked so nice at the checkout.  But thought I would give these a try.  I really love them and even ordered a pack for my friend&#x27;s birthday.  :)  You will be happy with these.</li>
    <li> Would buy a dozen! Cute, great quality, compliments galore and cheap! Will be buying more and looking for sun readers.</li>
    <li> Very light weight- great color combinations- and the fit is perfect- each comes with it&#x27;s own case - who could want more.</li>
    <li> The glasses were only two different colors.  The lenses were completely different than what I ordered.  Was looking forward to having different pair for different outfits.</li>
    <li> Love them!  I love the colors, quality and the matching cases are an added bonus.  Now I have a pair at work, home, car &amp; an extra!</li>
    <li> Very fun purchase of beautifully colored reading glasses.  All aspects of purchase went smoothly.  I have no complaints! Thank you!</li>
