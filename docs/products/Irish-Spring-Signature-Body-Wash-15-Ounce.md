      <li>Best thing about it?  </li>
      <li>Use a puff for best results.</li>
      <li>Good product, well accepted by the household!</li>
      <li>Great soap, the guys love it!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be as good, but now I see why they used the word &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; in its name.</li>
      <li>The packaging is very cute too.</li>
      <li>This is not a robust in smell as the bars, but still very potent.  </li>
      <li>But if you like it, as I do, then you will love it!</li>
      <li>Irish Sping SIgnature Body Wash is a great product for a great price!</li>
      <li>I liked the smell and cleanliness it provides.</li>
      <li>But then again I sometimes do that with aa bar of bath soap but not as effectively.  </li>
      <li>The smell is nice and it lathers up easily.</li>
      <li>I love the classics--</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Though we were able to try the product in exchange for the review, I know we will be buying more when it runs out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been ordering it on Amazon with Prime since I first bought at Walmart and have gone through a good 6-8 bottles now.</li>
      <li>I was so excited when offered this product to try out!</li>
      <li>Incredibly nice smell and adequate lathering.  </li>
      <li>After using it more, I&#x27;d say it moisturizes just fine.</li>
      <li>It leaves a nice scent after showering and it is for men, but smells so fresh I have used it as well.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather up easily and the scent is not that strong.</li>
      <li>Smell was OK, but it didn&#x27;t seem to clean that</li>
      <li>I think the fragrance is a bit too strong (hence the 4 stars).</li>
      <li>-- here&#x27;s the heart of the review: I think it works just fine.</li>
      <li>Right now I&#x27;m using Axe Apollo and it works pretty good.</li>
      <li>I received this product free of charge, in exchange for my review.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need a body wash to moisturize me, I need it to leave me feeling clean.</li>
      <li>You will be clean and smell</li>
      <li>It rinses clean off.</li>
      <li>It has a very strong, albeit not entirely negative, aroma to it.</li>
      <li>It smells great and really does leave me feeling smooth and much more moisturized than other body washes.</li>
      <li>I loved the old commercials with the older guy saying &amp;#34;the Irish never quit.&amp;#34;  I also remember my grandmother putting bars of the soap in drawers to keep linen and clothes smelling great.  </li>
      <li>I have always loved the smell of Irish Spring Soap.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It really lathers up though - much more so than bar soap.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t really recommend this body wash unless you&#x27;re specifically looking for one with a moisturizing quality and don&#x27;t care about getting clean quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>The scent of this body is good yet mild and does not linger long.</li>
      <li>The new Hydrating Body Wash is made for men who would like to preserve healthy looking skin.</li>
      <li>Also feels good and hydrating, doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel overly dry during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a great new product by Irish Spring.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s just nice whether used occasionally or all of the time.</li>
      <li>But it stands on its own, with a scent that&#x27;s similarly &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; to the others so it&#x27;s a winner for me.</li>
      <li>you have that nice Irish spring smell.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll get more mileage and moisturizing effect, The first time I didn&#x27;t feel very moisturized afterwards, but after the third time my skin did feel better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just such a clean, refreshing scent.</li>
      <li>I love the texture as it seems a little creamier than most body washes.</li>
      <li>It cleans well, lathers and doesn&#x27;t leave a strong scent like the original Irish Spring products.</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a nice product, and I suspect I&#x27;ll be going through my bottle fairly fast (as even my girlfriend is drawn to using it, regardless of the fact that its advertised &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34;).</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant and fresh, but not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not an overly masculine scent, just fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am quite satisfied with the quality of this body wash.</li>
      <li>It also lathers up very nicely, more so than my current bar of soap.</li>
      <li>I believe I first heard about 70 or so years ago.</li>
      <li>Sadly, I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this product.</li>
      <li>Nothing more manly then Irish Springs!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not sure I would use it as a face wash or a shampoo, though, but men who are looking for an all-in-one product may certainly feel differently.</li>
      <li>One other thing I almost forgot is it&#x27;s a nice shape for setting on the shower ledge.</li>
      <li>I have far more sensitive skin</li>
      <li>But too many of them dry you a bit.  </li>
      <li>What I do not like is that it does dry the skin more than it should.</li>
      <li>Irish Spring&#x27;s body washes are a staple in our house, so trying this version was an easy decision.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unless you&#x27;re really skimpy on the use, bar soap is much cheaper.</li>
      <li>I really like way</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t know as I&#x27;m not an expert on soaps or chemistry.</li>
      <li>I like the fact that this product did not dry out my skin and leaves you clean.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t really notice it until you lather up your washcloth and start washing your face.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update -- I have repented, and I have decided that I actually like this better than the bars -- and I have ordered more -- not free this time!(hence the 4 stars).</li>
      <li>I have repented, and I have decided that I actually like this better than the bars -- and I have ordered more -- not free this time!</li>
      <li>Despite this, when I was offered the opportunity to try the new Body Wash version under the same name with which I have become familiar, why not?</li>
      <li>The main problem I have with it is its moisturizing quality.</li>
      <li>It smells OK, not overly strong or unpleasant, mildly agreeable and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick and sudsy, and it feels nice - perhaps that&#x27;s the shea butter extract.</li>
      <li>Irish Spring bar soap is my go-to bar soap, so this fits right in -</li>
      <li>The world is trying to overload me with new tricks.</li>
      <li>After a hard day&#x27;s work all I want to do is take a quick shower that leaves me feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
      <li>Oddly, the day after I received this I had an appointment with my doctor and mentioned to him that I wash with Irish Spring, and he said that I should use something different because the bar soap version dries the skin, and as I&#x27;m a diabetic, that isn&#x27;t good for me.</li>
      <li>Irish Spring soap is one of those products which has a very distinct aroma, especially if you&#x27;ve grown up with it.</li>
      <li>When I saw that Irish Spring was back with a new body wash for men, I was excited to try it.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more similar to the smell of cologne that gives it a signature aroma that I have not smelled in other body washes.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;You can&#x27;t teach an old dog new tricks&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I thought it was going to have that typical Irish Spring soap smell to it, but it&#x27;s so much better.</li>
      <li>how much I am supposed to squirt into my hand to start the process, but the glob about half the size of one of the prunes I consume each day seemed about right.</li>
      <li>Well, now I&#x27;m an old dog.</li>
      <li>He likes it well enough but really sees no difference in scent or performance.</li>
      <li>It leaves skin feeling soft and silky and moisturized.</li>
      <li>Neither of us see this as an exclusively masculine scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have tried this product several times, and I am really beginning to like it.</li>
      <li>Old dogs like to do the tricks</li>
      <li>Old dogs like to do the tricks they know.  </li>
      <li>Not really what I was hoping for.... Seemed like a crappy version of original Irish spring.</li>
      <li>Here, with the Irish Spring body wash, you&#x27;ll get that same Irish Spring scent, but it&#x27;s surprisingly mild.</li>
      <li>I would think most men would feel the same, so I&#x27;m not really sure what Irish Sping was thinking with this new line.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This might be a positive for those who want to avoid smelling too &amp;#34;manly,&amp;#34; but I suspect a lot of people buy Irish Spring so that they smell like Irish Spring.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like way this body wash smells. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be as good, but now I see why they used the word &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; in its name. I thought it was going to have that typical Irish Spring soap smell to it, but it&#x27;s so much better. It&#x27;s more similar to the smell of cologne that gives it a signature aroma that I have not smelled in other body washes. I think I will have to start buying this instead of the other body washes that I used in the past.</li>
    <li> Irish Spring soap is one of those products which has a very distinct aroma, especially if you&#x27;ve grown up with it. Here, with the Irish Spring body wash, you&#x27;ll get that same Irish Spring scent, but it&#x27;s surprisingly mild. This might be a positive for those who want to avoid smelling too &amp;#34;manly,&amp;#34; but I suspect a lot of people buy Irish Spring so that they smell like Irish Spring. And this might be mildly disappointing for those who purchase this body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, there&#x27;s really nothing negative to say about this body wash. It&#x27;s thick and sudsy, and it feels nice - perhaps that&#x27;s the shea butter extract. Overall, it&#x27;s a nice product, and I suspect I&#x27;ll be going through my bottle fairly fast (as even my girlfriend is drawn to using it, regardless of the fact that its advertised &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34;).</li>
    <li> I have been a big fan of Irish Spring soap since I was a kid.  I loved the old commercials with the older guy saying &amp;#34;the Irish never quit.&amp;#34;  I also remember my grandmother putting bars of the soap in drawers to keep linen and clothes smelling great.  I have a love hate relationship with body washes.  Some lather poorly, while others later up very well.  Some can be used on your hair too, which gives you a total cleanse in one bottle.  But too many of them dry you a bit.  This is not a robust in smell as the bars, but still very potent.  Best thing about it?  It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.  Kudos to them on this.</li>
    <li> The scent of this body is good yet mild and does not linger long. It is convenient in that you may use it for washing your face, hair, and body. But then again I sometimes do that with aa bar of bath soap but not as effectively.  I like the fact that this product did not dry out my skin and leaves you clean. The ingredients listed include Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, Fragrance, Cocamide MEA, Citric Acid, Sodium Salicylate, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-7, Tetrasodium EDTA, Panthenol, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5, FD&amp;C Blue No. 1. Note: Vine product never arrived I had to buy locally in order to write this review.</li>
    <li> Not really what I was hoping for.... Seemed like a crappy version of original Irish spring. Smell was OK, but it didn&#x27;t seem to clean that well and was not very sudsy.</li>
    <li> This is a great new product by Irish Spring. The packaging is what drew me to it in Walmart, but once I got home and actually used it for a few days I was very impressed with the product itself. It smells great and really does leave me feeling smooth and much more moisturized than other body washes. I&#x27;ve been ordering it on Amazon with Prime since I first bought at Walmart and have gone through a good 6-8 bottles now.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;You can&#x27;t teach an old dog new tricks&amp;#34;. There&#x27;s a phrase the I believe I first heard about 70 or so years ago. Well, now I&#x27;m an old dog. 80 years under the ol&#x27; odometer, and guess what? The world is trying to overload me with new tricks. Let&#x27;s talk about something really simple like taking a shower. Back in 1972, while watching the Ed Sullivan Show one Sunday night, I was charmed by a commercial which had the immortal tagline &amp;#34;Manly, yes, but I like it too&amp;#34; uttered by a faux Irish colleen about an new soap bar. The product, of course, was Irish Spring. Since that date I believe that with the few rare exceptions when I was in a hotel or on a cruise, I have used the Irish Spring soap bar in my shower every day. That comes to something over 15,000 times. I received this product free of charge, in exchange for my review. I like the product. Last time I bought some I bought the package of 20 bars. I still have 6 unopened bars, and one in &amp;#34;partly used&amp;#34; mode. Despite this, when I was offered the opportunity to try the new Body Wash version under the same name with which I have become familiar, why not? I know that when I go to a gym to work out, and sometimes in a hotel I will find products offered that are similarly liquid, but I generally stick with the bar I bring with me. Anyway, I gave this a try. I have no idea how much I am supposed to squirt into my hand to start the process, but the glob about half the size of one of the prunes I consume each day seemed about right. Oddly, the day after I received this I had an appointment with my doctor and mentioned to him that I wash with Irish Spring, and he said that I should use something different because the bar soap version dries the skin, and as I&#x27;m a diabetic, that isn&#x27;t good for me. Wow! the Body Wash claims to be &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34;. That should keep my doctor happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, enough blather -- here&#x27;s the heart of the review: I think it works just fine. I think the fragrance is a bit too strong (hence the 4 stars). I believe I shall return to my trusty bar-soap version -- even if my doctor thinks it isn&#x27;t the best for me. Old dogs like to do the tricks they know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update -- I have repented, and I have decided that I actually like this better than the bars -- and I have ordered more -- not free this time!(hence the 4 stars). I believe I shall return to my trusty bar-soap version -- even if my doctor thinks it isn&#x27;t the best for me. Old dogs like to do the tricks they know.

    <li> I&#x27;ve used Softsoap for Men and the old version of Irish Spring, but sadly they both disappeared from the stores. Right now I&#x27;m using Axe Apollo and it works pretty good. The smell is nice and it lathers up easily. When I saw that Irish Spring was back with a new body wash for men, I was excited to try it. Sadly, I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this product. The main problem I have with it is its moisturizing quality. After a hard day&#x27;s work all I want to do is take a quick shower that leaves me feeling refreshed and clean. This is not the body wash for that. It doesn&#x27;t lather up easily and the scent is not that strong. I don&#x27;t need a body wash to moisturize me, I need it to leave me feeling clean. I would think most men would feel the same, so I&#x27;m not really sure what Irish Sping was thinking with this new line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t really recommend this body wash unless you&#x27;re specifically looking for one with a moisturizing quality and don&#x27;t care about getting clean quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> It smells OK, not overly strong or unpleasant, mildly agreeable and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a puff for best results. You&#x27;ll get more mileage and moisturizing effect, The first time I didn&#x27;t feel very moisturized afterwards, but after the third time my skin did feel better. However, it didn&#x27;t feel as moisturized as some other washes, such as Dove. UPDATE: After using it more, I&#x27;d say it moisturizes just fine. Use a puff for best results.</li>
    <li> Incredibly nice smell and adequate lathering.  It leaves a nice scent after showering and it is for men, but smells so fresh I have used it as well.  What I do not like is that it does dry the skin more than it should.</li>
    <li> Stands on its own&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m generally not a fan of bodywashes, but I&#x27;ve used varying brands over the years, including the exfoliating Irish Spring body wash that&#x27;s another fairly new offering from Irish Spring. This one is mellower than that version though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I like this version. But to me, it&#x27;s not like any of the signature scents from the bar soap versions. But it stands on its own, with a scent that&#x27;s similarly &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; to the others so it&#x27;s a winner for me. Irish Spring bar soap is my go-to bar soap, so this fits right in - but it&#x27;s not the regular bar version in a bottle. That&#x27;s the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really lathers up though - much more so than bar soap. After a really dirty day in the great outdoors, this beats bar soap any day to simply get washed up all over easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you&#x27;re really skimpy on the use, bar soap is much cheaper. But there&#x27;s a luxuriousness about body wash that&#x27;s just nice whether used occasionally or all of the time.</li>
    <li> Irish Spring has always had a distinctive smell, and if you don&#x27;t like it, then you will hate this body wash. But if you like it, as I do, then you will love it! This lathers really well, with lots of suds, but then rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird residue on your skin. Also feels good and hydrating, doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel overly dry during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure I would use it as a face wash or a shampoo, though, but men who are looking for an all-in-one product may certainly feel differently.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t your father&#x27;s Irish Spring soap. The new Hydrating Body Wash is made for men who would like to preserve healthy looking skin. It has shea butter extract so that skin does not overdry, as it would with cheaper options. It also smells delicious. My one complaint is that the scent, fresh and clean like saltwater air, doesn&#x27;t last long. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the quality of this body wash. 4/5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product several times, and I am really beginning to like it. I love the texture as it seems a little creamier than most body washes. It also lathers up very nicely, more so than my current bar of soap. As far as the hydrating aspects of it I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference between this product and other non-hydrating products. It could be to also to the fact that I like to stay under the shower until the water turns cold. I&#x27;ve heard before that can actually dry your skin out, and then maybe canceling out the hydrating affect. I really don&#x27;t know as I&#x27;m not an expert on soaps or chemistry. Now, why did I give it four stars instead of five. It has a very strong, albeit not entirely negative, aroma to it. You don&#x27;t really notice it until you lather up your washcloth and start washing your face. It&#x27;s no big deal as when you&#x27;re finished you have that nice Irish spring smell. I would definitely get this again. One other thing I almost forgot is it&#x27;s a nice shape for setting on the shower ledge. Some have an odd shape it is in very sturdy. I haven&#x27;t knocked this one over yet.</li>
    <li> Yumm! I have always loved the smell of Irish Spring Soap. It&#x27;s just such a clean, refreshing scent. However, my family is not a fan of bar soap, and as far as I knew, Irish Spring only came in bar form. I was so excited when offered this product to try out! It smells fantastic! It says it&#x27;s for men, but my daughter and I both use it as well as my husband. It&#x27;s not an overly masculine scent, just fresh and clean. It leaves skin feeling soft and silky and moisturized. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky film like some soaps. It rinses clean off. A little bit goes a long way as well. I can see this bottle serving our family of three for at least a few weeks.  The packaging is very cute too. It reminds me of a whiskey bottle.  Irish Sping SIgnature Body Wash is a great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> Irish Spring&#x27;s body washes are a staple in our house, so trying this version was an easy decision. The smell is pleasant and fresh, but not overwhelming. It lingers, but not for too long, so it does not overpower anyone. You will be clean and smell good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though we were able to try the product in exchange for the review, I know we will be buying more when it runs out.</li>
    <li> My husband is an Irish Spring bar soap guy. He sees no difference between that and this body wash. He likes it well enough but really sees no difference in scent or performance. I ,on the other hand, prefer this to the bar soap. I live the herbal/minty scent and it is kinder to dry skin than bar soap. Neither of us see this as an exclusively masculine scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do get a cooling sensation that lingers from this body wash. My husband does not. I have far more sensitive skin so perhaps that is why. Good product, well accepted by the household!</li>
    <li> I liked the smell and cleanliness it provides.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this and its awesome that its on the subscribe and save!</li>
    <li> Great soap, the guys love it!</li>
    <li> Great scent!  I love the classics--Nothing more manly then Irish Springs!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even remotely smell like Irish Spring, but t gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Th Irish Spring Signature wash for men is a very soft scented Irish Spring product. I like it for my boys. It cleans well, lathers and doesn&#x27;t leave a strong scent like the original Irish Spring products.</li>
