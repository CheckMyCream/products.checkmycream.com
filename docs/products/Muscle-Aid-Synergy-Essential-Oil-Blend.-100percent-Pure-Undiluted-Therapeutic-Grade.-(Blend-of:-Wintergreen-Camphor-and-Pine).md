<li> this Muscle Aid Synergy just stinks.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed.  </li>
<li> For one, it smells horrible.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well...use it frequently!</li>
    <li> nice! Grab and go. I keep&lt;br /&gt;It on my nightstand.</li>
    <li> On a positive note, I received this product much faster than expected. It wasn&#x27;t eligible for Amazon Prime shipping, so I expected to wait a week or so for delivery. Much to my surprise, I received it within two days. Kudos for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day I received the product, my son complained of a sore muscle in his back. I applied the Muscle Aid Synergy roll-on, rubbed it in, and waited. He felt no relief, nor did he experience the \\&quot;tingling, cooling effect\\&quot; promised on the label. I applied the oil a second time. After another hour with no relief, we resorted to a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my nagging shoulder pain resurfaced this morning, I immediately applied Muscle Aid. Even though it didn&#x27;t work for my son, I hoped that I would have better results.  Unfortunately, I experienced no effects, aside from the unpleasant odor of the camphor. I applied the roll-on a second time and still felt no tingling, cooling sensation, or relief of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product a try in an effort to avoid shelling out a lot of money for the popular direct sales brands. I haven&#x27;t tried them yet, so I can&#x27;t attest to their effectiveness. I can, however, say beyond a doubt that this particular product did absolutely nothing for me or my son.</li>
    <li> I use this oil with a drop of Coriander for my knees.  Years of exercise and sports have done a number on my knees and I refuse to have surgery or take medication.  I am so happy that I found Plant Therapy Essential Oils!</li>
    <li> I powerlift so I&#x27;m used to the aches and pains that come with the sport. That said, I&#x27;m used to the different topical oils, creams, and gels made for muscles aches. I&#x27;m not completely sold on this product yet after one use. I did feel a slight relief in muscle ache after applying this on my neck/shoulder area. I didn&#x27;t feel any tingling sensation with this product. However, the smell is very strong Ã¢â‚¬â€œ nothing new to me but is worth mentioning for users not familiar with these types of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was very easy to use in the roll-on bottle. Hopefully I&#x27;ll have better results when I use it next.</li>
    <li> I tried another company&#x27;s oils first and while they worked, they were not budget friendly for me. This Muscle Aid Synergy blend roll-on is perfectly convenient, cost effective, and WORKS. I have severe TMJ and have a temporarily high-stress life. I roll this from one pressure point to another on either side of my jaw, or run it down the back sides of my neck, and the pain literally tingles away. I only have to reuse it a couple of times a day, if that, and only when I feel the pressure coming back into my muscles and joints. I&#x27;ve been very happy with each oil I&#x27;ve used from Plant Therapy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have chronic neck pain and I use this when I am at work or on the go. I have the undiluted Muscle-Aid I use at home. This really helps me. I use it all the time and it is a life saver. I have fibromyalgia and I&#x27;ve found this helps more than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> I have used several different essential oils to help with my neck pain including doTerra Past Tense and also Deep Blue and Young Living Pan Away and Deep Relief.  I wanted to try some cheaper alternatives so I ordered this one.  For one, it smells horrible.  Past Tense doesn&#x27;t smell good but this Muscle Aid Synergy just stinks.  There is no tingling feeling or any relief felt when using this oil as I get with the doTerra and Young Living products.  As the old saying goes, you get what you pay for and in the instance, it is very true.  Will not buy again and will throw this bottle away.</li>
    <li> I love Muscle Aid synergy. It works really well to help tense muscles. I love the roll on, I can put it on my neck myself, without having to dilute it first!</li>
    <li> Natures gift to humanity. Essential oils have so many health benefits that I could write a book. Thanks Plant Therapy.</li>
    <li> This is outstanding on achy muscles and after having parathyroid surgery, we hit disney world, so I had the aches and muscle pains to prove it works! And it doesn&#x27;t smell terrible or leave greasy stains on clothes which is a huge bonus. The husband used it too. So much since he discovered it, I think I need to order more. And maybe get him his own!</li>

    <li> Meh. Works okay, nothing spectacular if you have severe muscle pain...smell isn&#x27;t horrible like many muscle rubs.</li>
    <li> I have several plant therapy oils and synergies.  I love them all and use them daily!  I have so many friends and co-workers interested and loving their essential oils from Plant Therapy too! :)  This muscle aid really does work!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed.  It didn&#x27;t seem strong enough to me to make a difference.  And it&#x27;s kind of messy when you roll it on.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me or my husband.</li>
    <li> This really, really works for me,  I would recommend it to anyone.  The roll-on application makes it super easy, too!</li>
    <li> Stuff works great. Very impressed!</li>
