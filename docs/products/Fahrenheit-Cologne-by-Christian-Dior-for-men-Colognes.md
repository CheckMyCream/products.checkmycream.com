      <li>It&#x27;s being my favorite for many years</li>

      <li>it has so many layers.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s smells even better from Macy&#x27;s.</li>

      <li>Upon receiving it all seemed to be ok and the scent is correct, so I am calling this one legit :)</li>
      <li>My wife sure loves it when I wear this cologne.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite men&#x27;s cologne I bought it for my boyfriend.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product for my fiance who has the best taste in fragrances, let alone fashion, as he was an international model.  </li>
      <li>girls always love it and so does my girlfriend :)</li>
      <li>probably buy some more when i run out</li>
      <li>As the most recommended</li>
      <li>but it is always on the top with POLO by Ralph Lauren</li>
      <li>What more could you ask?</li>
      <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne.  </li>
      <li>Price is okay.  </li>
      <li>is gift to my brother he love it</li>
      <li>and i just love the smell.</li>
      <li>Has a very unique fragrance not duplicated by anything else.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, its not to strong or floral smelling.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend loved it and totally appreciated it.</li>
      <li>It is one of the most unique EDT&#x27;s out of the 60</li>
      <li>this stuff smells good, but newer scents have gotten better than this and built on it  its a woody floral musk scent with seductive florals and musk and woods to make a masculine tone.</li>
      <li>and its not that strong</li>
      <li>Best of all, this purchase is original and lasts long - money&#x27;s worth!</li>
      <li>This is a great cologne and get many compliments on the smell, it holds most of the day, on thing is $$$ but to be expected!</li>
      <li>The fragrance is fine but the bottle looks like a knock off.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>The large majority of the colognes that are popular with MEN make you smell like you just walked out of the shower or some sort or water.</li>
      <li>definetely a stronger smell that will leave a huge footprint wherever you go.</li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy wearing it and get compliments.</li>
      <li>old school smell good</li>
      <li>Super masculine fragance, Bought it 15 years ago and still a very original fragance for men!!</li>
      <li>It is now a lot more \\&quot;used oil\\&quot; smelling and less of the bright and peaceful type of smells that are good about it.   </li>
      <li>It is a unique scent, great for romantic occasions.  </li>
      <li>It has a very distinct manly smell.</li>
      <li>Guess the formula changed and the original is no longer available.</li>
      <li>Maybe Europe has the original</li>
      <li>The original would not fade in 15-20min nor did it have this oil gas</li>
      <li>Wish I could find the original Fahrenheit.</li>
      <li>no es original es una falsificación, yo siempre uso este perfume, por eso se de que estoy hablando, considero que es un engaño para los compradores que se confían de que le van</li>
      <li>this is not what I was expecting for fade away really quick.</li>
      <li>any really lovely, probably the smaller one without spray is more concentrated than this one</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick through Prime.  </li>
      <li>Quick and efficient shipping.   </li>
      <li>I really have to go easy on it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this cologne, though I&#x27;m not much of a cologne person.  </li>
      <li>Women may love the floral notes and be intrigued by the tar, or be completely turned off by what she thinks is mechanics oil and flowers.  </li>
      <li>the green one.&lt;br /&gt;5++ stars for all the products of CD and always 5+ stars for the AMAZON on its trusted web site and shipments.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is like others on the top of markets and in my opinion sits in the top 4 in cyber-markets.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much for both of you guys</li>
      <li>The oder when first put on is just a bit strong like most, but after about 5 minutes it settles down and is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>lots of scents have this, and its a little overplayed and out of fashion but still a good scent</li>
      <li>For such a pricey Eau De Toilette, it has more of a motor or machine oil fragrance.....</li>
      <li>I have the olfactory power of a wolf and better does my prego gal who knew it was different.  </li>
      <li>Consistent with the product.   </li>
      <li>get nice comments on it all the time, but I dont ever tell them what it is because hey I dont want the secret out more than it is....</li>
      <li>The original scent did not carry what seems to be a petrol like linger that does indeed seem to be like gasoline or something along those lines, there is certainly a characteristic and closeness to the original</li>
      <li>Depending on which version you have(it has been reformulated a couple of times since its original release), it may have more or less of that classic oil, rubber note that makes this fragrance so daring.  </li>
      <li>So much for all the positive reviews posted here.</li>
      <li>just got it today and smells like the real stuff.</li>
      <li>OTHERS VERY INSINUATING....</li>
      <li>It really depends on your taste</li>
      <li>very manly smell that lingers all day.</li>
      <li>If you think there is no way a cologne could state this much about me</li>
      <li>Yes, if not carefully dispensed, even tiny bit can be too strong!</li>
      <li>I happen to enjoy it in small doses, but would much rather enjoy it&#x27;s flankers 32 and summer.</li>
      <li>This is a unique fragrance and should be treated as such.  </li>
      <li>I wear it only for special events ....</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t denied this timeless classic of colonges</li>
      <li>Much better than the ones I was buying from WalMart years back that doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>Being a longtime consumer of this cologne I couldn&#x27;t smell any difference between this and older bottle.</li>
      <li>THIS CLASSIC COLOGNE IS A PIECE OF HEAVEN ON EARTH.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the real thing for less, delivered to our home for free.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t seem to be the same as the last bottle I bought at Penny&#x27;s not as strong  </li>
      <li>Their prices are unbeatable &amp; I can get the extra large size for him.</li>
      <li>It states \\&quot;I am bold, complex, unique, different every time you interact with me</li>
      <li>&amp; I purchase it frequently for him on Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>WHEN I WEAR IT PEOPLE AROUND ME GO WILD.</li>
      <li>It is not over-powering &amp; provides a masculine scent, too.</li>

    <li> Wish I could find the original Fahrenheit. This stuff is a weak sister. Guess the formula changed and the original is no longer available.</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne and get many compliments on the smell, it holds most of the day, on thing is $$$ but to be expected!</li>
    <li> old school smell good</li>
    <li> I smelled this while shopping at Sephora for cologne as a gift to my boyfriend. When I smelled this - I seriously started drooling. It&#x27;s spicy, exotic... it has so many layers. I don&#x27;t think I have ever smelled anything like this. My boyfriend loved it and totally appreciated it. Every once in a while, I catch myself smelling it. Try it - you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> THIS CLASSIC COLOGNE IS A PIECE OF HEAVEN ON EARTH. WHEN I WEAR IT PEOPLE AROUND ME GO WILD. THEY CAN&#x27;T HELP IT !!. I&#x27;VE HAD COMPLIMENTS FROM BOTH SEXES, SOME VERY INNOCENT AND OTHERS VERY INSINUATING....WHEN I RUN OUT OF IT I GO  CRAZY AND RUN TO THE STORE TO BUY IT IN A HURRY. SOMETIMES I BUY IT TWO AT A TIME WHEN GOES ON SALE. THE BEST OF THE BEST FROM DIOR. VIVE LA FRANCE !!</li>
    <li> Excellent scent.  I am happy with your purchase.   It is a unique scent, great for romantic occasions.  Consistent with the product.   Quick and efficient shipping.   As the most recommended</li>
    <li> Product came in four days.Great.The real surprise is it cam from Macy&#x27;s but ordered from different company.I paid $59.99 for this product and if i had bought it from macys direct on their site it would have been $74.00.Will buy again from this company when i need anything.</li>
    <li> This is a unique fragrance and should be treated as such.  Depending on which version you have(it has been reformulated a couple of times since its original release), it may have more or less of that classic oil, rubber note that makes this fragrance so daring.  It is one of the most unique EDT&#x27;s out of the 60+ I own.  Longevity and projection are awesome, expect to get noticed with this one.  Now whether this is a good thing or a bad one depends one the person, this is a very much love or hate fragrance.  Women may love the floral notes and be intrigued by the tar, or be completely turned off by what she thinks is mechanics oil and flowers.  My girlfriend is on the latter end of this opinion.  Whether your love it or hate it you cannot deny it&#x27;s attitude to challenge the industry.  I happen to enjoy it in small doses, but would much rather enjoy it&#x27;s flankers 32 and summer.</li>
    <li> one of my personal favorites&lt;br /&gt;the girls always love it and so does my girlfriend :)&lt;br /&gt;will probably buy some more when i run out&lt;br /&gt;this is my 3rd bottle</li>
    <li> I used to love this a few years back.  Something has changed.   It is now a lot more \\&quot;used oil\\&quot; smelling and less of the bright and peaceful type of smells that are good about it.   I fear for the people around me when I wear it, so I really have to go easy on it.  Shipping was quick through Prime.  Price is okay.  Packaging was substandard.</li>
    <li> is gift to my brother he love it</li>
    <li> My husband wears this fragrance in the cold weather and we both love it. He had been paying an outrageous price for it at a local drugstore, so I researched it and found this on Amazon for less than he&#x27;d paid for half the quantity. It&#x27;s the real thing for less, delivered to our home for free. What more could you ask?</li>
    <li> Smells like cigarettes at times. Nothing like what Fahrenheit is supposed to smell like.</li>
    <li> Super masculine fragance, Bought it 15 years ago and still a very original fragance for men!!</li>
    <li> this stuff smells good, but newer scents have gotten better than this and built on it  its a woody floral musk scent with seductive florals and musk and woods to make a masculine tone. lots of scents have this, and its a little overplayed and out of fashion but still a good scent</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my fiance who has the best taste in fragrances, let alone fashion, as he was an international model.  It&#x27;s top notes are wonderful and it lasts and lasts and lasts, but is not too over powerful. The price isn&#x27;t too pricey for the quality. It is a timeless fragrance!</li>
    <li> My husband has wore this cologne for as long as I can remember.  It has a very distinct manly smell. I never get sick of it.</li>
    <li> This cologne is a cologne is one you can where every day to work or something you go to everyday and it will catch the attention of your female (and male) coworkers and friends over and over again day after day. The woodsy smell and complexity with subtle notes make it interesting and different every time you nose dives into it. This a VERY welcome change to all to the boring and simple smells out there. The large majority of the colognes that are popular with MEN make you smell like you just walked out of the shower or some sort or water. The fact that this is different WILL get you attention and the complexity and ever changing subtle tones is a statement to your character as a man. It states \\&quot;I am bold, complex, unique, different every time you interact with me and i have a soft subtle side\\&quot;. If you think there is no way a cologne could state this much about me you obviously don&#x27;t know how much women read into things. BUY IT you will have no regrets.</li>
    <li> the aroma is excellent, this perfume has a very fine and elegant scent that I love. i want mor products Christian Dior</li>
    <li> My boyfriend had been looking everywhere for this cologne it smells amazing arrived on time and I could not be happier with it</li>
    <li> I have been using Fahrenheit for several years now, and I really like it. It had a very different smell to it than any other. The oder when first put on is just a bit strong like most, but after about 5 minutes it settles down and is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I get nice comments on it all the time, but I dont ever tell them what it is because hey I dont want the secret out more than it is....</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for over 20 years and would recommend it to all the women to order for their man. It is expensive but worth it. You must try it when you next go shopping and try a sample.</li>
    <li> Smells good but for some reason I think it&#x27;s smells even better from Macy&#x27;s. My husband feels it&#x27;s the same.....I don&#x27;t</li>
    <li> Got this for my other half because he wears axe body spray (eww its so gross, I know!) like he is 13 or somethings. So I got him a \\&quot;big-boy\\&quot; scent. He is 30 and its time he smells like a man and not a pre-teen. I love the smell, its not to strong or floral smelling. Very attractive.</li>
    <li> I had a bottle long time b4 this is not what I was expecting for fade away really quick. .. and its not that strong</li>
    <li> My wife sure loves it when I wear this cologne.  Good times!</li>
    <li> on time and in perfect quality, love this perfume one of my top 10. very respectable sales man... thank you</li>
    <li> It really depends on your taste but I am not a fan. Unfortunetely I bought this for my husband and spent way too much money on it. It has a kind of spicy smell that makes me ill. I won&#x27;t even let him wear it. Have spent a lot less on much better scents.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne.  Women stop him all the time and ask what he&#x27;s wearing.  It&#x27;s a chick magnet!</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic.  My father had it growing up and i just love the smell.</li>
    <li> Sealed box. Correct markings. Correct smell and very long lasting. This is not fake or watered down. Has a very unique fragrance not duplicated by anything else. Enjoy wearing it and get compliments. May not be for everyone. Not a crisp clean light scent but rather a dusky one with subtle tones.</li>
    <li> I loved this perfume since my uncle gave it to me as a gift since 1992.&lt;br /&gt;I was with the POLO always.&lt;br /&gt;But Fehrenheit CD is different any really lovely, probably the smaller one without spray is more concentrated than this one but it is always on the top with POLO by Ralph Lauren the green one.&lt;br /&gt;5++ stars for all the products of CD and always 5+ stars for the AMAZON on its trusted web site and shipments.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is like others on the top of markets and in my opinion sits in the top 4 in cyber-markets.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much for both of you guys</li>
    <li> My husband has worn this for years &amp; I purchase it frequently for him on Amazon.com. Their prices are unbeatable &amp; I can get the extra large size for him. The fragrance has notes of citrus &amp; complex musk that makes it distinctive as well. It is not over-powering &amp; provides a masculine scent, too.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite men&#x27;s cologne I bought it for my boyfriend. He had never tried it he loved it.</li>
    <li> For such a pricey Eau De Toilette, it has more of a motor or machine oil fragrance..... So much for all the positive reviews posted here.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Seller describes the product as new, but the name \\&quot;Fahrenheit\\&quot; printed on the bottle is faded and crooked. Being a longtime consumer of this cologne I couldn&#x27;t smell any difference between this and older bottle. The fragrance is fine but the bottle looks like a knock off.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This has been a long time fav of my husband&#x27;s and I do love the scent.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve always used this cologne, it is great, i simply love it, got there on time, excelent for a gift and great price</li>
    <li> definetely a stronger smell that will leave a huge footprint wherever you go. very manly smell that lingers all day.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t seem to be the same as the last bottle I bought at Penny&#x27;s not as strong  don&#x27;t last as long will not buy online again.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t denied this timeless classic of colonges</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this fragrance on my man. Not to overbearing &amp; just breathes sexy no matter what outfit he is wearing with it.</li>
    <li> Well folks, here&#x27;s the Facts- The original scent did not carry what seems to be a petrol like linger that does indeed seem to be like gasoline or something along those lines, there is certainly a characteristic and closeness to the original but it&#x27;s Not. The original would not fade in 15-20min nor did it have this oil gas like scent- my guess is (and my Father was a scent/chem designer by pharaceticul head-chemist trade) is that amber gris aka whale vomit might not be present which is a main chemical and costly in many colognes placed in order to retain the essential essences applied, without it, the scents fade quickly and they may be using a petrol base to retain scent which chemically may linger as this funk.  Too bad, it was close but no cigar. I have the olfactory power of a wolf and better does my prego gal who knew it was different.  Maybe Europe has the original, this was a let down.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t quite seem to be the same that I have bought in the past. Doesn&#x27;t last like the same cologne I have bought in the past.</li>
    <li> I received the product promptly and it is exactly as I expected.  Have been wearing this for years and I am a female.</li>
    <li> It smell really bad it was almost like gasoline or diesel very disappointed</li>
    <li> Love this smell. just got it today and smells like the real stuff.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to say about this perfume? It&#x27;s being my favorite for many years - It&#x27;s always in my perfume collection. It&#x27;s the KING of all my perfumes ... I wear it only for special events .... others I wear for work and for general daily use. Yes, if not carefully dispensed, even tiny bit can be too strong! Thanks to the very soft dispenser that comes with the bottle - the amount dispensed is easily controlled (unlike other dispensers that are so hard one over dispenses!). Best of all, this purchase is original and lasts long - money&#x27;s worth! Much better than the ones I was buying from WalMart years back that doesn&#x27;t last. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this cologne, though I&#x27;m not much of a cologne person.  Still, I worried about the legitimacy of it.  Upon receiving it all seemed to be ok and the scent is correct, so I am calling this one legit :)</li>
    <li> He comprado este producto desde venezuela pero realmente no es original es una falsificación, yo siempre uso este perfume, por eso se de que estoy hablando, considero que es un engaño para los compradores que se confían de que le van a vender un producto de calidad y no es así. El vendedor que sea mas serio y no estafe a las personas con productos no originales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product from Venezuela but not really original is a fake, I always use this perfume, that is why I am speaking, I consider it a hoax for buyers to trust that you are going to sell a quality product and not. A seller who is more serious and not cheat people with non-genuine.</li>
