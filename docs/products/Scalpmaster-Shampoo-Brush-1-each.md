      <li>Would be better suited for travel if the finger clasp were collapsible.</li>
      <li>I wanted something that would improve upon using my finger nails to scratch my scalp as I shampooed and this does the job much better.</li>
      <li>So which is better to use?</li>
      <li>I am quite pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>The shampoo brush is just ok.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>They love the scratching</li>
      <li>Love this brush.  </li>
      <li>I am so happy with these new brushes.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the discontinued &amp;#34;Goodie&amp;#34; shampoo brush, but is the most reasonable substitute I have found.</li>
      <li>nice and small perfect compact brush for hair and more.</li>
      <li>I am able to work the brush thru my fine hair and find the bristle length to be suitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I need these brushes just as much as I need the shampoo, to feel like I have done a good wash job.</li>
      <li>He still has a full head of hair!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also amazing for someone with Psoriasis it gently exfoliates and lessens the embarrassing flakes!</li>
      <li>He was excited too, and was happy to throw his old one away.  </li>
      <li>Spend more on the one with the full hand opening.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it and wish I had known about shampoo brushes a long time ago lol.</li>
      <li>The brush works for fine hair</li>
      <li>Finger hole is way too small to be effective - can&#x27;t get good leverage, and, it kind of hurts.</li>
      <li>This thing is cheap &amp; flimsy.  </li>
      <li>The price is right, and if they fall apart in a year, it&#x27;s no biggie to get more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the 4-pack and Price, wish I had ordered 8, but wanted to be sure about the quality.&lt;br /&gt;Design and materials seem fine so far.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to see that they are still made.  </li>
      <li>This particular set of shampoo combs had great soft bristles.</li>
      <li>The loop that you insert your finger in to hold the brush is super helpful.  </li>
      <li>My husky especially likes this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great package of brushes at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I have like 6inch long hair and these make my scalp feel so good.</li>
      <li>It is also good for freeing loose flakes on the scalp.</li>
      <li>Great little brushes for shower or brushing dogs and cats.</li>
      <li>It is great to use to lift limp hair too.  </li>
      <li>I know hair falls out naturally, but comparing this product to using my finger tips - this product pulls more hair out than my finger tips.</li>
      <li>This four pack should last me about 10 years and I am thinking that I should probably order two more 4-paks while they are still available....</li>
      <li>as represented, promptly shipped and priced right.</li>
      <li>After many years of continual use my old brush, which I&#x27;d purchased at Walgreens, finally lost too many bristles, so I set out to replace it.</li>
      <li>Great brushes with lots of bristes, unlike a different brand I bought earlier.</li>
      <li>I would say that overall I am satisfied with the brushes.</li>
      <li>These brushes are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>love these; especially with tar shampoos; just digging into the itch</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>reason I gave this 3 stars is because they were not as good as the ones I bought on amazon few years</li>
      <li>Works ok i have long hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Small but gets the job done.  Massage my head good.  It is great to use to lift limp hair too.  Got the 4 pack for $1 more than a single.</li>
    <li> They work great, even used one for the cat.</li>
    <li> My particular hair/scalp situation is that I have fine,oily, long hair with severe scalp psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the 4 pack of scalp brushes to remove scalp psoriasis scales and to simulate hair follicle growth. I would say that overall I am satisfied with the brushes. I really like the finger ring holder and the size of the brush which fits in my palm. I am able to work the brush thru my fine hair and find the bristle length to be suitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combined with psoriasis shampoo, I have found the brush to have made a real difference for my scalp. I also love that it helps lift my roots and give my hair more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I do find the brush to be to stiff. The brush has no flexibility and working the area around/behind the ear is not easy. I wish it had a little flex for areas where you need some curvature. The brush works for fine hair but I would not be sure of its effectiveness on thick hair due to its short bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good brush for anyone with fine hair at a nice price.</li>
    <li> It was delivered with speedy detail! Husband loved it as a gift. He has used this product for 40 years. He still has a full head of hair! This particular set of shampoo combs had great soft bristles. Very nice product. I&#x27;ll buy them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the 4-pack and Price, wish I had ordered 8, but wanted to be sure about the quality.&lt;br /&gt;Design and materials seem fine so far.  Too bad not carried at CVS or Walgreen anymore.</li>
    <li> Great little brushes for shower or brushing dogs and cats. I bought these to brush my pet children. They despise pet brushes, but tolerate these. My husky especially likes this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great package of brushes at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Works well and I&#x27;m glad I ordered the 4-pack! One for me, one for my daughter - I used the other two for our furry children! The cats and dog thoroughly enjoy having their fur combed with this! Easier to hold than most pet brushes too.</li>
    <li> this feels great on the scalp in the shower. I wanted something to massage my scalp and bring some blood flow to it to help have healthy hair. I removed one star because sometimes I feel that the middle piece on the bottom (where all the spikes are) grabs onto my hair. The spikes are fine and my girlfriend has thick hair and she says it works through that very well. I feel that the little piece in the middle can snag onto hair though. I do notice too that this tends to pull some hair out. I know hair falls out naturally, but comparing this product to using my finger tips - this product pulls more hair out than my finger tips. So which is better to use? Not sure yet. If my hair thins out from this I will move this to a 1 star and make sure people are warned. I hope this product won&#x27;t do any damage to my hair or anyone else. If anyone has any input on hair falling out with this please leave a comment to clear anything up. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The bristles are not long enough and they are not stiff enough to give an invigorating scalp massage.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Had them before and should have them for the rest of my life....LOL</li>
    <li> nice and cheap.  use a couple times a week to scrape the scalp during a shampoo and cheap enough to replace every month or 2.</li>
    <li> Good deal on a shower necessity.</li>
    <li> as represented, promptly shipped and priced right.</li>
    <li> Helped me remove lots of scalp build up.  I used with T-sal shampoo and T-gel conditioner.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! It&#x27;s not too hard but it still gives you a good scrub</li>
    <li> I bought the 4 pack, for me and my children. My boys love washing their hair and scrubbing with this! I love that is helped get rid of my dry scalp issue. This is also good for massaging and combing through your conditioner. Great price too!</li>
    <li> Shockingly effective.</li>
    <li> I love these. I would have been ecstatic with a multi-color pack, but all purple will do. Soft enough for scalp massage, tough enough to get through actual combing of wet straight hair.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my teenage son, who has problems with dandruff building up on his scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work great!  The plastic is soft and flexible, it fits perfectly in your hand.  Great deal on a 4 pack!</li>
    <li> Been looking for several years for this Item. Ive used this type of brush for shampooing for more than 50 years.  I&#x27;m 81 now and still have a thick full head of hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing, seriously. I have like 6inch long hair and these make my scalp feel so good. Its all about that exfoliaton</li>
    <li> love these; especially with tar shampoos; just digging into the itch</li>
    <li> The prongs on this brush are plenty long, and not to stiff to gouge the scalp. The 4 pack is handy, I gave 2 to my daughter. The price is right, and if they fall apart in a year, it&#x27;s no biggie to get more. Can&#x27;t find these in local stores, thank goodness for online shopping!</li>
    <li> works great and hole up well</li>
    <li> I love these little shampoo brushes. It&#x27;s like getting a scalp massage in the shower. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair and I have very long hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love!! I got my daughter one also and it feels great on our hair!!</li>
    <li> I actually bought these to groom my two little dogs. They love the scratching so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great product n dont break easily</li>
    <li> Good item, and does the job of scalp scrubbing in the shower. Also leave one in the car to brush my hair after driving, for I usually drive with the top or windows down or open.</li>
    <li> Great product, delivered on time! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> These are a bit smaller than I expected, but they are soft on your scalp and seems to work very well for shampooing or as a massager.  There is four in a shipment, each packaged individually.  They do the job, so I&#x27;m happy with what I&#x27;ve gotten.  The bristles might be a bit short for someone with very thick hair long hair, but for shorter hair they work just fine.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it and wish I had known about shampoo brushes a long time ago lol. I have naturally curly, long hair &amp; recommend you only use this on your scalp after detangling your hair thoroughly to avoid causing ripping out your hair.</li>
    <li> These brushes are exactly what I was looking for. After many years of continual use my old brush, which I&#x27;d purchased at Walgreens, finally lost too many bristles, so I set out to replace it. Neither my local Walgreens nor CVS carried shampoo scalp brushes or even knew what I was talking about. I bought the Walgreens online version but returned it because the bristles were too soft and rubbery. The bristles on these brushes are stiff and get rid of bits of dead skin, etc., that seem to accumulate between shampooings. I bought four but should have bought more, both to give as gifts and also to ensure that I never again have to put so much effort into finding such a helpful, small personal care item.</li>
    <li> YES; I love these ... makes the scalp tingle when shampooing ... and even feels good when just sitting around and scalp itches ...</li>
    <li> A lot of comments on here about this being too sharp to use.  These work great for me.  And, they are pretty sharp, but, I simply use it very gently.  I even use on my face.  They work really well.  I am quite pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Simple plastic brush. It&#x27;s 1-piece, solid plastic. The bristles are fairly stiff, so it scratches as you lather if you aren&#x27;t gently. I suppose that&#x27;s good and I&#x27;ll get used to it. I wanted something that would improve upon using my finger nails to scratch my scalp as I shampooed and this does the job much better.</li>
    <li> My husband has carried around one of these brushes for the past 30 years!  I was excited to see that they are still made.  He was excited too, and was happy to throw his old one away.  He said these are actually better quality than the one he had!</li>
    <li> I cannot see myself without these in my life! I have a head full of thick hair, probably enough to make four wigs out of if I ever cut it all off. I always have felt like I would never fully get in between all my hair whenever I would wash it so I finally got this shampoo brush after reading reviews on it and it is the best product out there! It evenly distributes product throughout my hair without having to miss any spot and I can use it to brush any knots out at the same time.</li>
    <li> I have used these little shampoo brushes for decades. I need these brushes just as much as I need the shampoo, to feel like I have done a good wash job. For some reason, they were taken off of the store shelves about 4 or 5 years ago. I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere. I was down to my last one, missing teeth and a broken finger handle and all. I had given up hope of finding a new one and was looking a pet brushes, when a friend of mine told me to look at amazon. OH BABY!!! There they are!! In a FOUR PACK, EVEN! I am so happy with these new brushes. This four pack should last me about 10 years and I am thinking that I should probably order two more 4-paks while they are still available....a lifetime supply!  Thanks Scalpmaster and Thanks to you too, Amazon.  Richard &amp;#34;Mr. Bubble&amp;#34; Hodgkinson  Va., U.S.A.</li>
    <li> just what I remember from years ago!  great scalp massager.</li>
    <li> I like it.  Works for me.  Price is right especially if you buy the multipack.</li>
    <li> A perfect replacement fyor the &#x27;Goody&#x27; brush which I cannot find any more. Would be better suited for travel if the finger clasp were collapsible.</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  I have struggled with dandruff since I was 5 years old, and using this, coupled with the Pura d&#x27;or Anti-dandruff: Premium Organic Shampoo, has helped me a ton.  I have really long hair and this brush works fine.  I scrub my scalp in the shower, and again once I get out and I&#x27;m in front of the mirror.  The loop that you insert your finger in to hold the brush is super helpful.  After scrubbing, my hairline is usually a bit red, so I put some ELMA&amp;SANA Golden Argan Oil on and it helps with that.</li>
    <li> I bought the pack of 4. I was hoping each one would be a different color, but all 4 were the same purple color.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave this 3 stars is because they were not as good as the ones I bought on amazon few years back.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the holder on the top has one finger hole. The previous ones had a holder for two fingers, which was much more convenient to maneuver. Otherwise they are good for what they are supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Very good price for 4. The quality is great too. Haven&#x27;t had any broken bristles yet. I feel this works the shampoo into the scalp better than if I just used my hands. It is also good for freeing loose flakes on the scalp.</li>
    <li> Love these things...feels great massaging my beard with them too- before/during shampoo.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time!  This thing is cheap &amp; flimsy.  If you have more than a military high &amp; tight it will have a hard time going through your hair.  Spend a couple more dollars &amp; get the Mar-V-Cide rubber shampoo brush.  I hate giving negative reviews, in fact this is the first one I&#x27;d ever written.</li>
    <li> Great brushes with lots of bristes, unlike a different brand I bought earlier. Great for under the shower scalp massage.</li>
    <li> These cheap purple brushes have worked wonders for relieving my scalp of dry skin. Highly recommended to anyone with an itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> I buy a multipack  of these every few months. I&#x27;m a hairdresser and I give them out to my clients all the time. It feels great in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Also makes a great pet brush! My cats love it!</li>
    <li> nice and small perfect compact brush for hair and more.</li>
    <li> not at all bendy. It&#x27;s more like Scrape master. Mastery at scraping your scalp off.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I had never heard of such an item before!! I am now completely hooked! It massages your scalp and is SO relaxing!! It&#x27;s also amazing for someone with Psoriasis it gently exfoliates and lessens the embarrassing flakes!</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and was skeptical if I could move this through it when my hair is heavy and wet. If I sweep from the edge of my hairline to the center of my scalp I can cover all area. It helped to control my winter dandruff and was a nice massage.</li>
    <li> I use it in the shower when shampooing my hair, it&#x27;s wonderful! Gets every inch of my scalp and feels like a massage. Bristles may be a little too harsh but I would buy again</li>
    <li> Finger hole is way too small to be effective - can&#x27;t get good leverage, and, it kind of hurts. Spend more on the one with the full hand opening.</li>
    <li> Works ok i have long hair so i cant use it as good as it should be used. Would be perfect for short hair</li>
    <li> This shampoo brush works well and in the four pack was reasonably priced.  Different shampoo brushes have bristles that are finer or thicker.  The bristles on this brush are finer, but sturdy enough.  As a matter of personal preference, I like a little thicker bristle so I gave the product a four rather than a five. If a person preferred the thinner bristle, that person might give this product6 a five star rating.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a simple &amp; very standard product, works exactly as expected, no surprises, I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> Now my wife can find one when she wants one, and still send some to family.</li>
    <li> The shampoo brush is just ok.  It&#x27;s not as massaging as I though it would be, but it DOES help get the shampoo thoroughly distributed through my very thick hair.  So I&#x27;m using less shampoo, which is cool.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Does what it should!  For those of you who think the teeth are too sharp, try this... Apply Less Pressure!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who is having dandruff issues. She has used it once and I can already tell a big difference.</li>
    <li> Oh man where have these been hiding.  I used to have these when I was young, but just couldn&#x27;t find them locally.  The are a lighter plastic than the ones from my childhood (is&#x27;t everything) but they perform beautifully and feel GREAT.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the discontinued &amp;#34;Goodie&amp;#34; shampoo brush, but is the most reasonable substitute I have found.</li>
</ol>
