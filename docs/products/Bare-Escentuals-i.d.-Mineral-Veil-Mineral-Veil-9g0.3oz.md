      <li>I love Mineral Veil!</li>

      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>Bare minerals is the best make up I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I love the look and feel of Mineral Veil.</li>
      <li>It covers and stays on all day, can&#x27;t get much better than that .</li>
      <li>Love love love my mineral veil powder.  </li>
      <li>I think it is a good product if you have really oily skin or acne.</li>
      <li>First off, I should have paid attention to the size, this is more like a travel size and not one you want to keep in your make up bag.</li>
      <li>Always with a fresh look!</li>
      <li>Mineral Veil is a good product, and I do add it to my regimen, but I tend to prefer a loose powder on top of everything to set my make up.</li>
      <li>It has a nice light feel, not a heavy powder.</li>
      <li>Still the same great product and still loving it daily.</li>
      <li>I love this product &amp; love that I am able ti order on line fir convience &amp; that I can get the product for much less than in the stores.</li>

      <li>Love bare minerals.</li>
      <li>I apply it after putting on my daily makeup for a  lovely finished look that lasts all day.</li>
      <li>and I think you have to be very careful as the sellers may be doing misleading practices to make more money than it is worth.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Bare Escentuals for many years and never really had problems, but the powder just simply didn&#x27;t want to seem to come out of this one.</li>
      <li>It is very small and I will return it after doing some more research.  </li>
      <li>I finally gave up - tossed it - and went to the store and bought a new one.</li>
      <li>I use Bare Escentuals periodically.  </li>
      <li>cheaper here then at Bare Escentuals website, just have to check sizes when getting,  </li>
      <li>Several people have raved about Bare Essentials to me and I tried it.</li>

    <li> I love not paying overpriced salon prices!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. Still the same great product and still loving it daily. This product is a wonderful finish for your face each day.</li>
    <li> cheaper here then at Bare Escentuals website, just have to check sizes when getting,  there are several different sizes.  It has a nice light feel, not a heavy powder.</li>
    <li> Love love love my mineral veil powder.  It&#x27;s awesome !!!</li>
    <li> Several people have raved about Bare Essentials to me and I tried it. Went back to Mary Kay. Bare Mineras dried out my skin after the 2nd day of use and my face is normal skin oil type. I think it is a good product if you have really oily skin or acne.</li>
    <li> I love Mineral Veil! It gives a very beautiful appearance to the face since it is matte. Always with a fresh look!</li>
    <li> I use Bare Escentuals periodically.  I tend to switch between a couple of make up lines.  Mineral Veil is a good product, and I do add it to my regimen, but I tend to prefer a loose powder on top of everything to set my make up.</li>
    <li> Not sure that this is the real deal. Will not buy again from this buyer or Amazon. Does not go on like the makeup from the store.</li>
    <li> Love bare minerals. They make a great product. It covers and stays on all day, can&#x27;t get much better than that .</li>
    <li> I love this product &amp; love that I am able ti order on line fir convience &amp; that I can get the product for much less than in the stores.</li>
    <li> Product says 9g/.3 ounce in one spot but says .2 ounce in another.  I&#x27;m still trying to weigh it but it is impossible to weigh anything but the whole container, which doesn&#x27;t tell you how much you get.  It is very small and I will return it after doing some more research.  Do not buy this.  I&#x27;ve been using mineral veil for years and I think you have to be very careful as the sellers may be doing misleading practices to make more money than it is worth.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> Bare minerals is the best make up I have ever used. It provides all day coverage.  Is very good for your skin.</li>
    <li> Item was just what I was looking fir and a great price</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love these products and received pretty fast</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I wear it over my foundation and it sets it like a dream. It stays matte all day and blurs out imperfections. Will buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> Works great and I&#x27;m not getting breakouts from it</li>
    <li> I love the look and feel of Mineral Veil. I apply it after putting on my daily makeup for a  lovely finished look that lasts all day.</li>
