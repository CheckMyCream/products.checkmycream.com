      <li>I still got good results.  </li>

      <li>Love this mask!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty impressed</li>
      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>I liked this product as soon as I opened the jar and noticed the luscious vanilla scent.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice and did not leave any residue on my hair.</li>
      <li>The Fekkai Prx Mask is a nice conditioner for your hair.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice like vanilla</li>
      <li>Like most married couples, my wife and I don’t agree on everything, but one thing we do agree on is that Fekkai makes some of the best hair care products in the market today.</li>
      <li>also, as others noted, has a very strong smell.</li>
      <li>gave this jar a good sniff and while I could smell a light scent, it didn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
      <li>It can temporarily make your hair smooth &amp; shiny but if your hair is already damaged, you either have to cut it &amp; then make sure you don&#x27;t damage it again by taking good care of it</li>
      <li>In fact I thought it was mild and pleasant.  </li>
      <li>First the good: I absolutely love the scent!</li>
      <li>Great conditioning cream, really helps with fried frizzy hair like mine!</li>
      <li>The product has a really strong vanilla smell, which I liked</li>
      <li>they contain Argan Extract which I also love..</li>
      <li>I love how my hair looks and feels afterward.</li>
      <li>The Fekkai Prx Mask is definitely a fantastic addition!</li>
      <li>I love Fekkai &amp; use their curl products..</li>
      <li>This is not going to magically repair damaged hair - no product can do that.  </li>
      <li>Fekkai is one of my favorite hair care brands.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never tried a product like this before, but I definitely have hair that is perfect for it.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>I look forward to warmer weather when I can leave it in longer to see if I can get even better</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice that it worked any better than regular Fekkai conditioner, but it worked just as well, which is to say, great!</li>
      <li>Promises of lovely waves, no frizz, you name it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many hair products that had virtually no effect on my hair.</li>
      <li>but sometimes it seems OK in the bottle</li>
      <li>This mask is helping it heal, so that I will be able to get summer highlights.  </li>
      <li>Most people don&#x27;t need a lot of conditioning at the root area, so you can apply from the mid-shaft to the ends.  </li>
      <li>On my hair, with the help of a warm towel wrap and some time to soak in, it soaks in, and it leaves a silky smooth result.  </li>
      <li>My hair felt smoother and silkier, and the curls seemed more manageable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So it was no surprise that my wife and I agreed on one more thing:</li>
      <li>The scent is lovely and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>My hair has never looked or felt better.</li>
      <li>and/or keep using a product like this which will give you the *appearance* of healthy hair.  </li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s a very strong smell and may be too strong for some).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But the intense masque was amazing!</li>
      <li>My &amp;#34;experiments&amp;#34; are not always successful, but this conditioning mask really worked for me.  </li>
      <li>It also has a nice vanilla fragrance, but it&#x27;s a bit too sweet smelling for me.  </li>
      <li>Love the Fekkai line, so I was excited I was able to try this product.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair silky and smooth, better than Redmon etc.</li>
      <li>On the other hand, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed awesome results.</li>
      <li>I definitely enjoy using this conditioner on my own hair and feel it is worth the expense.</li>
      <li>For more intense conditioning I apply the mask and cover my head with an inexpensive plastic shower cap then wrap a warm towel over that, and leave it in my hair for 15 minutes before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it might be too strong for some.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s made a huge difference.</li>
      <li>This mask helps keep my hair silky smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>Not Recommended for those who prefer fragrance free products</li>
      <li>I can get 5 uses from this jar on my shoulder length hair, but clearly how many uses anyone else will get is dependent on their own hair.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a very nice product, but I probably will use others in the future.</li>
      <li>that she had to leave her hair in a warm towel - mainly because she felt that she was not getting work done in the house.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For reference, the directions say, &amp;#34;Apply to clean, damp hair.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t however provide the lasting results of a hot oil treatment, and the smell, however delicious, is a bit much.  </li>
      <li>I used this Fekkai Prx Mask as directed on a very humid day and was extremely pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>If your hair is much thicker and/or longer, you will need to use more of the jar to cover your hair.</li>
      <li>This is a good deep conditioner that does leave hair somewhat smoother.  </li>
      <li>No bad hair day for me today.  </li>
      <li>However, for the price, there are so many other products that would seem more appealing.</li>
      <li>Luckily, it disappears.</li>
      <li>This conditioner has a mild vanilla scent.  </li>
      <li>This product did what I was hoping it would do and the price seems very very reasonable, so I will be purchasing it when my free sample is gone.</li>
      <li>I end up using more hair product than normal to restore volume once I&#x27;ve used this</li>
      <li>I have to confess that I&#x27;m a hair product junkie and love to experiment with new products.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s in good shape, though it&#x27;s on the dry side</li>
      <li>hair is SO soft and I seriously can&#x27;t stop touching the ends where it looks like I just got the perfect haircut-</li>
      <li>At first glance, I originally thought it was for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was the fresh,  clean smell.  </li>
      <li>Good results, sure, but as I write this, one jar is $7.42, and it only contains enough for about 5 weeks&#x27; worth of washing (assuming I use it once a week as instructed).</li>
      <li>I recommend that if you have hair that could use some rejuvenation, this is worth trying at this price point.</li>
      <li>If you can stand the scent, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>My hair is more coarse now that I have more grey hair, so I am always looking for something that will condition better.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this the price is right</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really do any better than my normal</li>
      <li>The scent is floral in a very sophisticated way that quickly scentedthe bath and faded down once my hair was rinsed.  </li>
      <li>When you first open this, you&#x27;re greeted by the delicious smell of vanilla custard, and when you put it on your fingers, it&#x27;s thick, rich, and creamy.  </li>
      <li>the single direction was to leave it on for 5-10 minutes, with one&#x27;s head covered with a warm towel.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give this product a good testing, so I used Axe Intense shampoo to get my hair extra clean prior to applying the Fekkai masque.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> In my shower I have the much larger 7oz container of this product that I spend $25 on at a local beauty store. I have been using it weekly since it was recommended last year in a list of 10 new beauty products not to be without (Allure maybe?). I am not a huge fan of the scent, but it is not offensive and I love the way it works on my hair and it smells pleasant in my dry hair. I regularly use Pureology Hydrate on my hair and this as deep conditioning when I need it (at least once a week). This mask helps keep my hair silky smooth and shiny. This container is very very small (I would call it trail size). I can get 5 uses from this jar on my shoulder length hair, but clearly how many uses anyone else will get is dependent on their own hair. I am not going to take off any stars for the inflated price of this much smaller product because I would have bought this size product the first time if it had been an option. I definitely enjoy using this conditioner on my own hair and feel it is worth the expense.</li>
    <li> I have to confess that I&#x27;m a hair product junkie and love to experiment with new products.  My &amp;#34;experiments&amp;#34; are not always successful, but this conditioning mask really worked for me.  My hair is long and color treated; I shampoo and blow dry daily and use a curling iron or flat iron more than I probably should.  Despite the abuse I heap on my hair it&#x27;s in good shape, though it&#x27;s on the dry side (no surprise!) and this product leaves my hair soft and smooth with plenty of bounce and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use:  Shampoo hair and wring out the excess water.  Apply a small amount (I use a Tablespoon but you may need more or less depending on length and texture) and leave on for a few minutes.  Rinse thoroughly and style as usual.  For more intense conditioning I apply the mask and cover my head with an inexpensive plastic shower cap then wrap a warm towel over that, and leave it in my hair for 15 minutes before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:  1.69 oz. is not a lot of product but you can use it sparingly.  Most people don&#x27;t need a lot of conditioning at the root area, so you can apply from the mid-shaft to the ends.  In fact, if your hair texture is fine and you&#x27;re worried about the conditioner weighing it down and making it look flat, I&#x27;d recommend skipping the root area.  This is a weekly treatment and not meant for use as a daily conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  Leaves my hair soft and shiny with lots of volume.  I&#x27;m not mad about the vanilla scent, but I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant or overpowering either.  May not be rich enough for coarse or very damaged hair types. **Not Recommended for those who prefer fragrance free products**</li>
    <li> I got this to review through the Amazon Vine program.  I was looking for a new conditioning treatment for my hair since the ends up my hair always get a bit dry.  This does a good job of moisturizing and smoothing.  However it does have some issues as well.  There really aren&#x27;t any instructions on the container, so I used it like I would a normal conditioner (apply after washing hair, leave on for 2-3 minutes and rinse).  The product has a really strong vanilla smell, which I liked but it might be too strong for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem with this for me was that it made my skin breakout where my hair touched my skin.  The other issue was that my hair got greasier a lot faster (I usually wash my hair every 3-4 days and I had to wash after a day when I used this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it does make your hair softer and smoother as promised.  However I won&#x27;t be using it because it made the skin on my face (where my hair brushes) break out pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Makes hair soft and smooth&lt;br /&gt;- Smells nice like vanilla (it&#x27;s a very strong smell and may be too strong for some).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Instructions are very vague&lt;br /&gt;- My hair got greasier quicker&lt;br /&gt;- My skin broke out where my hair brushes it after using this (I have very sensitive skin)</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS DEEP CONDITIONER. It smells like vanilla pudding, and such a little bit goes such a long way. I love how my hair looks and feels afterward. Best of all, it doesnt affect my hair color at all! Highly recommend this, it&#x27;s super.</li>
    <li> Our college daughter is using the Fekkai Prx Mask and she exclaims, &amp;#34;I like it!&amp;#34; She continues on to say how light it feels--and yet very effective!  She also talks about how very nice the smell is. All in all, we are very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Love the Fekkai line, so I was excited I was able to try this product.  I used this after shampooing with the Fekkai brilliant glossing shampoo.  This conditioner has a mild vanilla scent.  It is infused with argon extract, which smooths and makes for a shiny head of hair.  I used a good sized dollop and combed through my hair.  I left the condition in for about 4 minutes and immediately upon rinsing I could feel a difference!  Upon blow drying, my hair was softer and smoother than its been in awhile. I regularly color and flat iron my hair, so it takes a beating.  I will definitely used this product over and over.  FYI...this is a smaller jar.  For longer hair it probably will only last 6-8 applications at most!</li>
    <li> I have found that inexpensive conditioners, which one can obtain in a supermarket, or plain shea butter or coconut oil, to have an effect that is equal to or better than this product. It comes with no directions. I assumed it was for use after shampooing - the single direction was to leave it on for 5-10 minutes, with one&#x27;s head covered with a warm towel. It is rather thick and greasy, and, though it helped with detangling, it left the hair rather &#x27;fly away.&#x27; I have very tight, thick curls, so the effect may be quite different for others. It is an acceptable product, but not exceptional.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair silky and smooth, better than Redmon etc.</li>
    <li> The Fekkai Prx Mask is a nice conditioner for your hair.  My hair is more coarse now that I have more grey hair, so I am always looking for something that will condition better.  I have only used this after my hair wash and did not do the hot towel as suggested.  I still got good results.  I do not use this everyday, just a couple of times a week and I only use about a quarter size each time, depending on how much hair you have. I would recommend this the price is right and it works.</li>
    <li> Love this mask! My hair is silver and it brought back such a nice luster and shine! I give this five stars and a big thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Very nice as I will b buying a bigger bottle it will a long time U only need a very small amount it&#x27;s wonderful</li>
    <li> My wife had a chance to pamper her hair with Fekki Prx Mask over the weekend as she had not had much time to go to a salon to do so ever since we have a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While she loves the fact that her hair is getting the appropriate treatment that it should be getting, she was impatient about the 5 min (or 10 min) that she had to leave her hair in a warm towel - mainly because she felt that she was not getting work done in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves that her hair feels so much silkier and softer after the treatment but felt that the DIY process too much preparation as compared to having it done at a hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said that perhaps the next time when she has the time to go to the salon, she would bring this in to ask her regular hairstylist to use this mask on her instead as she loves that this Fekkai Mask has Argen extracts, makes her hair very smooth and shiny. She wished that I had ordered this prior to her cutting her long hair to shoulder length as she would then be keep her long hair untangled and shiny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d have to say this is one of the worst packaging. When I received the product, I didn&#x27;t even remember what it was for. All it says on the jar was &amp;#34;Fekkai PrX Prepartives, Argan Extract&amp;#34;. Neither the packaging nor any wording on the product would clue me in that it&#x27;s basically for hair and a conditioner at that. I had to go back to Amazon to figure out what this product is for and how to even use it. At first glance, I originally thought it was for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading up on how to use the product, it seemed to work like an intense conditioner. However, for the price, there are so many other products that would seem more appealing.</li>
    <li> I used this Fekkai Prx Mask as directed on a very humid day and was extremely pleased with the results. I have very curly/frizzy hair and this DID tame the frizz a bit. I also didn&#x27;t completely blow it dry, and I think that helped as well. My hair felt smoother and silkier, and the curls seemed more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance was nice and subtle going on, and after rinsing my hair simply smelled clean. This product did what I was hoping it would do and the price seems very very reasonable, so I will be purchasing it when my free sample is gone. I recommend that if you have hair that could use some rejuvenation, this is worth trying at this price point.</li>
    <li> Great conditioning cream, really helps with fried frizzy hair like mine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what other reviewers are talking about in regards to there not being any ingredient list or directions with this product. Mine came with a sticker on the bottom that folded out and included both. For reference, the directions say, &amp;#34;Apply to clean, damp hair. Leave on 3-5 minutes. Rinse well.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is very, very small. I have long, fine hair and the amount of mask in this container will only give me about three treatments, which is very few for the current $7+ price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also, as others noted, has a very strong smell. I usually don&#x27;t mind strong-smelling hair products, but I&#x27;m not very fond of this because it is sort of a floral vanilla scent that&#x27;s a bit too perfume-y for my personal taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, the mask definitely works. It didn&#x27;t help as much with flyaways as I would have liked, but it certainly smoothed my hair without making it feel heavy or greasy. If you can stand the scent, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> My hair is currently healing from some slight damage as a result of color correction.  This mask is helping it heal, so that I will be able to get summer highlights.  It smells great, and leaves my hair feeling wonderful!</li>
    <li> Like most married couples, my wife and I don’t agree on everything, but one thing we do agree on is that Fekkai makes some of the best hair care products in the market today. So when I had the opportunity to try this product, it was a given that we were both going to be using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She used it three or four mornings over a week or so, both before work and on days off. She reported that even though she usually has to use some kind of pre-treatment on her hair before styling, with the Fekkai masque, she was able to do away with the pre-blow dry sprays and mousses. She said her hair felt much softer, was far less tangled, and much easier to handle. She also said that her hair stayed in place and looked better longer, even when using it only every other day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give this product a good testing, so I used Axe Intense shampoo to get my hair extra clean prior to applying the Fekkai masque. My hair also happened to be as long as it’s been in the last three years, so I was really able to evaluate the appearance and feel of the product. The verdict: I didn&#x27;t notice that it worked any better than regular Fekkai conditioner, but it worked just as well, which is to say, great! Hair is soft, scalp is smooth and not itchy, and the shininess of my grays and light browns showed well against my regular brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the tub of product is a little small and pricey compared to regular Fekkai conditioner, so I’ll probably leave the rest to the missus. But even with the small tub, because you only need to use a very small amount to get complete coverage, it should still last a long time. Also, if my wife gets by without using pre-styling products, this becomes a very competitively priced hair care product. And performance-wise, it is, like I said, great. So it was no surprise that my wife and I agreed on one more thing: this is a five star product.</li>
    <li> Was selected to test &amp; review the Fekkai VoxBox .. The shampoo &amp; conditioner samples were 2 tiny for my head of hair to get a real feel for it. But the intense masque was amazing! My hair is dry, curly, &amp; colored, so I need all the help I can get! I love Fekkai &amp; use their curl products.. But hadn&#x27;t tried these b4.. they contain Argan Extract which I also love.. CLAIM of FAME: supposed 2 repair, moisturize, shine, &amp; protect your hair.. MY RESULTS: this def kept my hair soft &amp; shiny all day long! I don&#x27;t believe anything can repair damaged hair unless its a trim! But this masque def helps strengthen &amp; protect ur hair!</li>
    <li> Amazing. My hair has never looked or felt better. A definite must buy!!</li>
    <li> Product is alright typical for fekkai but kind of annoying this item arrived without a box, I&#x27;m assuming it came from a trial size kit which I would have liked to know before making the purchase.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  Fixed my damaged hair instantly.</li>
    <li> I left this on in the shower for about 5 minutes and it did a decent job of detangling and smoothing out my hair. My hair was less frizzy and was pretty soft the next day, even with the wet weather we had. It smells nice and did not leave any residue on my hair. I have had good luck with Fekkai products before, so I was happy to try this. The jar is small and there is probably only 2 or 3 applications for my thick hair. I would imagine someone who uses a flat iron would have even better results than I did with this.</li>
    <li> I have scent sensitivities so I always have a little trepidation when trying a new hair or skin product.  Sometimes I can tell just by sniffing the bottle that it has too much perfume for me but sometimes it seems OK in the bottle but after I have used it, the lingering perfumes hit me and make me miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this jar a good sniff and while I could smell a light scent, it didn&#x27;t bother me.  In fact I thought it was mild and pleasant.  I used it in the shower in the place of my usual conditioner ([[ASIN:B00AVWJS1O Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner 12.6oz]]).  The scent didn&#x27;t bother me while it was on my hair nor was there any issue afterwards.  No scent issues from this for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it is too cold in my house here in Minnesota to sit around for 10-15 minutes waiting to rinse out this mask, I only left it in for about 5 minutes as I finished my shower.  At first I didn&#x27;t think it made my hair feel any different than my regular conditioner, but as the week went on my hair stayed feeling softer.  I look forward to warmer weather when I can leave it in longer to see if I can get even better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is fairly small and I initially wondered whether I would need to use the whole thing for just one use.  My hair is straight and a little fine and just brushes my shoulders in length.  An amount that I estimate would be about 1/5 to 1/4 of the jar per use worked well for me.  If your hair is much thicker and/or longer, you will need to use more of the jar to cover your hair.</li>
    <li> I live in the mid-atlantic where it&#x27;s cold and snowy right now,  which means dry,  heated,  indoor air with tons of static.  My thick,  curly hair is unusually flat and incredibly staticky,  very annoying.  Nothing was working,  so while I really like Fekkai products,  I didn&#x27;t think the hair mask could help.  I was totally wrong.  The first thing I noticed was the fresh,  clean smell.  It gave me hope that spring is coming.  I washed my hair and towel dried it.  I slathered on about a tablespoon of the Fekkai hair mask and wrapped my hair in a warm towel as the instructions indicated (just throw your towel in the dryer for a few mins).  I left the mask on for about 10 minutes, then rinsed with lukewarm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed an immediate difference.  My hair didn&#x27;t feel weighed down and when it dried,  my curls were bouncy,  shiny and static free.  No bad hair day for me today.  This is great for chemically treated hair too.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair feel and look shiny-smooth.  This is not going to magically repair damaged hair - no product can do that.  It can temporarily make your hair smooth &amp; shiny but if your hair is already damaged, you either have to cut it &amp; then make sure you don&#x27;t damage it again by taking good care of it and/or keep using a product like this which will give you the *appearance* of healthy hair.  Nothing can permanently mend split ends - appear mended/smooth? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser tells me NOT to wash my hair every day - every other day is plenty &amp; if you have dry hair/scalp, you should wash it even less than that.  BUT if you are going to wash it every day, you should always use a conditioner.  A weekly masque can also help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third ingredient is Behentrimonium Chloride which is a plant based conditioner that can actually penetrate your hair shaft to give you heavy duty conditioning.  Silicone Quaternium-25 (fifth ingredient) is a silicone that helps provide elasticity to hair.  Then we get to the Argan oil  (sixth ingredient) &amp; after that copolymers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a cloying/sweet, vanilla; not too overwhelming but not good - smells cheap.  It is that fakey-sweet &amp;#34;vanilla&amp;#34; scent that is in every celebrity fragrance these days.  Luckily, it disappears.</li>
    <li> At just shy of 2 ounces, I figured with long hair I&#x27;d get maybe a single use out of this masque.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasantly surprised that a little of the thick creme does go a long way.  The scent is floral in a very sophisticated way that quickly scentedthe bath and faded down once my hair was rinsed.  In this ultra cold winter, my hair could use some TLC as it&#x27;s quite dry, and the beneficial argan oil this masque contains make my hair silky and detangled (curly hair here) and only a little conditioner after rinsing it out was needed to finish cleansing routine.  Once dry, my hair felt and looked improved in that I saw less split ends/flyaway hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan use this once a week and see how it feels after styling a couple of times.  I typically air dry my hair then flat iron, so the additional oils to moisturize my hair is a great boost.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the tiny packaging fool you, this conditioning masque packs a powerful punch! It doesn&#x27;t take much, I used a little more than a dime&#x27;s size for my almost shoulder length thick hair. I left it on for around three minutes and then thoroughly rinsed it out. It left my hair feeling silky smooth and soft! I&#x27;m pretty impressed and my hair is loving it!</li>
    <li> When you first open this, you&#x27;re greeted by the delicious smell of vanilla custard, and when you put it on your fingers, it&#x27;s thick, rich, and creamy.  On my hair, with the help of a warm towel wrap and some time to soak in, it soaks in, and it leaves a silky smooth result.  The hair has a bounce and sheen it hasn&#x27;t had in ages.  It doesn&#x27;t however provide the lasting results of a hot oil treatment, and the smell, however delicious, is a bit much.  I think this it&#x27;s a very nice product, but I probably will use others in the future.</li>
    <li> This tiny jar (it is tiny, I hadn&#x27;t realized how tiny until I got it) of masque gave me mixed feelings. On the one hand, it smells awesome, like vanilla pudding. Between this and my Cinnamon Pumpkin body wash, I basically smelled like a latte for a short, glorious while. On the other hand, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed awesome results. Good results, sure, but as I write this, one jar is $7.42, and it only contains enough for about 5 weeks&#x27; worth of washing (assuming I use it once a week as instructed). I have really long hair, so someone with short hair could probably get at least double that. It seems a little pricy for the results. It didn&#x27;t really do any better than my normal conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;As for hair strengthening, I can&#x27;t say I could tell if it worked or not, but then, how would you ever tell? I certainly don&#x27;t measure the number of times my hair breaks. So I will just assume it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions are included, though they are sort of hidden on the bottom of the bottle. First there are instructions for deep conditioning (wrap hair with warm damp towel for 5-10 min), but the regular directions are actually underneath that. You have to peel back the label.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Fekkai products and this conditioning mask makes me love them a little more. My hair is pretty damaged from years of coloring and washing, drying, and straightening every day. For the past year, I&#x27;ve been working to wash and style my hair only twice per week and it&#x27;s made a huge difference. But after using this mask, I&#x27;ve seen an even more amazing difference! I only really use it on the ends of my hair and since I&#x27;m usually in a rush in the mornings, I leave it on for about 3 minutes before rinsing it off and then cold rinsing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is SO soft and I seriously can&#x27;t stop touching the ends where it looks like I just got the perfect haircut- Obviously it&#x27;s not possible for a conditioner to get rid of split ends, but having healthier, softer ends means they don&#x27;t look so frayed and split. The container it comes in is small, but a tiny bit of this stuff goes a long way and since you&#x27;re only supposed to use it once a week, you should be able to go a long time before needing to repurchase. Plus, the cost is pretty low!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY thing I don&#x27;t like about this conditioner is the smell. It&#x27;s overpowering and a little too much for me in the morning. But if I could give this product 4 1/2 stars, I definitely would!</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this hair mask. First the good: I absolutely love the scent! It&#x27;s vanilla with floral notes. I also like the way my hair feels after I use it--smooth and silky. Now the bad: I have fine hair, and while I love the way this makes my hair feel, I don&#x27;t like the way it makes my hair look--weighed down and flat. I end up using more hair product than normal to restore volume once I&#x27;ve used this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the so-so results and small amount of product (seriously, I have chin length hair, and I only got about five uses out of it), I&#x27;m happy that I got to sample it, but I won&#x27;t be buying it.</li>
    <li> This is a good deep conditioner that does leave hair somewhat smoother.  It also has a nice vanilla fragrance, but it&#x27;s a bit too sweet smelling for me.  It doesn&#x27;t give me a headache, but still seems a bit like a perfume product.  I followed the directions on the jar, which said to leave on your hair for 3-5 minutes, not the directions on this Amazon page that said to wrap your hair in a towel, and leave on for 5-10 minutes.  Using it for 5 minutes left my hair nicely conditioned, but it did not seem that much more conditioned then when I use a typical cream conditioner, as I do every night.  But, as I stated in the beginning of this review, my hair was smoother looking.  Next time I&#x27;ll try the towel/5-10 minute method, and see if that makes any difference.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to since a cream conditioner is a cream conditioner, not a hot oil one. It&#x27;s usually only hot oil treatments that make my hair truly noticeably different.</li>
    <li> Fekkai is one of my favorite hair care brands. The Fekkai Prx Mask is definitely a fantastic addition! After shampooing with Fekkai Apple Cider Vinegar shampoo, I used this mask. The scent is lovely and not overpowering. The Argan oils softened my hair and after styling, I could see a difference. My hair felt and looked healthier. I think this is a great once a week mask.</li>
    <li> I liked this product as soon as I opened the jar and noticed the luscious vanilla scent.  For me, it hit just the right note, neither too shy nor too aggressive but a felicitous balance.  The mask itself is thick, rich and of a creamy consistency.  After application I was happy to see that it stayed in place and didn&#x27;t tend to run or drip the way thinner treatments do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 5 minutes, I rinsed it out and let my hair dry naturally.  I was pleased with the results.  The Fekkai Prx Mask left my hair shiny, soft and manageable, qualities that have eluded me during the long cold winter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a product like this before, but I definitely have hair that is perfect for it. It&#x27;s thick, long, and just a little wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This... is great. I&#x27;ve tried many hair products that had virtually no effect on my hair. Promises of lovely waves, no frizz, you name it. I tried this one time, and I could immediately notice the difference - and the difference stayed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit, the jar is a little smaller than I expected, and with long hair it might be a little pricy since I have to use a tiny bit more than normal users, but if it continues to work like this it&#x27;s totally worth it, especially in Michigan winters.</li>
    <li> This product works well, it made my hair soft and shiny with just a small amount of product. The container is very very small so I use it sparingly. It smells wonderful too.</li>
