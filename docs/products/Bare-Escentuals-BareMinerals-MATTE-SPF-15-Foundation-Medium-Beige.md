      <li>This is my first time using the \\&quot;matte.\\&quot; I bought because it was cheaper to be honest.</li>

      <li>love bare minerals!!!!! :)</li>
      <li>Quick n easy to apply</li>
      <li>and they stated it is not their original product.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, the product was fine and probably this mechanicly error was probably more a factory fault than through this particular seller.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals since the original infomercials and have stopped trying to find a better product because there just isn&#x27;t one out there!  </li>

      <li>I love the new lid that allows you to close the holes so it doesn&#x27;t spill.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>but overall it is nice.</li>
      <li>I love Bare Minerals foundation.  </li>
      <li>LOVE THE ENTIRE LINE.</li>
      <li>but as I went outside I was able to tell.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>the product is good, but so hard to apply.</li>
      <li>Got my purchase in a timely manner and packed very well.</li>
      <li>Very light and orange in color compared to my other medium colored foundation bought from the department store.</li>
      <li>Definitely not the original product.</li>
      <li>The coverage is about medium, not what I would call full coverage, just moderate coverage.</li>
      <li>I used original for past 7 yrs and love bare minerals.</li>
      <li>It has a strange smell and does not work as the original product.</li>
      <li>In my dark room it seemed fine</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, prone to breakouts, even though I&#x27;m in my 50s, and this never irritates my skin.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t believe the price and fast service will never go to ulta again for bare essentials.</li>
      <li>I received my order a day early!</li>
      <li>I always use a primer first, though (not necessarily theirs).  </li>
      <li>After only a few hours I look like a lighthouse because my face is so shiny... very light coverage</li>
      <li>I tested some marks with old one and not even comparable.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t risk it, just order from bare minerals or sephora for this product.</li>
      <li>The top that is supposed to twist to close off the powder was broken and will not close.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big Bare Minerals fan -</li>
      <li>This is my third or fourth container of bare minerals, I&#x27;ll never buy another foundation!</li>

    <li> Best make up ever. Quick n easy to apply</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years&lt;br /&gt;It is what works best for me&lt;br /&gt;Easiest to order on Amazon, get it on my door step&lt;br /&gt;as apposed to driving two hours to their salon</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I was worried about the quality ordering online.  It was the same quality and coverage as what I bought at the shops.</li>
    <li> Product used in past. Easy to apply with a brush.I use it with the Prime Time Foundation Primer, and the Mineral Veil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I love it.  I&#x27;m so glad I was able to pick this up on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love Bare Minerals foundation.  I have rosacea and this is the only makeup I have found to cover my red cheeks.  It is very easy to apply and I am very satisfied with the coverage.  I love being able to order it from Amazon and have it delivered and it&#x27;s cheaper than buying it in the store.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe the price and fast service will never go to ulta again for bare essentials.</li>
    <li> Best face product I have ever used. Threw my Estee Lauder foundation in the back of the drawer. I am completely satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Love my Bareminerals!</li>
    <li> Definitely not the original product. Felt and looked like powder you would get from a local drug store. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using the \\&quot;matte.\\&quot; I bought because it was cheaper to be honest. I used original for past 7 yrs and love bare minerals. Nothing covers my blemishes better. I like the matte. It covers well. I can go either way. Both are good only opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT.  After using for a few days I am noticing it does not cover well.  In my dark room it seemed fine but as I went outside I was able to tell.&lt;br /&gt;The original is much more concentrated.  It actually covered red marks.  This product is too sheer.  It feels more like the mineral veil.  Looks powdery on face but doesn&#x27;t cover anything at all.  I tested some marks with old one and not even comparable.  Im disappointed as this was expensive.  :/</li>
    <li> Very good services , also good product,  so happy</li>
    <li> Very good price, and fast shipment!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years - ordered from this site because of great price</li>
    <li> LOVE THE ENTIRE LINE. DERMATOLOGIST RECOMMENDED.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS ALL I WEAR. LIGHTWEIGHT AND GREAT COLOR SELECTIONS.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals since the original infomercials and have stopped trying to find a better product because there just isn&#x27;t one out there!  This product is so incredibly light that it feels as if you&#x27;re wearing nothing however the coverage is amazing.  It evens out skin tone and covers blemishes easily without ever being cakey.  Another plus is that I can sleep with this make-up on without any ramifications in the morning.</li>
    <li> Bare Escentuals has the best mineral foundation. It provides good coverage without drying out or creating oily skin. I love the new lid that allows you to close the holes so it doesn&#x27;t spill.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big Bare Minerals fan - I love this foundation and never have any issues with it.</li>
    <li> I am most disappointed with this purchase, it is definitely NOT GENUINE. It has a strange smell and does not work as the original product.</li>
    <li> I swear by this makeup!!! I have oily skin and am prone to break outs. the matte helps absorb the oil through the day and leaves my skin feeling healthy. this is a must have in the beauty world (&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love the way this foundation goes on in the matte format.  I always use a primer first, though (not necessarily theirs).  I have very sensitive skin, prone to breakouts, even though I&#x27;m in my 50s, and this never irritates my skin.  The coverage is about medium, not what I would call full coverage, just moderate coverage.</li>
    <li> I like  this product but unfortunately I think it would&#x27;ve been a better idea to get the matte.  After only a few hours I look like a lighthouse because my face is so shiny... very light coverage but overall it is nice.</li>
    <li> The color is perfect, and it makes my skin look younger and evens out the color beautifully. This is my favorite foundation. I also use it at times to dust over other products to tone down the color if  I have inadvertently applied too much. Great product.</li>
    <li> Fake :(&lt;br /&gt;Compared the bottom label to none I purchased at an actual bare minerals store and they are completely different. Don&#x27;t risk it, just order from bare minerals or sephora for this product.</li>
    <li> thing product does a great job in covering my problems. it light and fresh looking. what more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve used this for years and have no plans to change makeup.</li>
    <li> Bare Minerals never disappoints and is wonderful for my acne prone skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Was a birthday gift to my sister she is very happy thank you!</li>
    <li> I received my order a day early! This is the only product I don&#x27;t break out with. It conceals and is lightweight. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have oily/acne/sensitive skin and this is the only product line that works for me.</li>
    <li> I do not think this is authentic. Pretty disappointed. Very light and orange in color compared to my other medium colored foundation bought from the department store. Sifter top does not close.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this item in the store AND online, and online is the way to go. Got my purchase in a timely manner and packed very well. It&#x27;s definitely the same color as I bought in the store. I&#x27;ll definitely order again when I&#x27;m out!</li>
    <li> great product, best quality, looks natural</li>
    <li> be warned not the same product you would buy in stores. Ulta sells something different. Contacted BM and they stated it is not their original product.</li>
    <li> This is my third or fourth container of bare minerals, I&#x27;ll never buy another foundation! It&#x27;s so light and makes your face look flawless and natural.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product all the time and she loves it.  She was surprised at the size and thought the price was wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is my brand for years.  My dermatologist told me if I use mineral that use this brand.  I buy through amazon for tax and delivery free that makes it better buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used BareMinerals for years now and stopped for a while to try other products. After several months of greasy and oily skin I had to go back to this one. It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> love bare minerals!!!!! :)</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Be foundation for years this is not genuine Bare Mineral foundation.I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> The top that is supposed to twist to close off the powder was broken and will not close. Otherwise, the product was fine and probably this mechanicly error was probably more a factory fault than through this particular seller.</li>
    <li> I love using bare minerals, and I love getting it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love it perfect for putting on while driving to work so much easier then liquid foundation and it actually covers up the redness on my cheeks</li>
    <li> the product is good, but so hard to apply. not in an efficient container at all</li>
