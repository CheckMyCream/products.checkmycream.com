<li> The green one is a little off maybe but other than that I&#x27;m really enjoying matching these with different hairbands.</li>
<li> One separated in the back with the first use (the fastener clip fell off) and the other has lost the little jewel piece in the middle without any use.  </li>
<li> The only thing is that I had to cut off the excess fabric since it was coming loose</li>
<li> so my husband used the black flower to pin my dress</li>
<li> so she has to wear a waffle headband everyday.  </li>
<li> and there were a few stray pieces here and there.</li>
<li> A little bit small.</li>
<li> they are alittle on the small side</li>
<li> I&#x27;m normally not as pleased as I expect to be with these types of purchases</li>
<li> Poorly put together.</li>
<li> I clip them at the base of my pony tail.  </li>

    <li> Great value when you consider you could get similiar on Etsy for $3-$5 EACH.  Good qualtiy and love the variety.</li>
    <li> Yep, this dad buys baby bows, too. These are inexpensive and look great. They make my little girl look cute as a button.</li>
    <li> I really like the colors. The green one is a little off maybe but other than that I&#x27;m really enjoying matching these with different hairbands.</li>
    <li> These hair clips come in so many colors that they match almost everything and they are good quality. I would recommend these.</li>
    <li> these are sooo cute and really stylish! I love to wear them with updos and the box it came with was excellent for safe keeping!  they are alittle on the small side i wish they had them in 3in but I love them!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product.  The box is even high quality so I can keep all my hair flowers nice and safe and in good shape.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m normally not as pleased as I expect to be with these types of purchases but these are an exception to that rule. These flower clips are extremely pretty, very well made &amp; packaged with class (really nice touch). I bought these to take with me to a destination wedding in California and they were very well received by &amp;#34;the gals&amp;#34; in the wedding party. This would make a great gift for anyone who enjoys wearing pretty things in their hair (or for the bridal party).</li>
    <li> Poorly put together. Hot glue bits and strings still stuck to most of them. Some pieces came apart before they arrived, and had to be re-glued.</li>
    <li> not only is it pretty but very durable. I didn&#x27;t have a bustle on my wedding dress so my husband used the black flower to pin my dress so I wouldn&#x27;t trip on it. It lasted the whole night and still is in great condition. My bridesmaid and I looked fantastic with these pretty little flowers in our hair.</li>
    <li> Super cute way to pin up my hair. I&#x27;m 28 years old and I love being a flower child. :) The color options are fantastic.</li>
    <li> These little hair flowers are just the perfect size - not so big that they look silly, and not so small that they look like they&#x27;d be for a baby.  I like them a lot.  A bonus is that the part of the hair clip that shows is also covered in a matching shade.  Nice little flowers.</li>
    <li> I think these flower barrettes are perfect for a toddler.  My daughter is 3 and has fine hair and the barrette stays in her hair.  I tried it on my hair too, fine but thicker and it worked.  There is a color to match every outfit.  The size of the flower is the perfect size. The quality is very good and worth every penny. We will order another set in case we lose a color here and there as my daughter likes to play with them.</li>
    <li> Beautiful flowers with each having a strong clip. Will be great for my Spring/Summer wardrobe to accessorized with ! Good for both long and short hair !</li>
    <li> Love these flowers, the sparkly center is gorgeous! Nice quality, beautiful colors that match nearly everything in my daughters wardrobe! Quick shipment!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved these, very cute, but 2 have already fallen apart.  One separated in the back with the first use (the fastener clip fell off) and the other has lost the little jewel piece in the middle without any use.  So sad because they are so cute.</li>
    <li> Cute flowers for my kids.  A little bit small. I have girls ranging from 12-5 and everyone finds a way to use these flowers!</li>
    <li> My daughter has very curly hair that has new growth in the front so she has to wear a waffle headband everyday.  So, I bought these for her headband.  For the price they are great.</li>
    <li> These seem well made and love the colors.  I order another set so i could have two flowers of the same color.  I clip them at the base of my pony tail.  Feels like hawaiiH</li>
    <li> I think they are the cutest clips ever! The only thing is that I had to cut off the excess fabric since it was coming loose and there were a few stray pieces here and there. I bought them for my dog actually and she hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of complaints so far. I clip them onto her collar and I haven&#x27;t seen any scratching. It&#x27;s as if they aren&#x27;t even there. Good for the prices as well.</li>
    <li> Very professionally packed and nice presentation.&lt;br /&gt;Seem quite durable and look really nice. Also good variety of colors, like seen in the photo.</li>
    <li> I absolutley love these flower clips, they are so pretty, they are small and dainty and they will look good in your hair, on your clothes and on your shoes or sandals.  They are presented nice in a little box and the colors are a good variety.  So glad I made this purchase!</li>
    <li> These came promptly.  The bows were just the right size for a 2 year and her 4 year old sister.</li>
    <li> The product came well packed and in a timely manner.  Just like in the picture.  The flowers are glued to the pins in a professional manner.  No glue is visible. Great buy!</li>
    <li> These are so cute!  They are a perfect size -- not too big and not too small -- and they look so cute!  I hope there are even more colors I can buy!</li>
    <li> Love these small flowers! They look so cute with my pinup dresses. I wear them with another LARGE flower in my hair. They hold really well and do not move much at all.</li>
