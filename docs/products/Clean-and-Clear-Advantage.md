### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This serum is absolutely perfect.</li>
      <li>Great product for oil skin!!</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Best</li>
      <li>Skin is getting so perfectly balanced now.</li>
      <li>she recommends in her Best Choice area.</li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT!</li>
      <li>- this works perfectly and isn&#x27;t drying.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a great alternative BHA to Paula&#x27;s Choice which is $19.</li>
      <li>the cream cleanser is also great...</li>
      <li>Great.</li>
      <li>Very nice alternative to Paula&#x27;s Choice exfoliants.</li>
      <li>It has a wonderful mattifying effect, I no longer need to use acne masks at night, and my skin has cleared up significantly.</li>
      <li>Best product ever for keeping my pores clean.</li>
      <li>LOVE!</li>
      <li>This product is really great if you&#x27;ve got oily skin, as it will leave you with a lightly matte finish when used under a moisturizer and makeup (if you like).</li>
      <li>It smells good, too, but not too strong.</li>
      <li>It is also an effective BHA--I can tell because the clogged pores are mostly rising to the surface and can now be extracted.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>and SO CHEAP!</li>
      <li>love this stuff, great for absorbing oil</li>
      <li>but I have found and love the Thayers Witch Hazel alcohol free Rose or Lavender toners.  </li>
      <li>but it certainly is better than it was.</li>
      <li>Also make sure there is Nooo alcohol in your toner.</li>
      <li>Most people can&#x27;t see or feel any difference.</li>
      <li>I will always keep this product in my cabinet because I love it.</li>
      <li>This is the best product I found using S.A., but if occasionally needing the more potent B.P. you can then just use intermittently a product with B.P. B.P. is also harsher &amp; more drying.</li>
      <li>I just went from a $45 product to something for $7, which I haven&#x27;t been able to do for about 7 years.</li>
      <li>I ended up looking at the Paula&#x27;s Choice list of \\&quot;Best BHA Exfoliants\\&quot; (2), which is how I found out about the Clean and Clear product.  </li>
      <li>So far, great results in six days of use</li>
      <li>Absorbing Treatment is a good product.</li>
      <li>Paula doesn&#x27;t really have any good inexpensive recommendations since she is a bit indifferent to toners</li>
      <li>combined, you&#x27;ll see a HUGE difference in your sebum/oil production.</li>
      <li>skin really smooth.</li>
      <li>As far as I can tell, my complexion is just as good as it was when I used to the Neutrogena product</li>
      <li>It is a great matte cream that I will likely continue to purchase (I am a skin care junkie and rarely purchase anything twice).</li>
      <li>(hooray) Clean &amp; Clear&#x27;s Oil Absorbing Treatment works remarkably well for me, despite being comparably cheap.</li>
      <li>Read a highly regarded review which gave this product a best in class award, well to me, this is nothing special and I can&#x27;t find a single reason as to why anyone would think so.  </li>
      <li>Received this exactly as expected and experienced an effortless transaction.</li>
      <li>This is the only over the counter product that works good for my wife.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I remembered her product review page because this really saved me and I didn&#x27;t have to break the bank to do it.</li>
      <li>It does have fragrance, but it&#x27;s not a bad scent and doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I don&#x27;t think there is such a thing as a cure for my probably hormonal acne, this product has helped me manage it pretty successfully.</li>
      <li>After the first night I had already seen a huge improvement...</li>
      <li>I like the Clean and Clear stuff better.  </li>
      <li>In the winter I need more moisture but one of the new moisturizers I tried broke me out.</li>
      <li>I use it only at night and put a really good moisturizer on first</li>
      <li>color tone was calm and even zit drying up and disappearing,</li>
      <li>Most acne products are weirdly too drying for me, even though I have incredibly oily skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For men with OILY SKIN, this product will keep you looking fresh without the worry of looking like a walking oil spill...</li>
      <li>I must add that while 2% salicylic acid liquid preparations (toners) are easy to find, I don&#x27;t use them because the high alcohol content dries and irritates my skin.  </li>
      <li>It works exfoliating the skin and the price is right.</li>
      <li>I would say that the severity and frequency of my breakouts has diminished by more than half since I added this product to my skin regimen more than a year ago.</li>
      <li>Was very effective at getting rid of my acne spots, worked in just a few days!</li>
      <li>I was using clindamycin and other oil free, well-rated products, but started to notice many stubborn, under the surface clogged pores.</li>
      <li>Most \\&quot;matifyers\\&quot; are $10-$30 for a tiny amount.</li>
      <li>Salicylic Acid is not as potent against acne as Benzoyl Peroxide but the later will bleach clothing (towels, shirts, sheets, etc).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a funny scent that reminds me of a sort of sweet-mint toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I tried this Salicylic Acid treatment from Clean and Clear.</li>
      <li>Then I found \\&quot;clean and clear advantage</li>
      <li>Clean&amp; Clear Advantage</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve been using the Clean and Clear for a couple of months now).  </li>
      <li>Thanks clean and clear!</li>
      <li>since the summer of 2011 with fantastic results, but this past fall it somehow went out of stock EVERYWHERE (except for eBay, where people were selling it for $18 or more per tube).  </li>
      <li>Since it is discontinued,  don&#x27;t think this will matter too much now.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>oil absorbing oil treatment\\&quot; and i couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
      <li>No irritating.</li>
      <li>Now its just on the nose and not the chin and forehead as much.</li>
      <li>controls breakouts and highly recommended by paula begon !</li>
      <li>when what he really needed was to stop the oiliness</li>
      <li>(her skin care advice really helped me in my youth)</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if it really did absorb oil on my face, but it does have  2% salicylic acid.  </li>
      <li>It was very affordable, too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a 2% salicylic acid chemical exfoliator, and is extremely gentle on the skin.</li>
      <li>I have very oily, acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>(I cannot figure out what triggers this, and it doesn&#x27;t happen every time, but it might have to do with not letting it dry long enough before moisturizing with CeraVe), and the fragrance is even stronger and more offensive than in the Neutrogena product, but overall it&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
      <li>I contacted Neutrogena, and they said that they are NOT discontinuing the treatment, but they wouldn&#x27;t say why there is a shortage, or how long it would take for the product to become available again.  </li>
      <li>believe Clean &amp; Clear and Neutragena are the only ubiquitous skin-care brands that sell affordable BHA exfoliators, and</li>
      <li>My skin is extra super sensitive, which I know is something every person on the planet loves to say.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not entirely off-putting, and the scent dissipates quickly after applying, but it&#x27;s definitely an unexpected smell in the context of a skincare product.</li>
      <li>I also switched my moisturizer to her recommendation of Neutrogena Extra Gentle Facial Cleanser Lotion Fragrance Free in the morning and the extra gentle foaming one at night because it takes my makeup off well.</li>
      <li>However, my skin is also very sensitive</li>
      <li>The fewer skin irritants you use over the years, the more likely you are to look younger because you are likely to retain collagen.</li>
      <li>I have only ever used one product that might be better for oil, but its more expensive and contains no salcylic acid.</li>
      <li>If too drying, find a moisturizer that will not clog pores, &amp; use that (though not excessively) before applying the acne fighting product.</li>
      <li>SA is great for mature skin apparently and not as irritating as Glycol which had really turned me red and sensitive.</li>
      <li>Hope this helps you on your journey to clear glowing skin.</li>
      <li>This is/was the cheapest product rated &amp;#34;BEST&amp;#34; on Beautypedia&#x27;s list of BHA exfoliators, and it&#x27;s really clear why it got the rating.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an adult in my 30s who has tried every acne treatment under the sun.</li>
      <li>and so I tried this product and it doesn&#x27;t completely remove the shine all day</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, like me, you will need to use a moisturizer during season changes.</li>
      <li>So far like this product and works well</li>
      <li>Collagen is what keeps you looking young.</li>
      <li>It was the same exact cream clinque was selling but clean and clear was much, much cheaper, but very hard to find in stores</li>
      <li>However, if you can use products with citrus, mint, lavender, and so on, then your skin is not all that sensitive, as ALL of those items are actually skin irritants.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find this in stores any longer, but it is the only thing that controls my adult acne.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my sebum under control throughout the day (I apply it first thing in the morning), and it seems to help my makeup stay put (probably because my skin is less oily throughout the day).</li>
      <li>It controls oil  well under my tinted moisturizer--I have need to blot MUCH less even though it has been a hot and humid week here.</li>
      <li>I have moderate acne that is barely kept in check with Retin-A, even after three rounds of Accutane.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find this stuff in stores, but it is the only thing that works for my 39 year old, dry in winter/</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product for oil skin!!</li>
    <li> Smells a little and it has the consistency of Elmer&#x27;s School glue and will need some time to get used to it.  Don&#x27;t know if it really did absorb oil on my face, but it does have  2% salicylic acid.  Since it is discontinued,  don&#x27;t think this will matter too much now.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this stuff in stores, but it is the only thing that works for my 39 year old, dry in winter/oily in summer, prone to breakout skin.  As long as I use it, only the occasional hormone related pimple gets by me.  I buy it by the case in hopes they won&#x27;t discontinue it!</li>
    <li> Was very effective at getting rid of my acne spots, worked in just a few days!</li>
    <li> Very nice alternative to Paula&#x27;s Choice exfoliants. Works. No irritating. Used it after Thayer&#x27;s toner, followed by spf 30 moisturizer in winter. In summer will use it with serum. Didn&#x27;t make my skin oily.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband who is still using acne cream at his age (way past adolescence!) when what he really needed was to stop the oiliness - this works perfectly and isn&#x27;t drying.</li>
    <li> Clean&amp; Clear Advantage Oil- Absorbing Treatment is a good product. This is the only over the counter product that works good for my wife. She use&#x27;s it every day. We can not find it in the stores any more,so, we will continue to order it on-line.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to any one.</li>
    <li> MATIFYING is NOT CHEAP! Most \\&quot;matifyers\\&quot; are $10-$30 for a tiny amount. THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT! and SO CHEAP! For men with OILY SKIN, this product will keep you looking fresh without the worry of looking like a walking oil spill...truly I KNOW! Fragrance is very generic and NOT feminine and a LITTLE goes a LONG way...the cream cleanser is also great...combined, you&#x27;ll see a HUGE difference in your sebum/oil production.</li>
    <li> Best product ever for keeping my pores clean. Doesn&#x27;t overdry. I will always keep this product in my cabinet because I love it.</li>
    <li> People use to call me \\&quot;hey shinny\\&quot; or \\&quot;I can see you comming a mile away\\&quot;. For years I struggled with excessive facial oil especially in the forehead area, it was embarrassing and it made me feel self conscious all the time. I use to buy very expensive men clinque products but the company stop selling it in the mens line and only selling in the womens line (same cream) only to charge twice as much. Then I found \\&quot;clean and clear advantage oil absorbing oil treatment\\&quot; and i couldn&#x27;t believe it. It was the same exact cream clinque was selling but clean and clear was much, much cheaper, but very hard to find in stores, I don&#x27;t know if the company stop selling the product in stores or what but I was ecstatic when I found out you can get it through Amazon!. Furthermore; I bought four bottles it, that should last me aleast a couple of years, the cream goes a long way and when applied, and it last all day,  no more shinny forhead. So take it from me, order this product, you will not regret it. Thanks clean and clear!</li>
    <li> So far like this product and works well</li>
    <li> Great. The oil absorption properties keep you face from shining as well as keeps the oil away from contributing further to acne. Salicylic Acid is not as potent against acne as Benzoyl Peroxide but the later will bleach clothing (towels, shirts, sheets, etc). This is the best product I found using S.A., but if occasionally needing the more potent B.P. you can then just use intermittently a product with B.P. B.P. is also harsher &amp; more drying. If too drying, find a moisturizer that will not clog pores, &amp; use that (though not excessively) before applying the acne fighting product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in stores any longer, but it is the only thing that controls my adult acne.  It controls oil and clears blemishes.  If you have sensitive skin, like me, you will need to use a moisturizer during season changes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a godsend. I am 28 and all of a sudden started getting small acne all over my forehead and lower cheek and mouth area. I tried and tried to get rid of it. Finally turning to Paula&#x27;s Choice product reviews online (her skin care advice really helped me in my youth) I tried this Salicylic Acid treatment from Clean and Clear. SA is great for mature skin apparently and not as irritating as Glycol which had really turned me red and sensitive. After the first night I had already seen a huge improvement...color tone was calm and even zit drying up and disappearing, skin really smooth. I&#x27;m so glad I remembered her product review page because this really saved me and I didn&#x27;t have to break the bank to do it. I&#x27;m going to switch my other products over to ones  she recommends in her Best Choice area. Remember that Salicylic like any exfoliation treatment can be a touch drying. I use it only at night and put a really good moisturizer on first then I spot treat or do thin layer across forehead, nose, cheeks. I also switched my moisturizer to her recommendation of Neutrogena Extra Gentle Facial Cleanser Lotion Fragrance Free in the morning and the extra gentle foaming one at night because it takes my makeup off well. Skin is getting so perfectly balanced now. Also make sure there is Nooo alcohol in your toner. That is one of the worst things you can do to your skin it dries skin out without exfoliation or any benefits and can actually cause the skin to breakout more. Toning with a cotton ball should be about wiping away dead skin cells and adding nourishment. Paula doesn&#x27;t really have any good inexpensive recommendations since she is a bit indifferent to toners but I have found and love the Thayers Witch Hazel alcohol free Rose or Lavender toners.  Hope this helps you on your journey to clear glowing skin.</li>
    <li> love this stuff, great for absorbing oil</li>
    <li> Received this exactly as expected and experienced an effortless transaction. This product makes my skin glow! It was very affordable, too. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have moderate acne that is barely kept in check with Retin-A, even after three rounds of Accutane. However, my skin is also very sensitive so I have trouble finding products that won&#x27;t irritate. This serum is absolutely perfect. I apply it in the morning as a primer for my makeup and in the evening as well. It has a wonderful mattifying effect, I no longer need to use acne masks at night, and my skin has cleared up significantly.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and so I tried this product and it doesn&#x27;t completely remove the shine all day but it certainly is better than it was. I used to be oily on the forehead and chin and nose. Now its just on the nose and not the chin and forehead as much. I have noticed clearer skin, but not completely clear. Overall I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My skin is extra super sensitive, which I know is something every person on the planet loves to say. However, if you can use products with citrus, mint, lavender, and so on, then your skin is not all that sensitive, as ALL of those items are actually skin irritants. So, when I say my skin is sensitive, I mean that I cannot use any product with any irritant, and even the lightest fragrances can sometimes cause me big problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine my surprise when I looked at the ingredients for this product (and a couple other products that go with it) and realized I could actually use this product. I just went from a $45 product to something for $7, which I haven&#x27;t been able to do for about 7 years. I wish I had found this product as soon as it came onto the market. I&#x27;ve been missing out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY THIS MATTERS TO YOU: You may not feel any discernible difference when you use products that contain skin irritants. Most people can&#x27;t see or feel any difference. However, skin irritants can break down the collagen in your skin -- not right away but over the years. Collagen is what keeps you looking young. The fewer skin irritants you use over the years, the more likely you are to look younger because you are likely to retain collagen.</li>
    <li> I have very oily, acne prone skin. I was using clindamycin and other oil free, well-rated products, but started to notice many stubborn, under the surface clogged pores. I could not extract the clogs and finally decided to try this after reading a &amp;#34;best product&amp;#34; beautypedia review. It is a great matte cream that I will likely continue to purchase (I am a skin care junkie and rarely purchase anything twice). It controls oil  well under my tinted moisturizer--I have need to blot MUCH less even though it has been a hot and humid week here. I have only ever used one product that might be better for oil, but its more expensive and contains no salcylic acid. It is also an effective BHA--I can tell because the clogged pores are mostly rising to the surface and can now be extracted. It does have fragrance, but it&#x27;s not a bad scent and doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin. So far, great results in six days of use</li>
    <li> The only thing that has worked for my oily skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year as part of my daily skin care routine and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;m an adult in my 30s who has tried every acne treatment under the sun. Most acne products are weirdly too drying for me, even though I have incredibly oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe Clean &amp; Clear and Neutragena are the only ubiquitous skin-care brands that sell affordable BHA exfoliators, and (hooray) Clean &amp; Clear&#x27;s Oil Absorbing Treatment works remarkably well for me, despite being comparably cheap. It keeps my sebum under control throughout the day (I apply it first thing in the morning), and it seems to help my makeup stay put (probably because my skin is less oily throughout the day). I use a BHA moisturizer at night and have not had issues with excessive drying. I&#x27;ve also been known to apply this product more than once a day when my skin is being particularly difficult, usually in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t think there is such a thing as a cure for my probably hormonal acne, this product has helped me manage it pretty successfully. I would say that the severity and frequency of my breakouts has diminished by more than half since I added this product to my skin regimen more than a year ago.</li>
    <li> controls breakouts and highly recommended by paula begon !</li>
    <li> Read a highly regarded review which gave this product a best in class award, well to me, this is nothing special and I can&#x27;t find a single reason as to why anyone would think so.  My skin is just as oily after I apply this as it was before.</li>
    <li> So I just turned 35 and am freaking out about my skin. I have combo, acne-prone skin. In the winter I need more moisture but one of the new moisturizers I tried broke me out. So I found this on beautypedia.com and it&#x27;s a great alternative BHA to Paula&#x27;s Choice which is $19. This stuff is around $6 and it works. I started out using it only in the morning but after I cleared up I added nights to the routine. It tones down the redness and improves my overall tone. It smells good, too, but not too strong. LOVE!</li>
    <li> I had been using Neutrogena Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment (1) since the summer of 2011 with fantastic results, but this past fall it somehow went out of stock EVERYWHERE (except for eBay, where people were selling it for $18 or more per tube).  I contacted Neutrogena, and they said that they are NOT discontinuing the treatment, but they wouldn&#x27;t say why there is a shortage, or how long it would take for the product to become available again.  So, I dried my tears and set out looking for a substitute 2% salicylic acid treatment.  I ended up looking at the Paula&#x27;s Choice list of \\&quot;Best BHA Exfoliants\\&quot; (2), which is how I found out about the Clean and Clear product.  I also tried a sample of Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA gel, but it felt sticky and heavy immediately after application, took several minutes to absorb, and left my face with a subtle shine (which I didn&#x27;t like).  I like the Clean and Clear stuff better.  It feels heavier than the Neutrogena product, and occasionally it flakes off (I cannot figure out what triggers this, and it doesn&#x27;t happen every time, but it might have to do with not letting it dry long enough before moisturizing with CeraVe), and the fragrance is even stronger and more offensive than in the Neutrogena product, but overall it&#x27;s a good product.  As far as I can tell, my complexion is just as good as it was when I used to the Neutrogena product (I&#x27;ve been using the Clean and Clear for a couple of months now).  I don&#x27;t know how much oil-absorbing it does, but at least it doesn&#x27;t make my skin tight and shiny when it dries.    I must add that while 2% salicylic acid liquid preparations (toners) are easy to find, I don&#x27;t use them because the high alcohol content dries and irritates my skin.  I will only use a gel or cream vehicle.    1. My review of the Neutrogena product: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CRDGWA81Y9ZJ/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_cmt?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B0013ER62M&amp;linkCode&#x3D;&amp;nodeID&#x3D;&amp;tag&#x3D;#wasThisHelpful    2.  \\&quot;Best BHA Exfoliants\\&quot;:(...)paulaschoice.com/beautypedia-skin-care-reviews/best-skin-care-products/Skin-Care/BHA-Exfoliants?sort&#x3D;none&amp;direction&#x3D;asc&amp;pageNumber&#x3D;1&amp;pageSize&#x3D;25&amp;rating&#x3D;3</li>
    <li> Can I tell you how incredibly disappointed I was when I found out this product was discontinued? SAD! Buy this stuff up while you still can.  This is/was the cheapest product rated &amp;#34;BEST&amp;#34; on Beautypedia&#x27;s list of BHA exfoliators, and it&#x27;s really clear why it got the rating. It&#x27;s a 2% salicylic acid chemical exfoliator, and is extremely gentle on the skin. This product is really great if you&#x27;ve got oily skin, as it will leave you with a lightly matte finish when used under a moisturizer and makeup (if you like). I use it morning and night as part of my skincare routine, although it can also be used as a spot treatment.  I would say that the only downside, other than the fact that it&#x27;s been discontinued, is the smell. It&#x27;s got a funny scent that reminds me of a sort of sweet-mint toothpaste. It&#x27;s not entirely off-putting, and the scent dissipates quickly after applying, but it&#x27;s definitely an unexpected smell in the context of a skincare product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It works exfoliating the skin and the price is right. Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive brands that don&#x27;t work as well.  My only disappointment is that it was listed as &amp;#34;brand new&amp;#34; and the expiration date on both boxes is the same month and year I purchased them.</li>
