    <li> Product was much more affordable here than at my local store.  I can tell the thinning of my hair has slowed down or stopped.  I&#x27;m not fond of the smell.  It&#x27;s not bad just a little different and my nose is very sensitive that&#x27;s the only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  But I got what I ordered and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I thoroughly enjoy this product.</li>

    <li> Have been using these combo for years at the recommendation of my hairdresser.  System 2 is for thinning hair.  My hair is still thinning out and am hoping for the day that it will thicken.  Don&#x27;t think it will happen but I will continue to use it dispute the rising cost.  Perhaps I may find something better in the future.</li>
