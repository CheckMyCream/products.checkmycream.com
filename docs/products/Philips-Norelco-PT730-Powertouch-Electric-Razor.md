<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> From here this looks like a great little work of art.  I&#x27;m surprised.  We&#x27;ll see if it continues to perform so well.</li>
    <li> This shaver cuts very good. The bad thing about it is, when you want to clean it. The head opens up and the blades fall out. So now it&#x27;s clean, but putting it back together is the problem. It took me 30 minutes to get it together. Definitely not worth the it.</li>
    <li> The razor works very good.</li>
    <li> Quick, close convenient shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son. His first razor.  But it came in a brown cardboard box, no picture, no nice presentation. I will not give this to him as a gift.  I will have to buy another one someplace else.  I had to open the box to find out what this was.  VERY disappointed!!  Not returning it only because its a pain.</li>
    <li> Just started using this shaver.  Much quieter then my old one, easy to clean, good battery life, and the shaver does a great job.  I would recommend this shaver for every day use for the average face growth.</li>
    <li> We are so impressed with this shaver. It&#x27;s quiet, does a great job and holds its charge for a LONG time!</li>
    <li> the trimmer is a little weak. I shave once a week and now I&#x27;ll need to get another machine to use for the first pass</li>
    <li> Good shaver. reasonable price. Very satisfied  My old one didn&#x27;t hold a charge very long.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband and he says it works great. He&#x27;s impressed with the fact that he can use it dry or wet. It&#x27;s light weight and not nearly as loud as his previous one.</li>
    <li> It works reasonably well, even on thick facial hair. The shave is not nearly as close as a razor, but its pretty smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works wet, dry and with lotion. Cleanup is pretty straightforward.</li>
    <li> Seems ok, holds a charge well and I like the pop up trimmer.  But like all electric razors I have used, there seems to be some hairs that just don&#x27;t want to be cut, especially on my neck.  I have to go over the same area many many times to even shave 95% of them, then have to run a razor over to get those pesky hairs... Maybe it is an individual results may vary kinda thing.</li>
    <li> great shave and batteryllife</li>
    <li> GARY LIKES THE SHAVER. WOW WHAT A SHAVE</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver, good close shaves.</li>
    <li> Item not as described in the pictures. It does not have a &amp;#34;pivot&amp;#34; for the pivot and float system. Also, the item inside the package was covered in a layer of dust when I opened it. I&#x27;m not satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought for husband. Works extremely well for price paid.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. It replaces my previous Norelco shaver of 10 years.  My only problem is with the vendor.  The listing talks about a free charging stand, but none is included.  The add is deceptive and therefore I would recommend getting your shaver from another source.</li>
    <li> This razor is not as powerful as I thought it would be. It is easy to clean. Charges well.</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t give a paticularly close shave.</li>
    <li> The Norelco shaver and trimmer works just fine thank you.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of good reviews ,but I had a bad experience with this shaver. The motor is so weak and slow it pulls and tugs at my face hair. In fact I had a cheap copy I picked up for $5 at Harbor Freight that shaved better. I have fine hairs on my face and under my lip on my chin. I spent an hour going over the same spot and still had stuble left .So don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of junk. Next I might try a foil shaver or go back to a blade. all this razor did was irritate my wallet and skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely excellent ! You won&#x27;t find a better shaver for the money. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. He said he likes it as well as his previous razor which he accidentaly fried in Italy.</li>
    <li> the package is a little bit cheap.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! I&#x27;ve only had mine a couple of months, but my brother is going on year 2 with no problems. This came with a two year warranty and I bought an extended 2 year through Amazon. I shouldn&#x27;t have to worry for 4 years. The motor seems slow compared to my last electric but I&#x27;m not overly hairy so....Anyway, I would recommend this unless your heavily bearded.</li>
    <li> My husband was against using an electric shaver -  but he luvs his Norelco.  Never going back to ujsing razor blades.</li>
    <li> This item came in an unsealed package, Dirty and dusty.  Is not a new item.</li>
    <li> Well packaged, and hubby is enjoying using it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Norelco for my husband and have been very happy with the results. I especially like the way the smooth shave is achieved without any nicks, scrapes, or discomfort. This is a great shaver for elderly people with delicate skin who none the less have tough beards every day and I would highly recommend it for people in retirement homes or anyone who wants an easy way to shave daily. The fact that it can be used with shaving cream or foam was a real plus because you don&#x27;t have to worry about dry hair particles going everywhere. The cleanup of the device is so easy that it takes around 10 seconds. Cordless handling is great and it holds a charge very well.  I actually forgot to charge it at all one day and it performed as if it had a full charge. The three rotating heads are compact enough to get into the most difficult areas and the pop up trimmer can be easily used to trim sideburns without having to resort to another tool. Quick, easy, safe, efficient, and comfortable, I could not be happier with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in the fact that it wasn&#x27;t in retail packaging as it was a gift.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor for my 91-year old father.  He finds it much more difficult to clean than his old razor.  However, does give a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> Quick and close shave.</li>
    <li> Got tired of the lather and disposable razors.  Ordered this one.  Works great, will never go back.</li>
    <li> Very nice Shaver. Good price, And it holds it&#x27;s charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes it. He alway used cream and razor.</li>
    <li> Bought this same razor maybe 6 years ago. Absolutely great shave while being very gentle. Works off battery or AC power.</li>
    <li> Very nice product for the price.</li>
    <li> better than my old one</li>
    <li> Not quite the quality I wanted</li>
    <li> good except the horrible noise of trimming cut using</li>
    <li> The shaver is very good and safe</li>
    <li> Update: 6/22/15 - I&#x27;ve downgraded this review. I&#x27;ve grown to hate this razor because how long it takes to shave. Same reason stated previously.. You have to go over the same spot way too many times. It just misses too much.  Not really that impressed with this razor. I&#x27;ve had Norelcos for decades, never tried anything else. I will say I never shave everyday; once or twice a week generally. I bought this razor primarily because the price was decent. If a more expensive one did a noticeably better job I would have rather spent more money. My biggest complaint is how many times you have to go over the same spot to get a clean shave. It also isn&#x27;t that great on longer hair. If it&#x27;s been 3 - 5 days I usually shorten my beard with the trimmer first before attempting to shave. I&#x27;ll live with it now because I&#x27;m too cheap to replace it but I just wish it worked a little better.</li>
    <li> Holds a charge very well (like really well!) The battery lasts somewhat like 40 minutes on single full charge. I use it maybe thrice every week and have to charge the thing only once every month. Charges overnight so that is not any issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note this device is only for dry shaving (trimming)... NOT to be used with shaving cream or lather or on wet skin. Also after using, you have to wait for like 10 minutes before washing your skin to prevent skin irritation. During the first few times, you&#x27;ll still have some minor irritation if you&#x27;ve never used electric shavers before. But that is normal, not a big thing at all. It gets better with time and you&#x27;ll start to feel how easy it is to use this shaver, or any Norelco shavers for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Light indicator that tells you if the battery is low; indicates its last 5 minutes of charge.&lt;br /&gt;  Lightweight, can be rinsed with warm water and most of the stubble on the blade goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: None that I can think of. Maybe the trimmer on the back could be wider than it is?</li>
    <li> Good all around shaver.</li>
    <li> The motor seems much slower and weaker than my previous Norelco. The feature I really like, it can be rinsed with hot water after shaving. I also noticed it is made in China and the old ones were from the Netherlands, I believe. But it seems to get the job done so we will have to see how it lasts.</li>
    <li> Great razor at a fair price</li>
    <li> Great shaver - works well - close, clean shave and it holds the charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product, I had a newer version but I Like this one better.</li>
    <li> The service from UPS was horrible but this razor itself is perfect and definitely worth the price.  I highly recommend it, very smooth and easy to use and gets rid of all the hairs very quickly.  From this point going forward I will only shave with a Philips Norelco Shaver, I have already convinced my brother to get one as well.</li>
    <li> not enough difference from their cheapest unfortunately</li>
    <li> Shipping is great. I received it after almost a week. The prodoct is OK but lacks some function of sideburns more clearly trimming.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this item.  I bought it to replace my old shaver after it wore out.  It shaves quickly and cleanly, and the battery lasts a long time.  It cleans up easily, and the price was god.</li>
    <li> My first electric shaver, and I must say, not going back to razors anytime soon. It leaves the skin feeling very nice, and not burning like a razor does. When you first switch from razor to this electric shaver, your facial hair growth is different due to the razor shaving directions. Once you start using the electric one, it takes a few weeks for your facial hair to grow differently, which is more favorable for the electric shaver. It may sound confusing your first time reading this, but once you use one of these, you will know. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good but not as good as my old foil shaver. Super quiet though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for almost a year now and it is holding up well.  Before this one I had another Norelco that lasted several years.  This unit still holds a charge for over a month per charge.  The shave is close enough form me for not being a razor.  It is easy to clean.  When I take this to travel the clippings do come out of the shaver and gets my bath tote dirty.  The shaver is easy to clean although just a rinse will not get all of the clippings out.  The best way to clean this is to brush and rinse.</li>
    <li> I use it to shave my half my head.  It is almost as close a shave as mother nature did to the other half.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Norelco electric shaver for over 25 years. It finally bit the dust while I was soldering some new NiCd batteries in to it. (acccidentally shorted something). So figured, time for a new one. So I gave this new one a shot. I LOVE this thing! I&#x27;ve read reviews here where people thought it felt cheap or something. It&#x27;s light because of the new Lithium Ion battery type. My old Noreleco was 3x as heavy because of the NiCa batteries, and a heavier frame. This shaver is light, and works like a charm. I charged it up when I first got it, about 3 weeks ago, and it&#x27;s still crankin&#x27; away. Very quiet, smooth, and light. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars out of 5! Love it!</li>
    <li> Works great ! I haven&#x27;t used a electric shaver in about 50yrs I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the old &#x27;Sunbeam&#x27; this &amp;#34;Norelco&amp;#34; is just right, My &#x27;Girl friend&#x27;loves how smooth it makes my face !  By the way I just turned &#x27;80&#x27;  &#x27;Dave&#x27;</li>
    <li> Seems a little underpowered, but it does the job for me.</li>
    <li> not much improvement over old one</li>
    <li> Satisfied, feel good。</li>
    <li> there is no package for this item. it looks really bad. I plan to return it.</li>
    <li> As advertised, is best for lighter beard which is me.  Very quiet, able to use it wet, rinse it to clean.  I&#x27;m glad to be back with Norelco.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than buying a new battery and blades for my old model. Shaves closer than my old Norelco.</li>
    <li> NOT AS GOOD AS EXPECTED FROM PREVIOUS UNITS OF NORELCO.</li>
    <li> The product itself is fine in the little time I&#x27;ve used it. However, Amazon sent me a refurbished razor instead of a new one.</li>
    <li> It was a gift to replace an older model.  Recipient LOVES it!</li>
    <li> Works good, no problems with this razor.</li>
    <li> Same quality as my old Norelco.</li>
    <li> This is a really good shaver! It shaves as close as a razor blade. After I wash and dry my face I apply a light bath oil and wet the shaver head and shake it out. This makes the shaver move easily over my face and produces a very close comfortable shave. This is a big improvement over my old Norelco shaver.</li>
    <li> Works fine, shaves me close, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I was surprised the blades didn&#x27;t rotate as quickly as my previous Norelcos. &amp;#34; just an observation&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any complaints, it works well!</li>
    <li> This Norelco is infinitely better than my old noisy shaver.  It is easy to clean and nowhere as noisy,  Giver a reasonably close shave.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I have owned. Exceeded all my expectations. I would recommend to anyone interested in a good electric razor.</li>
    <li> great buy and it gives ma an excellent fast shave</li>
    <li> First time with an electric in 40 years. Good shave and no nicks or cuts, which is always a good thing. Put my razor away.</li>
    <li> did not cut very good .  returned.</li>
    <li> Best shaver for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was unhappy with my Panasonic shaver. I tried it once and threw it away. It is an under powered little piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Shaves very nice. Quiet. Quick Charging and one charge will last me a week shaving once  a day. I will have to wait to see how long the heads last but seem great with no sign of bad design.</li>
    <li> It does not shave as close as I would like.</li>
    <li> So far great.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this lower end Philips Norelco. I bought it for a spare. I also bought my Dad a Comfort Cut for Christmas and he really enjoys it. I have one of those 9000 Philips Series Razors and it shaves terrible!!! You have to go over and over your face and it&#x27;s like you haven&#x27;t even shaved. Why waste your money on something that cost between $250-$350 and it doest even work?, when you can get this for $59 and it gives just a good of shave, no better than the 9000 Series. Also, get some Clubman Pinaud Shave Talc. This stuff is messy, but amazing!!! It helps to get the closest shave that I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a Philips Norelco Electric Razor!</li>
    <li> Gave it to my dad for Christmas to replace one that he had worn out.</li>
    <li> disappointed in order!  shaver was to come with bonus item!  not in box!  that is called false advertising!</li>
    <li> Purchased about a year and a half ago; time to review; I like this razor; great for every day use, but use a blade for Saturday night; I am light complected and have a medium beard; follow the instructions for maximizing results and you will be happy; the recommended frequency of changing the cutting heads (one year) is correct; I tried to squeeze more out of mine and went 6 months over; the improvement once I installed new cutting heads was dramatic. I shave every morning and a full charge will last me over 2 weeks. Didn&#x27;t find the sideburn trimmer to be adequate so use a separate tool, a beard trimmer, for sculpting.</li>
    <li> This is a VERY good razor for the price. This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve bought. I liked the first one so much, I bought another one for my son.</li>
    <li> Great price and love it .</li>
    <li> So far it meets my expectations</li>
    <li> Having owned Norelco shavers for many years, I thought the low price of this replacement for an older model would represent a real bargain. Was I wrong in that decision! After purchasing it in February, 2015, I was immediately disappointed to find that it gave no cleaner a shave than the older model it had just replaced. Two months later, after being fully charged, the motor just quit working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In past Norelco purchases, I have always found them to be quite satisfactory in shaver performance until the shaver heads eventually wear out.  While I do not expect a repeat of the motor failing, the poor shaving performance of a brand new shaver was an unwelcome surprise and a disappointment. I plan to find another model to replace tis one.</li>
    <li> This shaver meets all my expectations. I would recommend it .</li>
    <li> I have shaved with Norelco rotary shavers for over 30 years. I bought this one recently, through Amazon,and I hate it. It tears up my neck every time I use it. It is going into the trash as soon as I get over making such a bad decision. I have gone back to using my 10 year old Model 7825XL. It needs a new battery, but it works with the cord and it shaves great.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! :)  Operates perfectly - just as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leo</li>
    <li> Its working as i expected. Value for money.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price.</li>
    <li> Gift and the kid likes it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really used an electric razor before, but this one leaves patches of stubble on my face, which requires me to shave w/ a razor after having used this shaver. Is this normal?</li>
    <li> Performed as advertised.  Good quality for the price.  Have only had the item for a month, but am very satisfied so far.</li>
    <li> Cuts OK.  Not great.  Seems cheaply made.  I&#x27;ll use it until it breaks.</li>
    <li> Very quiet comparatively.  Cuts all lengths of hairs, whether you think this is a good thing or a bad thing.</li>
    <li> Okay except that the head falls off while cleaning.  It can be replaced, but it obviously isn&#x27;t supposed to come off, and it&#x27;s a little bit of a pain to put back together.  But this is a small complaint.  It works well for an inexpensive product..  And the shave is very good.</li>
    <li> I used this shaver for 2 years. I liked having the ability to clean the heads and screens with tap water. The shave was fine for an electric razor, but not as good as a blade. I had to recharge it every 2-3 days. I deducted two stars because after two years the power cord would not make contact with the internal connections, thus I was unable to recharge the batteries. I&#x27;m not sure if something inside broke or the water corroded some internal part. The shaver will not work with the power cord installed either. Thus it became useless.</li>
    <li> Good shaver for a reasonable price.  I like that I can use this wet or dry and clean it in the sink.  It took a couple days for my skin to get used to it, but after that, it feels fine.  The shave isn&#x27;t super close, but it gets close enough to look good (just don&#x27;t expect a baby butt face).</li>
    <li> My drain gets stuffed with shaving cream.  I got tired of snaking it clean, and buying Drano, so I bought this Norelco Shaver.  I was delivered exactly on the day Amazon promised.  I have not used and electric razor for over 25 years.  The last one I had was a Remington.  I had no luck with any product I bought from that company.  I also had used a Braun foil which didn&#x27;t real give me a good shave.  When I started to shave my father bought be Norelco triple header, that was the only Electric Shaver that I liked, but that was over 40 years ago, and my beard has gotten much heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have enjoy using the Shave over the last two weeks.  It works well, and I get as good of a shave as a blade.  The Trimmer is okay, and one of the features of why I choose the Norelco.  The shave leaves my face very smooth. which my wife approves.  I dry shave and have tried using ElectricShave lotion before shaving.  I see no difference in the result.  The shave is easy to clean, not as messy as the blade.  I like the price, which much less than a years worth of razors.  So I very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Good product at a fair price</li>
    <li> It is taking some getting used to because it does shave closely and pressing too hard gave me a rash.  I like that it can be used wet or dry but generally, I want to use it dry.  I&#x27;m still adjusting but think I like it.  The trimmer also works well and it holds a charge well.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my old shaver, a Phillips about 8 years old, had a problem with the start button and was difficult to start and stop.  I really liked the old shaver, but this new one blows it away.  Much better shave and quieter.  I can also clean it by running the head under the tap.  My only complaint, and a minor one at that, is that the power cord has a small transformer on the plug end.  This makes it a bit harder to travel with.  But the transformer is much smaller than most power cords of this type.</li>
    <li> Does a great job can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> Works great, fast shave, can irritate the skin a little on the neck if you aren&#x27;t careful but I&#x27;m sure with shaving gel it would work better. Easy to clean takes seconds or you can brush it out dry or simply wash it under the sink to clean out the head.</li>
    <li> I needed a new razor and didn&#x27;t want to spend several hundred dollars for one of the well-known, top of the line razor.  This model had a good price and the razor does a good job.  The trimmer does a good job with sideburns and mustache.  It&#x27;s a pretty basic razor, nothing fancy.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, which would mean I love the razor.  Sorry...but I don&#x27;t share my love with a razor.</li>
    <li> My last Norelco lasted nearly fifteen years before retirement. I was actually thinking about shaving with a blade again until I tried this Norelco. I&#x27;d forgotten how close you can get with a good electric. This model shaved twice as fast and considerably closer than my old shaver. I was and still am impressed by the shave I get. This is also my first time rinsing the heads with hot water! A notable improvement in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Was obviously a rebuilt. Came in a brown box, not the store package. Did not see anything in the product description that said the product would not be new. Blades are not sharp and shaves like an old machine. Disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> At first I was planning on returning it because it didn&#x27;t seem to have enough power.  After using this razor for 2 months every day I am very satisfied with it&#x27;s operation.  Especially like the pivoting heads and the fact that it is waterproof and easy to clean.  Leaves a nice smooth shave.  Highly recommend this shaved.</li>
    <li> Does not seem to do the job well,comment from my son....</li>
    <li> Nice shave and the battery charges fast and lasts a few shaves. Easy c!eanup!</li>
    <li> The razor met my expectations, because I have used Norelco razors for many years and there were not surprises.  I like the indicator for needing a charge and when the razor is charged up.  It gives as good a shave as my previous razors as well, which is fine with me.  It is comfortable to hold as well.</li>
    <li> bought this for my daughter &amp; she loves it. not good for underarms but that doesn&#x27;t bother her as she wanted it for her legs &amp; facial hair</li>
    <li> I have had it for about a month. Use it daily and gives a close shave in a few minutes. I have had to charge it only once after about 2.5 weeks.</li>
    <li> Tears up your neck. I hate this thing.</li>
    <li> Electric Razors just don&#x27;t due it for me - no close shave and razor burn  :(</li>
    <li> My husband likes it, it shaves clean and the razor is easy to clean too.</li>
    <li> Works as it should and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. No irritation whatsoever. It gives a very close, clean cut. The motor seems to run slower than older models, but it still gets the job done better than most other others. I do miss the charging stand. It would be nice to have that option.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product for the price but does not shave as closely as my son would like.</li>
    <li> I have only used it a couple times now, but it seems to shave me as well as any other electric razor I have owned in the past.  I have only ever owned Norelco so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands, but I have always been pleased with Norelco so I stick with them.  Norelco recommends replacing blades every year but I have found this to not be necessary as long as I take out the blades every couple months and give them a good cleaning with a razor cleaning solution.  Since I travel internationally, I like the dual voltage feature. Not all razors have this.</li>
    <li> This the 4th Norelco shaver that I have had.  The first two had Ni-Cad batteries and I preferred the powerful motors those had.  This shaver is powerful enough, though.  I have a heavy beard and this shaver does not slow down.  It gives a close, comfortable shave.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Damn fine rechargeable shaver. One charge lasts a VERY long time. Shave is clean, close and fast. No much else to say.</li>
    <li> Husband wanted to try an electric razor, gave it two weeks like it suggested in the manual.  He is still not happy and back to an old fashioned razor.  It didn&#x27;t seem to get the neck area very well.</li>
    <li> I have owned norelcos and they do a good job.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  My old one was 10 years old and chord constantly pulled out from outlet or shaver.  This one runs weeds without recharge and gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave and fast!</li>
    <li> Shaves great, holds a great charge and easy to clean just by rinsing off with water</li>
    <li> I have had it for about a month.  Although the motor &amp;#34;sounds&amp;#34; weak compared to my old Norelco, it does the job without problems.  The first charge lasted more than 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well, not the best shave for me, but neither was my last electric shaver. Gotta work it to make sure you get all the hairs on my chin and such.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful razor.  I have been using it for nine months, and I love it.  I have always used Philips Norelco in the past, and I have been most impressed with this model (PT 730).  My initial thoughts during the first week of use were that the shaving was very quick and comfortable (perhaps I had just become accustomed to my old razor which I needed to replace).  My experience differs from those of the 1-star raters who said they could not get a close shave; I get a very smooth shave from this model.  Sometimes I shave every day; sometimes I&#x27;ll go a week without shaving.  Either way, I get a great shave.  The charge lasts a long time.  It takes probably about 8 hours to charge, but then I&#x27;ll go a good two or three weeks without having to charge it again.  When I bought this razor, I replaced another model of Philips Norelco (sorry, I can&#x27;t remember the old model number); the old charger and stand work just fine on my new razor.  If I were to need to replace this razor right now, I would definitely buy the same model.</li>
    <li> As a long time (decades) Norelco user, I expect a certain shave quality. This delivers.</li>
    <li> I got this Norelco to shave an impaired gentleman in a nursing home. His right hand is impaired and he cannot not shave himself with a blade razor with his left hand. The aides had been shaving him with a blade razor and left him with a bad shave, missed places, and redness and irritation and small cuts. He has a very tough, wiry beard. I am really pleased with how effortlessly this does the job, leaving a pretty close shave even in the hard-to-reach areas. It is very flexible and he is able to use it with his left hand himself. The pop-out trimmer is handy and also does a good job .It is easy to clean.I  recommend it as a good buy.  It has only been used a few times so far, and time will tell how it holds up.  It also charges quickly. I keep it charged so I don&#x27;t know how long a charge lasts, but long enough for a thorough shave at least.</li>
    <li> Very close and smooth shave......I like it :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s at the cutting edge of diminishing returns. Does a good job on a medium-light beard.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband when is old Norelco died after many years of use.  He&#x27;s a goatee guy so he uses this around the outside and has a separate trimmer that he uses on his goatee.  He really likes this.  Enough that he gave his dad one for Christmas this year.  He likes that you can rinse the head off instead of having to brush it and that you can use it while it&#x27;s plugged in (his old one didn&#x27;t turn on while plugged in so if he forgot to charge it he had to wait).</li>
    <li> Never had an electric for wet shaving, this is good! Very close shave, no nicks! I like it, and it was cheap!</li>
    <li> i spent the extra few bucks on this model for one reason, the quick charge ability. I was under the impression that it charged in an hour. Yet according to the manual, this 1 hour is only for a quick charge that doesn&#x27;t last long, and a full charge still requires the 8 hours as cheaper models do. I read this and put it on to charge immediately, and sure enough... the fully charged indicator took roughly 7.5 hours. So I don&#x27;t know where some people are claiming it fully charged in an hour...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All is not bad though. I purchased this as a 2nd shaver. I have a Panasonic that costs around four times the price of this one. It charges in about 30-45 minutes and lasts a week. I use my Panasonic for my face, as I keep various styles of facial hair depending on my mood, and it uses the traditional horizontal bars, which give more precision around beards and whatnot as opposed to this triangular pattern of circular blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the goods? Well my entire reason for buying it is because I&#x27;m a bald man up top and I just shave my head. This took a very long time with my panasonic as its blades don&#x27;t exactly bend or contour. With the Norelco head design and contouring ability, shaving my head takes half the time and it gets closer, but only for my head. The Panasonic out performs it on the face, but for the money, it does a very good job either way. I was complaining about the false statements regarding charging time, but you CAN use it plugged in to the wall regardless of battery charge, so that&#x27;s a major plus considering its charge time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So good shaver? For the price most definitely. But some misleading info about the product is on here. It&#x27;s fine as a secondary like I&#x27;m using it for but honestly I would hate having to use it or rely on it as my only shaver to use daily...</li>
    <li> It cuts pretty dang close. Dry or wet. Not too loud. I wish it held charge longer and more waterproof but hey... Good for the money</li>
    <li> good price works great</li>
    <li> My husband says it is great.</li>
    <li> Great shave for an electric.</li>
    <li> The Norelco PT720 arrived on-time and in excellent condition. I&#x27;ve owned  Remington, Panasonic, and also Norelco shavers. I do not have a heavy growth and of the three brands the Norelco shaves the best. The Remington, feels a tad abrasive when using it. It gets the job done but is not as smooth feeling as the Norelco. The Panasonic comes closest to the Norelco in comfort shave but the battery didn&#x27;t last very long. Maybe just my luck. This is actually the third Norelco I&#x27;ve owned. I was forced to buy the Remington when I forgot my Norelco at home while on a trip and had to make an emergency run to Walmart where the only shavers I could find were Remington at the time.&lt;br /&gt;I hve no hesitation in recommending the Norelco.</li>
    <li> Did a 5 minute charge and used it, looks like unit works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve switched from foil razors to rotary for the last time.  These are the bomb.  It&#x27;s easy to clean, quiet, and the heads seem to last forever.  They get into tight spots very well-- such as under the nose and side burn area.  It&#x27;s very easy to clean, and the charge lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very reasonably priced, too.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This model is a little weak, so keeping it as a backup.</li>
    <li> I spent hours going through the many razor selections and the reviews, and I had decided on the 3100 because it was most like my old razor.  But one review said to pay the extra money for this one and I wouldn&#x27;t be sorry that I did.  So let me save you some time - this is the one!  I love this razor.  It&#x27;s true that you&#x27;ll have to use it for about 3 weeks to get the best results.  But after that I was impressed with the closeness of the shave without having to make multiple passes over the same areas.  I use it every day and it holds a charge for about 2 weeks.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Husband isn&#x27;t very happy with this model, as he has had it fall apart several times while cleaning it, and has had trouble putting it back together. He likes the way it shaves--just thinks it should be easier to clean.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD! I LIKE IT VERY MUCH!</li>
    <li> Great shave, long lasting battery. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product........I was pleased with it from the first shave.</li>
    <li> Not enough power for my beard</li>
    <li> cant go wrong with this shaver for the man in my life.  He loves to use it and it does just what he wants it to do.</li>
    <li> I have used a Norelco shaver for over 45 years and this is the best one yet.  I was very surprised that a shaver at this low price did such a good job.  I was also amazed that one uses hot water to clean the shaver.  One of the best purchases for me.</li>
    <li> okay for the price; if you need a close and quick shave not this one.</li>
    <li> Glves a great shave per my husband.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a great shaver. I had a 5842xl model, &amp; this one is hands down far superior. The weight is only half of my old one. I can not believe how close a shave it gives me. Next time I have to buy a shave it will be the aquatic  model because it should easier to clean.</li>
    <li> Very good razor.  Good shave.</li>
    <li> Transaction was very good, product works great.</li>
    <li> Nice shaver. Why fool around changing blades at this price?</li>
    <li> i have used Norelco shavers for more than 55 years (yeah, I am old) and lost track of how many I bought, but  most lasted several years and worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one before last had battery problems and stopped after 3 or 4 shaves. The cost to replace the battery where I live was about what a new one cost, so got another, but kept the prior one just in case. That last one ran daily for seven years, but then when washing, the head came off and one of the cutters fell down the sink drain, so out it went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the older one for the two days it took for this one to arrive from Amazon. After charging, the older one still worked, but I forgot how noisy it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the new one arrived, charged for eight hours and used the next morning. I was surprised at how quiet it was, and how well it shaved. It is a littler bigger so is easier to grasp, has a deeper hair chamber so don&#x27;t have to empty it as often,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even like the look, black with a white a \\&quot;racing stripe.\\&quot;  That is appropriate, as it gives me a faster shave. I am very pleased with this item and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like the razor. I is working well for me.</li>
    <li> Nice shaver... replaced another Norelco that had come to the end of its life.  I like the ability to rinse out the head on this model, didn&#x27;t have that prior.  Nice close, comfortable shave.  Seems to hold a charge very well.</li>
    <li> My husband is getting the best shave ever! He loves his new Norelco PT730/46 3500 Shaver. Also easy to order replacements thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> It shaves reasonably well. I was surprised to learn that it suggests washing and drying face 15 minutes before shaving and NOT using a pre-shave lotion. Battery life has been extremely good. At one shave a day it lasted well over a month.</li>
    <li> This a very satisfactory shaver. It replaces an older Norelco that I had for probably 10 years, which would no longer hold a charge for more than one shave. The HQ8 razor heads are probably a big reason for the success of this shaver. They have been redesigned. Cleaning the razor under hot tap water is particularly effective. But it leads to the minor complication that the razor must be left open for a long time to dry fully, and the manual says &amp;#34;Do not charge/recharge or use razor until fully dried.&amp;#34; After cleaning, the razor cannot be quickly packed away in a case under the sink. I hope to find a solution soon.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the razor</li>
    <li> close shave, holds 6 weeks of charge for me</li>
    <li> I received this shaver for Christmas after deciding that 65 years shaving with blades was too long. I am not pleased with this. It takes too long to get a reasonable shave. Doesn&#x27;t get close enough and has to be supplemented with a blade shave  for those hairs under the chin and on the neck. I requested this razor based on decades of effective Norelco advertising. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I not in the habit in giving bad reviews if something works for the price I gave for it.. But norelco this is not one of your better shaver,, motor very slow after two days charging..which  means a ruff cutting shave.. ouch!!! I only use electric or battery powered shaver..</li>
    <li> good enough for what I paid</li>
    <li> I read several reviews before buying this; someone wrote about feeling burnt on face after first use. However I did not find any such problem. From the first day it was soothing and I felt no problem to use that. One charge can serve for one week easily. No need to recharge often. Just charge once a week and you are ready to run for the week. Back trimmer is a plus point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue I found that near the edges of the round surfaces of the face such as chin or beside nose you have to keep it in rounding motion for a better shave. Another information you need to know, It wont give you a super clean shave like the traditional razors but you know it cant. It is really useful for ordinary days, for ordinary office or class. If you need super clean shave for party or dating, choose a razor, not this one.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my husband so that we could stop the waste on razor blades.  He really likes the ease and convenience but it is NOT a close shave like a razor.  (true, I did the snuggle test)  So now he uses both depending on time and occasion.  ❤</li>
    <li> this is the best electric razor I have ever had.  It rivals the blades.  would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> At first the shaver worked flawlessly. Then after about 4 months things started to degrade.  I cleaned the heads regularly, yet to get a clean shave took longer and longer. I have never had a razor that had such an inability to cut properly after such a relatively short time since purchase. With other razors I have had no issue with going over the hairs and cutting them.  The whole process would take perhaps 45 seconds. With this one, I have to repeat over the same areas;eventually combined with the trim razor, the hairs are finally cut. The heads are clean and not clogged, yet having to keep cutting over and over to achieve a clean shave is unacceptable!    Cleaning: this is the most difficult razor to clean in terms of disassembly and then reassembly. Normally the heads might be expected to pop in and out easily but each must be carefully aligned in just the right way prior to the blades being reinserted. Then the plastic retainer which has 3 individual rings must be properly replaced in order to secure the head/blade configuration. It took me the longest time before I was able to get this done properly. Whoever put this design together did not consider the human factors aspect of cleaning!</li>
    <li> I think this thing sucks, Fully charged it sounds like its struggling to turn the blades and it shaves like rubbing 800 grit sandpaper over your face.  Honestly I find this product to be entirely useless and I went back to razors after 4 times of using this product. I found myself just going over the same spots again and again and again only to find it still missing hairs and once complete it wasn&#x27;t that smooth at all. I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard at all, in fact I cannot grow a full beard even if I tried.</li>
    <li> This one replaced a much heavier Norelco. Just love the lighter model. No complaints about the shave either. Had about a month, no problems. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have these before and it meets my expectations.</li>
    <li> gift I am sure he will love it.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband for his Birthday.  He loves it and it&#x27;s always a great shave</li>
    <li> Its an excelent product, came just as they said and it works perfectly. Thanks, i&#x27;ll buy again from this store</li>
    <li> Like this shaver, except for the way it irritate the skin on my neck. I also have a Panasonic that does not irritate the skin anywhere, but it is not nearly as close a shave as the Norelco. I think the seemingly much slower spinning Norelco cutters are the cause of the neck issue, while the Panasonic screen and much faster lateral cutting movement keep it from pulling in flesh. However, the latter also seems to result in a less close shave on my facial skin. NOTE: I have a very light beard and am my 70&#x27;s, so these comments probably may not apply in case of thicker hair and irritation problem might not accompany to younger people with tighter neck skin.</li>
    <li> It shaves hair closely, as advertised.</li>
    <li> After doing some research on Norelco&#x27;s more expensive models I opted for this shaver as a replacement for my 25 year old Ronson electric shaver.  Ultimately my purchase was guided by several factors, but the biggest was service life.  Their 9000 series shaver costs between $220-330.  It can only be run with battery power.  The battery is not replaceable, it has a service life of 3 years, and you are supposed to replace the $60 shaver head annually.  Which ultimately means you will be replacing a 9000 series shaver every 3 years.  The PT730 by contrast can be operated on battery or AC power.  The battery is replaceable.  It was on sale for $40.  The PT730 provides a close shave.  My wife always complained about my shave and she wishes I would have purchased this razor sooner.  Like most electric razors I&#x27;ve used, it requires several passes over the more difficult areas of my face/neck.  I find the pop up trimmer is mediocre, but I prefer to clean up my sideburns with a traditional razor.  It operates quietly.  Overall, I would recommend this shaver for great value and a good shave.</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with the shaver. He says it gives a nice, close shave in much less time than his old shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace a rather expensive one I had for years. Needless to say, I love this one! It shaves super close and leaves very little razor burn, if any at all. And I have very sensitive skin! For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this. The battery lasts at least two weeks with shaving once per day. This was much less than my previous razor so I was a little hesitant but I&#x27;m glad I went for it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this brand.</li>
    <li> my husband seems to really like it, it was a gift.&lt;br /&gt;lightweight&lt;br /&gt;great price!</li>
    <li> The vendor did not comply to the product content - it was supposed to Model 3600 but did not include the &#x27;power stand&#x27;. It is disappointing that I have to take the burden to wait for the replacement before I can use it.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a while now and I absolutely love it. Im a guy who has sensitive skin, need to put lotion on my face at least twice a day or else ill look like my face is covered in powdered sugar and this shaver is gentle enough for my face. Worth it for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have to shave every day</li>
    <li> I had forgotten how nice it is to shave with new blades. I really love this shaver.</li>
    <li> Very quiet and cuts beard closely.  So far I have used shaver for 10 days and it still has not needed charging.</li>
    <li> prompt delivery, excellent performance as expected</li>
    <li> Best razor hes ever owned bought as a Christmas gift. Even has a spot that traps all the wiskers so they are not all over the sink. I love it too.</li>
    <li> it needs a titanuum blade for closeness and speed.</li>
    <li> Purchased this shaver for my husband for Christmas.  He has always liked the Norelco products and this one too, has met his expectations.  A very good product, one I would recommend.</li>
    <li> The package is so simple,it is gift for my father in law .I hope he will like it</li>
    <li> Shaves well at a reasonable price. Beat all the large area store prices.</li>
    <li> only used a few times now, but so far so good</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Philips Norelco Shaver in 30 years, and it&#x27;s by far the most extraordinary tool! It runs smoothly across my skin, picks up everything with the 1st pass, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and the trimmer works really, really well. I think we often take our daily tools for given and would like to thank Philips Norelco and Amazon for persevering and bringing us this GREAT tool at a very affordable price.</li>
    <li> Love shaver great for my RA, and blood thinner .</li>
    <li> Replaced fairly new Braun with this.  The Braun tore up my sensitive ginger skin.  This is much smoother (for me).</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for a Norelco I had for many years.  The battery finally gave out.  So, I kind of hit the ground running with this shaver.  there have many improvements over the earlier models such as a better grip feel in your hand. the flip-up head to empty stubble and the convenient off-on switch.  A thumbs up for this shaver!</li>
    <li> Great product and extremely fast shipping</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my Dad and he loves it</li>
    <li> My husband is very impressed with this shaver!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give this 6 stars if I could. Works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for less than a year, and it doesn&#x27;t shave like I should any more. The manufacturer recommends replacing the cutting head annually, but the functionality of this shaver starting waning in the 6 to 9 month range. I don&#x27;t know if I want to spend more for a replacement head, or to just run away from the rotary shaver concept altogether (I&#x27;ve also had a couple of Panasonic linear shavers, which did a much better job).</li>
    <li> Battery lasts forever.  Not as fancy as my previous model, but give just as good a shave.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver does its job well, better than most I&#x27;ve had. It is definitely a multi-pass shaver, however, so expect to spend a bit of time using it.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Only negative is I thought it came with a charging stand.</li>
    <li> Great Price Great Item!</li>
    <li> It is all it should be: lightweight, quiet, gives a smooth quick shave, charge lasts long, charges reasonably quickly, fairly easy to clean. I don&#x27;t think it needs to be cleaned with water every time if one shaves dry, despite the instructions. I also don&#x27;t think one needs to wait 15 minutes to shave dry after washing one&#x27;s face, despite their advice. It can be used corded or cordless, which is not true of the models that can be taken into the shower; this can be handy. There&#x27;s no need for the expensive models. One minor thing it lacks is an indication of how much battery power remains: One only finds out when it is time to recharge.</li>
    <li> best I have found after 60-odd years of trials</li>
    <li> I beleve it is to slow, cutting the hairs you have to make two pass, but that could be me.</li>
    <li> Light weightand provides close &amp; comfortable shave. Like that it is dual voltage for traveling overseas.</li>
    <li> best shaver i ever bought in my 82 years&lt;br /&gt;keeps me looking neat</li>
    <li> This shaver replaces a Remington. I wish I had made the switch sooner. A much closer, more comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> shaves smooth and close</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Does great job,second one that we ordered.  Gives nice clean and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Gift for my husband, and he seems to really like it. It appears to hold a charge well and give a nice clean shave.</li>
    <li> I should have upgraded to a better shaver.  I had one of these shavers before but this one is not made as well.  The trimmer wants to collapse while your attempting to do your side burns.</li>
    <li> Cuts better than any other expensive or cheap electric razors that I have purchased in the past twenty years!&lt;br /&gt;I have used it daily and waited until the beard is four or five days long.&lt;br /&gt;Takes more time to cut longer hair but results are the same: SMOOTH FACE&lt;br /&gt;Philips could manufacture a cutting head that would last several years until the battery stopped and the razor would rate ten stars!</li>
    <li> My previous Norelco shaver is made more durable with metal parts. This most recent purchased Norelco shaver is made mostly of plastic. I actually broke it the first time I used it in an attempt to clean the blades . I think I&#x27;ll spend a little bit more money next time and buy a better Norelco Shaver model. I still love the shave I get from the Brand.</li>
    <li> I was not pleased with this product.  I&#x27;ve had previous norelcos but this one did not live up to the previous ones.</li>
    <li> It takes forever to get a shave. Just doesnt cut well.</li>
    <li> Nice razor. Works very well. Super quiet. Like the waterproof feature for rinsing.</li>
    <li> Good shave good price</li>
    <li> Chose this shaver from the reviews and price. Very pleased so far with this shaver. Give it time to &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; and the shave is very close. I like that it can be rinsed with water to clean. Hopefully it lasts as long as the Norelco it replaced that was purchased 15+years ago.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver for the price- I have no problems with it.</li>
    <li> I was able to compare all the different models and choose the one I wanted with the lowest price on Amazon. The razor does what I wanted. It&#x27;s light weight and nice looking. Being able to rinse it after shaving keeps it that way. The shave is close and not as much irritation as my previous Norelco. Charge holds well so far and the feature of being able to use it with the cord ensures it will be used for years to come. The only negative is it didn&#x27;t come with a hard case to protect it from damage. I was able to take the egg crate carton it came with to the store and found a padded nylon case that the crate fits in perfectly. Another ten bucks but I think worth it. The shave is good but a little slower than my previous shave. All in all I would recommend this shave to anyone that likes an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> A great shaver, very smooth, and being cordless makes it very handy.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this razor, this is his 3rd one, He keeps one as a spare for work or travels. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> This is okay.  I have used it a few times with adequate results.  This product does not act like hair clippers, meaning it is not a one pass and get all the hair deal.  You have to continuously work one area, over and over, until it gets all the hair.  I have tried this with the facial hair at multiple lengths with the same  results.  From one day stubble, to four day length, it always struggle to get every last hair.  It is a very close shave overall though, and it will save you money on razor blades.  Battery lasts a good while too.  Got about 10 shaves before I plugged it in the second time.</li>
    <li> I have only had the razor for 3 weeks, but so far it is working perfectly.  I shave mornings and evenings and am still on the first charge.  I find it very easy to clean compared to my old Norelco because you can rinse this one.  I would say the test of time will be the determiner of total effectiveness.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor...bought it per Amazon&#x27;s ratings and my Dad likes t better than his last razor!! Thank you Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Good item, I love it.</li>
    <li> Great product, shipping, etc. However, I was surprised there was no travel case  to go with it. All my previous Norelcos had nice zippered cases.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected</li>
    <li> This is one of the best shavers I have ever used. I use it to shave my face and head and it does not irritate the skin. It flexes to the contours of the face and head and is relatively quiet.</li>
    <li> For how much you pay, this is a great item.  My old one had a more substantial power cord that you could hang it by, this one is like the kind that charges your phone.  The motor sounds a little &#x27;tin-y-er&#x27; as in cheaper than my old one, but it certainly gets the job done.  I like the button to start it better than my old one, too.  Overall it is very good, not giving it 5 starts because it doesn&#x27;t blow your socks off in any way, but it is everything I asked for.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I have ever purchased so I do not have anything to compare it to. It provides a close shave in seconds, very quiet and cleans up quickly. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> cut me pretty badly, but I may have had a defective unit. I&#x27;m too scared to try another, so its back to the remington for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for 18 months now and it is still cutting as well as brand new. I have been lucky first Norelco lasted 17 years, I still use my circa 2001 Norelco, very loud, heavy, and battery charge doesn&#x27;t hold charge long, but is fine plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  - Quiet rotating motors, substantial difference vs old school loud ones&lt;br /&gt;  - I shave daily and can get 2-3 weeks between charges, or when I see the blinking orange light&lt;br /&gt;  - Quick rinse, and deeper chamber to empty every other day vs daily with former shallow chamber&lt;br /&gt;  - Still get pop up trimmer and heads are same easy to remove and soak in rubbing alcohol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Con:&lt;br /&gt;  - No longer coiled cord, longer slim cord to reach more electrical outlets, but not the nice travel friendly coiled cord&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This is a high quality shaver that should last a while.</li>
