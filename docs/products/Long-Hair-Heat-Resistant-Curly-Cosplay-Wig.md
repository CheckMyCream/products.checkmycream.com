      <li>The hair does kinda shed and tangles fairley easily because of the length, but it can be brushed/combed out nicely.</li>
      <li>so anyone and cut them to the appropriate length.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so cute and</li>
      <li>and I love the color.</li>
      <li>Let me just say the quality and softness is 100% up top.</li>
      <li>It has been worn to many conventions.</li>
      <li>but I do love it.</li>
      <li>im seriously in love with this purchase</li>
      <li>The fibers are nice and soft, which makes it easy to detangle, and the wig looks good on.</li>
      <li>this wig does tangle easily but its still very good especially for the price.</li>
      <li>to my enjoyment, it didn&#x27;t tangle too easily.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s fine</li>
      <li>I love love love how ludicrous it looks yet how plausible it looks as actual hair.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s still fantastic.</li>
      <li>This wig worked out really well for my Rose Quartz cosplay.</li>
      <li>Overall I really like this wig and think it&#x27;s a great alternative to the pricier options out there :)</li>
      <li>the bangs are amazing and it&#x27;s just wow.</li>
      <li>I love it and really recommend it</li>
      <li>Really soft and nice.</li>
      <li>I bought this wig as a quick replacement for one I didn&#x27;t realize would come in 2 months time.</li>
      <li>but luckily I have two already</li>
      <li>Like I said, the quality is super.</li>
      <li>The thickness for this wig is decent, and the wefts aren&#x27;t very visible either, which is nice.</li>
      <li>I felt fabulous and this certainly pinked up my look.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this wig, I bought it just for fun</li>
      <li>Styles easily, but dont use on high heat or it melts.</li>
      <li>However, hair comes off very easily when brushed.</li>
      <li>I love the color, which is a flat &amp;#34;milkshake&amp;#34; color.  </li>
      <li>I love this wig, the bangs are long</li>
      <li>The only problem I have with the wig is the fact that when you part the bangs to the side, you can easily see the netting and wig seam.</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t mind it all to much because it is a cheap wig for its quality, thicker hair means bigger price tag.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s absolutely horrendous.</li>
      <li>now I have my cosplay ready for the anime expo</li>
      <li>Stringy thing and the most hideous shade of pink in person.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s like its my real hair to,</li>
      <li>With that said, this absolutely blew my mind.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>A lot of people thought it was my real hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually more like a neon bubblegum pink.</li>
      <li>The wig cap is good if you don&#x27;t have thick hair.</li>
      <li>In credible!!&lt;br /&gt;normally my wig shopping had to be done on ebay due to thinness but this seller sells good quality thicker wigs for a low price.</li>
      <li>Even with a wig cap, its got many bald spots where the cap shows through and the hair was falling into my face due to the heaviness.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft and the fibers are pretty decent but it tangles along the bottom.</li>
      <li>and it arrived super fast the next day which is a plus</li>
      <li>In the right light it actually looks closer to blonde.</li>
      <li>I got mine the light pink color</li>
      <li>so I could see how thin the layers near the neck line are, but other than that they will make one beautiful wig!</li>
      <li>The bangs definitely cover your right eye</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for but in this case it was better than expected, it&#x27;s soft, long and wavy, being a long wig it tangels easily</li>
      <li>The only thing is that the cap on the wig is the same mesh cap you find on cheap halloween wigs, so it isn&#x27;t adjustable.</li>
      <li>The wig came styled exactly as pictured, and it was a big hit.</li>
      <li>Let me just start off with, I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations in a wig that only cost 15 dollars.</li>
      <li>You can clearly see the wig cap, it doesn&#x27;t part</li>
      <li>but this can be fixed with a bow or a barette if that&#x27;s not the look you&#x27;re going for.</li>
      <li>The color is true to the description image, maybe slightly darker.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of disappointed, but I suppose that&#x27;s what I get for spending money on a cheap wig.</li>
      <li>Also, I love how long the bangs actually came, they fall down to about my chin</li>
      <li>I may need to pick another one up down the line though because Rose&#x27;s hair is so thick, but I would definitely buy this wig again.</li>
      <li>The wig is very soft and feels realistic, not cheap and plasticy like some wigs out there.</li>

<li> and it&#x27;s a very pale soft pink almost a champagne color.</li>
<li> the only bad thing was that it DID NOT come with the promised free wig cap.</li>
<li> It was pink.</li>
<li> but thats to be expected.</li>
<li> The pink is not.</li>

<li> If you are looking for a not-so-in-your-face pink colored wig, this one is not for you!</li>
<li> Came in two weeks sooner than expected!  </li>
<li> Very nice wigs, a little thin at the crown and at the base.</li>
<li> If you want a thicker wig, order two and sew one to the other!</li>
<li> I was a little upset with that</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Beautiful, just like the picture. Will buy again thank you!</li>
    <li> It was pink. Not dark pink.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig as a quick replacement for one I didn&#x27;t realize would come in 2 months time. It got here in about a week and I was so relieved it came. You get what you pay for but in this case it was better than expected, it&#x27;s soft, long and wavy, being a long wig it tangels easily but thats to be expected. the picture I have doesn&#x27;t give the color justice, curse you bathroom lights. The bangs are longer than shown in the product photo and this is usually a good thing so anyone and cut them to the appropriate length.The only problem I have with the wig is the fact that when you part the bangs to the side, you can easily see the netting and wig seam. But I don&#x27;t mind it all to much because it is a cheap wig for its quality, thicker hair means bigger price tag. If you want a thicker wig, order two and sew one to the other! Over all I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I wore it to the mall and one of the workers at forever 21 and I was so happy</li>
    <li> Perfect for the Fluttershy costume</li>
    <li> This was amazing and I aboslutely loved it. A lot of people thought it was my real hair and it&#x27;s so cute and the curls are so great and it&#x27;s like its my real hair to, the bangs are amazing and it&#x27;s just wow. I love it and really recommend it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good wig; perfect colour for a Megurine Luka cosplay, but when I received the wig it was very tangled and I couldn&#x27;t untangle it.</li>
    <li> Let me just start off with, I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations in a wig that only cost 15 dollars. With that said, this absolutely blew my mind. I adore this wig. The quality of the hair fibers, the length, and the styling are all great. The wig is very soft and feels realistic, not cheap and plasticy like some wigs out there. I got mine the light pink color and it&#x27;s a very pale soft pink almost a champagne color. The hair does kinda shed and tangles fairley easily because of the length, but it can be brushed/combed out nicely. Also, I love how long the bangs actually came, they fall down to about my chin but I think that&#x27;s nicer because you can trim and style them in whatever fashion you want. Honestly, I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this wig, I bought it just for fun but I do love it.</li>
    <li> In credible!!&lt;br /&gt;normally my wig shopping had to be done on ebay due to thinness but this seller sells good quality thicker wigs for a low price. i will be buying again &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of disappointed, but I suppose that&#x27;s what I get for spending money on a cheap wig. Even with a wig cap, its got many bald spots where the cap shows through and the hair was falling into my face due to the heaviness. It sheds like crazy. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Got it today! The wig cap is good if you don&#x27;t have thick hair. The wig itself is comfy and fits perfect. The bangs definitely cover your right eye but this can be fixed with a bow or a barette if that&#x27;s not the look you&#x27;re going for. I love it!</li>
    <li> Good for Rose Quartz cosplay</li>
    <li> Its exactly like the picture its absolutely beautiful!!!!! The curls are perfect im seriously in love with this purchase (: and it arrived super fast the next day which is a plus now I have my cosplay ready for the anime expo</li>
    <li> Came in two weeks sooner than expected!  The color was exactly as the picture and the quality is great!!</li>
    <li> It fit wonderfully upon arrival! The condition was great and I love the color. It has been worn to many conventions.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect and ordered this for a costume. I love love love how ludicrous it looks yet how plausible it looks as actual hair. The wig came styled exactly as pictured, and it was a big hit. I felt fabulous and this certainly pinked up my look. The color is not true to the photo, it&#x27;s a much more subtle pink, not bubblegum but like a blonde who has a hint of pink in there. In the right light it actually looks closer to blonde. But it&#x27;s still fantastic.</li>
    <li> This wig is very cute. I like the color and the wig is packaged well when delivered. Styles easily, but dont use on high heat or it melts.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very soft and the fibers are pretty decent but it tangles along the bottom.</li>
    <li> Really soft and nice. However, hair comes off very easily when brushed. There are a few bald spots I had to cover over.</li>
    <li> This wig worked out really well for my Rose Quartz cosplay. I may need to pick another one up down the line though because Rose&#x27;s hair is so thick, but I would definitely buy this wig again.</li>
    <li> VERY good quality for the price, and even came with a wig cap! The fibers are nice and soft, which makes it easy to detangle, and the wig looks good on. The only thing is that the cap on the wig is the same mesh cap you find on cheap halloween wigs, so it isn&#x27;t adjustable. For my purposes, however, I purchased this wig as a sort of donor wig so that I could harvest the wefts and sew them on to a blonde wig I have for cosplay. The thickness for this wig is decent, and the wefts aren&#x27;t very visible either, which is nice. The color is true to the description image, maybe slightly darker. Overall I really like this wig and think it&#x27;s a great alternative to the pricier options out there :)</li>
    <li> The long curls are nice, but the bangs are annoying. They don&#x27;t stay put, they really get in the way unless you pin them back, which makes it look stupid</li>
    <li> I love this wig, the bangs are long but that&#x27;s fine the only bad thing was that it DID NOT come with the promised free wig cap. I was a little upset with that but luckily I have two already so it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal.&lt;br /&gt;Now this wig does tangle easily but its still very good especially for the price.</li>
    <li> it was so cute! to my enjoyment, it didn&#x27;t tangle too easily. the wig cap is perfectly sized and it is very wear and comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> Great quality, I absolutely loved how neatly the wig was packed and it fit nicely. I&#x27;ll be ordering another color soon.</li>
    <li> Very nice wigs, a little thin at the crown and at the base. I love the color, which is a flat &amp;#34;milkshake&amp;#34; color.  Fast shipping so that was an amazing plus! I am splicing two wigs together so I could see how thin the layers near the neck line are, but other than that they will make one beautiful wig!</li>
    <li> The quality and color of this wig are great; it looks just like the picture. I&#x27;m really happy with this wig !</li>
    <li> This is the worst wig ever. Stringy thing and the most hideous shade of pink in person. You can clearly see the wig cap, it doesn&#x27;t part, it&#x27;s absolutely horrendous. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I bought the &amp;#34;dusty rose&amp;#34; colored wig. Let me just say the quality and softness is 100% up top. However, the color is not this soft and subtle pink we see pictured. It&#x27;s actually more like a neon bubblegum pink. Now I read reviews before I buy things, just as you are now. So let me say, buyer beware! If you are looking for a not-so-in-your-face pink colored wig, this one is not for you! If you ARE looking for that punk rocker shade of candy, then you&#x27;ve found it. I like the wig. But I won&#x27;t be wearing it. I would buy from this seller again. Like I said, the quality is super. The pink is not.</li>
