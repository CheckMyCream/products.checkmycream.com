      <li>This scent smells great!!</li>
      <li>and I loved it!</li>

      <li>While the product was great.</li>
      <li>Great surprise.</li>

      <li>make sure you don&#x27;t sweat Clinical Strength very excellent smell</li>
      <li>I love the scent &amp; it works great!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s basically as good as you&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a good product and I like the scent too.  </li>
      <li>Great price for a very effective lightly fragranced deodorant-Love the travel sized product and</li>
      <li>There are more cost effective sizes to buy.</li>
      <li>Well, on BOTH of my tubes, the packaging broke, so when I turned the knob to make the product come up, the top of the deodorant container went up.</li>
      <li>I love the product that is in the container.  </li>
      <li>I love the fragrance and how well it protects my underarms.</li>
      <li>It works much better than I thought it would.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of it.</li>
      <li>Finally found THE BEST deodorant!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>I love the product itself.  </li>
      <li>Aside from that this is a great product, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a twist stick kind, not gel, but soft texture that pushes through the cracks in the top of the stick.</li>
      <li>Before using this they tried all the &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; brands with super strong scents.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t keep me from sweating, and the pleasant lavender smell doesn&#x27;t last all day . . .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad, not too strong and a pretty scent, although I still prefer the unscented.  </li>
      <li>Maybe there&#x27;s not an adequate amount of product in each pack.</li>
      <li>I love first tried this deodorant a few months ago, using an unscented version, and I loved it.</li>
      <li>Worth a try &amp; the money.  </li>
      <li>This is the only kind that does the job.</li>
      <li>Woworks excellent keep you dry all day long</li>
      <li>I switched my 5 star rating to 3 because I&#x27;ve used all 4 of these deoderants in 2 months and that doesn&#x27;t seem right to me.</li>
      <li>This is a small pack, great for purse or backpack.</li>
      <li>Definitely works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, including deodorants for men.</li>
      <li>I definitely plan to order more of this product.</li>
      <li>The actual product is okay.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just creamy enough to be easy to to apply and dries right away.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll just get them at Target, much cheaper.</li>
      <li>and I have not had too much residue on my clothes.  </li>
      <li>It blends in very well</li>
      <li>never had problem with too much sweat, just offensive odor.  </li>
      <li>Love the scent, very clean, I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
      <li>Little, cute things make me smile, so it works for me, but just be prepared that these are small. :)</li>
      <li>should, I basically had to push the top down, and then all of the deodorant came out at once.</li>
      <li>so when I saw 4 for such an inexpensive price, it was worth it.</li>
      <li>Even with that in mind, you still receive enough product to make it worth the price.  </li>
      <li>Strong enough for my boys who play multiple sports.</li>
      <li>To top it off, the deodorant worked exactly the same as any other generic deodorant.</li>
      <li>This stuff will keep you smelling fresh all day long!</li>
      <li>It not only works great, but doesn&#x27;t leave the white marks on dark clothing like other deodorants</li>
      <li>I know that description may not be clear, but basically -- these travel-size containers are too flimsy, so they broke.</li>
      <li>I regularly use this deodorant and really like it.  </li>
      <li>I like this but was surprised that these were the mini size.  </li>
      <li>I gave it 2 stars because they really should make the regular size prduct not the mini one.</li>
      <li>I love Secret clinical strength because it works very well.</li>
      <li>I got surprised when I received it and is very small, travel size, only 0.5 oz each, but I love the product</li>
      <li>The seller should be clear about this advertisement, is a twin pack with total of 1 oz, is not 1 oz each.</li>
      <li>Really runny and wet.</li>
      <li>I have tried the Dove clinical strength, and for me, Secret is much better.</li>
      <li>I purchased this item because I love all of the Secret Clinical Strength products.  </li>
      <li>I only use this when I know I&#x27;ll be working, sweating hard and it gives me full day&#x27;s protection.  </li>
      <li>Super small containers and do not last long.  </li>

    <li> I got two little deodorant sticks for a very low price. They came in the same box that is pictured. The deodorant works.</li>
    <li> Since hitting menopause regular antiperspirant/deodorants don&#x27;t do the trick at all. I&#x27;ve tried every brand out there even prescription. This is the only kind that does the job. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
    <li> I regularly use this deodorant and really like it.  When I ordered this I was disappointed since I didn&#x27;t realize that they were travel sized and not the full size container.</li>
    <li> Strong enough for my boys who play multiple sports. Before using this they tried all the &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; brands with super strong scents. This has been a lifesaver for them.  A little goes a long way. This is a small pack, great for purse or backpack. There are more cost effective sizes to buy.</li>
    <li> Worth a try &amp; the money.  I only use this when I know I&#x27;ll be working, sweating hard and it gives me full day&#x27;s protection.  Other than that, I rotate between regular Secret, Dove, Keihls and currently Ban.</li>
    <li> Finally found THE BEST deodorant! I&#x27;m a nursing student and have the worst stress sweat before labs/clinicals/exams etc. This has done the trick and lasts! Love the scent, very clean, I&#x27;m addicted. If I shower and put it on Sunday, I wake up Monday without having to reapply, or even worry about it. It&#x27;s a twist stick kind, not gel, but soft texture that pushes through the cracks in the top of the stick. (It&#x27;s not a solid stick it that is what you are looking for)</li>
    <li> I like this but was surprised that these were the mini size.  I&#x27;ll just get them at Target, much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Great price for a very effective lightly fragranced deodorant-Love the travel sized product and I will purchase again in the future</li>
    <li> This is a good product and I like the scent too.  It blends in very well and I have not had too much residue on my clothes.  I have tried the Dove clinical strength, and for me, Secret is much better.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about the scent, but it smells quite lovely and isn&#x27;t overpowering. I was shocked to see it&#x27;s actual TWO TWIN packs, so there are 4 in this box. I was expected just two. Great surprise. I love first tried this deodorant a few months ago, using an unscented version, and I loved it. I definitely plan to order more of this product. Definitely works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, including deodorants for men.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It works much better than I thought it would. I love the fragrance and how well it protects my underarms.</li>
    <li> While the product was great. I gave it 2 stars because they really should make the regular size prduct not the mini one. If I can get product in a regular size I will definitely buy it. The product smells great and I loved it!</li>
    <li> I switched my 5 star rating to 3 because I&#x27;ve used all 4 of these deoderants in 2 months and that doesn&#x27;t seem right to me. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of this deoderant and buy the big $11 one in the store so when I saw 4 for such an inexpensive price, it was worth it. However I&#x27;m now re-thinking since I&#x27;ve used all of them so quckly. Maybe there&#x27;s not an adequate amount of product in each pack.</li>
    <li> Really runny and wet. Super small containers and do not last long.  They do stop the sweating and there is no odor after heavy workouts</li>
    <li> I love the product that is in the container.  Moreover, the container is extremely &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; on the amount of product placed in it.  Kinda miss-leading and a bit of a physiological &amp;#34;mind play&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is my everyday deodorant. I love the smell of it. It&#x27;s just creamy enough to be easy to to apply and dries right away.</li>
    <li> I love Secret clinical strength because it works very well. This scent smells great!! Very good purchase and a great value, I would definitely buy it again, especially through the Subscribe and Save program!</li>
    <li> The actual product is okay. It doesn&#x27;t keep me from sweating, and the pleasant lavender smell doesn&#x27;t last all day . . . but it&#x27;s basically as good as you&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem with this particular product is that the packaging is awful. They&#x27;re small sticks, and you turn the knob to make the product come up &amp; out. Well, on BOTH of my tubes, the packaging broke, so when I turned the knob to make the product come up, the top of the deodorant container went up. Rather than the product coming out like it should, I basically had to push the top down, and then all of the deodorant came out at once. I know that description may not be clear, but basically -- these travel-size containers are too flimsy, so they broke. It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love the product itself.  It not only works great, but doesn&#x27;t leave the white marks on dark clothing like other deodorants can (even when some claim not to) and I like the scent. I knew they would be smaller than the &amp;#34;usual&amp;#34;, but they are teeny, tiny size.  I guess a travel size would be the best way to describe it.  Even with that in mind, you still receive enough product to make it worth the price.  Little, cute things make me smile, so it works for me, but just be prepared that these are small. :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplying my deodorant after long hours at work! This stuff will keep you smelling fresh all day long!</li>
    <li> Woworks excellent keep you dry all day long stands up to secret quality make sure you don&#x27;t sweat Clinical Strength very excellent smell</li>
    <li> have switched to this exclusively and all version like it scented or not.  wonderful solution for odor.  never had problem with too much sweat, just offensive odor.  absolutely no problem now.  this price is unbeatable in stores</li>
    <li> The seller should be clear about this advertisement, is a twin pack with total of 1 oz, is not 1 oz each. I got surprised when I received it and is very small, travel size, only 0.5 oz each, but I love the product so I won&#x27;t return it, I will carry one in my purse and the other will leave in the car inside glove compartment.</li>
    <li> The packaging was bad (taped together with packaging tape) and the sticks were travel size. To top it off, the deodorant worked exactly the same as any other generic deodorant. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love Secret Clinical Strength have been using it for a while, I sweat very heavily and this keeps me dry throughout the day.  I usually buy the unscented because I am sensitive to smells but decided to try this lavender scent since it came in the travel size.  It&#x27;s not bad, not too strong and a pretty scent, although I still prefer the unscented.  Aside from that this is a great product, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I love all of the Secret Clinical Strength products.  This item is perfect for when you have to travel or to even toss in your gym bag or purse.  They are small in size and do not take up much room.  I love the scent &amp; it works great!</li>
