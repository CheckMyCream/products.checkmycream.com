      <li>but i was happy with this product but the price made me upset</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve heard that this is a great product for hydrating lips.</li>
      <li>it might seem a lil bit to bright in the packaging</li>
      <li>Plus it has a light scent, which smells awesome, by the way!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smells good though</li>
      <li>but when you put it on it isn&#x27;t as bright it still does show up in your lips as a pinky color which is just so amazing.</li>

      <li>I love this balm!</li>
      <li>so great, super moisturizing!</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a nice color.</li>
      <li>A lot of people online said that this one smells fruity and kind of like candy, but to me it just smells like lipstick.</li>
      <li>I still liked it even though it was a bit brighter than imagined.</li>
      <li>The &#x27;Strike A Rose&#x27; balm was a lot brighter and more neon than in the picture.</li>

      <li>I love Baby Lips.</li>
      <li>i absolutely love this product it is so mostourizing and</li>
      <li>Orange is ok...</li>
      <li>and I just love the color pay off</li>
      <li>I love Maybelline&#x27;s Baby Lips</li>
      <li>Color wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting - more neon than I would have figured.</li>
      <li>Love it and will be buying more and more of this one.</li>
      <li>this was okay.</li>
      <li>I love Maybelline</li>
      <li>It makes your lips nice and smooth, plus it stains your lips</li>
      <li>You just gotta make sure your lips are exfoliated.</li>
      <li>Lips is super amazing.</li>
      <li>The noticeably bright pinky-coral color can get intense if you apply it aggressively</li>
      <li>this melt on lips to blend in easily with any skin type.does not come in as melted.</li>
      <li>This one in particular is such a lovely shade and is wonderful.</li>
      <li>On Lips, Smooth Smooth Smooth</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of babylips and the electo is one of my favs.</li>
      <li>Could only give this three stars - definitely a great product but the color is NOTHING like the image shown.</li>
      <li>Comes on smooth, not sticky on lips.</li>
      <li>This is the only one in the line that is attractive to me because it isn&#x27;t super in-your-face.  </li>
      <li>Smells amazing, and definitely one of the more pigmented baby lips shades.</li>
      <li>It also had a nice scent to it and it did make my lips very soft.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t the first of the Baby Lips that I&#x27;ve purchased, so I was pretty sure that I would like the product to begin with.</li>
      <li>I got the chap stick quickly</li>
      <li>I liked pink shades more....</li>
      <li>totally recommend the Strike A Rose and Pink Shock lip balms in particular, because they&#x27;re my favorites lol!</li>
      <li>I just love it completely!</li>
      <li>i highly recomend it!!!</li>
      <li>Worth a try.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the buy, regardless.</li>
      <li>It keeps her lips soft and most while playing dress up.</li>
      <li>Then I read reviews, looked at swatches online and finally caved in and bought &#x27;Strike a Rose&#x27;.</li>
      <li>right on the front.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a subtle splash of an orange/pink color, it&#x27;s moisturizing and smells good as well!</li>
      <li>It smells like a fruity scent and leaves a nice pink color in two swipes on your lips</li>
      <li>The formula seems to be the same, so it&#x27;s GREAT moisturizer and lasts a long time on the lips.  </li>
      <li>Overall it was an okay product.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t look like a clown ;)</li>
      <li>Good go to everyday color.</li>
      <li>It smells very fruity which I really like ,but that&#x27;s the only thing that I love about this product.</li>
      <li>The lipstick case makes her believe that it is similar to her mom&#x27;s lipstick and the gloss is very effective to keep her lips unchapped in extreme weather.</li>
      <li>Unlike a lipstick it has a soft tint that fades quickly.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s chapped lips and this works very well.</li>
      <li>I just applied it gently and dabbed some off.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a neon pink.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great product, highly recommended!</li>
      <li>It resembles the &#x27;Pink Shock&#x27; in color, although the package it came in was undisturbed and clearly said &#x27;Strike A Rose&#x27;</li>
      <li>I will probably use it for those days where I&#x27;m trying to look very natural ,but I will put on my Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm first.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I would wear it daily as it fits my evening wardrobe a bit better, but it leaves my lips feeling healthy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the right kind of pink without too much pink if you get my drift?</li>
      <li>The color is nice, subtle but a nice pay-off, and you can wear it as an everyday color on the lips.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a BIG lover of the baby lips collection, my favorite is the one in the baby blue tube.  </li>
      <li>definitely gives a good amount of moisture which lasts a few hours along with the tint.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend if you&#x27;re already a fan of the line.</li>
      <li>When I originally bought this in the summer it was being sold as limited edition</li>
      <li>It made my lips soft, but the color was a bit much.</li>
      <li>I was expecting this color to be very vibrant ,but it was just very sheer.</li>
      <li>i bought this because my friend kept telling me about how soft it makes her lips feel...</li>
      <li>worth $ and time spent on ordering.</li>
      <li>I originally wanted the pink punch, which is a bit lighter than this tone but this worked out equally well.</li>
      <li>However, I bought it for $3 at Target instead of the high price listed here, so I&#x27;d suggest taking a look around your local shops before buying here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even though I feel like it&#x27;s barely on it</li>
      <li>First off, it&#x27;s not moisturizing because later my lips are dry and chapped and gross again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells amazing, and definitely one of the more pigmented baby lips shades. Highly recommend if you&#x27;re already a fan of the line.</li>
    <li> Great product! In the winter my lips get chapped very badly. But I hate using lipstick or lip crayon on chapped lips. This is the perfect solution!! It is a great Chapstick. It also gives you some color. The only downside is you need to put on ALOT to see a noticeable color.</li>
    <li> Color wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting - more neon than I would have figured.</li>
    <li> this was okay. It made my lips soft, but the color was a bit much. Not the type of lip balm you can apply often otherwise the color gets to be a bit crazy.</li>
    <li> it looks somewhat like the picture. but not really. its still nice though.</li>
    <li> I love this balm! It&#x27;s a subtle splash of an orange/pink color, it&#x27;s moisturizing and smells good as well! However, I bought it for $3 at Target instead of the high price listed here, so I&#x27;d suggest taking a look around your local shops before buying here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this. First off, it&#x27;s not moisturizing because later my lips are dry and chapped and gross again. It&#x27;s a nice color. The color is the only thing I like about it. The color lasts 2 minutes and then it&#x27;s done. It&#x27;s not worth $10.00 you can get it some where else for $5.00</li>
    <li> I just love it completely! If you are thinking about trying out one of the baby lips blame electro for sure try this one out. Truly great product and I just love the color pay off it might seem a lil bit to bright in the packaging but when you put it on it isn&#x27;t as bright it still does show up in your lips as a pinky color which is just so amazing. Love it and will be buying more and more of this one.</li>
    <li> this melt on lips to blend in easily with any skin type.does not come in as melted. works as described. worth $ and time spent on ordering.</li>
    <li> this product worked as expected. Comes on smooth, not sticky on lips. Would buy it again, as well as recommend this product</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this.  It keeps her lips soft and most while playing dress up. Plus, mommys love this too.</li>
    <li> I love Baby Lips. I have to buy them each time I am in the story, even if I am buying the same flavor again and again. I am totally addict to lip balm and chap stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baby Lips is super amazing. Unlike a lipstick it has a soft tint that fades quickly. Which is perfect for someone like me. Also it is like a chap stick, smoothing your lips so wonderfully, and you just reapply each time it wares out like any chap stick in the world. If your prissy about reapplication this isn&#x27;t the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives&lt;br /&gt;-Color&lt;br /&gt;-Smell&lt;br /&gt;-Effect On Lips, Smooth Smooth Smooth&lt;br /&gt;-Taste&lt;br /&gt;-Application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives&lt;br /&gt;-Price Tag, $2.98 in stores, ouch!</li>
    <li> great!! I suggest it for anyone who loves slight pink color.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s chapped lips and this works very well. The lipstick case makes her believe that it is similar to her mom&#x27;s lipstick and the gloss is very effective to keep her lips unchapped in extreme weather. I would buy this again/</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the first of the Baby Lips that I&#x27;ve purchased, so I was pretty sure that I would like the product to begin with. This one in particular is such a lovely shade and is wonderful. I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of the way it smell though. A lot of people online said that this one smells fruity and kind of like candy, but to me it just smells like lipstick.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this product it is so mostourizing and the color is great!  its not to brite but its not to suttle its just a perfect color! i highly recomend it!!!</li>
    <li> This lip balm is great! It makes your lips nice and smooth, plus it stains your lips so even when it&#x27;s no longer moist you still have the color and the softness! Plus it has a light scent, which smells awesome, by the way!&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend the Strike A Rose and Pink Shock lip balms in particular, because they&#x27;re my favorites lol!</li>
    <li> I originally wanted the pink punch, which is a bit lighter than this tone but this worked out equally well. I&#x27;m not sure if I would wear it daily as it fits my evening wardrobe a bit better, but it leaves my lips feeling healthy so still great nonetheless!</li>
    <li> This is a perfect lip balm. It&#x27;s moisturizing, not sticky, and beautiful color. Buy it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!  It&#x27;s limited edition so they won&#x27;t be around forever</li>
    <li> Nice color, goes on smooth. You just gotta make sure your lips are exfoliated. Good go to everyday color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a BIG lover of the baby lips collection, my favorite is the one in the baby blue tube.  When these came out, with moisture and color, I knew I would want one.  This is the only one in the line that is attractive to me because it isn&#x27;t super in-your-face.  The formula seems to be the same, so it&#x27;s GREAT moisturizer and lasts a long time on the lips.  The color is nice, subtle but a nice pay-off, and you can wear it as an everyday color on the lips.</li>
    <li> i bought this because my friend kept telling me about how soft it makes her lips feel...didn&#x27;t work for me...the color is way too bright/neon and i don&#x27;t like the texture...</li>
    <li> Orange is ok... I liked pink shades more.... It&#x27;s smells good though</li>
    <li> The &#x27;Strike A Rose&#x27; balm was a lot brighter and more neon than in the picture. It resembles the &#x27;Pink Shock&#x27; in color, although the package it came in was undisturbed and clearly said &#x27;Strike A Rose&#x27; right on the front. I still liked it even though it was a bit brighter than imagined. I just applied it gently and dabbed some off. It also had a nice scent to it and it did make my lips very soft. Definitely worth the buy, regardless.</li>
    <li> so great, super moisturizing!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy into the hype about Baby Lips because I felt it looked, as its name suggests, babyish and at the same time &#x27;80s and trendy-looking. Then I read reviews, looked at swatches online and finally caved in and bought &#x27;Strike a Rose&#x27;. The first thing I noticed was the tangy, fruity scent which reminds me of hawaiian punch and cherry hard candy. Artificial, yes, but not sickly sweet nor does it taste sweet like some balms do (Eos being one). The noticeably bright pinky-coral color can get intense if you apply it aggressively but if you don&#x27;t go overboard the color is sheer, shiny and buildable. I tend to apply it in small patting motions rather than swiping it across my lips if I don&#x27;t have a mirror on me so I don&#x27;t look like a clown ;) Even though I feel like it&#x27;s barely on it definitely gives a good amount of moisture which lasts a few hours along with the tint. When I originally bought this in the summer it was being sold as limited edition but I still see it at the drugstore so hopefully it&#x27;ll stick around. Worth a try.</li>
    <li> Could only give this three stars - definitely a great product but the color is NOTHING like the image shown. It&#x27;s more of a neon pink.</li>
    <li> I love Maybelline and I&#x27;ve heard that this is a great product for hydrating lips. I put it on and I didn&#x27;t really feel that instant hydration that I usually get from Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm. I do get chapped lips ,but they are not usually that bad unless its in the winter.I was expecting this color to be very vibrant ,but it was just very sheer. I will probably use it for those days where I&#x27;m trying to look very natural ,but I will put on my Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm first. This lip balm is not build-able; I tried it does not work. It smells very fruity which I really like ,but that&#x27;s the only thing that I love about this product. Overall it was an okay product.</li>
    <li> I love Maybelline&#x27;s Baby Lips but this is my favorite shade! It&#x27;s the right kind of pink without too much pink if you get my drift?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of babylips and the electo is one of my favs. I got the chap stick quickly and i loved it! It smells like a fruity scent and leaves a nice pink color in two swipes on your lips I went to my local target to buy another and i found out it was only $3.30! I spent $6 on this but i was happy with this product but the price made me upset but i got over it.</li>
    <li> it arrives all broken! I dont even have a chance to try it.</li>
