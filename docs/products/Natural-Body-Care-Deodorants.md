### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Not my greatest purchase.</li>
      <li>Excellent, non-irritating deodorant.</li>
      <li>It smells so good!  </li>
      <li>It works great for me.</li>
      <li>I find the odor control to be great.  </li>
      <li>Works longer than atoms brand with a pleasant smell.  </li>
      <li>No aluminum, parabens, and so forth and the scent is good.  </li>
      <li>I smelled it in the store and loved it</li>
      <li>An outstanding natural deodorant with a very pleasant aroma and excellent protection.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I love this deodorant!</li>
      <li>I bet you&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
      <li>Every Man Jack face wash is amazing.  </li>
      <li>The folks at Every Man Jack have outdone themselves with this amazing product.</li>
      <li>but I smelled this one as well and both were nice.</li>
      <li>It may smell nice, but that comes of no use midway through the day when you&#x27;re thinking that you may have forgotten to put your deodorant on.</li>
      <li>Kind of makes me wonder if this is just some kind of shampoo</li>
      <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to work.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product it was because I love everything else</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t stink to the point of being able to smell myself or disgust others with my smell, but by the end of the day, my armpits stank.</li>
      <li>Love this, will buy again.</li>
      <li>The scent is okay.</li>
      <li>I tried it more than once to see if I would get used to it.  </li>
      <li>And love the scent.</li>
      <li>No nasty ingredients.  </li>
      <li>The citrus smell on this one is awesome, very fresh and masculine.</li>
      <li>The scent is quite strong at first but the good thing about that is that the scent is still there by the end of the day; it&#x27;s nice.  </li>
      <li>Well, it smells pretty good.</li>
      <li>CLEAN!</li>
      <li>was fine, performance was OK ...</li>
      <li>I then went to atoms of Maine brand and while it worked, it ran out of steam fast protection wise.  </li>
      <li>Good stuff although it doesn&#x27;t lather much</li>
      <li>This is hands down the very best &amp;#34;aluminum free&amp;#34; deodorant / antiperspirant  </li>
      <li>However, if you want to try aluminum free deodorant, you should give this one a shot.</li>
      <li>Really enjoy the scent on this stick.</li>
      <li>This deodorant lasts all day and is extremely comfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also keeps me smelling good pretty well, and my job is pretty sweaty.  </li>
      <li>: a significant chunk ended up being detached from the housing, from the thing where you push it up</li>
      <li>The price is high, but it seemed like a good product at first.  </li>
      <li>EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep gives it a pretty good rating.</li>
      <li>I think that it is worth to give it a try.</li>
      <li>As far as its deodorizing capabilities, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
      <li>EMJ seems to be a decent product that doesn&#x27;t smell to girly and goes on easy after a shower.  </li>
      <li>It actually smells good, and I wanted to go natural and pesticide free.</li>
      <li>The salt stick is sort of iffy depending on my diet, so I wanted something that was aluminum-free but still able to protect me when my diet veered from raw vegetarian consumption, to one that was more carnivorous.  </li>
      <li>Bought this first at the store.  </li>
      <li>The only natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve used that actually works, love this stuff and love to not be using an aluminum based product.</li>
      <li>For me though, the rash is a very helpful reminder that I did in fact put it on.  </li>
      <li>Got this to go with some citrus shampoo / body wash we bought from Whole</li>
      <li>I can say that for me it has worked very well.</li>
      <li>I got this deodorant at Whole Foods just out of curiosity.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
      <li>Stick lasts a long time, glides on easily.</li>
      <li>However, I can say from experience that leaving a stick in your gym bag in your car (even in cool Colorado), or putting it in your suitcase in a car trunk in California, will melt the whole thing in a short amount of time.  </li>
      <li>and it works well for a decent price.  </li>
      <li>This has a pleasant citrus smell and has less chemicals than other deodorants.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t run around smelling your armpits or sticking them in other people&#x27;s faces all day, you&#x27;ll probably be fine.</li>
      <li>I was using an Old Spice deodorant before this and this works at least as well, and smells better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a fan of the Every Man Jack products, but this deodorant offers zero odor protection whatsoever.</li>
      <li>I understand making things natural, but they need to be functional too - and this product is not up to snuff.</li>
      <li>I can apply the old one once and it will stay on all day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not an especially sweaty person, but this brand really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>And that doesn&#x27;t happen with my old one.</li>
      <li>It nearly outperformed my &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>but the deodorant protection doesn&#x27;t last for more than a few hours.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several all natural deodorants and none have lived up to my expectations.</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;ll just stick with my Old Spice Red Zone.  </li>
      <li>These are not extreme temperatures, just regular travel issues that kill the product.  </li>
      <li>This is definitely my new favourite deodorant, and I look forward to trying out some of the other scents later on.</li>

<li> This product scent does not last very long after applying and still irritates underarm areas.  </li>
<li> It smells like orange Pledge furniture polish, and I&#x27;m really not fond of that scent.</li>
<li> and I guess that is why some  other deodorants haven&#x27;t worked for me, even the pricey ones.</li>
<li> Not as strong as the ones that have the bad stuff in them, but I can go through the day without smelling - not worried about 48hr coverage.</li>
<li> base that would be the &amp;#34;actual&amp;#34; bottom, while we enjoy all of the item that we actually purchased.</li>
<li> I chose the citrus scent, and it hasn&#x27;t let me down.  </li>
<li> it really is not better than any other product on the market and overpriced.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure that I will purchase this product again.</li>
<li> This review is coming from someone who usually uses a salt stick, so, take that into consideration.  </li>
<li> but at the bottom it fell apart even faster than is common with deodorants</li>
<li> Its subtle.</li>
<li> Update 7/30/15 - after a few months of using this product, my armpits started to itch REALLY bad and had a rash.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, it lasts about one hour.</li>
<li> The odor is a vague citrus/orange, and while not a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smelling orange, it is not objectionable.</li>
<li> but at almost 20 bucks it was just too expensive for me.  </li>
<li> Before I cast it forever out of my life, I must leave this sad review.</li>
<li> and i don&#x27;t smell bad at the end of the day.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too bad their deodorant is terrible.</li>
<li> I do not know of anything that I am allergic to, but this stuff gives me a terrible rash.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This has a pleasant citrus smell and has less chemicals than other deodorants. The price is competitive. I will keep using Every Man Jack.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the Every Man Jack products, but this deodorant offers zero odor protection whatsoever. It may smell nice, but that comes of no use midway through the day when you&#x27;re thinking that you may have forgotten to put your deodorant on. I cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> wanted this so I didn&#x27;t smell....didn&#x27;t work at all gave to hubby to use...</li>
    <li> It smells so good!  It also keeps me smelling good pretty well, and my job is pretty sweaty.  Love this, will buy again.</li>
    <li> It actually smells good, and I wanted to go natural and pesticide free. BUT I HAVE TO APPLY EVERY 4-5 HOURS!! Otherwise I start smelling. And that doesn&#x27;t happen with my old one. I can apply the old one once and it will stay on all day. CLEAN!</li>
    <li> The only natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve used that actually works, love this stuff and love to not be using an aluminum based product.</li>
    <li> I got this deodorant at Whole Foods just out of curiosity. I can say that for me it has worked very well. Applied in the morning and haven&#x27;t had to reapply thereafter. I understand that the chemistry is different for all of us and I guess that is why some  other deodorants haven&#x27;t worked for me, even the pricey ones. The citrus smell on this one is awesome, very fresh and masculine. I think that it is worth to give it a try.</li>
    <li> This is just deodorant, not antiperspirant. So you still will sweat, and the smell only stays for about an hour. Then you&#x27;re kinda left sticky. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the very best &amp;#34;aluminum free&amp;#34; deodorant / antiperspirant  I have ever used. I&#x27;ve tried several all natural deodorants and none have lived up to my expectations. This deodorant lasts all day and is extremely comfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this product it was because I love everything else Every Man Jack makes. I honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to work. Not only did it work. It nearly outperformed my &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; deodorant /antiperspirant. The only difference between the two is I will need to reapply after getting home from work if I&#x27;m going out after work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is we are all different and I don&#x27;t know if what works for me will work for you. However, if you want to try aluminum free deodorant, you should give this one a shot. I bet you&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
    <li> Bought this first at the store.  I find the odor control to be great.  No nasty ingredients.  And love the scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an especially sweaty person, but this brand really didn&#x27;t work for me. I thought things were going well until my girlfriend told me I need to reconsider my deodorant brand. Perhaps if you are hippy enough, you won&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> Update 7/30/15 - after a few months of using this product, my armpits started to itch REALLY bad and had a rash.  Once I stopped using this product the problem went away,  I can&#x27;t recommend this product anymore.  I started my move away from aluminum based anti persperint a couple years ago.  I started with Malin and Goetz deodorant that worked well enough but at almost 20 bucks it was just too expensive for me.  I then went to atoms of Maine brand and while it worked, it ran out of steam fast protection wise.  I gave this a try and it works well for a decent price.  Works longer than atoms brand with a pleasant smell.  I always smell after a workout and toms left me smelling &amp;#34;Amish&amp;#34; which didn&#x27;t matter, I am working it after all.  EMJ seems to be a decent product that doesn&#x27;t smell to girly and goes on easy after a shower.  I would recommend this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have had two sticks of this deodorant - both of them melted within a week, rendering them unusable.  The price is high, but it seemed like a good product at first.  If you only leave it in your bathroom - it still may be.  However, I can say from experience that leaving a stick in your gym bag in your car (even in cool Colorado), or putting it in your suitcase in a car trunk in California, will melt the whole thing in a short amount of time.  These are not extreme temperatures, just regular travel issues that kill the product.  I understand making things natural, but they need to be functional too - and this product is not up to snuff.</li>
    <li> This review is coming from someone who usually uses a salt stick, so, take that into consideration.  Anyway, I love this deodorant! The salt stick is sort of iffy depending on my diet, so I wanted something that was aluminum-free but still able to protect me when my diet veered from raw vegetarian consumption, to one that was more carnivorous.  I chose the citrus scent, and it hasn&#x27;t let me down.  The scent is quite strong at first but the good thing about that is that the scent is still there by the end of the day; it&#x27;s nice.  This is definitely my new favourite deodorant, and I look forward to trying out some of the other scents later on.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy the scent on this stick. Its subtle. Stick lasts a long time, glides on easily. Tiny tiny bit of residue on shirts but nothing noticeable.</li>
    <li> An outstanding natural deodorant with a very pleasant aroma and excellent protection. The folks at Every Man Jack have outdone themselves with this amazing product.</li>
    <li> It works great for me. I&#x27;ve worn it while working outside on my cars and i don&#x27;t smell bad at the end of the day. I used to use the regular speed stick deodorants but i want to get away from the chemicals.</li>
    <li> This product scent does not last very long after applying and still irritates underarm areas.  Based on their claims it really is not better than any other product on the market and overpriced.</li>
    <li> No aluminum, parabens, and so forth and the scent is good.  Not as strong as the ones that have the bad stuff in them, but I can go through the day without smelling - not worried about 48hr coverage.</li>
    <li> Got this to go with some citrus shampoo / body wash we bought from Whole Foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every Man Jack has a snarky tone on its labels — e.g., &amp;#34;Will this product take away the pain? Depends on your childhood.&amp;#34; — without the hyper-sexualized adolescent BS of Axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odor was fine, performance was OK ... but at the bottom it fell apart even faster than is common with deodorants: a significant chunk ended up being detached from the housing, from the thing where you push it up *just* a bit too far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A solution for all these products would be to have a 1/4&amp;#34; base that would be the &amp;#34;actual&amp;#34; bottom, while we enjoy all of the item that we actually purchased.</li>
    <li> Works for me. I use several products from EMJ and I like them all. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. The scent is okay. It smells like orange Pledge furniture polish, and I&#x27;m really not fond of that scent. As far as its deodorizing capabilities, it&#x27;s just okay. It&#x27;s definitely a twice a day deodorant. I didn&#x27;t stink to the point of being able to smell myself or disgust others with my smell, but by the end of the day, my armpits stank. If you don&#x27;t run around smelling your armpits or sticking them in other people&#x27;s faces all day, you&#x27;ll probably be fine. I&#x27;m not sure that I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I smelled it in the store and loved it but the deodorant protection doesn&#x27;t last for more than a few hours.  Before I cast it forever out of my life, I must leave this sad review.</li>
    <li> Excellent, non-irritating deodorant. The odor is a vague citrus/orange, and while not a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smelling orange, it is not objectionable.</li>
    <li> My son loves this Deodorant!</li>
    <li> Well, it smells pretty good. I picked up a stick of the red Every Man Jack, but I smelled this one as well and both were nice. Unfortunately, it lasts about one hour. In fact, if you add water to it, it sort of foams up. Kind of makes me wonder if this is just some kind of shampoo stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, well, it lasts for about an hour or so, and if you happen to sweat into it, it foams kinda. Not my greatest purchase.</li>
    <li> Good stuff although it doesn&#x27;t lather much</li>
    <li> I do not know of anything that I am allergic to, but this stuff gives me a terrible rash.  I tried it more than once to see if I would get used to it.  That&#x27;s not happening; I gave up.  And like the others said, based on the smell after a couple hours you wonder if you put it on at all.  For me though, the rash is a very helpful reminder that I did in fact put it on.  I guess I&#x27;ll just stick with my Old Spice Red Zone.  Every Man Jack face wash is amazing.  It&#x27;s too bad their deodorant is terrible.</li>
    <li> I was using an Old Spice deodorant before this and this works at least as well, and smells better. EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep gives it a pretty good rating.</li>
