<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it, but ordered three and received one!!</li>
    <li> Why pay for a bottle of water to wash with? Seemed like a waste of money right up there with buying bottled water. But whatever is added to this makes my skin feel clean and soft with no drying. It seems more economical than face wipes (even factoring in the cost of cotton balls or pads). I&#x27;ve tried other simple products and like that they tend to have fewer and less artificial ingredients. A surprisingly good product.</li>
    <li> Perhaps this cleanses. It is the consistency of water. It does not foam or suds up. Perhaps my face is being cleansed and nourished. It does not feel like it.</li>
    <li> It does what it says, helps clean your face and is nice to your skin but I&#x27;m not sold on the practicality of this product. Seems like there are other makeup removal products that are more convenient, less wasteful, and less expensive.</li>
    <li> This cleanser does a good job, but you have to like the way it works and I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is applied with a cotton pad and wiped across your face to remove makeup and dirt, etc.  For some reason, this doesn&#x27;t feel good to me. This is a matter of personal preference, not the quality of this product.  My face got clean but I didn&#x27;t like feeling as though I still had cleanser on my face.  I prefer the cleansers you put on your face and then wipe off with a warm wet washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, lots of people use cleanser exactly like this one and love the way they work.  For those people -- especially those with sensitive skin -- this will work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are concerned by the name of the product that this is just water -- it arrived in sub-zero weather and sat on my porch all day yet was not frozen when I brought the package inside.  So it obviously is more than just regular water.</li>
    <li> This product says it removes makeup.  I used in on my eyes at the end of the day and it stung.  It also did not remove my wateproof shadows or mascara.  It did remove my foundation and it took about 7 cotton balls to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be a coincidence but I broke out the following day each time I used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think for me this is more like a gentle toner than a makeup remover.  There are other Simple products that I have not tried that are specificallly designed to remove eye makeup.  This one stung my eyes when I used it.</li>
    <li> I use this product at night when I just want  to clean my face and feel refreshed before bed.  I use a stronger cleanser and moisturizer in the morning.  Using this at night you manage to cleanse your face much more than with water itself and it keeps you from having to use a product that may overdry.  You simply coat a cotton ball and wipe it all over your face.  There is no need to rinse and my face feels fully cleansed after use.  I am a guy and it suits me fine.  I don&#x27;t know how it would work for a woman seeking to remove make-up as well as cleanse.  If you are in need of a simple product to gently cleanse your face this may work for you.  You don&#x27;t get a deep cleanse mind you but a rather a simple touch up of clean.  A little pricey but may suit your needs.</li>
    <li> Effective and gentle.  Great for contact lens wearers who have trouble with oil based eye makeup removers damaging lenses.</li>
    <li> I love Simple products, and regularly use their cleansers and moisturizers. I prefer to thoroughly wash my face before bed, but sometimes I get home late from work or just feel tired and lazy and want to remove my makeup quickly. Usually, in this case, I would use one of the Simple facial wipes. Since this product is similar, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. The directions say to use a cotton pad, but I didn&#x27;t want to purchase an extra product, so I just used extra large cotton balls. I saturated the cotton balls with the cleaning water, and wiped off my makeup. Surprisingly, it only took one cotton ball, using both sides. The product feels very fresh and gentle on my sensitive skin. It reminds me a lot of toner, but without the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; from the alcohol. It&#x27;s quite a pleasant feeling.This product would also be useful for camping, and I prefer it to the facial wipes. Unfortunately though, I&#x27;ll have to stick to facial wipes for airline travel as the cleansing water is too large to take in a carry-on.</li>
    <li> I would like this product a lot more if it didn&#x27;t have a strange scent after a few seconds of use.  Does the job and price is great but the odor is really off-putting.</li>
    <li> Micellar water seems to be a trendy new phrase used to market skin care treatments specifically cleansers and makeup removers.  Chemically a micelle is apparently a&amp;#34;microscopic cluster of oil molecules suspended in water.&amp;#34;  These micelles are somehow good at trapping small quantities of oil and that makes them useful for removing makeup.Thus beauty/makeup companies are now manufacturing and selling micellar water concoctions.  Added benefits of micellar water for skin care is it is alcohol and soap free making it mild enough for the most sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this Micellar water does not clog my skin or flare my adult acne/rosacea I can not say it is a super effective cleanser either.  I don&#x27;t use a lot of makeup but it took quite a bit of this product to remove the little I occasionally wear.  It appears to be odorless and does have soothing, hydrating qualities.  Apparently micellar water has been commonly used in France for years but has just recently become well known in the U.S.  I found it to be OK but it will probably not be something I will be regularly purchasing.</li>
    <li> It does what ir supposed to do- i am still at comparison stage with the previous one</li>
    <li> I had never heard of Micellar facial cleansers before, but apparently they are all rage in Europe and among fashion and makeup professionals(for years). I applied the Simple Cleansing Water using cotton (real) balls. I don&#x27;t think a cloth will work best to apply to the skin. I am absolutely fascinated by this type of product esp. since it seems to be a secret from mainstream US women. Although it really does look and feel like applying water, the ingredients do more than just water alone.  I am still testing this on my face using a cotton ball with tap water on one side and the Simple Cleansing Water on the other. So far, I honestly cannot feel or see a difference, except after 3 passes with the water and cotton ball, the Micellar water and cotton ball still took more dirt/make up off the water side. I want to test this longer and also post more info on what micellar water is and how it&#x27;s supposed to work. In the meantime,here&#x27;s a list of ingredients, in order, from my bottle of Simple Cleansing Water (it says &amp;#34;No Harsh Chemicals,&amp;#34; but rest assured, it contains chemicals):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;water (agua), hexylene glycol,  glycerin, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, pathenol, niacinamide, sodium ascorbyl phosphate, PEG-6 caprylic/capric glycerides, dmdm hydantoin, cetrimonium chloride, tetrasodium EDTA, citric acid, potassium chloride, sodium chloride, iodopropynyl butylcabamate</li>
    <li> This literally SWIPES your makeup off</li>
    <li> Product works as detailed. I don&#x27;t use it daily, and only when I&#x27;m without water to wash my face. The only drawback is the high price, thus limited usage.</li>
    <li> This is so gentle on my face for cleaning!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. A facial cleaning product that refreshes without fuss. So great for sensitive skin leaving your face hydrated and soft. Yea!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage girls to use to cleanse their faces.  It is so easy to use, they were so happy to have it.  You put a little on a cotton pad and wipe your face, and it does a great job of removing dirt and make-up. Very soothing product and micellar water is great for skin. Perfect for the whole family!</li>
    <li> I started looking for micellar water and after seeing a post on a beauty blog about how it&#x27;s the best, easiest cleanser you can use, and all of the French women use it and have fantastic skin. I couldn&#x27;t find any of my local stores so I turned Amazon and voilà there it was, ranging  in price from approximately five dollars a bottle up to $20-$30 a bottle. I&#x27;m fairly frugal so I went low-end and bought the simple water and after using it for a month I am very pleased with it. I simply saturate some flat cotton  pads with the micellar water and rub the pads across my face, and all my make up is removed. I don&#x27;t wear a ton of make up, but I do wear bareMinerals powder foundation, and Christian Dior mascara. Both products came off very easily with the micellar water. It feels like tapwater; there&#x27;s no fragrance to it and it doesn&#x27;t foam up which took some getting used to, but it gets my face 90% clean, and I use it which is the best part of all. I&#x27;m one of those lazy gals that will sleep in my make up more often than not, but this stuff is so easy and effective that it was easy to work into my routine. Finding it in a three pack made it easy for me to stock up; if only it were available on Subscribe  and Save - then it would be perfect. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry you did.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. At 67 my skin feels clean and a bit plump after cleansing with Simple Cleansing Water and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to cleans your face.</li>
    <li> This product is very good:&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily&lt;br /&gt;- I can use it on my whole face (not just to remove make-up)&lt;br /&gt;- It cleans very well and gently and one time, I got some in my eye and it didn&#x27;t sting or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cotton pads work best (vs cotton balls). It does take more effort to remove mascara and heavier or darker make-up and thick eye-liner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently 6 months pregnant. Before I got pregnant I was using a toner with salicylic acid after cleansing. I found after reading online, that salicylic acid can be harmful to unborn babies when used topically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has also been more sensitive since&lt;br /&gt;becoming pregnant and I found that most toners were too dry on my skin due to the alcohol content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try the Simple cleansing water because this brand is known to be gentle on skin&lt;br /&gt;and free of chemicals and dyes .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m prone to breakouts, I always try a skin care product for 6 weeks before making conclusions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I&#x27;m almost finished with the bottle and I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m breakout free. I&#x27;ve had no irritation or dry skin either. I&#x27;m definitely repurchasing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice daily after washing with a mild cleanser.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really understand what this is supposed to be, but it does not work!  Bought it as a makeup remover and cleanser.  Is just a water that kind of removes makeup.  Not a replacement for any type of cleanser for sure!  Broke out my two daughter&#x27;s and I.  Basically useless now.  Good thing it was cheap!  Will not buy again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine to remove makeup, but not too replace your cleanser. There are better makeup removers out there so I don&#x27;t think I will be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, redness prone skin that is dry, itchy, and uncomfortable.I recently  started using this product after researching and all the latest hype about it. The micellar cleansing water contains chamomile which is excellant for calming irratated,  skin. For me, this product t is super gentle on my skin with no harsh ingrediants. It&#x27;s simple to use, just pure some on your palm, rub hands together then massage into skin. You do not need to rinse afterwards&lt;br /&gt;For me this product is my new cleanser. My skin is 90% less itchy and more comfortable. The 6.7 ounce bottle will last pretty long as you don&#x27;t need a whole lot. I&#x27;m so glad I tried this cleanser-it works beautifully  for me.&lt;br /&gt;If you have very sensitive, irratated  skin that is itchy I highly recommend Simple Cleansing Micellar Water. The chamomile will help calm and soothe your skin, if your not allergic to it.</li>
    <li> Remove makeup including mascara, will continue to buy</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Good and gentle.</li>
    <li> Removes makeup but does not remove mascara.  I like it since it does not leave my skin greasy like neutrogena, almay, rimmel, and garnier makeup remover products do.</li>
    <li> Great price. My secondary step in removing face and eye makeup and use it in place of a toner. Very effective in removing eyeliners (Haven&#x27;t tried it with waterproof).</li>
    <li> Easy to use and skin is left smooth</li>
    <li> I bought this as a dupe of the famed Bioderma cleanser, and I heard some good things about it, especially since it&#x27;s on the budget-friendly side. However, I wasn&#x27;t wowed by the performance of this product. It&#x27;s pretty gentle on the skin, but it&#x27;s ineffective against some of my waterproof makeup.  I haven&#x27;t seen much difference in terms of the quality of my skin (if anything, I&#x27;ve been getting more acne), but it could be because my skin is much more oily and sensitive during the summertime. It definitely is refreshing to put on after a long, hot day, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like anything more than a gentle makeup remover and maybe a toner to me.</li>
    <li> Love this cleaning water, I&#x27;ve been hoping a chemist or doctor would get this to market place. I have trouble, extreme trouble bending over or leaning forward to wash my face over a sink. I can&#x27;t properly wash it unless I&#x27;m sitting in a tub, and my very sensitive, oily, and 67 year-old wrinkly face needs many skin protecting products daily. So this is a life and face saver. So gentle feels so clean after each use.</li>
    <li> Micellar water is fantastic but I hate spending loads of money on the designer versions. As it gets more popular, prices have been increasing. Thankfully, Simple creates a very easy to use high quality and affordable version that I will be buying for years to come.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product. It did a nice job on my sensitive, combination skin. I don&#x27;t use soap on my face in general and chlorinated water can really do a number on my skin quickly. This stuff? Awesome. It cleaned up oils and dirt without leaving my skin feeling too tight or hot. In fact, my skin felt smooth and soft after every use. Over time, it smoothed out some problem areas on my skin. (I used cloths instead of cotton balls.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Don&#x27;t be fooled - it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;just water&amp;#34; and there are chemicals involved that you might be sensitive to. There&#x27;s another review that lists the ingredients.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- Mild&lt;br /&gt;- Feels clean&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to lift dirt well&lt;br /&gt;- Slightly toning&lt;br /&gt;- No harsh toner feel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- tiny bit of scent</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as my Bioderma Micellar Water. I have to use a lot of product to get even a little bit of makeup off. I initially purchased it because of the reasonable price but won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  With a few swipes of a cotton ball, my makeup is completely dissolved.  It&#x27;s a very simple way to remove the day&#x27;s dirt and grime without water.  I don&#x27;t know why, but I absolutely hate washing my face at night. But now, I can get rid of all traces of foundation, even mascara, with a few simple stokes of a cotton pad.  What a great invention.  My sensitive skin appreciates the fact that there are no harsh chemicals or preservatives or even fragrance in this magical liquid.  Even supposedly gentle skin cleansers make my face feel tight and dry, but not this stuff.  My face is clean and hydrated and ready for the night&#x27;s treatments.  However, I do rinse my face a couple of times with water, just to make sure everything is off.  I definitely recommend this micellar water for those with really sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s a godsend!</li>
    <li> Great!!! Would buy again, my bast cleasing water!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Seems so basic, but cleans without stinging and refreshes too. It replaces my old toner as it needs no rinsing. It&#x27;s more affordable too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Works great.</li>
    <li> This is super water for cleansing the face, it makes the skin feel clean and refreshed while not drying the skin as some cleansers do.</li>
    <li> Thought I would try one of the cleansing micellar products on the market. I would use it if I needed to cleanse my face during the day to reapply my makeup before going out for the evening. I would definitely not use it to cleanse at night - it doesn&#x27;t do a thorough enough job for that. My curiosity being satisfied, I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this product or any similar one of a different brand.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and it feels very clean after.</li>
    <li> This is super cool! You can use on your closed eye (I haven&#x27;t had any irritation) and actually does a great job removing waterproof mascara! I am not 100% ready to switch to a waterless face wash just yet, but it is in the rotation! Feels really night on the skin. It is a lot like using Ponds cream that takes off makeup without water, except more natural.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try micellar water but didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune. This is the perfect answer. It works great as a makeup remover and I like the feel of it. It does contain glycerin, which I never would have imagined, but I didn&#x27;t have any problems because of it. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> good, i guess? kinda just a regular ol&#x27; toner with the ability to wipe of residual makeup that my regular toner did anyway? decent price for fancy face water but i&#x27;d go with something more moisturizing if you have dry skin like me.</li>
    <li> It has really cut down on my breakouts. I tested it and found that it removed additional dirt after I&#x27;d already washed my face. Yay! Hidden dirt can suck it!</li>
    <li> Takes off my makeup fast and easily. Does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product. In drought stricken California i do not have to turn on the water in order to feel that my face is getting cleaned. I put it on cotton pads and wipe my face until the cotton pads are not dirty looking, it takes about 3 pads. And my skin is not dry or oily, but feels very smooth and does not have any negative reaction. Now i want to clean my face 2 times a day.</li>
    <li> It definitely removes makeup.  No stinging or redness. I like it just fine. I rated it a 4 because I don&#x27;t really think it hydrates. On the other hand it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of micellar water but kept reading about it everywhere. At this price, I had to try it! I have since used other brands and they all work great, but I like Simple because of the no fragrance. It really does get everything off your face - it&#x27;s better than regular makeup remover. It gets thick sunscreen off, the dirt from the day... it&#x27;s amazing! And you don&#x27;t have to use a ton of moisturizer after. I really think my combo skin is improving. I&#x27;m a convert!</li>
    <li> Great. Takes makeup off easily. Nice clean feeling on skin. Doesn&#x27;t sting eyes</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and it takes off ALL my makeup, including eye makeup. I was paying a lot more for cleansing pads from another brand, but this works even better at removing makeup and costs a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Best makeup remover ever!</li>
    <li> This &#x27;water&#x27; does a great job of removing my makeup without leaving any residue and stinging my eyes. My face looks and feels clean after use without any film. I am now purchasing my second bottle.</li>
    <li> This was just what I was hoping for! Sometimes I come home late and I don&#x27;t have the energy to do the whole nightly face routine, I just moisten a pad with this and it wipes off all my foundation eyeshadow eyeliner and mascara. My face feels pretty clean, best part is that I don;t even have to rinse. Having said that, this wont remove all your long wear eyeliner and waterproof mascara, it will remove most of it if you scrub but this was not designed to be an eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> I am a female in my 30&#x27;s, and I deal with oily skin, blackheads, and eczema. Most facial washes are too harsh for my skin and make the dry parts drier and the oil parts oilier. I use Lush products for face washes, but I was looking for something that I could use in between (or let&#x27;s face it...if I am too lazy to wash my face). This is my first time using a micellar water and I&#x27;m not that impressed. It removes some oil and leaves my face refreshed but my skin is oily and dirty looking only an hour later. I do not use make up so I cannot comment on how well this removes it, but I believe that it would do a decent job. I am no chemist who understands the ingredients on the back of the bottle, but there is something harsh in this product that strips my face completely of all oil. If you have normal skin then this product would probably be fine, but I will try one of the more expensive micellar waters made for oily skin next time.</li>
    <li> At first I really like it, because my face was still hydrated in the morning.  After about a week my skin started looking like leather with so much dead skin that I had to have a peel and it peeled and peeled and peeled and the esthetician told me my skin was extremely dry.  Used this in conjunction with their moisturizer for very dry skin! Totally changed my appearance, I looked ragged and old!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard about Micellar cleansers for a while, and finally decided to try one for my sensitive skin. I love this Simple Water; I find that it easily removes my makeup without any kind of irritation. While it says you can just use it and keep it moving, I tend to use rose water witch hazel to follow up as my toner; they seem to work very well together - again, no irritation. Additionally, the price point as compared to other micellar waters is great - a good product for half what other brands are charging!</li>
    <li> Has glycol, irritating.</li>
    <li> No harsh chemicals! Thanks for the quick shipping. Item as described. Picture as described. Great product! Would purchase from again!</li>
    <li> Great product. It cleans, yet doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel dry.</li>
    <li> This feels so nice to wash my face with. I use this and then use the moisturizer afterward. Makes my skin feel great!</li>
    <li> Stings my eyes.  Not sure this is a time saver.  Doesnt work any better than my face cleanser.</li>
    <li> Thoroughly removes all makeup. Very gentle on skin.  Have bought several times with no issues!</li>
    <li> Had read about thi s product in Woman&#x27;s Day, the price on Amazon was amazingly cheap so I ordered two. I am so glad I did.  This cleanser ROCKS!!!!!! My face was soooo smooth after one use.  I love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to wash it off.  It&#x27;s a one step. I am also trying out other items in the Simple line. Can&#x27;t wait.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard a lot about micellar water so I thought I&#x27;d try this variant given its affordability (under $4 on amazon... I&#x27;ve seen it for $8+ at drugstores). I just used it to take off my everyday makeup and it performed just as well if not better than most makeup removers I&#x27;ve used (such as Lancome, L&#x27;Oreal, and Sephora). It did a pretty darn good job of taking off the mascara and eyeliner, leaving just a bit of a trace that I think I could have gotten out if I&#x27;d wetted a fresh cotton pad and gone over it again. I guess at this point I&#x27;m kind of resigned to most removers leaving a bit of residue, but this one performed much better than most, and what&#x27;s more, left my skin feeling nice and hydrated without any gross residue. I haven&#x27;t used it for very long so I can&#x27;t speak to its effect on my skin over time, but so far so good!</li>
    <li> good for removing makeup</li>
    <li> I like this and it does take off all my NOT waterproof and NOT long-wearing cosmetics BUT it does not work well on any of my waterproof or long-wearing cosmetics - specifically my eye makeup (shadow, liner, mascara). I&#x27;ve had to use 4 soaked cotton rounds (2 for each eye) in order to get all of it off.  It is very gentle but I wish it worked on waterproof or long-wearing makeup; I don&#x27;t want to have to use this and another remover which is what I have to do.</li>
    <li> Leave my skin feels nice, but it doesn&#x27;t remove all my makeup.</li>
    <li> This is really nice cleansing water!  I pout a little bit onto gauze and then clean my face: around the eyes, forehead and even neck area.  For my normally oily skin, it does a pretty good job of getting rid of the oil without drying my face out like a warm washcloth can.  There is no funny smell and even wiping near my eyes, it does not sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Unilever product)</li>
    <li> Great product and an unbelievable price. My dry skin has been getting sensitive. I stripped my products back to the least drying and non-irritating products I could find. This is great stuff. It&#x27;s easy to use. (I recommend using cotton rounds to apply.) Leaves no residue, non-stripping and leaves my skin clean. A real find.</li>
    <li> Threw it away because it wasn&#x27;t worth returning. I really wanted to like this product. But it broke me out, I think mostly because it wasn&#x27;t taking make-up off completely? I had to use a lot of it to get off what little bit of face powder I use. I don&#x27;t use heavy liquid foundation or concealer, just a little powder, and this stuff just wasn&#x27;t cutting it. I&#x27;ll stick to Purpose soap.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how much I liked this product. At first I was disappointed because it is not a regular suds-up rinse-off cleanser. Instead you soak a cotton pad with the liquid, and then wipe it over your face - like a DIY facial wipe. The first time I used it, I thought &amp;#34;Is this doing anything?&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s fragrance-free and looks and feels like water. But it did actually make my skin feel clean and refreshed, and not irritated at all.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it as a makeup remover (my skin has been too sensitive for makeup recently) but I&#x27;m really enjoying this product. I&#x27;ve been using it in place of my usual facial cleansing wipes. I like that it&#x27;s pretty much one-step: cleanses, tones, and even hydrates too.</li>
    <li> I had to look up what &amp;#34;Micellar Water&amp;#34; is, and apparently it&#x27;s pretty trendy right now.  For me, this product works better in addition to my regular cleanser rather than a replacement for my regular cleanser.  It doesn&#x27;t quite get my makeup off on its own.  As a post-cleanser toner type thing, though, it works really well here in the winter months when an astringent is definitely too much for my skin, and most toners really need to be handled with caution to avoid over-drying and burning.  It&#x27;s a good alternative to toners and harsher cleansers for sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t have much makeup on.</li>
    <li> This is an interesting product. It is a cleanser with the consistency of water. Its base is water and it is refreshing. However, I needed to remove may makeup first since this does not remove it for me. It left my skin feeling nice but I could not tell if this gave me a deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;01/28 Update: I used this product to remove a water-based makeup foundation and it seemed to work much better. The makeup I wore when I first tried this was oil-based and much heavier, and therefore harder, to remove. My skin felt much nicer this time but I still do not like using cotton balls because they leave residue. I also used the Simple Moisturizer afterwards.</li>
    <li> Love this... it works as well as the ones that cost $30</li>
    <li> I actually really like this product. I use it after oil cleansing to double cleanse my sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t break me out which is awesome!</li>
    <li> This is awesome!!!! I highly recommend this product. I have a sensitive skin and this product works like a charm!!</li>
    <li> I love it! I bring it with me everywhere. Since I use a super gentle cleanser  it can sometimes feel like my pores aren&#x27;t as clean as they could be. I wanted to get a toner to use once in a while on my T-zone but I was afraid that would be too harsh. I looked for this brand&#x27;s toner but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, so I got this &amp;#34;cleansing water&amp;#34; to follow my cleanser instead. It&#x27;s so gentle that it&#x27;s pretty underwhelming when you first use it. It basically feels like putting expensive water on your face. Doesn&#x27;t have any smell and doesnt leave skin feeling dry, tight and shiny like a toner (which some people will appreciate and others will find disappointing, I suppose.) It&#x27;s actually pretty hydrating; I&#x27;ve only been using moisturizer like once a week since buying this. I love to see traces of makeup on the cotton ball that my face wash missed. If you use it regularly, it&#x27;s the gentlest way to keep pores squeaky clean without overdrying.</li>
    <li> Gentle cleanser. I use it for eye makeup remover. Maybe less residue than the standard eye makeup removers. Nice product but not revolutionary.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not even trying to remove makeup and my skin is not very oily these days but I&#x27;m  disappointed in this cleanser. I hoped it would replace the premoistened facial clensing towlettes that I&#x27;ve been using but it won&#x27;t. My face feels cleaner and better after swiping with a baby wipe than after using this product.  I went over my face twice, using two cotton balls and my skin felt like I had just used plain water. There is an odor too. Not that bad but not good (like witch hazel) either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few cleansing waters and when this came on the market I was really excited.  When I first started using it I noticed a tiny fragrance.  It&#x27;s not very noticeable and after a few days I didn&#x27;t smell it anymore.  I use this on the face, not on the eyes because it doesn&#x27;t work very well to remove eye makeup.  I have to use something a bit stronger.  However, it does get all my blush, bronzer, tinted moisturizer, etc off of my face.  I use a lot of eye makeup, as well as primer.  The packaging is nice but the opening at the top of the bottle is a bit too big for my taste.  It&#x27;s hard to control how much product comes out and I hate that.  I love micellar waters, and this one being readily available it a great thing.  However, I can&#x27;t wait for more to be available in the US.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been hearing about cleansing waters for a while, but hadn&#x27;t found an affordable one to try. Imagine my excitement when I came across this in the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m terrible about removing my makeup out of sheer laziness, so you can bet that I&#x27;m not the kind of person who will remove my makeup and then wash my face. No thanks! I also can&#x27;t stand the feeling of having any residue on my face (I&#x27;m talking to you, makeup wipes!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing. Just pour a generous amount on a cotton pad and wipe. It feels amazingly cool going on and does a great job at removing my makeup. I wear fairly light makeup - tinted moisturizer, blush, eyeshadow, eyeliner and mascara (not water proof) and I&#x27;ve never had any trouble. I use two cotton pads, one for my face and a second to remove eye makeup. I have never found anything that removes mascara better, and it doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product claims to be moisturizing, and while it doesn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s drying, I do still use a moisturizer after.</li>
    <li> BROKE ME OUT!  had high hopes in this product but it broke out my skin bad, after just 1 use! ended up giving it to my sister, which later her skin also broke out!</li>
    <li> Using this a makeup remover every couple of days.  Takes off makeup well (using with a cotton round).  What I like the most about this water is that it keeps the pH of the skin balanced, this way I can apply retin A afterwards.  Typically you are supposed to wait 20-30 mins after washing your face to apply retin A (something about the soap changing the pH of the skin).  I had a hard time doing this be/c 30 mins later, I was already asleep.  I only use retin A every other night, so that is when I try to use this cleansing water.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not drying at all. It really does get off all the make up off. I definitely go in with face wash afterwards but that&#x27;s just because I like to be super clean!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stomach shelling out for the luxury brands of micellar water, so I&#x27;m happy to find something that does the same thing for a significantly reduced price. I&#x27;ve had other cleansing products for sensitive skin leave my face feeling tight or irritated; this does not. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend just using this as the only cleansing product - I use it in the morning and to take off makeup.</li>
    <li> It does have an odd smell, not so fresh, but it is not a strong odor. I need to use a lot of this product to remove any eye makeup. Face makeup it does better. This doesn&#x27;t even come anywhere close to BioDerma for me. I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> This did not dry my skin out or irritate it (like other toners have). I can also wipe off mascara with it. I read about it in Fitness magazine and so far, so good!</li>
    <li> Love! Light, removes makeup fully without irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I have horribly dry skin on my face and it got worse over the summer. I decided to try this and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, that is perfect for sensitive skin..highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Cleans well, feels good.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say I will never wash my face again. I have been using this for a week and my skin is noticeably more even with hardly any redness. I thought I would miss that sqeaky clean feeling after using soap but my skin feels soft and clean! It&#x27;s quite refreshing to use after you have been sweating or just when you wake up or before bed. Before this if I used cetaphil and an acne medicated moisturizer... Now just this. I have sensitive combination skin that is acne prone on the nose and chin with red cheeks so I basically have the trifecta of bad skin. I&#x27;m excited to see what my skin looks like after a month of using this since I have such a good result after one week!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to have discovered this product. I like to use this to remove my makeup instead of makeup wipes. I also like to use it after I wash my face to get rid of any makeup or residue left on my face that my face wash didn&#x27;t get. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my skin and it leaves my face feeling fresh. It&#x27;s really hard to find good cleansing water here in the US. I wish all US makeup companies would hurry up and get on the cleansing water band wagon because I love the stuff. My favorites are by Bioderma and Garnier but they are only available in stores is Europe and Asia. I can usually find some Amazon but the prices are so inflated. So glad to have found this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> works so well!! I got mine later than expected though</li>
    <li> I tried this as it is getting rave reviews. Unfortunately, it did more harm than good on my particular skin type (dry/sensitive). It clearly says &amp;#34;no need to rinse&amp;#34; on the package. After three days of use, it had built up on my skin to the point of tackiness. My skin did not feel &amp;#34;clean and hydrated&amp;#34;; rather the opposite. I suffered such severe break-outs that I ended up at my dermatologist&#x27;s office. The package was not sealed nor was the bottle so I&#x27;m not really sure if it was contaminated some way. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product my makeup comes of within a couple swipes and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of micellar water, and used a couple of bottles of Bioderma.  I gave this a try because of the rave reviews and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper.  Firstly, this thing does not remove waterproof makeup well, like liquid eyeliner and mascara.  You will be tugging at your eyes trying to get rid of all the product.  Secondly, it really doesn&#x27;t do anything more in terms of removing makeup than a toner.  I don&#x27;t think this cleans or hydrates my face to the point where I don&#x27;t feel the need to wash my face with water and cleanser.  With Bioderma, my skin feels really clean.  Simple definitely has a tackiness and &#x27;film&#x27; to it that Bioderma does not have.  I will finish this bottle and use it like a toner, but won&#x27;t purchase anymore.  The one thing I hate the most is that the top does not screw off.  You have to flip the lid open and then hope droplets fall onto your cotton pad.  Obviously, if you are not so agile, you get droplets on your vanity, and it drips over the side of the bottle which I hate.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this cleanser! I have had mixed results with other Simple products so I was a bit skeptical before trying this but it works wonderfully! My face doesn&#x27;t have that tight itchy feeling after using it like it does when I use some other cleansers and water. It is so convenient, even better than cleansing cloths because this bottle should last you a lot longer than an average size package of those. You just put a few squirts of this cleanser on a cotton pad and you&#x27;re good to go. Wipe it gently around you face, neck, and eyes, just as you do a cleansing cloth! I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Interesting! I had not herd of &#x27;Micellar waters&#x27; before, but it really isn&#x27;t as ridiculous as it sounds. It removes makeup and cleanses skin without the use of water. You don&#x27;t even have to rinse it off, which is nice since it includes vitamins that might be helpful if they stay on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to use. My skin felt nice and soft, not at all tight. It removed makeup, including eyeliner. I don&#x27;t use mascara, so I don&#x27;t know if it removes it or not. I didn&#x27;t feel it necessary to wash the cleansing water off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current routine is to use an exfoliant followed by a cleanser at least once a week. The rest of the time I just use a cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to use the micellar cleansing water for travel, because I never trust the water in hotels. It&#x27;s also refreshing, so in the summer I may keep it in the refrigerator.</li>
    <li> Takes off make-up quickly!</li>
    <li> Really love this in the morning to rinse while I have no make up on. So nice not having to use water but getting my face just as clean. Will definitely be buying again!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  By the time I go to bed I&#x27;m so sleepy I don&#x27;t always go through a good beauty routine.  I leave a bottle of this by my bed and a few wiped and I&#x27;m done..........so easy!  It does leave your face feeling a little sticky but not that noticeable.  What I have noticed is the tightening feeling which I DO like because at 65 I need all the tightening I can get ;-}!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: When I bought this it was $5.97 and now when I go to order another one it&#x27;s $11.90 THAT&#x27;S $.04 LESS THAN DOUBLE!!&lt;br /&gt;SHAME ON THE SELLER!!</li>
    <li> I loooove this! Its so weird its just like water but it removes all my makeup. It does not burn my eyes at all and gets off mascara and evrything. But please do not buy this for $16.99 ! It is only $5.99 at Walmart.</li>
    <li> Wow, I was so pleasantly surprised by this cleanser, it is so gentle on my skin, and doesn&#x27;t have that strong astringent feel that a lot of other makeup removing products have. I liked using it just for cleaning my face in the morning and evening as well, I could see the grime on the cleaning pad after using it. Impressive results so far, leaving my skin feeling much less dry and naturally clean than with other similar products.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product.  it works excellent for removing make-up and eliminates extra steps.  With this product you can remove your make-up and clean your face at the same time.  There is no need to wash or rinse your face afterwards.  For a mom of two, this is a plus.  Makes for quick and easy make-up removal and cleansing.  Leaves your face feeling nice afterwards and doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of perfume smells.</li>
    <li> My son and I have been using Simple cleansing water for about a week and we both love it.  The first time I used it I had already washed my face and was very surprised to see the cotton ball dirty from what my face wash left behind.  I have normal skin, my son has very oily skin, it cleans great for the both of us.  I also now use it to take all of my makeup off.  I love that it gets everything off (including mascara) with just a few swipes of the cotton ball.  Best of all my old makeup remover used to sting my eyes, Simple cleansing water does not.  This will definitely replace my face wash and my sons soap.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Before I got this item, I had never heard of Micellar water before.  I went online and what the articles said intrigued me and I wanted to try it.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I have sensitive, dry skin with more than occasional bouts of Rosacea.  On top of that I tend to be somewhat lazy about skincare in the evenings since most days  I don’t wear makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have used the product for one week and this is what I found so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It is quick and easy to use.  Just pour a generous amount onto a cotton pad and wipe all over the face except for the eye area&lt;br /&gt;2. It does remove oil and dirt very well as well as make up, which I wore on one of the days&lt;br /&gt;3. It is mild and feels nice on the skin&lt;br /&gt;4. Gives a “tingly” feeling&lt;br /&gt;5. You don’t need water and actually should not follow it up with water&lt;br /&gt;6. It’s a cleanser and tone in one&lt;br /&gt;7. Portable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. It has vitamin C in it which is usually very good for the skin but in my case because of the Rosacea it seems to irritate just a little&lt;br /&gt;2. You still need eye makeup remover since it can’t be used on the eye area&lt;br /&gt;3. It might be more costly than you want because one uses quite a bit per day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I think it’s a great product for on the go, late evenings and a quick freshener for those going out evenings straight from the office.  For travel (check luggage only) it’s a practical cleanser since you don’t need to pack makeup remover and toner.&lt;br /&gt;For myself, I think I will go back to my regular routine of using mild soap and water which seems to work better for my Rosacea.  But I will definitely keep this for my upcoming travel and for those lazy evenings.</li>
    <li> After reading in several magazines that this stuff works wonders, I decided to try it myself. I do have to say after using the micellar water for a few weeks, my skin is very soft and my rosecea seems to be improving. Will continue using this and recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have no end of facial care products and use them religiously. People always comment on my beautiful skin. Then I read an article on how French women never use tap water on their faces. Only &amp;#34;micellar&amp;#34; water, whatever that means! I ordered some from the Simple brand as I like their products and boy was I surprised. I can throw out everything else, except daytime and nighttime moisturizers. This water feels soft, no rinsing and leaves skin super soft! The only reason I use daytime moisturizer is for the SPF. I would not have believed it but it works! Face dirt, gone. Eye makeup, gone. Now, in the vein of full disclosure, I usually only wear the moisturizer, gel blush, eyebrow gel and lipstick. No liquid or other foundation. But that&#x27;s the beauty of good skin - you don&#x27;t need it! I did wear mascara one night when we went out but this product creamed right through it. Gone with a swipe. This is amazing and I will never touch MY face with tap water again. Oh, one more thing. I am an adult woman with slightly dry skin. I can&#x27;t vouch for acne prone or otherwise troubled skin.</li>
    <li> Very gentle cleanser. I use this on a cotton round to remove my waterproof eye makeup. Removes it like a charm with no harsh chemicals or rubbing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ambivalent about this product, so I am going to list the positives of my experience and the potential negatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive:&lt;br /&gt;-Feels nice and cooling on skin.&lt;br /&gt;-Had no reaction to this product whatsoever (and my skin is incredibly sensitive).&lt;br /&gt;-Free from perfumes or dyes.&lt;br /&gt;-Did remove all of my make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potential negatives:&lt;br /&gt;-Even though I wear Bare Minerals, it still require way too much product and cotton pads to remove my make-up (until the pad was completely clean when I wiped it across my face). This could end up being a little costly (?).&lt;br /&gt;-Funky fragrance (my boyfriend said I smell like fresh-cut grass ... I thought it smelled a little medicinal).&lt;br /&gt;-A slightly weird coating on my face (barely perceptible).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit of a Clarisonic addict, so I think I miss the exfoliating aspect of cleansing my face. However, if one has exceptionally sensitive skin, this may prove to be a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I like this wash very much.  It is exactly what it says..Simple cleaning for Simple skin care.  It leaves my skin very clean, takes off my makeup easily and wipes of mascara quickly.  Very little on a cotton ball is all you need to clean off the makeup so this is not only wonderful for the skin, but easy on the wallet too! I use this Simple Cleansing Water for skin washing and Coconut Oil for moisturizing and a dab of mascara, lip gloss and off I go in the morning.  Simply Simple for incredible skin care!  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Years ago, I gave up toner as part of my skincare routine.  I didn&#x27;t like that extra step. Needless to say, I&#x27;m probably not getting my face completely clean using soap and water; there may be traces of makeup around my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product eliminates that problem. I&#x27;d never heard of Micellar water before. Apparently, I&#x27;ve really been missing out.  It&#x27;s not at all oily; it isn&#x27;t a harsh astringent either, but it effectively removes makeup. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on that, I give the product five stars.  The reason I ultimately gave it four stars is I&#x27;m just not willing to go through that many cotton pads every night. It has nothing to do with the effectiveness of the product. It&#x27;s about the time spent using cotton pads/amount of product used to remove makeup versus two minutes with a Clarisonic or just soap and water. At least with the Clarisonic, I feel like I&#x27;m getting a little exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are a heavy makeup wearer, this method takes a little extra time, a lot of product and a fair amount of cotton pads. If you are a tinted moisturizer type of person, this may be a great product for you.  I do like the option of using this on extra cold nights because it is so gentle. For non-makeup days, this is probably quicker than a soap and water wash.</li>
    <li> I came to this product as ignorant of what micellar water is as many others - and was unimpressed after use on myself.  I did NOT get the tingle left on my skin that feels so refreshing that others did. There was no trace of dirt on the cotton afterward though I&#x27;d been sure there should have been. I didn&#x27;t feel hydrated. I had my young daughter use it with her lush 16 year old skin and she immediately liked it and described a feeling akin to what I feel after a refreshing toner. I note she also used it as eye make up remover and later I was to see that some reviewers say it&#x27;s not for that: however it only takes a moments research to see it&#x27;s often advertised as being excellent for eye makeup removal. It&#x27;s a given that none of us are going to open our eyes wide while using  ANYthing to remove make up. So, is it an age thing or a skin thing with many of us having such different experiences, it&#x27;s as if we&#x27;re using different products. I&#x27;d say  - based on my daughter&#x27;s appreciation of it - give it a try. Maybe this will end up being what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and so far have been able to use this product without any irritation. It works well to remove makeup and has a pleasant odor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never seen a product like this, so had to give it a try.  First off, I&#x27;m 61, and still have a bit of the oily T-zone going on.  I&#x27;m not sensitive to smells, or most products, but would guess, that if smells bother you, there&#x27;s not much scent in this product.  What I found, is that with one cotton ball, I can clean off my face at night, then put on my night time face creams. Another way that I&#x27;ll enjoy this product, is for the days, where my face feels oily and needs washing, but too early in the day, to wipe off my eye makeup.  Works great that way, wipe off the face makeup and oiliness, then reapply only face makeup.&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like and will not use this product for again, is cleaning my face in the morning.  I gave it a try, and within 2 hours, couldn&#x27;t stand the feel or look of my face, so washed up with my regular face soap and warm water.  Another problem with not using water in the morning, was the way my eyes felt.  I need to refresh my eye area with a splash of water.&lt;br /&gt;So, for night time, and on the go, or midday washes, great. First thing in the morning, a big NO!</li>
    <li> Got this cleansing water for wife to try.  She has semi sensitive skin.  She said this cleaner is very gentle and comfortable on the skin for make-up removal.  But since it is very gentle, it takes a few tries before all the make is visibly removed.</li>
    <li> It works better than a makeup remover and leaves your skin fresh and clean. The best part is, you don&#x27;t even need to wash your face after.</li>
    <li> Removes make up, dirt, oil and grim while leaving skin soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I first heard about Micellar water in a Refinery 29 blog, where they reviewed several products, including this terrific offering from Simple. Over the years my skin has become increasingly sensitive, and I despaired of ever finding products that would not irritate my already stressed skin. Simple Micellar water not only lives up to its claims (safely and gently cleansing skin without the need to rinse, and it even removes make-up), it is a STEAL at $7. Other Micellar waters sell for 3 or 4 times the price. I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> This product does a great job cleaning the skin without drying it out.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of the product to clean my face.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Apparently, micellar water is very popular for years among make-up artists in the fashion industry in Europe. Micellar water uses tiny micelle particles suspended in the water to remove make-up, sebum and impurities from the skin. It is designed to be simply swept away with a cotton ball, without having to rinse with water. It is very gentle to the skin since it is free of soap, alcohol or other harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a comparison, I applied the Simple Cleansing water with a cotton ball to remove the makeup on my left face and normal water on the right face. I didn&#x27;t feel much of a difference between the two, perhaps just a slight tingling sensation with the micellar water but it went away quickly. After 3-4 wipes, The cotton ball dabbed with the micelluar water seemed to have more makeup / dirt on it than the one with normal water. There was no redness nor irritation in my face neither. I felt my face was clean and moist, without the need to rinse it further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the cleansing power of this product. It has no artificial fragrance and is virtually scentless. It is easy to use, very effective in make-up removal or general cleansing, and yet very gentle on the skin. Great product.</li>
    <li> Really like how it breaks up the makeup and cleans my face. Only being using it a short time but seems to live up to the claims of the benefits of the micellar water. Easily cleans the mascara without hurting my eyes and avoids the more oily feel I get from other eye makeup removers - even the oil-free ones. My skin feels refreshed and clean. Will see how my skin responds over time...that&#x27;s the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this after reading an article about it and how wonderful it is. I have horrible blackheads on my nose.  I have been using this for a little under a week and have noticed they are less of them. That alone makes this worth the money  to me. My face feels very clean and slightly cool after I use this. I will buy this again once it is gone.</li>
    <li> This product works really well.  I&#x27;ve tried some other Simple products that I didn&#x27;t like very much, but this is an affordable cleanser that does what it says at a much cheaper price than other brands that do the same thing!  I use it to take off eye makeup and to make sure there are no more traces of makeup after I&#x27;ve washed my face.  I will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> I picked this up at Walgreens on an impulse, because I had heard how great micellar water can be for sensitive skin, including skin affected by rosacea. It is supposed to be a gentler alternative to harsh cleansers that can leave skin irritated and stripped of its natural moisture. This sounded like the perfect solution for me. I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, and when I do, I remove it with oil first. I used the Simple micellar water either on a bare face or right after rinsing and patting off my cleansing oil. I will say that this cleansing water is good at actually cleansing my skin. It removed dirt and leftover oil from my skin without a problem. However, it also made my skin very irritated, red, and blotchy. It didn&#x27;t feel gentle at all, even if I rinsed it off instead of letting it sit on my skin as suggested. Of course, everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but I tried it over 5 different times and had the same results. The redness would last into the next day, so I would have to keep my skin extra moisturized in an effort to repair it. I also ended up breaking out in small whiteheads from it. I looked into some other micellar waters and it seems that there are more gentle ones out there, which I will be trying next. Hopefully I have better success with them than with the Simple micellar water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars is because it&#x27;s okay as a 2nd step to remove my eye makeup. I put oil on it first, massage to dissolve it, then swipe it off with micellar water. It works better than just water. But it does NOT remove makeup by itself as it says on the bottle.</li>
    <li> Read the description of the product. It&#x27;s for hydrating, cleansing, and makeup removal. Just because it looks like a toner, it does not have any of the drying or astringent properties of a toner.  I have very dry skin and I am on my third bottle of this.  It does a really good job of removing makeup.  I use it in conjunction with makeup removing wipes, eye makeup remover, then the micellar water to take off all of their chemicals and re-hydrate. Like another remover, I typically have not liked other Simple products that I&#x27;ve tried, but I have added this to my regular skin care routine.  It doesn&#x27;t make my skin tingle at all, since another reviewer said that, and it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes unless you get a lot directly in your eye.  It seems very gentle, unlike a toner.</li>
    <li> Does remove impurities but nothing that any other product couldn&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> I was really pleasantly surprised at how well the Simple Cleansing Water works.  I followed the directions and used a cotton pad and my makeup removed with just one swipe of the pad.  While there was a slight odor to the water, it was not unpleasant and it did not linger.  After cleansing my face, my skin felt nicely refreshed.  The actual product had a cool feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally use Neutrogena make up cleansing pads and those leave a slightly greasy feel to my skin after use; the Simple Cleansing Water does not.  I am really pleased with this product and plan to use it in the future instead of the product that I currently use.  I like the way it feels as I use it and after I have used it.  I recommend it for makeup removal or times when you want to clean your face without using soap and water.</li>
    <li> I received a full size sample of this product in the mail right before Christmas and it has completely changed the way I take care of my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I have combination/oily skin and am extremely prone to acne, alternating between periods of severe and mild breakouts. I use this product as my daily cleanser both morning and evening, followed by a mild BP Treatment or a retinol gel (usually once a week). Since switching to this product as my daily cleanser I have noticed a huge improvement in the texture and balance of my skin, it no longer get shiny or tight. It took about two weeks for my skin to get used to this product, but since then it has been great. Prior to this I used a salicylic acid face wash followed by a BP treatment and then a moisturizer, and while it worked to help my breakouts it left my skin unbalanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 5 stars for a few reasons. First of all it is simple and quick to use, all you need is a cotton ball/pad and 10 seconds. Secondly it cleans the skin thoroughly, you can see all the grime on your cotton ball afterwords. Lastly it has truly helped to balance my skin and break the cycle of drying and re-moisturizing, ultimately leading to less breakouts. I currently have no active spots, though I have plenty of healing spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the 5 stars there is one negative effect I&#x27;ve noticed. Since using this product I am more prone to blackheads than I have ever been in my life, most likely because I am not using a traditional daily wash/scrub. My remedy is to make sure I keep up with regular exfoliation to prevent dead skin build up, an easy fix with a hot wash cloth at the end of my shower. Needless to say it is worth  the extra 10 seconds to have clearer more balanced skin! I definitely recommend this product, try it! You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I only recently heard of micellar water and its cleansing abilities.  I was intrigued.  I originally saw it on a site that had a high end version for about $20. Are the different brands that much different from each other?  I had my doubts, so I went to Amazon and looked at a variety of different brands--some inexpensive like Simple, others upwards of $20.  I was still on the fence until I saw a buy one, get one 50% off in the Simple brand  at CVS and decided to give it a whirl.  I bought two of them and then put it to the test.  As others have stated in the reviews of this brand (and others as well), they weren&#x27;t sure it did as well in getting makeup off as hoped.  Many felt their usual cleanser did a better job or that it takes too many passes with cotton balls to get all their makeup off.  So I decided to try it in the morning instead when I am usually in a hurry, have only moisturizers on from the night before, and wouldn&#x27;t be as likely to have plugged up pores or breakouts from it.  So far I love it.  It definitely saves me time and also leaves my face feeling clean and soft.  I do rinse it with tepid water after using it just to make sure that the residue won&#x27;t break me out.  I just feel better doing it that way.  I&#x27;ve found it still leaves my face feeling smooth and soft even with rinsing with the tap water.  Since I take my shower in the evenings, it&#x27;s no biggy to wash my face in there, so mornings is best for me.  I did notice a few clogged pores yesterday after using this for a solid week, so now after washing with the micellar water, I swipe on some toner with salicylic acid 2% on my oily t-zone.  I want to continue to use this water because I find it so easy and my face feels so soft afterwards.  I&#x27;ll just have to see if the pore issue becomes a real problem or not.  I have Rosacea and very sensitive skin and find this product very gentle on my face.  I have not noticed any odor at all as yet and haven&#x27;t had any problems when I wipe my eyes with the cotton ball (though I&#x27;m especially careful).  Also, I have not used it to take my makeup off, so I can&#x27;t speak to how well it would work for that (but one of these days I&#x27;ll try it and see if it will do a good job or not).  I&#x27;m getting 2 more bottles on Amazon now to continue my trial.  As some have said, you do use a lot of this as you are supposed to really saturate the cotton balls so that you don&#x27;t have to rub too hard to remove the oils (makeup, etc.).  After one week daily use, I have about 1/3 of the bottle left.  I do recommend exfoliating your face with a gentle product at least a couple of times a week to get rid of any dead skin cells which is good practice no matter how you clean your face.  A product with lactic acid is a good choice for sensitive skin.  Should plugged up pores or breakouts become a problem over time, I&#x27;ll update this review.  As of now I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Removes makeup SO easily with no scent, no residue....use on a cotton pad and makeup melts off.  Sometime after I wash my face I use this and the amount of makeup that comes off AFTER washing is very surprising!  When I&#x27;m lazy I do this instead of washing and I end up feeling cleaner.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
    <li> I wear full coverage, long-wearing foundation, and I had to use about 5 cotton balls to remove it. It doesn&#x27;t do anything to waterproof eyeliner. I had to scrub to remove my non-waterproof mascara. My skin was red and dry afterwards. I&#x27;ll stick to the Dermalogica Precleanse which is spendy, but so gentle it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Bought this at my grocery store and I love it. I have oily, acne prone skin and this cleanses it without leaving it feeling stripped. I have not had any breakouts and my skin is looking more luminous and it seems to also be cleaning up my pores slowly. I like it better than the prescription soap I have been using for like 10 years on my face to control the acne. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much residue is left from your make-up and this gentle cleaner works!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Removes all make-up gently.</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;m lucky because I have skin that is not sensitive to anything and usually I don&#x27;t break out. I am part caucasian and part native american so I have a bit of color in my skin. I love this product so far, I use the 100% cotton rounds and it seems to remove my foundation with no problem. I use Retin-A and have used the Micellar Water in the morning when I wake up to remove it and again at night to clean my face before applying the Retin-A and I think it&#x27;s doing a great job. I can use one or two rounds to remove makeup and then a third to check and make sure it&#x27;s gone, if the round stays clean then I feel confident that my face is clean. I haven&#x27;t experienced any tingling, but then again, I don&#x27;t have even the slightest bit of sensitive skin. I can see how this bottle is going to last a long time, it&#x27;s really a great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Super gentle, no stinky smell and my skin looks great!</li>
    <li> You can find this a few dollars cheaper in an actual drug store. But, it is lovely that it is so affordable and moisturizing it is.</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser.  I use it to remove makeup (including eye makeup) and to tone.  It is really gentle and I like it a lot.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This has been great so far.  My face feels really clean and refreshed.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and it&#x27;s become a staple in my beauty routine. I use it at night after I wash my face with Purity. Purity is great, but sometimes I feel like I need that extra level of clean. I put a few squirts on a cotton round and wipe around my face. I do not use this to remove eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and this neither dries me out nor makes me oilier - it just leaves my skin feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how often you use it, it&#x27;s inexpensive. One bottle has lasted me 2+ months and that&#x27;s with daily 1x use and sometimes more.&lt;br /&gt;No harsh chemicals and free of artificial perfumes and dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;None that I can think of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from being a part of my nightly routine I also love that I can use this on the go to give my face a quick wash. This came with me to the beach, waterparks and on hiking trips this summer. I&#x27;ve tried portable wipes in the past and they always leave me feeling oily or like there&#x27;s residue on my skin. This doesn&#x27;t do that - you just feel cleansed and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin, so I was shocked when I used this product and my eyes swelled shut.</li>
</ol>
