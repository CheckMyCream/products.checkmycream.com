      <li>Thrilled to find this quality (100% shea butter) at this price.</li>
      <li>great and cool.</li>
      <li>They really do seem to stand by this product and expect their customers to be pleased, which I take as a very good sign.</li>
      <li>I love the shea butter.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also been impressed by the communication I&#x27;ve received from African Skin Solutions.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Excellent product and outstanding customer service.</li>
      <li>Will surely buy again when it gets over for me or</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this!</li>
      <li>My areas of concern are heals and elbows; this is where I use the shea butter on to make sure that I stay moist.</li>
      <li>I use it on my hands mostly, being it is winter now</li>
      <li>Shea Butter is safe for all ages and is non toxic.</li>
      <li>I love this particular shea butter and am very satisfied with the product!</li>
      <li>This is a very nice, high grade Shea Butter!</li>
      <li>I guess if you needed a plain shea butter for your own purposes this would be the best product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s is a great product for those of you like myself with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Shea Butter of this quality does a magnificent job on rough and scaly skin.  </li>
      <li>Keeps skin moisturized all day, no smell, spreads easily.</li>
      <li>It applies easily and keeps my skin feeling hydrated all day.</li>
      <li>I love how it gets absorbed very quickly without a layer of greasy lotion laying on top.  </li>
      <li>but without causing a smell that is not too strong.  </li>
      <li>I get excited putting it on because my skin is starting to get beautiful again.</li>
      <li>Gotta on smoothly and it isn&#x27;t greasy, which is important to me.</li>
      <li>And, the light fragrance reminds me of cocoa butter.</li>
      <li>Once I had received the product, a friendly follow up</li>
      <li>Works great on heels and dry skin also...</li>
      <li>I will also put it on my hair the night before I wash it; and, if I have fly away hairs after washing my hair, I dab a little shea on them to tame them down.&lt;br /&gt;Great, great product!</li>
      <li>Finally found a great pure Shea Butter.  </li>
      <li>Helped with my mild psoriasis.</li>
      <li>There is no unpleasant odor</li>
      <li>Great product... Extremely moisturizing!</li>
      <li>I am ready to re-order!!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how amazing my skin will look in a few more weeks...</li>
      <li>This is my third order of shea butter by this company so this should help make the product appear as credible and a highly likable item for others to consider.</li>
      <li>Once applied and absorbed into the skin there is virtually no odor.</li>
      <li>This is the best for all the dry skin and dry spots all over your body.  </li>
      <li>Unrefined and 100% pure!</li>
      <li>: I received one or more of the products mentioned above in exchange for review.</li>
      <li>It smells and its very oily!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s works very well and not greasy!  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It is absolutely silky smooth and soft feeling!</li>
      <li>One other very important fact is that this product is manufactured right here in the United States of America.  </li>
      <li>Medications are the thing that makes me seek other ways to stay smooth and free from cracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
      <li>as an ER Nurse always looking for something that is strong enough to combat chapped hands...</li>
      <li>For anyone who is not bothered by this, I&#x27;m fairly certain this will keep your skin hydrated.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I understand that numerous applications are necessary to continue to keep the skin soft and supple but I felt a remarkable difference in just one application.</li>
      <li>I have used refined Shea butter before but never a raw, unrefined Shea, and am extremely pleased with the African Skin Solutions product.</li>
      <li>There wasn&#x27;t much of a smell</li>
      <li>I have tried just about everything for my psoriasis and nothing helps much.</li>
      <li>This is the real Shea butter I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 months and while it is working very well</li>
      <li>I put a small amount on my hair the night before washing, and the results are amazing.</li>
      <li>After only a short time, I love this product.</li>
      <li>This shea butter purports to be of very high quality, and indeed, after repeated use my impression is that it moisturizes as well as a much more expensive product I have been very pleased with, that product containing a high percentage of shea butter but still falling far short of 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Being Certified Grade A you must also realize that this product has an expiration date for its effectiveness but that only proves the purity of this product.</li>
      <li>It is also important that the African Skin Solutions Shea butter is tested and rated grade A by the American Shea Butter Institute...not all are.</li>
      <li>and I was completely blown away!  </li>
      <li>My skin has never felt and looked so soft!</li>
      <li>Other than just that minor thing, I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>and I apply to my 4C hair and it makes it so soft.  </li>
      <li>This product is not absorbed particularly quickly.</li>
      <li>and I can already see a major difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>this product is 100% shea butter, there are no other ingredients that might mitigate the inherent oiliness of the butter.</li>
      <li>For me moisture is key in my life for my skin to look and feel alive.</li>
      <li>Be aware that this creme is hard and thick to be able to do what it does.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Oh, this is very nice. You take a little bit and let it melt in your hand and then you apply it - I use it on my hands mostly, being it is winter now and they feel dry - non-greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;This also works well if you have essential oils and wish to make a small container of scented shea butter. There are recipes out there - anyhow, I am happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I never write any reviews but I had to write a review for this product. I&#x27;ve been using this Shea butter for only a few days and I can already see a major difference in my skin. I get excited putting it on because my skin is starting to get beautiful again. Thank God I follow my instinct and bought this brand even though its a little expensive but its all worth it. I can&#x27;t imagine how amazing my skin will look in a few more weeks...im ecstatic!!!</li>
    <li> Great product... Extremely moisturizing!</li>
    <li> I love the shea butter.  It&#x27;s works very well and not greasy!  I will order this product again!</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing !!!! My feet were fully cracked but just one use made drastic change, not to mention subsequent uses. My dad&#x27;s hand started getting too dry and cracking a lot. I gave this to him and he loved it somuch that he told me he is keeping it ( he never asks for anything from anyone ). I was so happy and ordered another one for me. Will surely buy again when it gets over for me or my dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, it doesn&#x27;t smell very good. You need to get used to it to start liking it.</li>
    <li> I love that this product when worked into my lower legs keeps them moisturized all day !</li>
    <li> great and cool. i like it</li>
    <li> For me moisture is key in my life for my skin to look and feel alive. In the past I have lotions but they just are not getting down to my skin and leaving it feeling right. My areas of concern are heals and elbows; this is where I use the shea butter on to make sure that I stay moist. Medications are the thing that makes me seek other ways to stay smooth and free from cracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received one or more of the products mentioned above in exchange for review.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and well packaged. Shea Butter of this quality does a magnificent job on rough and scaly skin.  I understand that numerous applications are necessary to continue to keep the skin soft and supple but I felt a remarkable difference in just one application. Once applied and absorbed into the skin there is virtually no odor. Being Certified Grade A you must also realize that this product has an expiration date for its effectiveness but that only proves the purity of this product. Shea Butter is safe for all ages and is non toxic. One other very important fact is that this product is manufactured right here in the United States of America.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Just bought this for some very bad skin problems. Thrilled to find this quality (100% shea butter) at this price. An elbow, raw and discolored for years (and getting worse as I get older) responded well to this stuff, leaving a smoother surface and soothing the pain of broken skin after just one application. Be aware that this creme is hard and thick to be able to do what it does.</li>
    <li> When I saw this product I was so excited to try it!!!  Unrefined and 100% pure! There is nothing better than that! It was beautifully packaged and safety sealed. I opened the jar and took a smell. There wasn&#x27;t much of a smell so I reached in and got some to try on my hands. It is absolutely silky smooth and soft feeling! This is definitely a product to keep close for daily use! I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Great product! Helped with my mild psoriasis. Keeps skin moisturized all day, no smell, spreads easily. I am definitely a fan and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Loved it!  A little goes a long way.  I mix it with Jojoba oil and I apply to my 4C hair and it makes it so soft.  I use it for my entire body.  It&#x27;s is a great product for those of you like myself with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This shea butter purports to be of very high quality, and indeed, after repeated use my impression is that it moisturizes as well as a much more expensive product I have been very pleased with, that product containing a high percentage of shea butter but still falling far short of 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the instructions indicate, a very small amount will cover a large area. I recommend this product without hesitation for people who are looking to, in effect, repair notably dry skin (e.g. heels) and plan to use this product as a dry skin preventative in the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this product is 100% shea butter, there are no other ingredients that might mitigate the inherent oiliness of the butter. For this reason, I am slightly hesitant to recommend this as an everyday, all-over moisturizer for people who are averse to sporting a bit of an oily sheen. This product is not absorbed particularly quickly. For anyone who is not bothered by this, I&#x27;m fairly certain this will keep your skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been impressed by the communication I&#x27;ve received from African Skin Solutions. They really do seem to stand by this product and expect their customers to be pleased, which I take as a very good sign.</li>
    <li> AMAZING..as an ER Nurse always looking for something that is strong enough to combat chapped hands...but without causing a smell that is not too strong.  Works great on heels and dry skin also...definitely will be a staple</li>
    <li> I love this particular shea butter and am very satisfied with the product! Once I had received the product, a friendly follow up e-mail had occurred by the owner of the company, which by the way was welcomed. This is my third order of shea butter by this company so this should help make the product appear as credible and a highly likable item for others to consider.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, high grade Shea Butter! My skin has never felt and looked so soft! I really enjoy this! This puts any and all lotions to shame!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for a non-biased and honest review!</li>
    <li> Great product! Just as described!  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Finally found a great pure Shea Butter.  This is the best for all the dry skin and dry spots all over your body.  I even use a little for my face.  This is one jar I will continue to buy over and over again.</li>
    <li> Nice lotion. Gotta on smoothly and it isn&#x27;t greasy, which is important to me. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell, but it isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s most-likely just the smell of the shea butter. Other than just that minor thing, I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I could not wait to try this shea butter and I was completely blown away!  It is creamy and rich and smells wonderful!  I love how it gets absorbed very quickly without a layer of greasy lotion laying on top.  I am in love with this wonderful cream!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like this product. It smells and its very oily!</li>
    <li> Great product! I have tried just about everything for my psoriasis and nothing helps much. This shea butter has helped greatly reduce the redness and irritation on my hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on making soaps with it as well!</li>
    <li> It helps with my dry skin but I can&#x27;t use it on my face.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Excellent product and outstanding customer service. All of the rave reviews are well deserved. I have used refined Shea butter before but never a raw, unrefined Shea, and am extremely pleased with the African Skin Solutions product. It applies easily and keeps my skin feeling hydrated all day. There is no unpleasant odor and it is not greasy. It is also important that the African Skin Solutions Shea butter is tested and rated grade A by the American Shea Butter Institute...not all are.</li>
    <li> This is the real Shea butter I was looking for.  It doesn&#x27;t smell great but the results are great.  I use it for my dry and thinning hair. I put a small amount on my hair the night before washing, and the results are amazing.</li>
    <li> I put on at night and is the only thing I know that will last several days and keep my skin from flaking and getting itching.Good product. Have bought several times</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 months and while it is working very well, I don&#x27;t see a performance difference between this (expensive) product and the cheaper palmer&#x27;s shea butter. Plamer&#x27;s has a more pleasant scent too. I guess if you needed a plain shea butter for your own purposes this would be the best product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is part of my total body care regime. I use it morning and evening on my face (with no break-outs) and neck, lips, and feet. Also, I use it after my shower in the morning. It is not greasy and feels wonderfully soothing! And, the light fragrance reminds me of cocoa butter. I will also put it on my hair the night before I wash it; and, if I have fly away hairs after washing my hair, I dab a little shea on them to tame them down.&lt;br /&gt;Great, great product! I am ready to re-order!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> After only a short time, I love this product. Absorbs well and feels great on your skin. Will buy again!</li>
