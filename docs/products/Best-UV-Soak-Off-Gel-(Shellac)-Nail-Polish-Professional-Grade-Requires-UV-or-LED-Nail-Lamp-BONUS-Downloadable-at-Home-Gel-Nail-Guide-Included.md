      <li>It is amazing!</li>
      <li>This polish is amazing!</li>
      <li>It is good for about a day and that is all.</li>
      <li>Y&#x27;all I have a sensational gel nail polish starter kit from Wal-Mart, I followed the directions that came with that but used this heart breaker polish in place of what came with my kit.</li>
      <li>beautiful, easy to use,</li>
      <li>I love the color changing aspect of it!</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>otherwise, i love it!</li>
      <li>it is absolutely amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good quality and the brush is even better than what I have gotten in the stores.</li>
      <li>It stayed on nicely</li>
      <li>My daughter loved it and bought more colors.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to end up collecting the whole set in no time :D</li>
      <li>The color is nice and the polish does change in hot/cold temperatures BUT the polish peels off extremely easy.</li>
      <li>The color change is so prominent and immediate.</li>
      <li>I love this polish.  </li>
      <li>The nail polish is a lot more reactive than I thought it would be.  </li>
      <li>love it!&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how responsive it would be to change in temperature...</li>
      <li>Very fun gel polish!  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to order more colors, it is truly unique!</li>
      <li>I attached pictures of what each color stage looks like: warm, changing, and cool.</li>
      <li>Just a heads up, it comes out as the cool color and changes to the warm after it is cured.</li>
      <li>Very cool product.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this color and brand, it is a very good quality and lasts a long time!</li>
      <li>At first I was worried the formula was too chunky but it went on nice and smoothly.</li>
      <li>These color changing gels are so much fun!  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>This is one of those things that&#x27;s too good to be true but its not, this was better than an expected.</li>
      <li>: waiting the 2 or more weeks before trying another color LOL not really a con but haven&#x27;t found an real con ;)</li>
      <li>its super fun.</li>
      <li>Long lasting and beautiful color change!</li>
      <li>Now, she has so much fun</li>
      <li>We went to the water park and had so much fun playing with our nails in line, we sometimes forgot about the wait.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>This is so cool, I always get surprised when my nail polish changes colors.</li>
      <li>she forgets how much she hates working in that department, lol.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>I received my package last Saturday and ordered 3 (Heartbreaker, Pink Frost, and Classic Galaxy) and immediately applied Heartbreaker and Pink Frost to my nails and love them! :</li>
      <li>: no glue smell, watch it change as you apply it (cool feature), applies smooth, true rich colors, can use with other polishes (I use gelish base and sally hansen top), doesn&#x27;t burn or heat up curing, and long lasting.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a subtle beautiful pink color</li>
      <li>It takes a few steps, a uv light,  time and patience</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m slightly obsessed with this polish and have made several additional purchases for friends who love it too!!  </li>
      <li>The only issue I have is that in between when it is hot (bright light pink) and cold (black)</li>
      <li>So I love black nail polish, my daughter-in-law loves pink, here we have both at the same time on the same nail.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really get the black tips though.</li>

<li> a thin coat then 90 s on the uv lamp applied the 2nd thin coat again in the lamp then top coat and done!</li>
<li> It was a little hard to see if I was getting any on my skin, but really had no issues.</li>

<li> it has small glitters and big glitters too.</li>
<li> I will buy the other colors no doubt about it.</li>
<li> It was black in the bottle and on the brush but turned pink as I applied it.</li>
<li> Putting it on was a breeze (I used my Gelish top and base).</li>
<li> Since is a little bit thicker</li>
<li> So far we have both had them on for 2 weeks, no chipping or lifting, mine show signs of needing a fill in soon (weird never got there before).</li>
<li> And the polish became very thick and chunky.</li>
<li> Bad stuff.</li>
<li> but when my nails get cold either from a drink, washing, or even the beach water they change color!</li>

    <li> I love the color changing aspect of it! it has small glitters and big glitters too. its super fun. The only issue I have is that in between when it is hot (bright light pink) and cold (black) the transitioning color is a kindof brown. otherwise, i love it!</li>
    <li> Peels off in 24hours. And the polish became very thick and chunky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it 6 stars if I could. This is one of those things that&#x27;s too good to be true but its not, this was better than an expected. I will buy the other colors no doubt about it.</li>
    <li> Wow! This is a great product! At first I was worried the formula was too chunky but it went on nice and smoothly. Just a heads up, it comes out as the cool color and changes to the warm after it is cured. I am so happy with the look and the color change. I attached pictures of what each color stage looks like: warm, changing, and cool. I want to buy all the colors to try now!</li>
    <li> I loved it! Works perfectly! !  Since is a little bit thicker I applied 1st a thin coat then 90 s on the uv lamp applied the 2nd thin coat again in the lamp then top coat and done! 😊  I&#x27;m very happy with this product! !</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and matched description</li>
    <li> I love this polish.  The nail polish is a lot more reactive than I thought it would be.  I&#x27;m slightly obsessed with this polish and have made several additional purchases for friends who love it too!!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite polishes!!</li>
    <li> So I love black nail polish, my daughter-in-law loves pink, here we have both at the same time on the same nail.&lt;br /&gt;So beautiful, easy to use, just wonderful. We went to the water park and had so much fun playing with our nails in line, we sometimes forgot about the wait. And everyone around us did too!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter-in-law works at a grocery store, and sometimes is assigned to the freezer department. Now, she has so much fun watching her nails change color she forgets how much she hates working in that department, lol.&lt;br /&gt;I had so much trouble with regular nail polish chipping that once I found gels, it was hard for me to keep them on until they NEEDED changing, with these its much easier, I play to much. So far we have both had them on for 2 weeks, no chipping or lifting, mine show signs of needing a fill in soon (weird never got there before). Will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> Very cool product.  My daughter loved it and bought more colors.</li>
    <li> This polish is amazing! I received my package last Saturday and ordered 3 (Heartbreaker, Pink Frost, and Classic Galaxy) and immediately applied Heartbreaker and Pink Frost to my nails and love them! :D&lt;br /&gt;Pros: no glue smell, watch it change as you apply it (cool feature), applies smooth, true rich colors, can use with other polishes (I use gelish base and sally hansen top), doesn&#x27;t burn or heat up curing, and long lasting. It&#x27;s day 5 for me and no chipping! ;) love it!&lt;br /&gt;Cons: waiting the 2 or more weeks before trying another color LOL not really a con but haven&#x27;t found an real con ;)</li>
    <li> Saw this polish on Chickettes.com and had to try it! I got Heartbreaker. I&#x27;ve used color changing polish before, but not gel polish. I wasn&#x27;t sure how responsive it would be to change in temperature...it is absolutely amazing. Putting it on was a breeze (I used my Gelish top and base). It was black in the bottle and on the brush but turned pink as I applied it. It was a little hard to see if I was getting any on my skin, but really had no issues. I used maybe 2.5 coats for opacity. The glitter was not sparse and didn&#x27;t require any dabbing to get an even appearance. The color change is so prominent and immediate. Can&#x27;t wait to order more colors, it is truly unique!</li>
    <li> Long lasting and beautiful color change!</li>
    <li> Just got it in yesterday. Y&#x27;all I have a sensational gel nail polish starter kit from Wal-Mart, I followed the directions that came with that but used this heart breaker polish in place of what came with my kit. It is amazing! It&#x27;s such a subtle beautiful pink color but when my nails get cold either from a drink, washing, or even the beach water they change color! It&#x27;s good quality and the brush is even better than what I have gotten in the stores. I&#x27;d reccomend this for anyone who understands how to do gel polish. It takes a few steps, a uv light,  time and patience but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Don&#x27;t really get the black tips though. Either your whole nail is pink, or you whole nail is black when your hands are cold.</li>
    <li> These color changing gels are so much fun!  I&#x27;ve got a feeling I&#x27;m going to end up collecting the whole set in no time :D</li>
    <li> The color is nice and the polish does change in hot/cold temperatures BUT the polish peels off extremely easy. It is good for about a day and that is all.</li>
