<li> Lasts a long time.</li>
<li> Long time user.</li>
<li> If you want a wetter look apply it to nearly dry/damp hair, but I usually apply it to dry hair.  </li>
<li> This is the only pomade/paste type product I&#x27;ve used daily for the past 15 years.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t make my blonde hair look wet and doesn&#x27;t have a stiff hold.  </li>
<li> Use only small amount and on dry hair</li>
<li> I also use some other products, but this is the finishing touch --sort of like highlights on a painting.  </li>
<li> While it&#x27;s expensive, you don&#x27;t have to use much.  </li>
<li> but my hair doesn&#x27;t get stiff or sticky.</li>
<li> But this last batch is too thick, hard to get out of the tube and icky to put in my hair.</li>
<li> residue on your scalp can cause hairloss and itching.. which is scary and annoying.</li>

    <li> I have used this paste for over 15 years. Nothing else works as good as this for styling and holding my hair. Never a sticky feel.</li>
    <li> Favorite product, sorry I have to hunt for it on Amazon as it&#x27;s been discontined</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and i really like the natural feeling once the paste is put in. But this last batch is too thick, hard to get out of the tube and icky to put in my hair. Somehow the formula has changed and i don&#x27;t like it much. Will look for a new product or consider this a fluke?? i don&#x27;t know...</li>
    <li> I have the cowlick from Hell that Aquage has tamed and put into its intended place.  No other product that I have tried over the years has even come close.</li>
    <li> I wish I could find this locally.  I love this product!  It provides good hold but my hair doesn&#x27;t get stiff or sticky.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for YEARS.  It&#x27;s thicker than some but very versatile.  It&#x27;s great for &amp;#34;piecey&amp;#34; styles and short hair.  I use it every day and I probably get compliments on my hair almost every day.  I also use some other products, but this is the finishing touch --sort of like highlights on a painting.  I don&#x27;t ever want to go without this product.  Haven&#x27;t ever found anything else quite like it.  While it&#x27;s expensive, you don&#x27;t have to use much.  And you can make your hair look good on bad hair days.</li>
    <li> This is the only pomade/paste type product I&#x27;ve used daily for the past 15 years.  It doesn&#x27;t make my blonde hair look wet and doesn&#x27;t have a stiff hold.

    <li> I have tried many gels/ creme&#x27;s till one day .my hair dresser recommended this product. Well the best part of this is.. that it comes off easily when you wash your hair.. no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any residue on your scalp can cause hairloss and itching.. which is scary and annoying. This ones doesn&#x27;t, it comes off easily when you wash your hair .. so it seems like this will be the paste for me till I find anything better. !</li>
    <li> Love this.  Just the texture I was looking for.  A must have for short hair!  Doesn&#x27;t take much.  Will purchase again....and again!</li>
    <li> This little tube has become indispensable for me. It&#x27;s light years ahead of other styling products I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t leave a weird residue, has a pleasant smell, and most importantly of all, does its job really well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Best ever for texture!</li>
    <li> For the price, doesn&#x27;t provide more than less costly similar items.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Im so glad I found it  at amazon.</li>
