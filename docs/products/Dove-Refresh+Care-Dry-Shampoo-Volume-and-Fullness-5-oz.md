### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>this is an awesome product!</li>
      <li>Love it!!!</li>
      <li>Great product for volumizing your hair without drying it out and making it brittle.</li>
      <li>I like Dove products and find them generally great basics for my skin and hair.  </li>
      <li>It was a great purchase.</li>
      <li>Smells great, leave hair bouncy and shiny.</li>
      <li>Great for styling.</li>
      <li>This mousse is a good product.  </li>
      <li>Good product just make sure yours is intact when you get it!</li>
      <li>The scent is light and pleasant.</li>
      <li>It is very good and leaves hair smooth and full of body.  </li>
      <li>I am alwasy on a look out for something to give my hair the appearnace of more body</li>
      <li>when my favorite mousse was no longer produced I tried this one.  </li>
      <li>It gives it a great texture and makes it easier to blow-dry straight.  </li>
      <li>It is my favorite product for managing frizz.</li>
      <li>so I thought I&#x27;d be more generous.</li>
      <li>but it seemed like more of a hassle to try and return it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Tresemme which I think does a much better job of adding volume to my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this before and love the volume it gives but</li>
      <li>I wish Dove would come up with something more streamlined for packaging.</li>
      <li>I have used many high priced volumnizing mousse and this by far is the best.</li>
      <li>the only good thing was it was inexpensive....</li>
      <li>My hair is not as full as with the Dove mousse but looks a lot thicker which is what I am looking for.</li>
      <li>Like this very much!</li>
      <li>but overall it&#x27;s a pretty good mousse for every day use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure there is more than half the bottle remaining</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, not heavy in your hair.</li>
      <li>The product itself is ok, which is to say the actual Mousse product.</li>
      <li>Anyone interested can comment on this</li>
      <li>when I read the reviews of this product in a beauty mag I thought this would be the answer to my prayers.&lt;br /&gt;it stated you can spray in and then even let your hair dry naturally and it won&#x27;t be frizzy and your hair will dry wavy, like your best hair day at the beach, without frizz.</li>
      <li>Was able to manage to put it back on but does not foam very well.</li>
      <li>i put it on my thick hair and it makes it smooth,yet it adds amazing volume!</li>
      <li>I have fine hair which I wear short.</li>
      <li>well no such luck for my baby fine hair and the bottle sprayer doesn&#x27;t even work very well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have a lot of long, fine, naturally pretty straight hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like using too much because it makes my hair look like a statue</li>
      <li>Works very well...</li>
      <li>It is fantastic, but there definitely is an application method to be used for curly hair.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
      <li>This product is great for someone with thin hair.</li>
      <li>I think it would be too light to use a mousse for wash &amp; wear (no blow dry)</li>
      <li>after a few uses the whole top just came off.</li>
      <li>I like its mild and clean scent and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your hair,</li>
      <li>Anyone that uses products to give volume to fine limp hair knows that these products more often than not give hair a dry, unnatural feel.  </li>
      <li>it is ok  when i blow my hair dry but no difference than other mousses...</li>
      <li>I have 26\\&quot; naturally curly hair that is cut into layers,</li>
      <li>I used the previous version of Dove&#x27;s styling mousse for several years, but when I recently needed to buy more, this Nourishing Amplifier Mousse was on the shelves instead.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize this until much later - at first it was dispensing fine, just very slowly...</li>
      <li>This product makes it feel smooth and much less dry.  </li>
      <li>The formula feels similar in my hands but it doesn&#x27;t give me the soft curls I&#x27;ve become accustomed to with this mouse.</li>
      <li>I am left with soft, shiny manageable curls that I am complimented on all the time.  </li>
      <li>The top of the mousse was broken off.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not only did the dispenser break the second time I used it, making it harder to dispense, but it weighed my fine hair down so much it was flat.</li>
      <li>With fine hair, I have to wash it every day, but it would be heavy and feel really gross, especially on the sides of my head above my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is good for my hair, and helps styling a lot, but unfortunately, the pump broke before the bottle was empty.  </li>

<li> unlike other mousse I have tried where you have to apply a gob of it to your hair to hold it.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t confuss with the other styling mousse for curly hair.</li>
<li> You only need to use a small amount.</li>
<li> The lid is large &amp; awkward and the spout to get the product out is constantly falling off.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding this mouse at my local grocery store and pharmacy</li>
<li> and it just weighed it down.</li>
<li> While this is an amplifier mousse, I found it to be too heavy for my hair</li>
<li> I was wrong, it just made my hair look fluffy leaving lots of open spaces which I felt made it look even thinner</li>
<li> I have thin color treated hair and this product does not weigh it down..</li>
<li> This product is very thick and way too heavy.</li>
<li> The cans look alike,but it&#x27;s to heavy for thin hair.</li>
<li> However the canister arrived with the cap and foaming head broken off.</li>
<li> the can I got from Amazon arrived with a broken nozzle.</li>
<li> but it is now useless because I can&#x27;t get it out.</li>
<li> The packaging is awkward.</li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>
<li> very disappointed.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Absolutely one of the worst mousses I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>

    <li> While this is an amplifier mousse, I found it to be too heavy for my hair and it just weighed it down.</li>
    <li> This product works well and holds my hair in place all day without looking greasy or wet. It was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I have 26\\&quot; naturally curly hair that is cut into layers, when my favorite mousse was no longer produced I tried this one.  It is fantastic, but there definitely is an application method to be used for curly hair.  Anyone interested can comment on this and I&#x27;ll explain.  Once my hair dries there is a slight crunch to it, I simply crunch out the crunch, if that makes sense.  It does not leave any flakes and my hair never comes out frizzy unless I missed a spot when applying it. I am left with soft, shiny manageable curls that I am complimented on all the time.  I even have this item setup on auto delivery.</li>
    <li> I like Dove products and find them generally great basics for my skin and hair.  This mousse is a good product.  It has a firmer hold than the Nourishing Curls Mousse, also put out by the same brand.</li>
    <li> Anyone that uses products to give volume to fine limp hair knows that these products more often than not give hair a dry, unnatural feel.  The Dove Amplifier mousse does not do this.  My hair loves this stuff.  It&#x27;s bouncy and shiny when I use the mousse.  Please Dove, don&#x27;t ever stop making this.</li>
    <li> The top of the mousse was broken off. Can&#x27;t use the bottle. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Like fluffing the hair and all. But ah well. I kinda works on my sis. So w.e</li>
    <li> This product is very thick and way too heavy.</li>
    <li> I like its mild and clean scent and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your hair, unlike other mousse I have tried where you have to apply a gob of it to your hair to hold it.</li>
    <li> This product is great for someone with thin hair. It&#x27;s light, not heavy in your hair. Great for styling. Don&#x27;t confuss with the other styling mousse for curly hair. The cans look alike,but it&#x27;s to heavy for thin hair. Pat</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding this mouse at my local grocery store and pharmacy so I decided to buy it off of Amazon. The formula feels similar in my hands but it doesn&#x27;t give me the soft curls I&#x27;ve become accustomed to with this mouse.</li>
    <li> The product works well but the nozzle broke off the container making it a challenge to dispense the product each time I use it. I haven&#x27;t found this product on stores so I will have to reorder from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I would like to give the packaging on this product 2 stars but I actually like the product so I thought I&#x27;d be more generous. The packaging is awkward. The lid is large &amp; awkward and the spout to get the product out is constantly falling off. I wish Dove would come up with something more streamlined for packaging. I also don&#x27;t care for the smell of this product. Although it is a light smell, it&#x27;s not the standard Dove scent, which was disappointing. In fact, the smell is a bit &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do, however, like how the product works. I have a lot of long, fine, naturally pretty straight hair. It provides volume and control for when I blow dry. I think it would be too light to use a mousse for wash &amp; wear (no blow dry) but overall it&#x27;s a pretty good mousse for every day use.</li>
    <li> I used the previous version of Dove&#x27;s styling mousse for several years, but when I recently needed to buy more, this Nourishing Amplifier Mousse was on the shelves instead. Thinking it was just a packaging change and not a new product altogether, I bought it and used it for about a week before going out and buying something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did the dispenser break the second time I used it, making it harder to dispense, but it weighed my fine hair down so much it was flat.

    <li> This product is good for my hair, and helps styling a lot, but unfortunately, the pump broke before the bottle was empty.  I&#x27;m pretty sure there is more than half the bottle remaining but it is now useless because I can&#x27;t get it out.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading several reviews about how it made your hair look fuller. I have fine hair which I wear short. I am alwasy on a look out for something to give my hair the appearnace of more body and I thought this was it. I was wrong, it just made my hair look fluffy leaving lots of open spaces which I felt made it look even thinner andI had to use a ton of spray to keep it from going completely flat. I tried it several times and it seemed my only choices were puffy hair or flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Tresemme which I think does a much better job of adding volume to my hair. My hair is not as full as with the Dove mousse but looks a lot thicker which is what I am looking for.</li>
    <li> Works very well... I don&#x27;t like using too much because it makes my hair look like a statue but other than that it works as it says.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and love the volume it gives but the can I got from Amazon arrived with a broken nozzle. I didn&#x27;t realize this until much later - at first it was dispensing fine, just very slowly...after a few uses the whole top just came off. Good product just make sure yours is intact when you get it!</li>
    <li> It is very good and leaves hair smooth and full of body.  I would recommend it and purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Great product for volumizing your hair without drying it out and making it brittle. Smells great, leave hair bouncy and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have used many high priced volumnizing mousse and this by far is the best. I have thin color treated hair and this product does not weigh it down.. It gives my hair body and shine. You only need to use a small amount. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> when I read the reviews of this product in a beauty mag I thought this would be the answer to my prayers.&lt;br /&gt;it stated you can spray in and then even let your hair dry naturally and it won&#x27;t be frizzy and your hair will dry wavy, like your best hair day at the beach, without frizz. well no such luck for my baby fine hair and the bottle sprayer doesn&#x27;t even work very well.&lt;br /&gt;very very disappointed.  it is ok  when i blow my hair dry but no difference than other mousses... the only good thing was it was inexpensive....</li>
    <li> I have extra-frizzy, cotton-candy texture hair.  It is also dry and damaged.  This product makes it feel smooth and much less dry.  It gives it a great texture and makes it easier to blow-dry straight.  It still has volume.  It is my favorite product for managing frizz.</li>
    <li> I like that I only have to use a little bit to get the desired result. The scent is light and pleasant. Like this very much!</li>
    <li> The product itself is ok, which is to say the actual Mousse product. However the canister arrived with the cap and foaming head broken off. Was able to manage to put it back on but does not foam very well. Have to wrestle with it every morning to get it to foam correctly. Don&#x27;t like doing that but it seemed like more of a hassle to try and return it.</li>
    <li> this is an awesome product! i bout it from target and it was the same price. i put it on my thick hair and it makes it smooth,yet it adds amazing volume! defensively buy it!!!!!!!!!</li>
