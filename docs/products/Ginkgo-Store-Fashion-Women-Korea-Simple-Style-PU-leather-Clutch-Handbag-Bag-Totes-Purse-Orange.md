      <li>Smaller than I thought but good quality!</li>
      <li>Overall, a cute bag at a great price.</li>
      <li>The inside lining is cheap, but the color of the bag is nice and in season right now.</li>
      <li>This bag is too cute and exactly as pictured!</li>
      <li>The lining is cheap.</li>
      <li>It was great to hold all my stuff for a daytrip, and to carry my stuff to work and back.</li>
      <li>Cheap price.</li>
      <li>but if you see it actual not that  great.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s such a great size.</li>
      <li>all my accessories fit neatly inside so well.</li>
      <li>is cheap.</li>
      <li>Cheap material feels like rubber, would not order this bag again.</li>
      <li>The lining is crackly crinkly and makes a sound that&#x27;s like a baby toy that crackles.  </li>
      <li>Lovely color and the right size.</li>
      <li>Nice purse vibrant color</li>

      <li>Although very inexpensive, and the liner is plastic, not fabric, I am enjoying this purse for every day use.  </li>
      <li>I loved mine in red.</li>
      <li>It is rather sturdy and very pretty.</li>
      <li>Loved the outside, inside not so much!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for daily use.</li>
      <li>&quot; How this seller came up with their size description, you wonder if they really know how to measure their bags!!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> small purse not as big as I thought but cute</li>
    <li> This is so small it should be classified as a small purse.</li>
    <li> Magazines and iPad slip right in.  I got the orange tote.  It&#x27;s a summery sherbet color of orange.  The lining is crackly crinkly and makes a sound that&#x27;s like a baby toy that crackles.  Weird.  For the price it&#x27;s great and adds to my wardrobe.  I can take it out in the rain, to the beach, out with the toddlers and leave my nice bag at home.  The trim at the top is brown and white striped.  A little strange, but o.k.</li>
    <li> The color is awesome and the size is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zipper on the inside broke just weeks after purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But still love this purse.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised when I received this purse.  For the price I was not expecting much however, it turned out to be very nice.  No way does this look like a $200 purse but it serves it&#x27;s purpose.  Inside of the purse it has a nice center zip compartment to secure a wallet, along with a zip pocket in the one side and 2 open pockets on the other side.  IT is a very nice size, not overly large and looks very nice.  Have received many compliments on this bag and am thinking about getting another one in another color.  I had ordered the orange.</li>
    <li> LOVE this bag and will be ordering a couple more perfect size for everyday and with the pricing being so nice I can get one in every color if I choose to</li>
    <li> Loved the outside, inside not so much! Zipper broke on inside when first opened and the lining is very low quality. The lining is crackly...weird!</li>
    <li> I have had this bag since May, it is not falling apart at the seams, the stitching on the handle attachments are tearing and one of the side top corners is now starting to rip.  the inside zipper pull for the purse container broke.  loved it at first, but not so much now</li>
    <li> More orangy than I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Good bag and I love the color.</li>
    <li> Color nice, but it is not sturdy.  Not very happy with the material.  The design is very nice.  The faux material is too soft.</li>
    <li> Just got my orange tote. The sellers size description is absolutely off the actual size. Actual size is 12\\&quot; LengthX 8\\&quot; HeightX 5\\&quot;Deep and handle drop is 5\\&quot;. The sellers site description is 13.5\\&quot;Lx9.4\\&quot;Hx5.5D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can put a zero star I will.  Part of the seller&#x27;s response to me was \\&quot;AND OUR SIZE IS INCLUDING THE HANDLE, MAYBE A LITTLE CONFUSION OF IT, WE SAY SORRY TO BRING YOU THIS CONFUSION\\&quot;. Well, the bags height including the handle is 13\\&quot;--not 8\\&quot; How this seller came up with their size description, you wonder if they really know how to measure their bags!!  They have to learn the American way of measuring bags, they do business in America, right!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just think, the seller doesn&#x27;t pay for return label even though they know its their mistake, so the seller wants the customers to pay for their size description mistake!  All the seller has to do is be truthful in the way they do their business, and they wont have these problems. This seller should not bring their business practices in America.  This Tote is small, I don&#x27;t want it, but if I return it I have to pay for the shipping.</li>
    <li> I wanted a tote bag (not too big and not too small). I thought I would try this one and was quite surprised by how attractive it is.  Love the colour. Very rich and still elegant. I have had lots of compliments.  I would have preferred a pocket in the front but that&#x27;s just my preference. Otherwise it is a very nice bag.</li>
    <li> Love , love my little orange bag I can&#x27;t wait to order all the other colors. ..</li>
    <li> I like the bag, I love the color but gosh... It&#x27;s sooo small. I hope it doesn&#x27;t look too child like when I dress up with it :(  well I am looking foward to using it</li>
    <li> Cheap material feels like rubber, would not order this bag again.</li>
    <li> But had I seen it in person, I most likely would not have bought it. You can definitely tell it was &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34;, the stitching is erratic. The lining is cheap. But the color is great and it does hold a lot. I used it for a month. It was great to hold all my stuff for a daytrip, and to carry my stuff to work and back. However, its not a fashion item.</li>
    <li> Not the most expensive handbag but cute and basic to add some color to any outfit and came so fast especially considering how far it traveled.</li>
    <li> Looks nice in picture but if you see it actual not that  great. The stitching is coming out. I should have known not to buy this even thou is cheap.</li>
    <li> I like the purse a whole lot except for the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a long and a short handle which is what U expected.</li>
    <li> My handbag arrived today. Nice bag for the price. Smaller than what I expected. But it will work great for a summer bag. I would like to see a longer strap. But overall a decent bag.</li>
    <li> quality was every poor</li>
    <li> Great colour, quality, size and price.  Have received so many compliments on my bag. Keep getting asked who designer is</li>
    <li> Although very inexpensive, and the liner is plastic, not fabric, I am enjoying this purse for every day use.  I like it so well that I am purchasing another one in a different color.</li>
    <li> Really cute bag, excellent price!</li>
    <li> I do not like it. to small and the handals are to short. The photo makes it look bigger. Not happy</li>
    <li> Gave this bag as a gift.  I loved mine in red. A friend recommended to me, and I would recommend to others to buy.</li>
    <li> Nice little bag that I use a lot. It doesn&#x27;t look like the priciest bag but it&#x27;s such a great size. It holds all my things nicely. The orange is nice  and bright.</li>
    <li> It is a good product but it is very small</li>
    <li> This is a cute little bag. It isnt expensive and i dont carry it everyday but it is a nice casual bag</li>
    <li> This is a great bag, medium sized-looks like leather but it is not-love it!</li>
    <li> I Love my purse.  Everybody asks me where did I get it, and I tell I ordered it from Amazon.  Thank you for a great purse.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit small so I gave it to my daughter and she loves it.....</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother, and she totally loves it. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I like the bag. It&#x27;s cute. Definitely more Orange than the picture but that&#x27;s alright, I can live with it. Thought it was bigger but I blame myself for not reading the description.</li>
    <li> It was smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> This works excellents as a book bag for my Tuesday night meetings.  Everything is right at hand and easy to pull out each book when needed for different pats.  The color is wonderful and the construction is great.&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying one for field service work later.</li>
    <li> Great price. Great color. Well made and a good design.</li>
    <li> Love this purse. Wish there were more colors to pick so I could buy more!</li>
    <li> Lovely color and the right size.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this but I really did! When I opened it I thought it would be too small for all of my things but it works great and I get lots of compliments when I use it. Great summer color. I would and have recommended this to friends.</li>
    <li> I like the size but wish it was a little bigger. The color is great. Great for interviews. The handles could be longer and maybe a strap for cross body.</li>
    <li> Got it a month sooner than I thought I would. Love the color. Had to stuff it to reshape overnight but that was no biggie. And I could use it as a shoulder bag. Love it will buy more colors.</li>
    <li> This tote bag is poorly made. The magnetic buttons  are not aligned which makes the inside pocket  crooked.  The pocket&lt;br /&gt;does not close well. It is a disappointment.</li>
    <li> love love love!&lt;br /&gt;Great product for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(wish the handles were about and inch and half longer)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  a nice little bag. I added a copper conchology belt around the rim and people always ask where they can find one like it. Wish it were just a bit larger and had the longer handles - doesn&#x27;t it say shoulder bag or something?</li>
    <li> for the price this bags is the best everywhere I go everyone is always asking me where did I get it.  it took a long time for me to get but it is worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I thought it was bigger they trick me</li>
    <li> Definitely recommending this one--and with all the color choices, I imagine I&#x27;ll be ordering another one soon! The organizational  divisions inside was an unexpected bonus.</li>
    <li> Nice purse vibrant color</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price. I&#x27;ve only had it a week, but it seems to be a pretty nice purse.</li>
    <li> Interior was  a loud, crunchy, plastic type material. Never seen that before.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought but good quality!</li>
    <li> It looks exactly like the photo!  But unfortunately its very very small. I mean small, about the size of a text book.</li>
    <li> Considering the price of this purse, it is an excellent value. I have purchased other purses in this price range where the straps are falling off withing a month of use. This purse has good quality stitching and is a great size for daily use. I would definitely purchase this again (but hopefully won&#x27;t have to as I expect it to last a long time).</li>
    <li> This bag is too cute and exactly as pictured!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! Simple, lightweight and inexpensive! Cute!</li>
    <li> I use it every day and its just right for me. all my accessories fit neatly inside so well. you have a wonderful selection of fashionable bags to choose from. i already have five more seledtions in my wish list i plan to order in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this purse. I love the color. I love the size. I will be buying more in different colors for myself and for gifts.</li>
    <li> Good price really cute. Love the color. I wish it had came with a shoulder strap. It did not say it came with one I just wish it had</li>
    <li> I love this bag. It is rather sturdy and very pretty. The middle pocket is not connected to the purse on the bottom so things slide between the two sides, but I don&#x27;t care! It holds up very well and I have gotten a lot of compliments. The handles are just big enough for me to carry it in my palm or on my forearm.</li>
    <li> Nice medium  size purse.  Hope they get more colors like green, yellow, purple or pink.</li>
    <li> I love this purse and you cannot beat the price. It&#x27;s small to medium sized and fits what I need perfectly (wallet, phone, keys, sunglasses, ipad, and water). I was a little nervous about the orange color, but I love it and have received several compliments on it. I knocked off a star because this really isn&#x27;t a shoulder tote--you could probably force it,  but it wouldn&#x27;t be very comfortable. Overall, a cute bag at a great price.</li>
    <li> Purse doesn&#x27;t look anything like picture. Color is not as shown &amp; looks very cheap in person. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The purse arrived earlier than expected &amp; was just as described in the listing.  I have already received compliments on it (I chose the orange color).</li>
    <li> The quality, the price and the color it is so fashionable. I&#x27; d def recommended it... I lo ve it!!!</li>
    <li> just like the picture,its smaller than what i  thougth it was, but its good looking purse</li>
    <li> always get compliments on this color!!! Sooooooooooooo pretty!!!!  it fits everything perfectly and it&#x27;s a great bag for any time and any season!!!</li>
    <li> I have titanium hips, femurs, and knees, and on a shopping day my leather handbags, believe it or not, heavy as they are even empty, become pain producing on my replacement parts.  This is smart looking, has a darling lining,  is compartmented and pocketed, holds what I need to carry when shopping, and is light as a feather.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This was ok b/c I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the dimensions.  It&#x27;s really small!</li>
    <li> totally disappointed with the size of the bag.  Return policy did not stress that I would not be able to return this item. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect and holding up nicely</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very simple bag but seems durable. It would look great if it has a zip closure instead of the magnetic closure. So I gave it a four star rating. It&#x27;s pretty good for daily use.</li>
    <li> Very cute bag. Looks to be made well. The striped lining is only 1inch deep and then it turns to a butter white lining. It&#x27;s a bit like windbreaker materiel but it is sturdy.  My only complaint is that the color is more pastel than pumpkin colored.    If you want a simple look with a pop of color in a medium size this could be the bag for you.</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s attractive, but it&#x27;s tiny compared to what I was expecting. The inside lining is cheap, but the color of the bag is nice and in season right now. Cheap price.</li>
    <li> Love my purse it is the perfect size for me.</li>
    <li> this bag looks like it fell off a garbage truck and no one else wanted it but a squirrel</li>
