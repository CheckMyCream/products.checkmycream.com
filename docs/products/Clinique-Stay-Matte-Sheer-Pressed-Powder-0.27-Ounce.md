    <li> I have used this product for a long time&lt;br /&gt;and satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I wear this product and love it! It is great to apply over a liquid foundation for full coverage or by itself for sheer coverage. It helps to control excess oils on your face for a shine free look! I keep one in my purse and one at home in my makeup collection. In love Clinique and this product. I normally by mine for $19 in store of from Clinique&#x27;s website! Great product!</li>
    <li> This is no #3 but it is darker then the foundation</li>
    <li> I purchase the \\&quot;Stay Matte Powder Oild Free No.3\\&quot; very often. Buying online is cheaper but the shipping and handling cost is high for the small items like this. But anyway, the product is good and suitable for my skin and I use it daily for my making up.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years now and I really love it. When it&#x27;s worn, it doesn&#x27;t either feel or look like make up, it just gets rid of shine (my T-zone is oily) and seals the previous make up you have applied before, like in my case, I apply it after my eye concealer and it helps me blend it in, it helps me to look very natural. I love to use it with an brush (not with the included sponge) to transform it into a easy-to-carry translucent powder. Also, my skin is sensitive, and by using this product I have neve had any problems with my skin. I have used it on \\&quot;stay beige\\&quot; and \\&quot;stay neutral\\&quot; and I prefer the \\&quot;stay neutral\\&quot; because I feel it has a slighter pinkish tone that the \\&quot;stay beige\\&quot; one.</li>
    <li> It was mattifying without being drying.  Color match was good for my squinting too.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed&lt;br /&gt;The pressed powder is all crushed and totally covered in powder. Probably very old product. Don&#x27;t recommend it at all. I have been a loyal customer and this was my first time receiving a bad product</li>
    <li> It came with the powder broke into many pieces and whoever wears this knows it&#x27;s not easy using this product that way, dosappointed in the way I received it.</li>
    <li> Arrived with the powder completely shattered. Messy! Didn&#x27;t bother returning, it spilled all over me and counter when I opened it...</li>
    <li> I received the product broke. i need your email address to send you  the pictures..</li>
    <li> It is what I expected. I recommend it. The product is as shown in the publication and is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Perfect... Exactly what I expected, it&#x27;s right like the ones I&#x27;ve purchased before. Anything can go wrong whe we are talking about Clinique</li>
    <li> This is the exact powder that I wanted.  Saved me from going out and looking for it in the stores.  I have to drive at least an hour to a large retailer that carries this product.</li>
    <li> Shine-absorbing, oil-free formula, great for oily skin and oily spots (my case). I loved it!</li>
