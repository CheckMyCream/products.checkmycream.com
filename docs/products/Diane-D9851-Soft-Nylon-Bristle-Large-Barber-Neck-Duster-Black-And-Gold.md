      <li>The hairs come off easily!</li>
      <li>This is the large brush and it works great.  </li>
      <li>If it is supposed to remove most of the hair, it does.</li>
      <li>The top of the duster was falling apart.</li>
      <li>This thing sheds more than you can imagine.  </li>
      <li>great product, very well made.</li>
      <li>It seems to be well made and it stands up by itself on its handle, but the static electricity is an issue.</li>

      <li>This duster is so cool!</li>
      <li>This brush is easy to hold and light in weight to use.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, a good sturdy handle and very soft bristle tips.</li>
      <li>Huge bummer.</li>
      <li>Nice soft brush, I love this thing.</li>
      <li>Not only does it clean the hair around your neck, but it is great cleaning the hair from the Nylon Cape.</li>
      <li>It makes brushing hair off the cape quick and easy.  </li>
      <li>its a lot lighter than i originally though but not a bad buy.</li>
      <li>Nice soft brush.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a good neck duster then look no further because this is the one!</li>
      <li>Bristles are of good quality, soft exactly as needed to remove hair after haircut from the neck and face.</li>
      <li>Useful to have for hair cuts.</li>
      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a good buy</li>
      <li>Unlike others of this style that I&#x27;ve tried, right out of the package, the Diane duster did NOT lose hairs...</li>
      <li>it has a good type grip, very wide.</li>
      <li>I ended up with more bristle hair on the neck than the real human hair!!</li>
      <li>It gets the hair off and feels fine on a bare neck!</li>
      <li>This brush is nice and soft, but because it is made with synthetic fibers, the hair clings to the brush, instead of getting brushed off.  </li>
      <li>It is big size and easy to hold.</li>
      <li>It is big size and easy to hold.</li>
      <li>This is a gift for my daughter who cannot seem to find a large &amp;#34;body brush&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>its pretty decent.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>This works very well for dusting the kids&#x27; necks after I give them a hair cut.</li>
      <li>, the Marvy Neck Duster #53 Horsehair, which worked very well, much like the barbers brushes that I remember.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>This works better than I expected it to work.  </li>
      <li>brush.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately can&#x27;t return because the cost is almost as much as the product cost.</li>
      <li>Better than I expected!</li>
      <li>Good for first few uses, but started falling apart shortly after....</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now, with this handy dandy little brush, I can&#x27;t believe it!</li>
      <li>what you would expect this helpful duster to do and the produce is very strong to with stand the everyday use.</li>
      <li>This works amazingly well to brush off small hairs off of faces and necks.</li>
      <li>Wow this is huge , never imagine how big this brush is,</li>
      <li>The hairs of the brush are slightly crimped which give the brush a bit more backbone than some others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>This is a bigger sized brush that makes quick work of brushing off the neck.</li>
      <li>Will help tremendously getting hair off back of neck and face.</li>
      <li>and very soft to the skin as well!</li>
      <li>On occasion one or two fall out but that is normal.</li>
      <li>Very soft bristles that are comforting to every customer.</li>
      <li>When used on clients&#x27; faces, ears, and necks, use a little bit lighter pressure to keep it comfortable and let the brush do the work.</li>
      <li>Works well and soft.  </li>
      <li>- just dont expect feather soft.</li>
      <li>It wasnt as soft as others had described it.  </li>
      <li>Wonderfully soft.  </li>
      <li>Maybe a natural hair duster would not have this issue.</li>
      <li>This is so soft on the neck.  </li>
      <li>It looks very expensive and masif, very good quality made ,  but doesn&#x27;t work properly because the hair it way to soft ...</li>

    <li> Useful to have for hair cuts.</li>
    <li> Got this duster and tried it out the same day...it does what it&#x27;s supposed to, feels good in the hand and didn&#x27;t dent my wallet much.  I recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Was not impressed by the quality. The brush kept loosing hairs before we even start using it.  Had to return.</li>
    <li> works great for getting the hair off your neck and clothes!</li>
    <li> Barber Grade! and very soft to the skin as well!</li>
    <li> Great size brush. Great price but hairs falling out on first use! Huge bummer.</li>
    <li> Sheds more hairs than it brushes off.  Threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> It works for us at work.</li>
    <li> a lot larger than i thought it would be. but ill still use it. just wish is was smaller.the bristles i like.</li>
    <li> This works better than I expected it to work.  The bristles are firm enough to do the job.</li>
    <li> Good quality product would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Soft Brush, However I have used this duster a few times and every time I constantly have bristles coming out.</li>
    <li> It seems to be well made and it stands up by itself on its handle, but the static electricity is an issue. I use it for body powder that is made from cornstarch and talc. It pops and crackles when I use it. I&#x27;ve tried rubbing dryer sheets on it, but that only lasts a few minutes. It gets the job done, but I think most of the powder clings to the fibers because of the static electricity. Maybe a natural hair duster would not have this issue. Not sure - If you just need a giant brush, you can&#x27;t be the price.</li>
    <li> Bristles are of good quality, soft exactly as needed to remove hair after haircut from the neck and face. The grip is good and looks really neat.</li>
    <li> I needed this to remove cut hair from my son&#x27;s neck.  It works well enough, but hair is left on the neck.  I combine the brush with a damp rag to remove the cut hair.  For the price, it is a good buy.  If it supposed to remove all the hair, it doesn&#x27;t.  If it is supposed to remove most of the hair, it does.</li>
    <li> Brush is absolutely amazing. I cut my spouse&#x27;s hair and my moms hair. Will help tremendously getting hair off back of neck and face.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!  My dad mentioned he wanted one of these for his home haircuts and was very happy when I gave this one to him.</li>
    <li> This brush is easy to hold and light in weight to use. It gets the hair off and feels fine on a bare neck!</li>
    <li> Wow this is huge , never imagine how big this brush is, im sure this will do a good job, the quality looks ok too.</li>

    <li> I like this neck duster. It is big size and easy to hold. It cleans all hair cutting.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
    <li> This brush is not for make up. If it is, it has to be for a giant. My bag for not looking at the dimensions. I thought this was a kabuki brush.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately can&#x27;t return because the cost is almost as much as the product cost. So will not be purchasing from this company again.</li>
    <li> Nice soft brush, I love this thing. Better than I expected!</li>
    <li> Sheds and leaves strings all over.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied on the delivery and product thanks</li>
    <li> Great product for price! I use this at home on my husband and son&#x27;s hair every month. The brush is soft enough, but still firm enough to knock the hairs off of skin. On occasion one or two fall out but that is normal. Big fluffy brush, narrow handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:08/01/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several hair cuts, the quality of this product has held up. I&#x27;m still satisfied and will purchase again when mine eventually wears out, which at this rate may be a year or two.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive but functions just as I had hoped. I use it to brush off after cutting my hair with a Wahl Clipper.</li>
    <li> Works well and soft.  However, bristles do come loose.  Good ergonomics and is the right size for a comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does its job well.</li>
    <li> It looks very expensive and masif, very good quality made ,  but doesn&#x27;t work properly because the hair it way to soft ...</li>
    <li> Good product, but it sheds. Overall it works if you want to brush your cut hair from your neck,body or arms.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully soft.  Feels good to be &amp;#34;dusted&amp;#34; by this.  This is a bigger sized brush that makes quick work of brushing off the neck.</li>
    <li> Must have in barber shop.</li>
    <li> like the handle and brush ends. what you would expect this helpful duster to do and the produce is very strong to with stand the everyday use.</li>
    <li> I wonder how my brush turned out to be so awful when everyone else loved theirs. Maybe we got a different stock from theirs -- my was so smelly even before I opened the package and I had a good amount of bristles fall out in the envelope even before I took it out. The edges were extremely uneven, like someone had tried to force the bristles back into the base. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet because my son was so disgusted with the way it smells so I am airing it out. Hopefully I can make it work. I hope this wasn&#x27;t a complete waste of money!</li>
    <li> This duster is so cool! I have been cutting my boys&#x27; hair for years because they ask mom to cut it (they don&#x27;t like going to a barbershop or stylist). I have been using a wet cloth to wipe off hairs, or a dry cloth to slap them off, and I just can&#x27;t get them off, so the kids always run off into the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with this handy dandy little brush, I can&#x27;t believe it! The hairs come off easily! The kids especially like it when they have hairs on their nose or face during the hair cut and they are squirming all over because they are itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles themselves are very soft, and they are compacted tightly together - nicer than my makeup brushes even&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is such a convenient tool! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The top of the duster was falling apart. Strands were falling out everywhere.</li>
    <li> great product, very well made.</li>
    <li> A great brush at a very good price.  Unlike others of this style that I&#x27;ve tried, right out of the package, the Diane duster did NOT lose hairs...and it seems to be keeping them.  Only four stars because the duster top is a little heavy and the base is a little light, sometimes allowing it to tip over if it&#x27;s not carefully placed on the counter.  The hairs of the brush are slightly crimped which give the brush a bit more backbone than some others I&#x27;ve tried.  It makes brushing hair off the cape quick and easy.  When used on clients&#x27; faces, ears, and necks, use a little bit lighter pressure to keep it comfortable and let the brush do the work.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush hoping that it would do the job of removing hair around the neck after a boy&#x27;s haircut...the bristle hairs starting shedding constantly.  I ended up with more bristle hair on the neck than the real human hair!! Yikes!!!! Certainly do not buy!</li>
    <li> This works very well for dusting the kids&#x27; necks after I give them a hair cut. It is an excellent product!</li>
    <li> Quality isn&#x27;t the greatest but for the price I can&#x27;t complain. I am happy with it :)</li>
    <li> The quality of this brush really impressed the wife and I.  Now my at home haircuts look and feel like I just left the Barber Shop.</li>
    <li> This is the large brush and it works great.  Not only does it clean the hair around your neck, but it is great cleaning the hair from the Nylon Cape.</li>
    <li> Very soft bristles that are comforting to every customer.</li>
    <li> Nice soft brush. Heavy handle so it stands on the base easy. Has a tendency to loose it&#x27;s bristles though. Other than that it&#x27;s a good buy</li>
    <li> This works amazingly well to brush off small hairs off of faces and necks. My 3yo son LOVES it, and actually ALLOWS me to cut his hair b/c he knows he gets this brushed on his face afterwards.</li>
    <li> Really good product. It removes hair well. If you are looking for a good neck duster then look no further because this is the one!</li>
    <li> I gave this to a coworker which is using it and seems to be loving it too. thank you</li>
    <li> do not think....get it</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my daughter who cannot seem to find a large &amp;#34;body brush&amp;#34;.  She has been using a brush that looks like cars ran over it and is not willing to give it up.  I need her to retire this old brush and gave her a kabuki brush, but it was so small, it didn&#x27;t do what she needs it to do.  Then I found this one.  It is large and has a good handle.  I&#x27;m glad to have found this and I believe she will be thrilled with it.</li>
    <li> Counter weighted well, makes it easier to dust people off.</li>
    <li> Good brush if you cut your own hair.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews i was a little disapointed by the feel of the brush. It wasnt as soft as others had described it.  Still a good value and does the job - just dont expect feather soft.</li>
    <li> Great Duster Brush does a good job and fits in hand comfortable .</li>
    <li> Good for first few uses, but started falling apart shortly after....</li>
    <li> This thing sheds more than you can imagine.  I guess it could be a fluke but I think I am going to have to throw it away, it leaves tufts of hair all over every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Great brush! Awesome duster! As a barber I use it all the time! Everyone loves it! great look and great feel!</li>
    <li> Hairs come off all the time,but it does the work</li>
    <li> This brush is nice and soft, but because it is made with synthetic fibers, the hair clings to the brush, instead of getting brushed off.  Also the fibers are very fine, and tend to fall out of the brush. I did not like this brush, and replaced it with a horsehair brush, the Marvy Neck Duster #53 Horsehair, which worked very well, much like the barbers brushes that I remember.</li>
    <li> its pretty decent. it does the job, but the item tends to &amp;#34;shed.&amp;#34; and i have noticed this on all of these types of neck dusters. its handle is good though. it has a good type grip, very wide. the bottom is hard plastic which on this specific item is not completely aligned. so it tends to shake when i try and put it down. its a lot lighter than i originally though but not a bad buy. i would recommend this to someone else.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush.  Very attractive.  Gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Not very strong neck brush. Fits the price</li>
    <li> My bristles started falling out as soon as I pulled it out of the packaging. It has a lot of loose hair to fall out. Which doesn&#x27;t make sense because you&#x27;re using it to get rid of hair, not create more! Otherwise, a good sturdy handle and very soft bristle tips.</li>
    <li> I like this neck duster.  It is big size and easy to hold. It cleans all hair cutting.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
    <li> Dropped it and the bottom broke like glass almost. The duster itself was great. The handle was the worst</li>
    <li> This is so soft on the neck.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet so am not sure how well it gets the hair off.</li>
    <li> Nice brush does was it should</li>
    <li> If you dont mind the goat smell - it works well. Fabreeze and washing wont do a thing. its goat and I don&#x27;t like their smell.</li>
