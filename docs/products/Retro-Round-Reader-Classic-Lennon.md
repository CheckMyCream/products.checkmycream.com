      <li>These are my favorite pair of reading glasses.  </li>
      <li>I received many compliments.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Update: Aug 2016 -- These were my favorite readers up until this week when the dog chewed them up.</li>
      <li>Would like more in lighter color.</li>
      <li>Otherwise Ok quality.</li>

      <li>They look nice but the right temple piece broke off almost immediately</li>
      <li>Thesre are fine, no complaints</li>
      <li>These are very sturdy and fit nicely.  </li>
      <li>It would&#x27;ve been great if the seller stated the actual standardized frame size on this listing, to save a lot of time and effort on everyone&#x27;s side.</li>
      <li>My delivery was fast and the product looked liked the picture.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy these, and I get complimented on them all the time.  </li>
      <li>I loved these glasses,  but after 2 months the screw came out, I took them to an optical store and they could not fix them, I contacted Reading Glass Co of America, and they informed me that warranty is over, and there is no replacement screw available, don&#x27;t glasses usually last longer than 2+months?</li>

      <li>Without question the quality of this pair, for the same price, is much better than the Asset Eyewear</li>
      <li>They are rather large as well.  </li>
      <li>really like them .Five</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve still been wearing them with one lens out--that&#x27;s how much I like these glasses, but I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s time to buy a new pair.</li>
      <li>My main hesitation:</li>
      <li>The frame has a more solid feel, the hinges appear solid as does the entire construction of this pair (including the lenses.)  </li>
      <li>They have a new style that is not completely round.</li>
      <li>less than a week , i bought two pairs, the screws fell apart  with light use.</li>
      <li>Fit my narrow face well.</li>
      <li>The frames are solid and the lenses are high quality.</li>

    <li> I loved these glasses,  but after 2 months the screw came out, I took them to an optical store and they could not fix them, I contacted Reading Glass Co of America, and they informed me that warranty is over, and there is no replacement screw available, don&#x27;t glasses usually last longer than 2+months?</li>
    <li> I have had alot people ask me where i got them .I really like them .Five star&lt;br /&gt;Very good quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m to hard on wire or metal reading glasses.  These are very sturdy and fit nicely.  If you like the style, and I do, I would recommend you consider these reading glasses.</li>
    <li> Cool reading glasses.  I wear them every day.</li>
    <li> Glasse fit perfect and love the look and feel great as ordered a second pair for another room reading !</li>
    <li> Very nice price. Fit my narrow face well.</li>
    <li> It would&#x27;ve been great if the seller stated the actual standardized frame size on this listing, to save a lot of time and effort on everyone&#x27;s side. Stating inches doesn&#x27;t get the job done.  Honestly, these had to have been made for a child.</li>
    <li> These are weighty and well made. They are spring loaded and look very nice. If you like vintage eyewear you can&#x27;t go wrong here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Aug 2016 -- These were my favorite readers up until this week when the dog chewed them up. I&#x27;ve still been wearing them with one lens out--that&#x27;s how much I like these glasses, but I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s time to buy a new pair. These are just very comfortable glasses.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite pair of reading glasses.  I got lots of compliments on them.  I carry them in my purse all the time and no scratches.  I tend to be a little careless with my glasses</li>
    <li> These are now my favorite pair of reading glasses. The frames are solid and the lenses are high quality. The price is ridiculously cheap but the quality is excellent.</li>
    <li> So cute, good quality</li>
    <li> Not sure if I look like Harry Potter or Lennon.  I like the glasses and family thinks they are cool.  They seem to be sturdy and need to be as I take them off and on often.</li>
    <li> Great reading glasses.  I get lots of compliments.  I even think they make me look brainy.  I own 8.  Only one has broken Now that I want to reorder, AMAZON is out of my strength.  Restock AMAZON</li>
    <li> I love this glasses! I will order again.</li>
    <li> Just great looking glasses!</li>
    <li> Bought these since my customary (cheap) reading glasses were temporarily unavailable on Amazon (and I wasn&#x27;t willing to shell out the $5.00 requested from third-party sellers.)  Without question the quality of this pair, for the same price, is much better than the Asset Eyewear Reading Glasses - Round Tortoise, I prefer (owing to profile, looks, and comfort.)  The frame has a more solid feel, the hinges appear solid as does the entire construction of this pair (including the lenses.)  This model is slightly larger than the aforementioned pair and calling it Lennon-style is a bit of a stretch.  My main hesitation: the power of the lens (and or the focus) appears slightly different from the Asset Eyewear Reading Glasses - Round Tortoise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been buying 3-packs of inexpensive readers at warehouse stores for awhile, but they would fall apart after a few months. These are sturdy and stylish. The optics are to spec, also.</li>
    <li> less than a week , i bought two pairs, the screws fell apart  with light use. these are beyond repair</li>
    <li> The glasses are too heavy for comfort. Otherwise Ok quality. The glass bulky and a little on the big side also.</li>
    <li> Love it¡,!!very  very happy with my purchase , i will buy them again without any doubt  thank you ver y much</li>
    <li> Thesre are fine, no complaints</li>
    <li> Cheaply made and disappointing.  They are rather large as well.  Not impressed with quality of the lenses either.  Considering a return.</li>
    <li> Not the style of glasses that are shown in the image. They have a new style that is not completely round. They lead consumers astray</li>
    <li> I wish these came as bifocals - I&#x27;d wear them all day long!  I really enjoy these, and I get complimented on them all the time.  Thank you for offering them!!!</li>
    <li> Love these!!  I received many compliments.  Would like more in lighter color.</li>
    <li> They look nice but the right temple piece broke off almost immediately</li>
    <li> I liked the first pair so nice, I bought them twice!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these reading glasses. They are super cute and fit my face very well. My delivery was fast and the product looked liked the picture.</li>
