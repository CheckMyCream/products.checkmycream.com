    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used!  Living in Vegas my skin was chronically dry and thus every wrinkle was magnified.  I was hesitant to spend the money on this but wow was it worth it.  This stuff goes on cold so it feels great, and my skin absorbs it almost immediately so no greasy residue.  My skin is no longer dry and it has made me look years younger.  Others complain that it didn&#x27;t smell good but I love the smell - to me you get a hint of the sunscreen smell.  Well worth it if you suffer from dry skin!</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed in this product. I typically use Youth surge and love it but this product smells awful. I&#x27;m not sure if it was really old or the product itself. My previous jar from Sephora was perfect.</li>
    <li> Will not purchase another item like this over the internet. The product did not have a pleasant smell so it is not being used. A waste of money for me because I didn&#x27;t try to return it.</li>
    <li> I cannot put any product in my face but this cream is a relief to my face and it is the only one to which I am not allergic</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for your face!!! Its worth the price!!! One will always notice perfect skin when using this product!!!</li>
    <li> I have EXTREMELY SENSITIVE skin so I cannot usually use any skin cream unless it is totally hypoallergenic.

Hopefully I will be able to continue using it.  If not, I will just add it to all the myriad other creams on my &amp;#34;Cannot Use&amp;#34; list.</li>
    <li> I do wonder if any commercial sunscreen would do the same for a third of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure about quality of this product.</li>
    <li> My Skin looks better, I have a softer look, feels great! Love this product! Will continue to buy youth surge!</li>
    <li> The product was ok, but the box was damage and I couldn&#x27;t read the informations about the moisture in it.</li>
    <li> I usually purchase this from Macy&#x27;s or Dillard&#x27;s when the have their freebee products. This is the first time I ordered Clinique online. I will not be doing it again! It had an awful odor to it.</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for a long time....like it and wish it were less expensive</li>
    <li> This is one of the nicest night creams I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is so light and silky.  It was well packaged, arrived promptly and in good shape. Thank you!</li>
    <li> muy buen producto, excelente vendedor, entrega rapida y efectiva, me llego en excelente condiciones, agradecido por tan buen servicio prestado</li>
    <li> I tried lots  of moisturizers, but this one is the best so far. leaves my combination skin soft, clear and not oily.</li>
    <li> My mother uses it all the time.  Great for dry skin and makes her feel and look young and pretty in her 90s.</li>
    <li> I love Cliniques anti-aging skincare products. This one is great to put on over other skincare products like the Clinique Laser Repairware and the Dark Spot Corrector.</li>
