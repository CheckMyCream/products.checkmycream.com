      <li>Foundation goes on smoothly without primer.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t feel comfortable putting it on my face.</li>
      <li>I ordered the light one</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty convinced that this seller didn&#x27;t even sell me an authentic Josie Maran product.  </li>
      <li>Bought this through my friends account, Was excited to purchase this product, came and the dropper somehow melted and not functional..</li>
      <li>I purchased the small bottle of original Josie Maran 100% Argan Oil a month ago 1 for my daughter &amp; one for myself &amp; we fell in love!!!</li>
      <li>love the light oil  so soft on my face</li>
      <li>LOVE the new lighter version for SUMMERTIME</li>
      <li>This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased, and I&#x27;m sure this will be in my regimen for years!</li>
      <li>I love it so far.  </li>
      <li>The Josie Maran 100 % pure Argan oil really works as it goes into the skin quickly and keeps my face &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; free.  </li>
      <li>Very light and works just as well as regular oil!</li>
      <li>I put it on at 5:30 am and until I wash it off at night, and it keeps my face non oily, even MATTE for the first time ever.</li>
      <li>open when you twist the top.</li>
      <li>Love this in the dry winter months under moisturizer night and day.</li>
      <li>I am almost certain the box was sealed on each product.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t felt like it made a huge difference yet, but i&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t contain any fragrance, but also didn&#x27;t really have a smell.</li>
      <li>I received this item so fast</li>
      <li>It also has no smell and is light enough to be used as a moisturiser before you apply your make up.</li>
      <li>There was no &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; on the top like her other products that you have to &amp;#34;break&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I figured this might be normal since I have not smelled pure Argan oil before.</li>
      <li>Sinks in the skin very quickly and does not leave an oily residue.  </li>
      <li>The Argan Oil box was completely beat up and the actual oil doesn&#x27;t even fit into the box</li>
      <li>The dropper top looks completely different than it does on the actual Josie Maran website.</li>
      <li>I bought this particular one from Amazon for travel because QVC didn&#x27;t have this size.</li>
      <li>This particular order from Amazon, had this scent from the get go</li>
      <li>not broken as much as rotted and old.</li>
      <li>they are natural and they keep my skin very &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I live in the mountains so dryness happens.</li>
      <li>My first indication of a problem was when i opened the Amazon box the individual boxes they were in were not sealed, kinda beat up looking in fact, &amp; the bottles of oil were out of their packaging just rolling around the amazon box.</li>
      <li>My face feels so soft!</li>
      <li>And I have tried them side by side, it is not less oily whatsoever!  </li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive, acne prone skin and these two products</li>
      <li>So I am thinking that the oil was old too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to use the product as I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s either been tampered with or is completely fake.</li>
      <li>Right off I noticed a &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; that wasn&#x27;t there with the other.</li>
      <li>It should be light with very little odor whatsoever.  </li>
      <li>but then we thought we would try the light version, since its supposed to be the same thing just a bit less Oily.</li>
      <li>which means it&#x27;s been sitting around for a very long time or not the real one.</li>
      <li>and actually I don&#x27;t know I am Not sure if its the original one or not because it came without a box</li>
      <li>This version of this product (again not convinced it is authentic) makes my skin PINK- definitely have a small reaction to it</li>
      <li>In the past when my oil was almost gone, it developed  a funny &amp;#34;old olive oil&amp;#34; scent when it was almost gone.</li>
      <li>I am going to try &amp; get my money back or at least try to exchange for a bottle of original by another seller.</li>
      <li>Ill put up with my acne, thanks very much!).</li>

<li> which is great because the winters in Chicago can be brutal to your skin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, pharmaceuticals, orally and topically, just short of Accutane, which I feel like is way too extreme (It causes liver damage, suicidal thoughts, and birth defects.</li>
<li> Then because i was anxious to try this lighter version of the oil i have become addicted to, against my better judgement we started using it.</li>
<li> I have very dry skin, yet still prone to breakouts.</li>

<li> Unfortunately the bottle doesn&#x27;t travel well though, much of it spilled.</li>
<li> the melted rubber dripped down the oil</li>
<li> I opened the bottle and the oil smelled odd.</li>
<li> Be forewarned and don&#x27;t waste your money by ordering  this from Amazon.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t shy away just because you have sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
<li> It made my face beyond dried out and it was swollen for a week.</li>
<li> I was not sure about this product.</li>
<li> It almost feels like they poured olive oil or something in these bottles, or at very least the product has turned or something.</li>
<li> This argan oil is seriously a game changer.</li>
<li> However, the eye dropped was broken.</li>
<li> Whats really sad is</li>
<li> SOMETHING is seriously wrong here.</li>
<li> Josie will be getting another try, but I seriously doubt it will be through Amazon!!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had really awful oily skin and cystic acne for as long as I can remember.</li>
<li> And now I&#x27;m afraid to.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> PLEASE DON&#x27;T BUY IT.  I don&#x27;t think its Argan oil, but kind of a mixture of olive oil as it smell like one. Its texture and feel is also not as argan oil.Really disappointed with this. Would have given it a minus-star but there&#x27;s no option!</li>
    <li> I ordered the light one but I get the thicker one but its ok and actually I don&#x27;t know I am Not sure if its the original one or not because it came without a box</li>
    <li> The best Argan oil I have ever used! Both for skin and hair!</li>
    <li> LOVE the new lighter version for SUMMERTIME</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the lightness of the oil.  I put it on every evening before going to sleep.  Sinks in the skin very quickly and does not leave an oily residue.  My face feels so soft!</li>
    <li> I was not sure about this product. I opened the bottle and the oil smelled odd. I figured this might be normal since I have not smelled pure Argan oil before. However, the eye dropped was broken. not broken as much as rotted and old. So I am thinking that the oil was old too. I would not order again. I love amazon but sometime you just have to spend the extra money and buy from a store.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t felt like it made a huge difference yet, but i&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. I have very dry skin, yet still prone to breakouts. This stuff is great! I only use it at night, though; it tends to not let makeup stay put if you use it in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product many times from QVC and have always liked it. I bought this particular one from Amazon for travel because QVC didn&#x27;t have this size. In the past when my oil was almost gone, it developed  a funny &amp;#34;old olive oil&amp;#34; scent when it was almost gone. This particular order from Amazon, had this scent from the get go which means it&#x27;s been sitting around for a very long time or not the real one. Be forewarned and don&#x27;t waste your money by ordering  this from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I feel like i got ripped off. SOMETHING is seriously wrong here. I purchased the small bottle of original Josie Maran 100% Argan Oil a month ago 1 for my daughter &amp; one for myself &amp; we fell in love!!! That product i would  give 5+ stars in a heartbeat. It was shipped by Morning Beauty. I am almost certain the box was sealed on each product. It didn&#x27;t contain any fragrance, but also didn&#x27;t really have a smell. Made my skin feel wonderful, &amp; completely cleared my daughter adult onset acne within 3 weeks. We loved it so much we both used our .5 oz bottles within a month. Wanted to buy a larger size but then we thought we would try the light version, since its supposed to be the same thing just a bit less Oily. Well I ordered &amp; this time came from SPEED BOX. My first indication of a problem was when i opened the Amazon box the individual boxes they were in were not sealed, kinda beat up looking in fact, &amp; the bottles of oil were out of their packaging just rolling around the amazon box. Then because i was anxious to try this lighter version of the oil i have become addicted to, against my better judgement we started using it. Right off I noticed a &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; that wasn&#x27;t there with the other. And I have tried them side by side, it is not less oily whatsoever!  AND worst of all. Looked at my daughter today &amp; her skin is completely broken out!!!! When I read the description of what this oil is supposed to be like on Josie Marans site, it is not the product i received. It almost feels like they poured olive oil or something in these bottles, or at very least the product has turned or something. I think Josie Maran would be appalled that what ever I received is being sold under her name. I am going to try &amp; get my money back or at least try to exchange for a bottle of original by another seller. I am a hardcore amazon user, but this makes me very afraid to buy these kinds of products from amazon. Whats really sad is I dont think I actually got a chance to give the lightproduct a try. And now I&#x27;m afraid to. They should have been returned the moment I saw the bottles outside their packaging, rolling around the box. SOOO upset about this and you can imagine how my daughter feels after she thought she finally found a cure to her acne. Josie will be getting another try, but I seriously doubt it will be through Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty convinced that this seller didn&#x27;t even sell me an authentic Josie Maran product.  There was no &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; on the top like her other products that you have to &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; open when you twist the top. It does not smell like her other products- this reeks.  It should be light with very little odor whatsoever.  I buy Josie Maran products bc they are natural and they keep my skin very &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34;. This version of this product (again not convinced it is authentic) makes my skin PINK- definitely have a small reaction to it and I have NO REACTION to the regular Josie Maran oil.</li>
    <li> I loved this oil. It made my skin feel better than it has in a while. It helps with my oily skin and it feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> I look forward to using this and the Josie Maran cleansing argan oil every evening!! Such wonderful products that work so well together. I have extremely sensitive, acne prone skin and these two products have worked wonders.</li>
    <li> Great product, speedy delivery. Very happy with my product.</li>
    <li> Luv this oil. Ordered it got it one day!</li>
    <li> No need for moisturizer.I am a Neutrogena woman cleanser moisturizer and lotion. I have only been using this and I  must tell you I do not use eye cream or facial moisturizer anymore. Foundation goes on smoothly without primer. I love will buy again. I am 56 and the wrinkles around the eyes,nose and mouth have greatly diminished. Been using 1 WEEK!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very light and works just as well as regular oil!</li>
    <li> I love this product....I just need about a gallon of it!  I&#x27;m almost out already and the difference in the texture of my face is amazing!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the BOMB!  I mix it with my daily serum and a little moisturizer.....given me a dewy glow without looking greasy. May face just drinks it up which is great because the winters in Chicago can be brutal to your skin.</li>
    <li> If I could give it a zero, I would. It made my face beyond dried out and it was swollen for a week.</li>
    <li> I love it so far.  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure exactly when to use it or what order with other products to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had really awful oily skin and cystic acne for as long as I can remember. I&#x27;ve tried everything, pharmaceuticals, orally and topically, just short of Accutane, which I feel like is way too extreme (It causes liver damage, suicidal thoughts, and birth defects. Ill put up with my acne, thanks very much!). I never thought face oils would be for a girl like me, I assumed it was for other women with already perfect skin. This argan oil is seriously a game changer. I put it on at 5:30 am and until I wash it off at night, and it keeps my face non oily, even MATTE for the first time ever. I definitely recommend it. It&#x27;s such a relief to glance in the mirror and not shine, or touch my face and come away with oily fingers. Don&#x27;t shy away just because you have sensitive or acne prone skin. It also has no smell and is light enough to be used as a moisturiser before you apply your make up. It&#x27;s great. I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Awesome oil without being oily!</li>
    <li> Bought this through my friends account, Was excited to purchase this product, came and the dropper somehow melted and not functional..the melted rubber dripped down the oil so I don&#x27;t feel comfortable putting it on my face. So crushed:/</li>
    <li> I have used this Aryan oil for 3 yrs now and it is amazing so light and absorbs into the skin so good, can&#x27;t be without it and will order again and again  before I run out. I received this item so fast and I LUV it so much thanks again for another wonderful item, so happy with the service I receive from Amazon.com they rock!!!</li>
    <li> This was a gift and she loved it!</li>
    <li> I just received his item from LAST_ITEMS. The product was not inside its box, it was rolling around the amazon box. The Argan Oil box was completely beat up and the actual oil doesn&#x27;t even fit into the box it&#x27;s supposed to come in. The dropper top looks completely different than it does on the actual Josie Maran website. I&#x27;m not going to use the product as I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s either been tampered with or is completely fake.</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil - use it every day to keep my &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin from drying.  I live in the mountains so dryness happens. I tried other oils - they created a greasy mess.  The Josie Maran 100 % pure Argan oil really works as it goes into the skin quickly and keeps my face &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; free.  Love it!</li>
    <li> works great! doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy</li>
    <li> love the light oil  so soft on my face</li>
    <li> I have oily skin, but that does not cause an issue with this product. I use it on its own as an eye and face cream at night, and also mix a drop or two in with my face lotion/BB creme to make it richer. This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased, and I&#x27;m sure this will be in my regimen for years!</li>
    <li> Love this in the dry winter months under moisturizer night and day. Unfortunately the bottle doesn&#x27;t travel well though, much of it spilled.</li>
