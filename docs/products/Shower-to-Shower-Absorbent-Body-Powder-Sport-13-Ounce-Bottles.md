<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Refreshing product!  Great to use after a shower for all-day freshness!</li>
    <li> Very very good and the price wasn&#x27;t bad either.&#x27;&#x27;</li>
    <li> Great powder to use, you know, down there.  Smells great, and keeps you dryer.  Only other alternative is baby powder (what guy wants to smell like that?!)  You cannot find this anywhere (looked at drug stores, grocery stores, and discount stores).  Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product last year. I was very satisfied  The softness and clean scent was very appealing.  When I tried to purchase it at some of stores, it  was not available. I turned to Amazon.com and found  just what I was looking for. Thanks for making  this wonderful powder available.</li>
    <li> This powder is excellent for absorbing sweat for the active women.  It does not chafe or dry out the skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best body powder for men.  Finding a product that doesn&#x27;t smell flowery on men is a plus.  The pack of 2 is is cost effective and it&#x27;s impossible to find this body powder in our local stores, even the super stores.</li>
    <li> A nicely scented mens after shower powder</li>
    <li> This is a product I&#x27;ve used for many years and is one of the only body powders without a very feminine smell. Highly recommended for summertime.</li>
    <li> Like the product and the price. Order came on time and was packed very well. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have always loved STS powder, but I thought they went out of business. I have not seen this product&lt;br /&gt;in any store in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep purchasing this from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I wanted something for my son and husband without a floral or medicinal scent.  I know this brand has been around along time and the scent is perfect for my guys!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff daily. Best to put some right in your undies first next to your back door, then pull back on your undies and release like a sling shot and you&#x27;ll get a little poof cloud that coats your under carriage.</li>
    <li> Just like Snoop&#x27;s song ,\\&quot;I&#x27;ve got the Johnson&#x27;s baby powder and Coolwater cologne.\\&quot; This powder smells exactly like Coolwater cologne. It&#x27;s the only powder I know of that smells manly... If Johnson &amp; Johnson advertised this they could have 1 million new users easy... It&#x27;s always sold out at Walmart... So I get it here.</li>
    <li> Like the other reviewers, I really like Shower to Shower Sport.  The scent is not overpowering and I have never gotten a bad reaction to it like other deoderants I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had trouble finding this product locally at the large everything stores (Target, Walmart, etc).  I am glad Amazon has it available.</li>
    <li> This is powder for men.  Sport does not mean for women.</li>
    <li> Seems the pricing is off: $6.66 each for the 2 pack and for the 4 pack, but $10.17 per unit for the 3 pack?! Great product tho- smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> shipped fast , works great...</li>
    <li> What can I say, its powder and does work. What separates this from most others is the nice scent. Its not a baby or womens powder - it smells really good.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> As always Amazon delivers as advertised, I am pleased.  Burton</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t smelled the sport scent before buying it.  I expected it to smell fresh &amp; clean but it&#x27;s too manly &amp; strong scented for me.</li>
    <li> Loved Shower to Shower when it first came out, then it disappeared from the shelves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad to have found it again!! Great price and rapid shipping.</li>
    <li> I use this when I groom down below to make everything go more smoothly and have less risk of nicks.  Works for my use perfectly and I haven&#x27;t even gotten close to finishing the first bottle after about a year of use.</li>
    <li> Eh.  It would be nice if I had known ahead of time that for this product &amp;#34;SPORT&amp;#34; means SMELL LIKE A GUY.</li>
    <li> almost gave it 4 stars because i don&#x27;t use it anymore because the scent is kinda strong for me. im a little sensitive to strong fragrances. It does what it needs to keeps you dry and smelling good. longer than most other powders ive used.</li>
    <li> Shower to Shower each day...helps keep odor away (and chafing)....I like it better then GB powder.  It sticks to you much better.</li>
    <li> I love the smell.. Great for use after showering before bed or work. I just wish it the smell lasted longer but overall its great!!</li>
    <li> Smells great, doesn&#x27;t clump up, Great product . Its hard to find in stores so I order  it on here form time to time.</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this scent of Shower to Shower.  It has a masculine fragrance compared to the other scents offered my Shower to Shower.</li>
    <li> The absorbent powers of this body powder are magnificent. It keeps my body all nice dry and the scent is a good manly scent, some even think it&#x27;s a cologne. Buy it already</li>
    <li> I just love this powder.  I have used it for years and just really enjoy the smell of the sport Shower to Shower.  I will continue to use this for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and smells good.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day as a part of my daily commute.  After wiping down in the office lavatory, I then use the Shower-to-shower powder as a final touch.  It is a great talc and I recommend it without reservation.</li>
    <li> It does do the job but it stinks.</li>
    <li> it served my purpose, Great to use, delivered on time, economically affordable, using everyday, and I will buy it again. I strongly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have used Shower to Shower fpr tpp many years to remember.  I always got the lavender scent but decided this time to make a change. Thought the Sport might be a little to masculine but I find it very refreshing.  It was a nice change.  I will still use the lavender as the product is excellent.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t need the other fragrances, and this is the best around for all purpose use, always have some on hand, I recommend this !</li>
    <li> The VERY BEST body powder!</li>
    <li> very satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> Great product. Can&#x27;t find in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I should have read all the reviews. Didn&#x27;t see the ones that talked about flowery scent. I&#x27;m allegeric to scents. Have to return. Very disappointed. Need a body powder that is unscented and can control body odors. Trying the regular but the cost is too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I&#x27;ve been told I will get a refund. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Addicted.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than sprays or roll/rub-on.  They should provide a coupon for a one-slot toast holder to minimize powder spread on the countertop or drawer.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great.</li>
    <li> my 85yr old brother uses this product at the place  he lives at as he likes his own stuff ya know . so it gives him peace of mind and thats what counts.</li>
    <li> It has a good scent and work well.  Don&#x27;t smell like a lady but eliminated the bad odor.  A keeper.</li>
    <li> Really great deal, two 13 oz bottles for the price of one!!  I&#x27;ll be sure to re-order this item a second time!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. My local Walmart is always out of stock .</li>
    <li> The sport smell is the best one of the bunch. it is never found in stores. I am so glad Amazon has it.</li>
    <li> Love this shtuff - After I shower I use it all over, to prevent razor burn and make my feet smell delicious! Buy this, it smells clean and handsome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and find it effectively controls sweating for hours (even in SW Florida weather).  I&#x27;ll continue to buy Shower to Shower body powder for years and recommend to others as an alternative to sticky roll-on, sprays, etc. Also...the &amp;#34;Sport&amp;#34; scent version does not overwhelm as other Shower to Shower scent varieties tend to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this stuff for about three years. Prior to this I was using Gold Bond. I think it was &#x27;desensitizing&#x27; my junk so I switched to this. I literally hate the smell of baby powder. I mean who wants to smell like a baby&#x27;s butt? So I was looking for something a little more &#x27;manly&#x27; smelling. This is exactly it. It works well in keeping &#x27;the boys&#x27; cool in the summer time and is helpful in reducing swamp @$$. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best body powder for men. I use it after a shower before going to bed. Smells great not like a girl.</li>
    <li> Great fresh scent.  Using for years but couldn&#x27;t find in local stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I sweat a lot. This makes me sweat less. And it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent. So that&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get this locally anymore. Weird. Anyway, good stuff.</li>
    <li> Living in TX, summers get brutally hot and lead to swamp rot, which leads to jock itch, which isn&#x27;t fun.  So options are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baby Powder&lt;br /&gt;Gold Bond&lt;br /&gt;Shower to Shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They all work about the same.  For pure absorbing power, I think Gold Bond might be the best.  However, Shower to Shower has a mild scent that is \\&quot;sporty\\&quot;, but not so strong that women can&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use Gold Bond, you&#x27;re going to smell like you&#x27;re 70 yrs old.  If you use baby powder, you&#x27;re going to smell like a baby.  Both Gold Bond and baby powder have such strong scents they&#x27;re overpowering.  Also, the corn starch used in baby powder tends to irritate me over time.  Gold Bond has a strong burning sensation too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget stockpiling food and ammo for the zombie apocalypse - I just ordered 6 units of this.  If they ever stop making this product or Degree deodorant, I&#x27;m in big trouble</li>
    <li> As a guy, I really don&#x27;t eant to smell like a girl.  This makes you smell like a girl.  Really not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Helps the gang in my trousers stay fresh as I run around the ICU saving lives.</li>
    <li> Love this. Have been using for over 5 years. Repeat purchase. Consistent quality. Will continue to buy. Cheers,</li>
    <li> The Sport Scent Shower to Shower is great smelling - clean and light. Does the job well. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I remember using this in college. just re-bought it. I use it under my arms, and feet. smells awesome and works great</li>
    <li> AND SO DO I WHEN HE&#x27;S WEARING IT. FINALLY A SHOWER TO SHOWER MADE 4 MEN! IT&#x27;S A VERY MASCULINE FRAGRANCE THAT COMPLIMENTS THE DEGREE DEODERANT/ANTI-PERSPERANT HE USES. ITS NOT ONE OF THOSE HEAVY, SPICEY OR MUSKY SMELLING DESIGNER ODORS. JUST A CLEAN + FRESH SCENT THAT DOESNT SMELL LIKE BABY POWDER OR WOMANS BATH POWDER. WE&#x27;RE BOTH THRILLED 2 HAVE FOUND THIS PRODUCT HERE AT AMAZON AS OUR LOCAL RITE AID DOESNT CARRY IT + EVEN IF THEY DID, IT WOULD BE WAY MORE EXPENSIVE. ..IT ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY, IN PRISTINE CONDITION + WE WILL DEFINITLY BUY AGAIN!</li>
    <li> Smells so sweet and light.  I just love it.  I haven&#x27;t found any other powder with such a wonderful fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this isn&#x27;t carried in stores near me anymore, but this is as important to me as soap.</li>
    <li> Best talcum powder ever! My mom loves it too! Unfortunately can&#x27;t find it at any local retailers.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this product. Has a light scent, fresh and clean. Thanks for providing such a great product. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for years. Started when I borrowed someone else&#x27;s Shower to Shower in a pinch and thought it worked great, but being a guy I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the fragrance. Saw the &amp;#34;sport&amp;#34; version in the store and tried it - haven&#x27;t looked back since. If you are active and want to stay dry, this is the goods.</li>
    <li> My husband used this every day and for some reason stores in our area don&#x27;t carry it anymore, only the girly scents, so when I found it on Amazon he was thrilled. It has a clean, sporty scent that lasts and really does work.</li>
    <li> great product, I&#x27;m a long time fan.</li>
    <li> Great manly scent and my wife loves the smell on me.</li>
    <li> I currently work in Afghanistan and through the summer you instantly start to sweat when you walk out of any air conditioned building.  I would use them after my showers and it really helped me stay fresh and feel fresh throughout the day even though it was a very hot, sticky, climate.  I love the smell as well.</li>
    <li> Love this powder. I can&#x27;t find this scent any where in the stores and I don&#x27;t like smelling like a musty flower in the heat of the day. I am in and out of the weather all day with my job and need something that helps keep me dry and smelling nice, this is the product for me!</li>
    <li> Love it! Can&#x27;t live without it (at least not willingly!).  Has a lovely scent much better than high priced strong perfumes.  A must for hot summer days - makes you feel cool and dry.  I&#x27;ve purchased multiple times from Amazon because none of the local stores carry it.</li>
    <li> This powder keeps me dry and feeling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll love it. Buy it and use it. I recommend&lt;br /&gt;it unconditionally.</li>
    <li> Keeps you dry and doesn&#x27;t smell like baby powder.</li>
    <li> As a wheelchair bound disabled individual with incontinence, I know how important it is to stay dry and comfortable.  Powder is a MUST in our survival kit!  However, in the past I always felt self conscious about how I smelled.  What I mean by that is that I never cared for the \\&quot;fresh baby scent\\&quot; that your usual powder exudes.  The thought of my younger relatives asking \\&quot;Why does Uncle Bryan smell funny?\\&quot; was never far from my mind.  Until now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a nice \\&quot;sporty\\&quot; scent that is not too overpowering while handily doing what powder should do.  You use this with confidence that you can smell like a fresh adult and not a baby in swaddling diapers.  Thank you Shower to Shower.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I am not greatly allergic to anything so I can&#x27;t speak for its hypoallergenic quality.  I will say that I have used it for quite some time without ill effects and that it washes away easily without clumping.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product more to my fellow similarly challenged friends.  Be protected and comfortable without smelling like a baby or a hospital patient.  Since anything that helps boost your mental state is worth its weight in gold I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.  Also, I imagine that the easy open top and larger, easily grippable container will be beneficial for those with limited hand grip strength.</li>
    <li> For some reason, this product seems to be hard to find in various stores. I am glad I found it online.</li>
    <li> Well there&#x27;s not much to be said, this stuff did the trick when nothing else I&#x27;ve tried could. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves Shower to Shower products and I love the smell of this powder. It&#x27;s so sporty and cool.</li>
    <li> This is a welcome change from the original types fo S toS.  Thank you</li>
    <li> The scent is a little lite for me.  I prefer a stronger smell.  I can barely smell it when it is on me.  Otherwise it is normal body powder (i.e. it obsorbs moisture).</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. I definitely recommend it.</li>
