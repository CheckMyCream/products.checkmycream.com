<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather well at all.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious, and really gets the job done. I rarely have to use conditioner in my girls&#x27; hair after using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I had severe scalp problems for the last several years.  I grew up using ordinary commercial shampoo, but in my 40s I thought I was losing hair by my temples.  On advice, I switched to a shampoo that promotes a healthy hair-growing environment.  That helped a little for a few years, but eventually stopped doing even the little good it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to herbal shampoos.  Hooray for natural products, right?  No, not right.  I tried 8-10 of them.  I developed horrible scalp problems (red, peeling, itchy).  I tried rotating the shampoos, which was a little help, but not much.  Finally, I thought that since I&#x27;m allergic to some plants, perhaps some of the herbal ingredients were causing my problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to Sweet Baby Shampoo and had immediate relief.  It is wonderful.  I know some reviewers had problems with it, but guess what?  Each individual is different!  Wow, what a stunning thought!  The glorified natural ingredients harmed me.  The ingredients in Sweet Baby Shampoo help me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Sweet Baby Shampoo.  It is gentle and cleans well.  For the first time in my life, I don&#x27;t need so-called conditioner afterward.  I can comb my hair right after washing it (although I don&#x27;t).  I would recommend it to anyone.  But be sensible.  Know your body&#x27;s reactions and don&#x27;t use anything that hurts you, and don&#x27;t think of reviewers as experts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, one last thought.  It&#x27;s slow, but my hair seems to be growing back.  It&#x27;s too soon to guess how it will turn out because I&#x27;ve been using Sweet Baby for only 2-3 weeks.  If I remember, I&#x27;ll update about the hair regrowth.</li>
    <li> I tested this shampoo before using it for our newborn who is expected to arrive in about 3 months...I have found many organic shampoos and washes to have this pungent, chemically-smell, like you&#x27;re washing yourself with dishwashing liquid, but this shampoo smells wonderful...very coconut-y. It also left my hair super soft. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love the ingredients and knowing how safe it is to use on my kids.  My 7 year old son refuses to use any other shampoo.  I think we&#x27;ve used all the different varieties and find them all wonderful smelling.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo on both my 3 year old daughter (who has long fine hair) and my 3 month old baby.  It works wonderfully on both.  I love that it isn&#x27;t full of chemicals.  I use the Unscented on my baby, and the Coconut Baby on my toddler.  The Coconut Baby smell so good that I&#x27;m considering using it on myself!  Their lotion is great too.</li>
    <li> We love this shampoo - and our baby does too! We have used it since the first bath, and can&#x27;t get enough! Not only does it smell great, a bottle also lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and bodywash around! My 3 yr old son has very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate his skin. This shampoo does not have any chemicals or questionable ingredients in it. And it smells really nice which is a plus</li>
    <li> I read somewhere that the sodium laurel sulfate type additives in most shampoos contributed to skin and scalp itching in some people. So I searched for a &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; product and bought Sweet Baby, unscented. Since I shampoo in the shower I thought maybe I&#x27;d have some luck by using a nicer shampoo. I had been miserable, kept awake at night by itching skin and scalp for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin itching stopped on day one! Scalp itching stopped on day one! The End.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never use anything else but Sweet Baby.</li>
    <li> The best organic baby shampoo, hands down!  Have tried others, but neither the product nor the ingredients compare.</li>
    <li> The bottle looks smaller than I expected. But the shampoo is much better than I expected. It made my hair looks fuller and healthier. I&#x27;m not too crazy with the scent though. But it smells good on my daughter&#x27;s hair, very sweet. I will get unscented one for myself. A great shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and sensitive to chemical damage. It gets greasy very fast and I used to have to wash it every day. I have tried tons of different shampoos and every one of them contributed even more to my hair loss and split ends. When I tried organic Sweet Baby Shampoo after all these generic, full of chemicals, brands, I was instantly surprised by the results it gave me. Not only my hair was soft, shiny and had a healthy look, but also it did not get greasy as fast as it used to. Now I wash my hair every other day and am very happy I have finally found a product I was looking for so long.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product! Was looking for a natural shampoo/body wash for my little ones and found it with this one. I love the smells too. Coconut and Tropical are both great. Coconut is a very mild, subtle smell and tropical is more of a fun smell. Smells great on my babies! Have ordered it twice and plan on continuing to order!</li>
    <li> My only concern before I bought the product had been that it was not &#x27;tears-free&#x27;  - but this is no longer a concern since I have found it to be very gentle and non-irritating for my baby!  Great product overall - so happy to have found a natural shampoo/body wash at an affordable price!</li>
    <li> I do hope this company sticks around.  This shampoo is the best I have ever used. No itching, no burning, just pleasant smelling, clean, silky hair.</li>
    <li> It has a great smell.  I wish my kids were a little easier when it comes to washing their hair but that has nothing to do with the shampoo.  ;)</li>
    <li> Started using it after the Earth Mama Angel Baby wash dried out my newborn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is 15 months old and I&#x27;m stocking up for my new babe due in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing (tried coconut, tropical, pear and have a bottle of vanilla waiting), makes my babes silky as all get out and leaves them so squeaky clean but not at all dry. We never have to use lotion. I&#x27;m buying this as shower gifts too. It&#x27;s just that good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is I wish it was more readily available and in the larger sizes/lotion.</li>
    <li> I have been experiencing allergic reactions to shampoo and cream rinse and ordered this product in the Vanilla scent which is lovely. In just a few days - my hives appear to be diminished...and the shampoo is not harsh at all. My hair is fuller and has body. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love that this is chemical-free. I have been using the coconut but just tried tropical and like it even more! Very gentle scent. A little bit of a strange \\&quot;after scent\\&quot; (like \\&quot;after taste\\&quot;) but it&#x27;s still really nice. Great lather and easy to put on a washcloth before soaping up the babes. Wish it were tear-free but I understand that chemicals make it that way. Never knew that before buying this product! I definitely recommend for peace of mind alone.</li>
    <li> This soap was purchased when my young 18 month old son was experiencing a rash. I am not certain this was what cleared up the rash. Could&#x27;ve been? Too many co-founding variables. It is rather expensive but cost isn&#x27;t a factor when it comes to the baby boy.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is excellent!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, flat hair and this shampoo does not weigh my hair down, but keeps it healthy and clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, like many others, am trying to cut back the number of nasty chemicals that my system absorbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Living Proof Restore, but it is so so expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started using this shampoo with the Living Proof Restore conditioner and I don&#x27;t see any negative results!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo lathers very well. It does not seem to dry my scalp or my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dye my hair and it does not strip out the color, but let&#x27;s it gradually fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent, I highly recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you know?? You can also use it as a body wash?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, also, I&#x27;m not a baby. This does great on adult hair, too. :)</li>
    <li> I got the unscented shampoo to be my baby girl&#x27;s first product, and it worked beautifully!  Best of all, you need very, very little and so one bottle lasted well over a year! I bought a a more pricy &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; brand (Petit Phyto) after that, but my daughter&#x27;s skin reacted with a mild, but red and bumpy rash all over her body that lasted for a week. :-( I just bought my second bottle of the Sweet Baby.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my 2 yr old daughter over the summer and loved it.  When I became a mother I was shocked at all the baby products out there with parabens, endocrine disruptors and nasty carcinogenic chemicals (looking at you Johnson and Johnson No Tears!).  I&#x27;ve tried a few natural shampoos for her and this is one of the best.  It smells really nice but it&#x27;s not overwhelmingly fragrant (I order the coconut scent) and a little goes a long way (our first bottle lasted months).  It does get sudsy but not a crazy amount which is because it is sulfate free.  When I use it for myself, I apply it to very wet hair.  For my daughter, there is a never an issue of it not getting sudsy enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t tear free but I would prefer not to buy tear free after finding out that those shampoos are that way due to anesthetizing agents (more chemicals).  We are just a little more careful to make sure it doesn&#x27;t get in our daughter&#x27;s eyes and it hasn&#x27;t been much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish this company would make conditioners and spray-on detanglers.  If the owner reads this review, please consider doing so and thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> This makes my hair soft and shiny.  Rinses out of my hair more easily then other shampoos, with oily hair and hard water this is very important for me. I also like the fact that this is organic and seems much more natural then other shampoos. I got a bottle in Feb and I am still using it (near the bottom now in June) so even if the bottle is small it last quite a while if you don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday.  I wash mine every other day because I have oily hair.  I don&#x27;t recommend using it everyday as it will probably dry out your hair.  I am an adult, but this shampoo works for me, although I do have fine hair and not a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> Been systematically getting away from the harmful additives and going organic or as near to organic as I can.  The light smell of pear is very pleasant and it cleans my hair great!  I am very pleased to find it works so well without the things that can affect my health.  So glad to have found the product and its not just for babies at all.  Will buy again when about 2/3 used up.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for my daughter since she was 2 months. I love that it&#x27;s natural and chemical free, but still smells amazing. It&#x27;s not oily, too concentrated, or under concentrated, it&#x27;s perfect! It&#x27;s a small bottle but you only need to use a small amount so it lasts for awhile.</li>
    <li> My daughter is not scratching his head after this shampoo (she scratched his head after all the other shampoos that we tried).&lt;br /&gt;I recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sooo excited to have found an organic baby shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have parabens,sulfates and all the other yucky gunk that doesn&#x27;t need to be in shampoo. It smells wonderful and love its a body wash and shampoo all in one. Ive even used it on my own hair..found a lifetime customer!!</li>
    <li> I like that this gentle yet effective shampoo is all natural.  Every other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo seems to have one or two of the undesirable ingredients.</li>
    <li> its good as a body wash not a shampoo. leaves a heavy residue in hair.</li>
    <li> The soap suds up well, smells like vanilla and washes out pretty cleanly. I would recommend this shampoo for kids!</li>
    <li> My son and I are allergic to a plethora of chemicals. We both break out... But not to this! this is perfect. I had used this on him as a baby but then couldn&#x27;t find it for months, until it recently became available again. It leaves my son smelling so sweet, even the unscented leaves this great soft clean baby smell. Nothing strong, just perfect.</li>
    <li> I gave 4 stars only because of one issue. I am a 72 year young senior and I would suggest a slight change in packaging. The bottle gets very slippery because of it&#x27;s smooth as glass surface and slippage causing foot injury is a real possibility. I love the shampoo because it does the job on my scalp ( notice I did not say hair) and the little hair I have left. without chemicals. We all know that cancer is aggravated if not caused by chemicals, so organic is the way to go especially for children.</li>
    <li> I bought this originally for my daughter who has eczema and then used it myself and was hooked.  It has helped my daughters eczema and keeps my hair soft and frizz free, no conditioner needed. Love it!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shampoo that would be safe for my kids AND actually work.  This is it!  I first tried the unscented kind (for the kiddos) and have just ordered the tropical baby.  When the shampoo arrived I decided to try it myself since I saw some adults used it as well.  Now both my husband and I are hooked on Sweet Baby!  This is the first time I have been able to use a shampoo and not need a conditioner!  I know others have complained that they just make a shampoo instead of both shampoo and conditioner- but seriously- this is ALL you need.  I apply it, gently run my fingers through my hair to get any tangles out and work the shampoo in, and then rinse.  My hair is so incredibly soft after using it.  I am completely in love with this product- I am so glad I gave it a shot!  You should try it as well- you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Also, when washing my baby, I used a damp washcloth above his eyebrows to keep it out of his eyes like they recommend and it worked great.  I am so happy to have finally found the perfect shampoo!</li>
    <li> This is my 4th bottle. Nice smell and it feels clean!</li>
    <li> I have been using Sweet Baby Organic Shampoo for about a year now and  I love this product. I am a mother of five children and have tried many products on the market and will now use no other but this shampoo . Sweet baby organics not only contains safe organic ingredients , it is emollient  and comes in wonderful natural fragrances. Having family members with sensitive allergy prone skin ,it is great to find a product that does not cause irritation . This is truly a great product!</li>
    <li> This shampoo isn&#x27;t just good for babies or women, it&#x27;s amazing for anyone, this is simply the best all natural shampoo I have ever used. I got the coconut scent and it smells great without being overpowering, it lathers extremely well for a sulfate free shampoo and you can also use it as a body wash which is a great bonus since my skin is sensitive to most products with chemicals out there. It has also helped with my dandruff and itchy scalp and actually makes my hair look thicker without making it look oily and I didn&#x27;t even need to use a conditioner with this, this is the only shampoo I have ever used that I did not need to use a conditioner. My hair feels soft and smooth after. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this shampoo and will continue to buy this line of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does for my hair (23 year old male)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.Cleans and moisturizes making it soft and smooth without a need for a conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.Gives my hair more volume and a thicker appearance without making it oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.I am shedding a lot less hair in the shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is simply the best, for people with extreme sensitivity use the unscented version but remember it may dry out your scalp if you overuse it, which is why I use the coconut one.</li>
    <li> A little but goes a long way. Smells amazing.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful product and I would recommend it anyone. We bought the \\&quot;Coconut Baby\\&quot; scent and it smells just divine!!  The product lathers very well and rinses very clean and leaves a great scent.  I am very excited about trying all the products in this line!!!! I have read they will be coming out with a conditioner soon I will be first in line to purchase that.</li>
    <li> We have tried lots of different products for our 3 kiddos that have always had sensitive skin/eczema patches. Aveeno, Johnsons and Johnsons sensitive and various natural/organic online products (not sold in stores that I have seen). This is the first one that actually smells good (their hair smells nice after washing, unlike many of the other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or organic products). Plus, their skin is finally clear!! Love using this product! We have been using the coconut baby (fabulous!!) and hope to try some of the others soon!</li>
    <li> ...and the fact that it&#x27;s safe for my baby&#x27;s skin?  Non-negotiable!  Thank you Sweet Baby for making a wonderful product that I can feel good about using!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! Have ordered it over and over, and recently got my roommate hooked too. I buy Tropical Baby and it smells delicious - my checkout clerk at Trader Joes the other day wouldn&#x27;t stop raving about how good my hair smelled haha. I&#x27;ve also tried their Paradise Island shampoo when this one is out - same ingredients, same scent ratio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard that more natural shampoos have issues with lathering, but thats not a problem here. I have thick hair and a normal amount of shampoo is plenty!</li>
    <li> Love the natural ingredients--great for my little ones and for the Earth. I also use it for shaving. The smell is amazing! It is a sweet, creamy coconut scent that I can smell in my kids hair the whole next day, but not in an overwhelming way. Their hair and skin seems extra soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was taken aback by the fact that this wash/shampoo is not tear-free. I even tested a tiny bit in my own eye and it does sting quite a bit. However, I&#x27;ve used it every other night to wash my three kids&#x27; (5yo, 3yo, and 7 months) for the past month+ and have never gotten it in any of their eyes even once. I explained to my older kids how to keep their eyes closed and lean their heads back while it rinses out. They were nervous at first, but don&#x27;t seem to even think about it now. My 5yo son even comments on how great it smells (: I&#x27;m planning to try some of the other scents.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for myself recently and I absolutely love it.  Definitely the best natural shampoo I have found.  Lathers well, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  I just bought the adult version of the shampoo and am looking forward to similar results.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! Smells amazing and is so much healthier than most other products.</li>
    <li> I DIDN&#x27;T REALIZE THIS WAS THEIR KID FORMULA BUT USE IT AND LOVE IT! MAKES MY HAIR HEALTHIER AND STRONGER. WIS THEY MADE CONDITIONER.</li>
    <li> The only thing i use on the younger boys.  I have used both unscented and coconut.</li>
    <li> When I typically buy shampoos that are better for mine or my daughters hair, they usually never have a smell and when they do it&#x27;s not pretty. I love the smell and feel of my toddlers hair.</li>
    <li> I went through a stage where I began freaking out about all of the chemicals in our health and beauty products. I spent hours and hours browsing the internet and amazon looking for a nice smelling, chemical free shampoo to use on my 18 month old son. I bought this product along with several others and let me just say that this product wins hands down. I bought the tropical baby scent and everyone loves it. Some can even smell it the next day. It hasn&#x27;t burned my son&#x27;s eyes and he really seems to prefer it over all other&#x27;s we&#x27;ve used. I love it so much that I&#x27;m going to purchase my very own bottle. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I know it says it&#x27;s all natural - but it does make my baby to tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also allergic to most cosmetics and perfumes so we normally use non fragrant cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;I thought that getting this natural shampoo I could get a scented version, but the smell makes me sneeze.</li>
    <li> I have been on a hunt for a less chemical-laden shampoo for my toddler and when I found this product, I ordered the coconut scent.  Unfortunately, I did not end up liking the smell of the shampoo after my son&#x27;s bath was completed.  I emailed the company to give them some feed back on my experience with the smell and  the company went above and beyond, in my opinion, to try to help me find a scent I did like (which ended up being the vanilla scent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish I could change was that the shampoo be tear-free, but I know that&#x27;s just not possible without adding tear-duct numbing chemicals.  For now, I&#x27;m just extra careful to not get the shampoo into my son&#x27;s eyes. Overall, I love the lather of the product; it&#x27;s very rich and leaves even my hands super soft after bathing my son.</li>
    <li> This has become my go to baby shampoo.  My first concern was toxicity and I was happy with the ingredient list on this brand.  I tried a couple other natural brands and like this one better.  It is not too expensive, cleans well, leaves hair and skin soft and smelling great.  I really like the tropical baby and sugar cookie scents and will be trying the pear scent next.</li>
    <li> With the birth of my third baby, I was looking for a product that was truly safe for an infant&#x27;s super sensitive skin. I purchased the coconut scent and both my husband and I really liked how simple the scent was. It really makes you realize how overdone and artificial most other coconut scented products are. We have ended up using it on all three little ones and myself with really good results. My three year old had broken out and after the first time of using it, her skin was clear again so this is now her go to body wash. It lathers well, lasts a really really long time and smells wonderful. If you are on the fence due to the cost, don&#x27;t be. We have had the larger bottle for over 2 months and are just over half way done.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed by this product.  Its smelled ok.  I  was disappointed when i realized that it is not tear-free.</li>
    <li> Not a single dandruff after one use, also leaves hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> The fragrance proved annoying and it failed to leave hair feeling clean. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have used it everyday since I purchased it. Husband likes it too. I first tried it at my sister&#x27;s house and had to buy it as soon as I got home. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have used the product and I am very satisfied.  It made my hair really shiny, lathered good. I wanted a shampoo that was natural and I found it. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I am one of those people who must use unscented products, but because of a skin condition, I also cannot be exposed to SLS.  There are great unscented shampoos with sulfates in them available, but fragrance-free shampoos that are also SLS free are difficult to find. There are other shampoos out there that qualify on both counts, and I think I&#x27;ve tried the vast majority of them.  Unfortunately, they leave my hair flat, dull and shapeless.  Like a continual bad hair day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this shampoo. So much so that it prompted me to write my first Amazon review.  It leaves my hair shiny, with bounce and very maneageable.  I really don&#x27;t know how they do it, but this is fantastic shampoo, especially if you have thin hair that needs every bit of \\&quot;body\\&quot; it can muster.</li>
    <li> I bought this around the end of 2011 for when my son arrived and he is 21 months old and there is still a small amount in the bottle! I absolutely love the coconut smell. It is super gentle and never bothered my sons eyes. Now we mostly use it as a body wash for him because we are getting off the shampoo train, but we use this when we need a crap free shampoo every now and then. Will be purchasing another bottle very soon!</li>
    <li> this shampoo leaves hair soft and smooth. A little goes a long way. We have been using this for almost an year for for the entire family. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sweet Baby Shampoo now for over two years. My first purchase was Tropical Baby. I began using it for my twins along with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap. I have always been very careful about the products I use on their skin. I have been very pleased with this product. A little bit goes a long way and it smells divine! I am now using this shampoo/body wash for my third child as well. I just bought the Vanilla Baby scent and I love it! My little one smells like a little Christmas cookie! Yum! I am now using it as my sole shampoo/body wash/soap for all three of my children. I love knowing that I&#x27;m not using any harsh chemicals on my children and they smell so lovely after a bath. Thanks for this product! I plan on being a long-term customer!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It has done wonders on our children&#x27;s hair, who have super curly hair. Their hair looks much better, previous shampoo made it look dull and dry.</li>
    <li> I am a 58 year old woman with extremely dry, very curly, frizzy hair and very dry skin.  I tried this product because of all the good reviews and I am so glad that I did!  I use the Unscented Baby Shampoo for both shampoo and bath gel and my hair and skin have never been better. My hair is less dry and my skin is so soft that it is like a miracle to me! I would love to try the Angel Baby Scent but have not been able to find it yet.  I bought a second bottle for my 82 year old mother who lives in a nursing home and she loves it too!</li>
    <li> I bought this in coconut for my three month old son and I love it. He has eczema and this shampoo does NOT worsen his symptoms. The coconut smell is divine,  not overpowering at all, in my opinion. The texture is on the creamy side but rinses clean without hassle or stress. I finished off the first bottle and reordered in the sugar cookie, which I think is maybe too sweet, but thats jyst me. I will continue to use this shampoo for my son. Oh, it also bubbles nicely so doubles as a bubblebath!!</li>
    <li> Great product, our baby loves it and we love the smell!</li>
    <li> I have the bad habit of jumping the gun but so far this shampoo is AMAZING on my hair!!  My hair is soft and it smells LOVELY and My hair is shiny and I&#x27;m just happy happy happy because I have such dry dull hair but SO FAR once again, it is working like a miracle !!  Thank you Sweet Baby Shampoo!!!!!!  &#x3D;-)</li>
    <li> I ordered the coconut scent. It smells delicious. It makes my hair soft and smooth, and I appreciate it&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; compared to the majority of toxic shampoos on the market.</li>
    <li> this shampoo smells great and leaves your hair feeling amazing. i am an adult and i use this shampoo. the only thing is it doesnt foam up like other shampoos. i dont know if this is a bad thing. it doesnt really bother me.</li>
    <li> Smelled great but badly dried my hair out. No amount of deep conditioning afterwards could control the frizz.</li>
    <li> I really like the Pear one.  I have been trying to grow my hair and is very picky on what I use.  So far this is one shampoo I&#x27;m sticking with.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and I only have to wash my hair twice a week and still smells awesome!</li>
    <li> Great product. No problem with drying out our daughters skin. It&#x27;s not a tear free formula, so be aware that your child needs to close their eyes to prevent burning (or parents be careful). Only complaint is the price. It is so expensive for such a small bottle. I&#x27;d buy more of it, if it was even just a bit cheaper.</li>
    <li> After I washed my daughters hair, she fell in love with it. First of all it smells yummy, don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it just a little and it does its job. I have noticed after one week, my daughters hair became more softer, shinier and thicker. This shampoo is not tear free so I would recommend to use this for bigger kids not infants or toddlers.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo!  Use it on all my kids and myself.  I got the coconut scent, and I love it.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product for my hair.  Currently, it is the only product that helps minimize my scalp issues.  Further, it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance in it so it doesn&#x27;t exacerbate my allergies.  Definitely plan on ordering more of it in the future.</li>
    <li> I have used several different types of shampoo over the years.  Sweet Baby shampoo is the best yet!  As I&#x27;ve gotten older my hair has become more difficult to manage---dry and dull.  Sweet Baby shampoo has brought the shine back.  My hair looks and feels so much better.  I initially tried it based on the positive customer reviews posted on Amazon.  I just reordered it---it is a great product!</li>
    <li> My three year old daughter&#x27;s hair was brittle and very rough. I decided to look for a sulfate free shampoo for her and stumbled upon Sweet Baby shampoo. The reviews were all very positive. I am very pleased with this product for many reasons. First, it is so gentle on her hair and skin. Her hair is clean but not stripped down. She also has eczema and have no problems using this product as an all in one. It lasts FOREVER! I just received my third bottle (2/2015) and the last purchase was May 2014 and I use it on two kids! You don&#x27;t have to use a ton on them. As a bonus, it smells great. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo for my kids (newborn and 3 yrs old). I got the tropical scent and I really like it!  Most other natural shampoos smell like essential oils; which I don&#x27;t care for...this shampoo is not like that though! It also works well, my 3yr old&#x27;s hair seems softer since switching to this shampoo.</li>
    <li> OK-Doesn&#x27;t have many of the unacceptable shampoo ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for myself as well as for my 5year old and 3 year old daughters. I feel this is the best shampoo that I have used so far</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried this shampoo!  I had been using Pantene for many years and for the last couple my hair was looking oily by mid day at the scalp and dry on the ends.  My hair also was falling out at an alarming rate.  I just figured I was doomed to mid life hair thinning like my mom and grandma.  I did have the doctor run blood tests just to rule out any medical condition for the hair loss.  2 months ago I went to a new hair dresser who recommended that I switch to a sulfate free shampoo.  I&#x27;m happy to say that not only has my hair stopped falling out, it is filling back in.  The mid day oily look has stopped and my ends are no longer dry and frizzy.  Money well spent!</li>
    <li> Very  nice and the fragrance is not overwhelming.  Great for my my granddaughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Makes my 2 year old girl&#x27;s hair smell funny after just a couple hours.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. I was looking a a scent free organic shampoo with natural ingredients and as little chemicals as possible. Came across this product while browsing Amazon reviews. I keep reordering it after trying it for the first time. My hair looks healthy and feels strong and smooth. It doesnt dry my scalp. A good product overall.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat customer of these products. I have searched for a good sulfate-free shampoo, and have finally found one that I love. I was very happy with the amount of lather this shampoo produced and I love the scents. The fact that it is a body wash as well is an added bonus. Rinses clean and leaves both my hair and body feeling clean but not dry. Shipping is always fast and the products packaged well. I am very pleased with this company&#x27;s products and customer service.</li>
    <li> I use it for myself and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it. Cutting out all of the sulfates, parabens, etc. has REALLY helped my hair and I wash my hair everyday. Much less breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the bottle were bigger, because you tend to use more than the over-the-counter stuff, which have all of the lathering agents (sulfates).</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these, one for my young son the other for my 5 year old daughter.  They smell wonderful, are a great shampoo, and I don&#x27;t have to work about any crazy chemicals and preservatives in them.  I definitely recommend!</li>
