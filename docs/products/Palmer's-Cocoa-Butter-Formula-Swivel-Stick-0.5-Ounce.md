<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My boyfriend went through five sticks of this. He&#x27;s tried ten different brands after reading extensively the reviews for each and this one worked the best. He&#x27;s sort of a chapstick connoisseur... I on the other hand can&#x27;t use up one stick before loosing it to save my life.</li>
    <li> The best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s the only one that actually works and I have tried many brands.</li>
    <li> Ordered this three-pack last year, right before the winter. Time for another threesome. I keep one in my purse and others in the nightstand and use one on my lips, the other on elbows, feet and instead of cuticle cream on my nails. Awesome moisturing without an oily feel. They are unscented.</li>
    <li> Good price and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> The Swivel Stick is the best. **another purchase and loving it</li>
    <li> Only thing that prevented chapped/ split lips this winter</li>
    <li> I actually wonder if the rest of the reviewers actually have dry lips... I used to use Flexitol till I ran out of it. This one is no way near it. My lips are just DRY.</li>
    <li> I will use this product for the rest of my life.  I&#x27;ve used Palmer&#x27;s on my lips for years and have never found a moistener I like better.  I have one in my coffee table drawer, one in my bedside table, one in my purse, one for work.....</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I am using it on every part of skin that is dry and scaly.  It is so moist and really non greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a huge cocoa butter fan since childhood, ever since I fell and gashed my face in elementary school (needed stitches and all) and my mother nursed my skin back to its flawless state with a jar of cocoa butter. I was delighted to find it in swivel stick form, which is convenient to carry around as a lip balm or just ot have on hand. I should also add that I&#x27;ve tried other brands like Queen Helene and the smell alone is not as pleasant so I stick to Palmer&#x27;s brand. Can speak to the effectiveness of the other brands either.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. My 2-year-old daughter has eczema and I have found that Palmers is one of the few things that her skin accepts without irritation and soothes the eczema. However, rubbing lotion all over her while she squirms around and tries to eat it (yes, she eats it if she gets the chance. in her defense, it does smell good) is not my favorite task. So, when I saw these I ordered them right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great. I can just rub them on the areas that she needs it. Also, she has a scar on her lip from cleft lip surgery as an infant.  I had read or seen somewhere that it helps to fade scars. This is really easy to apply to her scar, which is virtually invisible at this point. I don&#x27;t know if it the cocoa butter has contributed to that, but it couldn&#x27;t hurt. I would not be without this product now.</li>
    <li> Target stopped carrying this product.  I don&#x27;t know why, because it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I have became way too dependent on chapstick, so at a friend&#x27;s suggestion, I decided to use cocoa butter (since the other alternative, Vaseline, is nearly unbearable) to wean myself away from chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cocoa butter stick has the consistency of a soft chapstick and feels great. I have definitely noticed a decreased need to apply it to my lips (compared to chapstick before) after using this for a few weeks. It also smells great, which is a plus, since some chapsticks can sort of smell synthetic and strange on occasion. Liberally applying this to my lips about every 2 hours has caused the sticks to last about 3-4 weeks each; and I think that&#x27;s an over-estimate of use. All-in-all, the sticks last a pretty good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stick can also be used for a bunch of other applications in a pinch. Dry hands/nail-beds, itchy bug-bites, sore/dry nose, sunburn, etc. It&#x27;s sort of like nature&#x27;s wonder material for dermatological maladies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should note that the size of the stick is pretty big. It&#x27;s much larger than a normal chapstick, perhaps a bit smaller than the size of one of the Elmer&#x27;s glue sticks you used to use in grade-school...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy the cocoa butter at my local pharmacy, but I noticed this pack of 3 had a cheaper price-per-unit than the in-store version, so I opted to buy them in \\&quot;bulk\\&quot; and keep the three sticks in three locations I use them the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works good and smells good.  I use one stick as a lip balm and I use the other stick to just smear it on my face when it seems to be extra dry.  Works good.</li>
    <li> You lips will drink this up,please buy it in the 3 pack,pass it out,everyone will thank you</li>
    <li> Great texture and smell! Love them!</li>
    <li> This is, in my humble opinion, the greatest chapstick in the 🌎.  I have rather large lips and searched for a long time for something that didn&#x27;t dry out my lips and/or make me addicted. I can use this and if I make a mistake and leave it at home my lips are still fine for the day. That being said, I love to use it all the time because it makes my lips feel good and look soft, and it&#x27;s kind of invisible, unlike all the glossy products out there.  Also, doesn&#x27;t contain petroleum, which may or may not matter to others, but I prefer it that way.</li>
    <li> Love this product, great moisturizer for your face too!</li>
    <li> Good stuff, good price, as advertised.</li>
    <li> I soo love this things I keep one everywhere. I use as chap sticks and in the winter around my eyes. It as also helped me grow my eyelashes and eyebrows. Its a must have!</li>
    <li> This product is the absolute best for lips.  Not greasy.  Healing.  Can use on any part of body.  Easy to handle, to carry.</li>
    <li> The item arrived exactly as photographed and described. Sadly I found out I am allergic; I was able to give the others away to a friend.</li>
    <li> It seems to be doing something for me, but I am not saisfied with the small bit of results, after having surgery 5 months ago.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Once I received the first one I ordered more for my family.  I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Love this for chapped lips buy it all the time. Its smooth and works well.</li>
    <li> Love the product but for some reason thought these were the size of normal chapsticks.  They really are the size of glue sticks!  WOW! More bang for your buck - that&#x27;s for sure!  THe coca butter is awesome - creamy and smooth unlike the waxy and sticky other chapsticks I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Very good product to help heal and prevent eczema. I love it</li>
    <li> Never saw results with this product. The only thing that has worked for my dry, cracked lips in Ohio&#x27;s winter is Vaseline!</li>
    <li> I recommend this item. I have bought it for years. It is amazing! The price is good!!!</li>
    <li> My friend introduced me to this swivel stick years ago, i am obsessed with it! It is so soft and smooth and makes my lips feel great! I have one by my bed, which i apply every night (my lips are always chapped, year round!) in my bag and around the house! Ive only seen it at my local Target and the last few times it wasnt there so thank god for amazon!</li>
    <li> The price on this 3-pack is excellent, and the product is one of the best lip balms on the market.  The scent is a very mild vanilla or white chocolate, so it doesn&#x27;t get annoying after a while.  This formula protects my lips against our dry climate very well, and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available here on Amazon, as I haven&#x27;t seen it in my local market.</li>
    <li> only product I have used which is not oily</li>
    <li> This product has been an absolute life saver!  My daughter started  using Accutane last fall and the biggest side effect is chapped lips.  We had been using EOS lip balm but we both noticed that after wearing it for a little while it dried our lips out.  I happened to find this product in a store and purchased a bunch of it on Amazon.  It is AMAZING!  Keeps lips moisturized, especially my daughter who has had such a tough time with Accutane.  Worth a try (even comes in a version with sunscreen)</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this vitamin c serum. My dermatologist offers a similar serum for $80 and I figured I could find something just as good at a lower price. I&#x27;m glad I found this one because as far as I can tell, this serum is just as good as the expensive one. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> The (ONLY) thing that works on my lips! Getting three so I have one in my car, house, and purse. Its a lotion for your lips, not waxy or cakey feeling.</li>
    <li> Palmer&#x27;s Swivel Sticks have been a favorite of mine since high school. They last FOREVER, are super smooth and buttery feeling, and don&#x27;t leave any gross residue on your lips. Very hydrating. Palmer&#x27;s stopped making these swivel sticks a few years back, so finding them has been increasingly difficult, but Amazon&#x27;s price for the 3 pack was way low and extremely worth it! I&#x27;m set for another 15 years now!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, but have never paid this much for it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for chapped lips, dry skin on hands and feet. I live in NV where we have to use a good moisturizer and it&#x27;s especially great for those pesky dry spots.  I keep one in my purse.</li>
    <li> Best cocoa butter ever!</li>
    <li> This was actually an impulse buy, as I was trying to find another item of Palmer&#x27;s but this caught my eye. I&#x27;ve always had chapped lips, and I&#x27;ve used eos, nivea, chapstick brand, freaking everything. I have eczema on my legs, and my family jokes around that I have it on my lips too - yep, not so funny after hearing it a few times a week. I&#x27;ve always heard cocoa butter works like a charm on dry skin and stretch marks so maybe some miracle it would work on me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OOOOH man. I had no idea this was out there and it changed my life. Well not super dramatically, but I don&#x27;t have chapped lips anymore! God I love this chapstick. It&#x27;s like the angels came down and bestowed this chapstick on my amazon search and patted me on the head. And by the way, it has the most glorious taste, like a smooth light hint of chocolate. And yes, the chapstick tube itself is big. Dunno why there are complaints about that...like sorry the company decided to sell a larger size, therefore guaranteeing you lots of product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;-Super easy to find in a purse because of its rad size&lt;br /&gt;-Light pleasant cocoa taste that slowly fades, but moisture stays in for a long time&lt;br /&gt;-You get 3 freaking sticks for a fantastic deal, come on&lt;br /&gt;-Heals and moisturizes your lips without tingling, swelling, aching, itching, redness, etc. Just smooth sailing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;-There aren&#x27;t any cons. There really aren&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re still conflicted about buying this product even after reading my review, just slap yourself really quick and then push &#x27;Add to Cart&#x27;. And if you&#x27;re one of those people who are still concerned about the size of the stupid tube, then maybe you should reconsider your priorities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And no, I wasn&#x27;t paid to review this. I just am genuinely in love with this swivel stick chapstick thing.)</li>
    <li> Must have for me for the last 10+ years.</li>
    <li> A PRODUCT I HAVE USED FOR ABOUT TWO DECADES NOW - WHY, BECAUSE IT WORKS AND THE SIZE OF CONTAINER IS, FOR A MAN, JUST PERFECT. R.D.A.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it as chap stick and for rough spots</li>
    <li> Better than chapstick, have to have one everywhere, in my car, in my desk drawer at work, in my nightstand at home EVERYWHERE, love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.  It has helped me cure and prevent the chapped, cracking lips I end up with every winter.  I also saw a version with SPF 30 that I am VERY excited about for the summer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cocoa butter stick for 10 years. I first found them when I was in high school and was made fun of because it looked like I was using a glue stick on my lips, so yes it is huge but I LOVE that about it. It&#x27;s so much easier to find in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my lips every single night before bed and that stick lasts about 6 months, as does the one I keep in my purse to use when I go out--and this is applying it liberally. It feels so amazing on my lips with no nasty taste (like some sticks I&#x27;ve used before). There&#x27;s no &amp;#34;fun flavor&amp;#34; for anyone who likes that kind of thing. I don&#x27;t, so this is perfect. My lips are immediately softer and, if I don&#x27;t use it for a while during the day and get chapped lips, it only takes a day of using it regularly to get them back to normal. But really, I don&#x27;t ever have an issue with chapped lips because of this stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I ever found was not being able to find them. I&#x27;d randomly find them at a store (and I look at pretty much every store) and buy in bulk. They&#x27;re usually about $4-5 at the store, so when I found these on Amazon last night I immediately bought them! I can&#x27;t even express my excitement at knowing I can easily buy these when I need them. I have other sticks around the house now, because I haven&#x27;t found this stick anywhere for months, and I plan to toss them all.</li>
    <li> Palmer&#x27;s makes great products, including this swivel stick.  It really is easy to use and works well.  The price at Amazon was good too.</li>
    <li> To say I&#x27;m addicted to this is an understatement! I can&#x27;t use anything else for my dry, chapped lips. It goes on smooth and stays on! My boyfriend also doesn&#x27;t mind kissing me with this on :)</li>
    <li> very fast shipping and great price.</li>
    <li> the best smooth and natural</li>
    <li> Dark Spots remain , however I do not claim that more effort or further use by needing more of this product would not help more.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on The Dr. Oz. program. I have been using it for a couple of years as a lip moisturizer, I always have one available @ home, in my car, at or work. It came highly recommended and now I would recommend it also.</li>
    <li> best lip balm ever and I have tried the ALL</li>
    <li> This is a reorder after using up three others over the year. There&#x27;s a smooth consistency to the stick when applying. It can be used for lips, elbows and other chafed areas.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all I use these days. I&#x27;ve become sensitive (tingling, burning, peeling) to several different lip products. This works best for me.</li>
    <li> I use the cocoa butter for lip balm, dry skin, etc.  It has a nice feel and lasts well.  This is a great product!</li>
    <li> i love this cocoa butter stick, I mainly use it for my lips cause they get chapped all year round. A little expensive but they bring me great relief.</li>
    <li> My wife has tried to use other brands and types but she in the end always goes with Palmers because it is the best she has found.</li>
    <li> I prefer this stick over any other brand of chapstick. Recently I discovered the lip balm size stick and am able to use that instead. Great product.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT , IF YOU HAVE DRY OR FLAKY SKIN OR LIPS, THIS WILL WORK FOR YOU. I RECENTLY HAD A FULL REPLACEMENT KNEE SURGERY AND IT ALSO WORKS WONDERS FOR THE SCARS TO HEAL</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Palmer Cocoa Butter products for two decades now....availability seems to fluctuate based on popularity. It&#x27;s always available on Amazon though, thankfully.  This stick (which you cannot tell from the pictures) is about three times the size of a Chapstik container and each lasts a long time.  Because it is cocoa butter, I not only use it on my lips but all over my face and on dry elbows and knees. (For my feet I use the container of Palmers Cocoa Butter)  I keep one in my purse all the time....it&#x27;s great for superficial cuts, burns and to stifle an insect bite until you can get to the real help.  Because of the larger size of this stick it is easy to find in a purse or knapsack, unlike smaller lip balm containers. Granted, it&#x27;s a bit bulky for you back jeans pocket but other than that it is the perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soothing and naturally tastes good because it&#x27;s cocoa butter - stays on longer than most lip balms also.  Does not freeze in the car in winter or melt in summer.  One of my all time favorite beauty/skin/lip products.</li>
    <li> I love this product and its versatility. Great price for three sticks. Great for travelling, i don&#x27;t need to carry additional lotions, hand moisturizer, face moisturizer in my hand bag! Works great on chapped, dry lips and I&#x27;ve used it as a night &amp; day face moisturizer. It is not greasy at all, and the scent seems to be lighter than the [[ASIN:B0009F3O8Q Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula with Vitamin E, 13.5 fl oz (400 ml)]]. It is a bit bigger than a regular chapstick though, but i don&#x27;t find that to be a problem at all.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 10 years.  I use it on my lips (world&#x27;s largest lip balm) and now I can&#x27;t use anything else.  Has a light cocoa butter scent.  I also use on elbows and when I travel and don&#x27;t have lotion handy.</li>
    <li> Makes my lips feel protected from the sun and wind. I love the feel when I put this on.</li>
    <li> I have trouble finding this in local stores, so was pleased to order it online. It&#x27;s my favorite lip stuff, I keep a tube handy everywhere.</li>
    <li> I called this my giant glue stick, in an endearing way. Some might not like how it&#x27;s so bulky but I personally love that because it also makes application easier. I&#x27;ve tried many lip balms product in the past. This includes Burt&#x27;s Bees, EOS, Chapstick, Aveeno, Nivea, Ocean Potion, etc. and I gotta this one does the best job a moisturizing and it stays on the longest. I have stubborn, chronically dry lips so this is saying a lot. Though I admit this could have something to do with its price. Since it&#x27;s so cheap, I&#x27;m not hesitated to put it on whenever my lips are not moisturized.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Palmer&#x27;s?  They&#x27;ve been around forever!!! I bought these for my daughter-in-law during her pregnancy and she loves them!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product that I am using on some rough patches on my face and arms. It does well at softening these spots. I&#x27;m hoping it also lightens some dark spots on my face as the product claims. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to verify that yet. I heard about this product through the Dr. Oz show when they reviewed inexpensive remedies for the problems I&#x27;m experiencing.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite chap stick and I could no longer find it in my local store...I was happy to find it here and the price is a real bargain! I bought 2 packs of 3 so that I have plenty - I&#x27;ve sat them here and there around the house so that I have one in each room. They&#x27;re also great on my knuckles which get pretty rough in the winter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for just about anything. It came packaged. One of my staple products. makes your lips so soft.</li>
    <li> This came in the same exact packaging as any drug store I have purchased it before. This will be the only way I will purchase Palmer&#x27;s in the future.</li>
    <li> I get these for applying to surgical scar, makes for easy application and keeps me from getting greasy hands :)</li>
    <li> Love, love this product.  I use it all the time.  I think it does a fantastic job keeping my lips moist.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Use this in the winter when my hands dry out.  Makes my hands feel so much better and helps heal cracks and dryness.  Found the price on Amazon to be similar if not slightly less than at the drugstore, though drugstore brands work just as well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I was a little unsure about the stick form, but it fits perfectly in my purse for carrying along with me. It works wonders on dry spots on hands, elbows, knees, and wherever else you may need it.</li>
    <li> These are great for chapstick or even really dry skin. I just roll it onto my cheeks at night for a fresher hydrated look in the morning. I also use them directly on my tattoos for moisture or cuts and scrapes. They heal so much faster!</li>
    <li> I use for lips (not addictive) and works great.  I&#x27;ve also used for skin.  Has a very pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> The best lip care product I&#x27;ve ever used. Love it. It is easy to use and fixes every problem with my lips I&#x27;ve ever had. GREAT</li>
    <li> For chapped lips, I don&#x27;t think you can do better. My daughter&#x27;s lips had become horribly chapped after all the hot Florida sun and swimming. We tried the extra-moisturizing Chapstick that is supposed to last 8 hours, but her lips kept getting worse, eventually cracking and bleeding despite using the Chapstick at least 4 times a day, and extra on swim lesson days. Her grandmother bought her some of this, swearing by it and she was right. My daughter felt relief on the first day, and by the 3rd day, her lips had healed almost completely, with no new cracks appearing. I&#x27;ve bought 2 more since then. One to keep at home, one for her book bag, and one for my purse.</li>
    <li> as a lip balm and you can&#x27;t go wrong.  It&#x27;s much better than the \\&quot;actual\\&quot; lip balms they sell out there, it softens, protects, isn&#x27;t sticky or have a bad smell/taste.  I love using this on my lips. . this and Rosebud Strawberry Lip Balm Tube are the only two lip balms in my makeup bag.  As a long time user,I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite sometime... Very good stuff for people that get chronic chapped lips!  And it feels, smells and taste great too!!</li>
    <li> It keeps my lips healthy and soft.  Clear and feels light with little to no oder.  I wish it had some SPF in it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the harder items to find in stores.  This pack of three makes an ideal purchase.  This is the best lip balm you will find.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best thing for your lips! It keeps my lips hydrated and does not dry them out....EVER! This is the only product I use and I keep it in stock.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff both as a lip gloss and a quick dry-spot remedy while I&#x27;m out and about. This is a jumbo stick which makes it look pretty silly while applying it to your lips in public. Think of it as being the girth and length of two C-batteries stacked on top of one another. That said- I like the size of it because it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> It does not last as long as I would like, but  frequent applications help make lips and skin feel good.</li>
    <li> Product also contains fragrance, mineral oil (parafinum liquidum), microcrystaline wax, benzyl alkohol, cocoa see butter, carotene 40800.&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried the product since I purchased for the child.</li>
    <li> I keep extra tubes on hand to share with friends and send out as gifts. And I keep them in every jacket pocket and purse.  A winter must.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;m 45 and moved from humid coast to arid plans and it was terrible on my skin.  I use this product on my hands elbows face and lips. Especially on the slopes.  Its my must have favorite</li>
    <li> i love this lip moisturizer. it immediately soothed my very chapped lips. pleasing taste. i think it would be good for sensitive lips. i also use it for a dry patch under my eye. very pleased.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It even out the tones in your lips and make soft without the greasy or burning feeling.</li>
    <li> I was having a hard time finding this in stores so I am really glad amazon has them and at such an affordable price. Cocoa butter is great for blemishes, dry skin patches, ect. I mainly use these swivel sticks on my lips as a daily form of chapstick. My lips are very soft and I never have to worry about them getting windburned or cracked. Plus with these bigger containers they are harder to lose. (:</li>
    <li> we love palmers and we love cocoa butter so this worked out great for our stockings.  good price and value.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it as a lip balm, keeps your lips moist for hours without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I love these sticks. I have given them to my friends to love also.  Don&#x27;t ever stop making them for us.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have been using this product for years on our lips. You can swipe it anywhere on your body for instant moisturization, but we use it just on lips. It smells/tastes amazing, lasts a long time and is priced right. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not loving this products. You can&#x27;t always find Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Swivel Stick at Ulta or drug stores, so picking it up online is a great idea.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, came quickly and as described.</li>
    <li> I use this product not only on lips but its perfect for nostrils that become raw from blowing the nose. Also great for chapped knuckles and other dry parts of the body</li>
    <li> Great for lips! I use it all year long to prevent chapping, and it&#x27;s also nice for other rough skin. Great price helps too.</li>
    <li> I have used Palmer Coco Butter Formula for many years.  I’ve tried other types of gloss, but none have the staying power or provide a continual relief throughout the day or night.  An application twice in a 24-hour span provides the continuity of moisture for my lips to help me get through my regular work day or night’s sleep.  I am particularly glad that Amazon provides a 3-stick package so I can have a spare to carry in my purse if I’m out of my normal routine. Bob&#x27;s Girl</li>
    <li> Great stick to have in your pocket on the go,even my 8 year old who did not like cocoa butter loves it. Love Palmers,they make great products at  reasonable prices.</li>
    <li> This works great for very chapped, cut bleeding lips. Apply it at night go to sleep and wake up with your lips repaired. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the new lip balm with SPF IT IS NOT the same formula and it burned my lips. Stick with this and you can&#x27;t go wrong. I just wish they would make it in a smaller tube. The scent is a little strong but somewhat comforting because it smells chocaltey.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm on the planet.  Hands down.  I used to use chapstick and for some reason burts bees and the more medicinal options actually make my lips worse.  This cocoa butter option works miracles, smells great, lasts forever and is big enough that you won&#x27;t lose it after two uses.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Have written reviews before, but don&#x27;t mind doing it again! The best chap stick in the world! I hope they never discontinue making it!</li>
    <li> I purchased the 3 pack, which is a great deal. The tubes are large. the smell is nice without a funky taste. I also use one tube for my cuticles it keeps them soft without the greasiness like oil.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money. Lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I love this small tube of cocoa butter.  I use it daily on my hands, lips and other places that need it.  Easy to dispense, just rub over the area.  Great for travel too.</li>
    <li> I love cocoa butter products, and this little stick is great. It is about the size of a small glue stick. I keep it in my purse, and I use it as lip balm, it works so much better than chapstick! It actually helps heal chapped lips instead of providing only temporary relief. My hands and face get dried out in the winter months, so I go ahead and rub it wherever I need it! It has a very subtle cocoa aroma to it, sort of an earthy, nutty smell.</li>
    <li> This is my most-loved &amp;#34;chapstick&amp;#34; of all time. I&#x27;ve been through many many seeking to find a wonderful one. I mainly use this for lip purposes and I am in awe of the smoothness and sleekness it leaves as a result. I was complimented on how moisturized my lips looked by more than a few people, also asking what I used. Referred them to this instantly. I loved that this has many more purposes, not only chapstick wise. It is amazing!</li>
    <li> My wife ordered this and loves it.  She uses it alone or under lipstick.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years as a lip balm. As far as chap sticks/lip balms, this is the only product I use. It is very moisturizing, smells good, and stays put. I have one in every room of my house. Great product!!</li>
    <li> Softens dry/cracked skin like nothing else.  This was the 2nd or third time I&#x27;ve purchased this product over Amazon and hope to continue purchasing it.</li>
    <li> PLEASE DON&#x27;T EVER STOP SELLING THIS PRODDUCT.  I&#x27;VE BEEN USING IT FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS NOW.  AND MY MOTHER ALSO LOVES IT TOO.  IT&#x27;S THE ONLY PRODUCT WE USE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WE WOULDN&#x27;T KNOW WHAT TO DO IF WE CANT PURCHASE IT FROM YOU!</li>
    <li> Love this product and use it all the time.  The swivel stick lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that has to ALWAYS have something on her lips. This is the only thing that works for me and stays on longer than 3 seconds. I love it.</li>
    <li> Me and my girlfriends can not get enough of this lip balm - it is the absolute best! Thanks xx</li>
    <li> I love using this instead of lip balm. It lasts a long time and does not dry out my lips.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it for many years and highly recommend it. You&#x27;ll also love the cocoa scent it leaves behind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for weeks now and I&#x27;m obsessed with it. You don&#x27;t have to apply it to your lips as often as other chap sticks. It&#x27;s a huge tube. You can also used it on dry skin or sunburns. It&#x27;s a perfect multipurpose stick.</li>
    <li> Better than anything else on the market and a great price.  It is very, very hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> When used as a lip balm it actually moisturizes so lips are softer even after it wears off, rather than just making them feel soft when applied like most other balms and glosses. Achieving that long lasting moisture Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter lotion is famous for on your lips? Win!</li>
    <li> my wife swears by this stuff, and we always keep 3 around the house for her because she much prefers it over chapstick. it works better and longer, and it doesn&#x27;t feel as greasy on.</li>
    <li> Palmer&#x27;s is not available locally, so I order it from Amazon.  Unlike similar products, this lasts a long time thanks to the large swivel stick, and the lip balm seems to sink in rather than simply gunking up my lips. The &amp;#34;cocoa butter formula&amp;#34; is lightly scented, unflavored, and smooth.  Reviews need to contain at least twenty words: what more can I say?  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> needed this item for my chapped lips....like the product. will order again. prompt service. would recommend to anyone. helps to heal my lips</li>
</ol>
