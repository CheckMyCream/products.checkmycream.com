      <li>Love this shade.  </li>

      <li>The parts of my hair that this worked on did look beautiful - a nice, soft, light auburn -</li>

      <li>So easy to use and color</li>
      <li>Color application is fairly quick and easy.  </li>
      <li>It finished true to color and is very gentle, too!  </li>

      <li>You won&#x27;t find this color in a semi-permanent shade anywhere else unless you are willing to fork over 5x the money.</li>
      <li>only your hairdresser knows for sure</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t even touch the gray/white streak at my temple and actually made it stand out more.</li>

      <li>strawberry blonde just right.</li>
      <li>This one did not come out anywhere near the box color.  </li>
      <li>It just naturally fades after about 3 to 4 weeks.  </li>
      <li>My hair used to be a soft auburn color...</li>
      <li>By light golden red, they mean orange.</li>
      <li>Looks like natural red.</li>
      <li>It had some red but always looked so natural.  </li>

    <li> This is the only...the ONLY.. semi-permanent red out there on the commercial/drug store market that isn&#x27;t in the  brown or highly pink family. This has nice golden undertones and works well if you are a natural redhead. It covers grays pretty well and makes your hair so soft! Definitely a great buy at this price. You won&#x27;t find this color in a semi-permanent shade anywhere else unless you are willing to fork over 5x the money. Thank God Clairol brought this color back!</li>
    <li> By light golden red, they mean orange.</li>
    <li> My hair used to be a soft auburn color... until, in my 20&#x27;s, I went gray!  I have longed to have my soft auburn color back ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began to have my hair colored in the salon.  The product that we used was very gentle, but the color was either too red or too dark.  But at least it wasn&#x27;t gray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this product on Amazon, I was thrilled!  The model&#x27;s hair color is just like my &amp;#34;born with it&amp;#34; hair color!  So I decided to give it a try myself.  I am so happy I did!  It finished true to color and is very gentle, too!  This is just right and with Subscribe and Save it costs $44 less than salon color!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found my color.</li>
    <li> I like using this color and can&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
    <li> I look like Carrot Top&#x27;s less funny cousin. My hair matched the light natural hair color example on the box almost exactly but I came out looking absolutely ridiculous. That&#x27;s what I get for buying clairol... Too bad they can&#x27;t refund my old hair.</li>
    <li> My color that I cant find at the store is here.</li>
    <li> I have used Natural instincts in the past with great results.  This one did not come out anywhere near the box color.  It was brighter red, brassy color. I had to use color remover to get this out of my hair and then applied a permanent color.  It may work better on darker hair color.</li>
    <li> Love this shade.  Looks like natural red.</li>
    <li> Absolutely my favorite color by Natural Instincts! So easy to use and color is great!</li>
    <li> only your hairdresser knows for sure</li>
    <li> Clairol used to make a Desert Sunrise color that was amazing.  It had some red but always looked so natural.  I used it for years and then suddenly they stopped making it.  Made me sad.  This color is the closest I&#x27;ve been able to get without using a regular dye-job.  I hate roots growing out and you won&#x27;t get that from this product.  It just naturally fades after about 3 to 4 weeks.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and gives nice results.</li>
    <li> just the color I was looking for, could not find in the stores and this restores my&lt;br /&gt;natural strawberry blonde just right.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered -- no more no less.</li>
    <li> It did not include the 2 week color refresher.</li>
    <li> I am naturally a dirty blonde and my hair hadn&#x27;t been dyed in several years prior to this little experiment. I thought I would try this before taking the leap to red permanent color. The parts of my hair that this worked on did look beautiful - a nice, soft, light auburn - but alas, that was like maaaybe a quarter of my hair. It didn&#x27;t even touch the gray/white streak at my temple and actually made it stand out more. To be fair, I only used one box and almost definitely should have used two. (I have long, thick hair.) My hair was incredibly soft and shiny afterward which was nice, but over all I was disappointed with the outcome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reserving the fifth star to see how it looks after it dries.</li>
    <li> Color is nice; gray coverage isn&#x27;t great, nor does it last.  Color application is fairly quick and easy.  Subscribe and save price is best part!</li>
    <li> Great Color! Perfect shade of reddish blonde, a bit darker than strawberry blonde, I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this color as they have a habit of doing for great colors.</li>
