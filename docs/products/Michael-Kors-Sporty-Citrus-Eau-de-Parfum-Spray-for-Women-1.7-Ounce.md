    <li> The scent is very strong... Can&#x27;t wear it everyday....  Unlike other perfumes, I can smell myself all day long ..a bit strong.</li>
    <li> It was my mistake. The person wasn&#x27;t stay in the house when the package was delivered and never contac me.</li>

    <li> If you like Light Blue by Dolce &amp; Gabanna, then you&#x27;ll love Sporty Citrus.  It has notes of citrus, patchouli, and something I can&#x27;t quite place.  It&#x27;s light and but not faint or fading.  Really fantastic scent.</li>

    <li> Love it! Sporty and flirty.</li>
    <li> The first time I smelled I was captivated, it smelled like the first perfume I ever remember. Then the citrus got lost to me in the floral notes and I was sad. I love citrus perfume, DKNY women, I Love Love, D &amp; G Light Blue, etc... This was less citrus then I wanted. I add my DKNY to it and am completely satisfied, but warning if citrus is all you want. This has a floral note that can be stronger than the citrus. When I think sporty, I think airy or clean, not the case here-more musky to me.</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect condition</li>
    <li> I just received a small sample of this from Macy&#x27;s, it smells so wonderful. Its a refreshing feminine citrus scent, and the parfume is very potent. Don&#x27;t use to much, one small spray will last all day. I would definitely buy this.</li>
