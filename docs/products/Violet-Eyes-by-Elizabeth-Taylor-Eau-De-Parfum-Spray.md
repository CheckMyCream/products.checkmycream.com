<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> light flowery scent, ideal for summer.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. I get compliments each time I wear it. Very feminine scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother. She loves the smell and this is a great deal.</li>
    <li> I received this yesterday.  It is wonderful!  A very light, powdery, lemony clean fragrance.  Even my husband, who rarely likes anything, raved about it.  Doesn&#x27;t last too strong throughout the day, but is still noticeable.  A very fresh fragrance.</li>
    <li> Just love it, keep the,,parfumes smell&amp;quot;long time!  Not expensive, and fast shipping!  Recommend this product! And now second bottle is wrong and price going up and quality down!  :(</li>
    <li> Amazing fragrance to this perfume. I bought it for my fiancÃ© and she totally loved it. I would say a must have</li>
    <li> really didn&#x27;t smell like an original scent But it was to much trying to return it ! so Ikept it sure wish I knew how to test for fakes</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife, and it seems it was a wise choice.  It smells good on her, and she likes it.</li>
    <li> It looks to be rip-off, it does not last for long. Its better to buy from over the counter</li>
    <li> this was gift and she loved it</li>
    <li> not only does it smell nice, it lasts! Love it!</li>
    <li> last less than an 1/2 an hour... is like water...</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this fragrance! Doesn&#x27;t last long on me but it&#x27;s still my favorite! The price can&#x27;t be beat either!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter because her name is Violet and it smells lovely.</li>
    <li> Love the price for this size bottle. Had bought it before and love the scent.</li>
    <li> I love this scent I used to buy the one ounce, but I thought I would try this 3.3 oz. and I am very pleased. I reviewed the one ounce bottle and I will quote it here: &amp;#34;This perfume has a beautiful soft flowery scent. It smells very expensive and sophisticated. I always get compliments on how wonderful it smells.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lovely, floral, feminine scent that I first discovered in a local department store. Whenever I wear it, people ask me what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing. I can&#x27;t say this is the only fragance that I wear, but I DO wear it OFTEN. And your price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> I love this product but am disappointed in the bottle.  The sprayer does not work.  This item can not returned.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem in the past with this perfume, but this quite disappointing.</li>
    <li> Wonderful; love this perfume.  It&#x27;s the only kind I wear now.</li>
    <li> I always love Violet eyes :))</li>
    <li> Violet Eyes by Elizabeth Taylor.  Good price for a nice scent and it is hard to find in my area.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased to find VIOLET EYES being sold on it&#x27;s own, rather than in a gift set with other fragrances (which I don&#x27;t use).  I fell in love with the scent last Christmas when I received it as a gift and was delighted that you offered it on it&#x27;s own.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am one of her biggest fans and this is a high quality product, lasts a long time and smells great!</li>
    <li> Great size . I&#x27;m unable to get this size anywhere else so this is a great value for the $$. My mom&#x27;s fave fragrance - so I gotta keep her happy :)</li>
    <li> My new favorite! Great size for the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of The Diamonds, lovely scent it is. ðŸ˜€</li>
    <li> Nice soft floral scent that is great for young or older women. Lasts for a long time (but not quite all day) with just a few sprays. Never fail to get compliments. Does not have a vanilla or powdery nor musky scent. Fresh and clean lightly floral perfume.  UPDATE: This perfume was a limited edition and is no longer made. Any bottle you receive will be old and rancid. I have ordered it twice now since my original purchase and they were yellowed and had an odd smell. I am so sad because the scent was fabulous. I wish they would start producing it again. But until they do I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last at all. The one bought at the store smells good all day, maybe a diluted mixture. I&#x27;m not buying anymore : (  a sad day.</li>
    <li> lovely soft everyday scent - wish it lasted longer on me. I wish they sold the body lotion in a larger size - it holds the scent longer. Such a good buy!</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD THIS IS MY SECOND ORDER FOR THIS PRODUCT I RECOMEND IT AND I LIKE IT VERY GOOD STOFF</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty, slightly powdery, clean perfume. Nowhere near as &amp;#34;grandma&amp;#34; as White Diamonds. It reminds me of scented toilet paper (remember that stuff? It was pink) and I mean that with all the love in the world and in the best way possible. It doesn&#x27;t last very long, but in my opinion, that&#x27;s better than the alternative. I&#x27;m a big fan of Elizabeth and I find myself liking this scent the more I wear it. Those two statements had nothing to do with each other, but there you have it. It costs 25 bucks... but it smells like 50!</li>
    <li> Heaven in a bottle,  love this scent and even better it last all day without spraying again a most get. Oh and the service was amazing the package came so fast I forgot what I had ordered and was wondering what I got in the mail until I opened it. Ps I do live in az and it was coming from California</li>
    <li> Just an OK perfume. I expected a more flowery scent, bu I did Inot get that from this perfume. I would not want this perfume again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like it should. The scent didnt even last long like it should of</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Very well pleased with it.  Will be ordering from Amazon again</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister, who loves this scent.  I don&#x27;t care for it -- just doesn&#x27;t work for me -- but it smells wonderful on her.  She had almost run out of it and was very happy to receive a new bottle!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes and I was over joyed to find it at such an economical price.</li>
    <li> Violet Eyes is a new one for me.  I have worn Passion for years. I like this one, lighter, fresher but not as long lasting. .  Order arrived safely &amp; was a bigger bottle than I had anticipated!</li>
    <li> came nicely wrapped and it was everything I expected in the quality  of  fragrance that I wanted for my mom.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find wings in stores any more, so I was able to smell this one and decided to try it.  Which I am glad I did because I like this one and bought more of it.  If you can try it then go for it.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments about how good I smell :)</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Only wear it and Passion.  Service from amazon is great. Thanks!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a very large bottle and the shipment was quick.</li>
    <li> I wear perfume everyday.  I&#x27;ve been stuck on the same fragrance for years.  I tried Violet Eyes at a department store and liked it.  I checked Amazon and couldn&#x27;t beat the price, so I bought one... and a week later, I bought another.  The beautiful bottle is nice, too :o)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this fragrance. It smells very royal and beautiful. It has a clean a crisp scent that has a feminine and classy feel which is also rich in floral notes. It is also very light and airy but at the same time rich and luxurious.</li>
    <li> Love it. Some people said theirs was watered down.. I don&#x27;t think mine was, scent doesn&#x27;t last ALL day but its not a huge hassle to spray myself one more time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing The Real Violet Eyes for almost two years. I always get compliments and everybody wants to know what I am wearing. Not with this bottle! I only smell it faintly when I first spray it. I never got compliments with this stuff. When I saw this gigantic bottle for the price that I pay for a bottle half the size, I was overwhelmed. Not only did I buy one bottle I bought two. I&#x27;m going back to my little POTENT bottle. I can smell the little bottle on me all day and tons of compliments. Not a day goes by without someone saying &#x27;SOMEBODY SMELLS GOOD&amp;#34; AND I PROUDLY SAY IT&#x27;S ME! This stuff is watered down. This is not the one. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Got this today &amp; it smells so good!! Fast service. Will use again &amp; recommend to others</li>
    <li> One of the only perfumes I will wear, the price and delivery time are fantastic.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product, will purchase again in the future! Thank you :)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother. She loved itl Sais she never saw such a big bottle of this perfume. She is glad she wll have plenty on hand.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent, one of my favorites. It is not too overpowering which is a must to me. It is very delicate and soft. I always get compliments when I wear this. This was an excellent deal, the best I&#x27;ve seen. Packaging was great and delivery was sooner than I expected. I will definitely buy from this seller again!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, would return to buy.</li>
    <li> i really like it!!! i wasnt sure at the begining ..  but it was the real perfume ... new and seal ... i will keep shoping</li>
    <li> I love this perfume great to wear in the winter, spring, summer and fall! I would buy it again too!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly this is an absolutely terrific fragrance at an even better price! I always get compliments when wearing this perfume. Price even beats Walmart&#x27;s price!!</li>
    <li> Not bad. Nothing exceptional, I bought a small bottle to try 1st, and it smells nice, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> My mom was happy with it and it arrived early too!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied !!! Great choice for price and size will consider future purchases thru Amazon</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten mine yet but I ran into a lady in a market and I asked her what she was wearing and she told me this fragrance so I immediately ordered it I can&#x27;t wait to get mine!</li>
    <li> The perfume was wonderful, it has a very nice  and mild scent. not strong but last long and the price was better as compared to other store.thank you.</li>
    <li> Creamy scent..... Very pretty!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  It was all that I expected it to be.  It arrived in good condition and the packaging was great.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so good. everyone that smells it compliments. my girlfriends and I have this thing were we have our choosen perfumes and no one else can wear it now they are all mad because I claimed this one :-)</li>
    <li> This perfume is awesome. Smells great at an affordable price. I can&#x27;t afford Channel so this scent will just serve me. Like it&#x27;s endorser it&#x27;s timeless and classy.</li>
    <li> As always Violet Eyes is wonderful. Smells so good and Liz never lets you down</li>
    <li> HI I bought this for my mom for her birthday. She loves it. Fast Shipping. Great Seller to do business with. I highly recommend this. I asked my mom if it smelled diluted she said it smelled really good and seems fine. I really love this perfume scent. It has a pretty flowery sweet clean scent. A+++++++</li>
    <li> Lovely scent of any type of floral concoction! I love it!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this scent the first time I wore it. A beautiful woody floral that is not overwhelming and lasts all day. Soft and sensual, it is one of my go to fragrances for everyday wear. Thank you Amazon for offering this large size bottle at a great price!</li>
    <li> Best suited for those who like mild fragrances that is not too expensive. I also love the packaging in violet color with flowers and butterflies. The bottle looks awesome too with a diamond-like band on the top.</li>
