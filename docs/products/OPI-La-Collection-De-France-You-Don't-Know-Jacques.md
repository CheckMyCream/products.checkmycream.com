<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is one of the hottest colors and it can be worn with everything.  If your sick of the old reds and browns...this is a great choice..A+  PS: husband really loved it as well.</li>
    <li> ok, i ordered 3 polishes a few months ago from amazon and i was imediately suspicious. i researched how to tell the difference between real and fake OPI bottles and ALL THREE of mine were fake. and i got them from 3 different company things. i don&#x27;t know if this is the exact one i bought (i know it was you don&#x27;t know jacques) but just be careful. it&#x27;s probably just better to go to a store and buy OPI.</li>
    <li> Love the color. Dramatic but still neutral enough to go with everything. The color is thick and goes on well and dries fairly quickly. It does seem to chip a little easier. I had put on 2 coats and the top one flaked off in spots. Weird.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color. It is so nice for the fall and it goes on very smoothly!  Also, it lasts a lot longer than most nail polish.</li>
    <li> It looks nothing like the picture, it just looks like a plain dark brown, I would leave a picture if I knew how lol. Just don&#x27;t get it thinking it&#x27;s like the picture. I will admit it looks nice on me and I&#x27;ve grown on the brown color but it is really just like a darkish creamy brown color.</li>
    <li> I get TONS of compliments on this unique color. I love that it goes with everything, and as expected OPI lasts and doesn&#x27;t chip!</li>
    <li> this nail polish is a nice color. it doesnt not go on as the \\&quot;greige\\&quot; color that i had wanted, but goes on as a dark muddy brownish color. it honestly is a very nice color and at times looks likes a nice chocolate brown color. however with all opi nail polishes that i have had bought in the past, they chip very easily.</li>
    <li> Though it&#x27;s been said already, this product is great! The color is excellent and goes with anything. I&#x27;m the poster of the 2nd customer image. I tried it on my toes first and it looks wonderful, though the hue is more gray and muted than I was expecting. Like I said in the picture caption, it can tend to go on thin and uneven at first, but quickly becomes opaque with few coats. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> The color works well on dark and olive skin. The polish last longer than the cheaper brands. The amazon price was also lower than at the nail salon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought OPI nail polish before this product, I actually bought it at a local salon and not on Amazon, Love the Nail Polish and this was absolutely this seasons color. I will admit it reminds me of a mud puddle...but its definitely original and it&#x27;s flattering to any outfit. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This is a product that I&#x27;ve been using for some time.  My problem being that I cannot find it any longer.  I went on line to Amazon and there it was.</li>
    <li> I was leary about buying this color, thinking it would be too purple.  Don&#x27;t hesitate - it is just a perfect blend of purple and brown.  Doesn&#x27;t look too \\&quot;young\\&quot; either!</li>
    <li> This is a great color of polish and goes with any color outfit or make-up.  It&#x27;s a great choice if you are looking for a less dramatic color choice than black but still want an impact.</li>
    <li> Perfect for fall, its simply and easy to wear with dark colors, goes on well I only needed two coats to look like the picture :) well worth the money, I&#x27;m not one to spend $5 dollars on nail polish but when I bought this it became by new obsession, fall or summer, I&#x27;m wearing it now.</li>
    <li> Looked great on its own, and with Silver Shatter. I was skeptical of going taupe, because I don&#x27;t wear these colours, but it was very sharp. My skin tone is sort of mid-range, I guess, with ruddy tones when I don&#x27;t get a lot of sun (skin tans easily to olive). I wear a lot of black and grey, and this polish was beautiful. I almost didn&#x27;t want to hide it with the shatter, but ended up thrilled with the overall look.</li>
    <li> &#x27;You Don&#x27;t Know Jacques&#x27; is my favorite OPI nail color.  It is a smooth blend of dark taupe and gray.  I am a fairer-skinned African American woman and as I have gifted this color around to friends and family members, I can tell you it looks great on all skin tones!  THE color to have!</li>
    <li> I have dark skin and I absolutely love this color--I guess it just depends on your own view. So don&#x27;t shy away from it, even if you have dark skin. You might like it. I have been looking for a good tone of gray for a long time and this one is perfect. I also had to apply it twice to get the color similar to the one in the picture. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I recieved the product in the mail in 2 days! I was so excited i put the nail polish on right away. I didnt expect the nail polish to come so fast :) Other items i ordered on the same day havent even been shipped yet. I will definately be buying again. Very good service. 10 out of 10</li>
    <li> Love OPI polish and this is one of my favorite colors! I plan to purchase more colors soon so that I can finish my collection.</li>
    <li> This color is super flattering, and a great departure from the standard black of past seasons. I love it. It&#x27;s my new standard for fall/winter.</li>
    <li> Unable to find this nail polish in any local store but easily ordered it on line and it is great! Very easy purchase!</li>
    <li> I am an OPI addict. I don&#x27;t know how many of them I own, but I would guess around 25 bottles of it. This color is so different, and for some reason I was always hesitant to buy it. I&#x27;m so glad I finally did! It&#x27;s incredibly unique, and it looks excellent with my lighter skin. Definitely one of my favorites, along with DS Original (which was 32 bucks a bottle!)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get a grey/taupe color for a while and decided on this one. It looks pretty light in the bottle but I found that on the nail it tends to look a little darker unless you&#x27;re in really bright light. It&#x27;s still a nice grey/taupe color but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more of a dark grey than taupe. The color also lasts forever without chipping similar to other OPI colors, especially with the OPI top coat.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a dark color to paint my nails, what with Halloween right around the corner, and stumbled upon \\&quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jacques!\\&quot;  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase - it&#x27;s a really nice color and looks great on.  I agree with the other reviewer who described it as a mix of dark gray with brown/taupe.  I have very light skin and although I love the look of black nail polish on other people, it looks way too harsh on me.  This shade is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opi is a fantastic brand.  I used to think anyone who spent $7-9 on a little bottle of nail polish had to be crazy, but Opi&#x27;s made me change my mind.  Dries fast, and doesn&#x27;t streak or chip nearly as easily as other nail polishes.  This is great for a girl who has better things to do than worry about messing up her manicure 24/7.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of my favorite OPI shades. I bought it not sure if I would love it or hate it, but Im so glad I got it. I get so many compliments when I wear it, women of all ages seem to love it. I have a light skin tone and it works for me. I have yet to try it on my toes but its great for fall!</li>
    <li> I saw this polish color on pinterest, and I have to say that it looks exactly like the model picture when on!!!!  I love the color!!!  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> The nail polish is great. It was a present for my sister. She loved it!  goes great with her olive skin.</li>
    <li> I thought this color would just be amazing but it&#x27;s kind of dull..&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lot browner than I wanted. But it&#x27;s an alright fall color.</li>
    <li> I received several compliments for this color this fall, it goes with everything. Always pleased with OPI products, this color does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few colors that are authorized to have on your nails, and the color isn&#x27;t bad either. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I use nothing but OPI nail polishes because of their quality. While I love this shade I was very unhappy with the polish. It was very thin and I had to apply twice as many coats. It was almost as if a lot of nail polish thinner was added to it. Since it arrived without the seal around the cap and bottle I am left wondering if the seller did just that to make a used bottle look new.</li>
    <li> I ordered 11 polishes from NailEtc, only received 5 in the parcel. This one is one of the missings. It&#x27;s very disappointed. But I got my refund at the end.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best cool weather color for me. Dusty plum/taupe. Goes on great. Bought it easier and cheaper than at local store. They are always out of this color.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE fan of OPI-- which is saying something, as I am not a huge wearer of nail polish. I am also very particular about how the colours look on my fingers, which are far from long and elegant. This colour looks fantastic-- even my husband independently mentioned liking it and he couldn&#x27;t care less about these things-- and I get compliments on my nails from coworkers, friends, and complete strangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my nails short and use my hands all the time (especially at work) so the gel polishes work well for me, as long as I can keep still long enough for them to dry, because it lasts longer without chipping. It would last even longer if I actually baked the gel on under a heat light like you&#x27;re supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish colour is also true to the photo-- at least it was compared to how it appeared on my computer screen, which was not the case with a couple other colours I purchased through a different seller on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this color and it was mailed out to me very promptly! The polish isn&#x27;t old or thick (I was scared it might be old back-stock) and it was packaged well.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this thinking it was going to be a dark grayish brown? Sounds odd, but it looks like a nice subtle dark polish in the picture. Once it is on it can appear to be so many different colors, at times this nail polish looks purple gray, brown, or just flat out dark gray? Its a nice color but I wouldn&#x27;t reccommend it to anyone with a dark skin tone.</li>
    <li> This color is a rather dark taupey brown.  It&#x27;s a great color for the fall and reminds me of chocolate pudding!</li>
    <li> identical to the photo, really creamy and smoothe but it turns out this color is a little \\&quot;mature\\&quot; for me, being 23 and all. I wanted it for fall and thought it would look fun and indie but it pretty much just looked like an old lady color on me. Pretty cute though i guess. In an earthy way.. only it has not so earth-friendly ingredients so I suppose wearing it to look earthy would be pretty stupid. yeah. get it if youre old.. or just older than 23.</li>
    <li> I picked this up at ulta for about $8 and i love the color. it looks great and i have already gotten so many compliments with it!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely try it out. its sure to be a fall staple.</li>
    <li> I ordered OPI polish \\&quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jacques\\&quot;.  The service, the delivery,etc. were fine.  However I know that colors cannot be reproduced exactly on the computer, but I was very disappointed.  The color on my MAC computer was closer to khaki which I wanted, but the product received was quite dark.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jaques!\\&quot; is a cross between plum/brown and mauve. A really subtle dark color if you want to get a  darker nail polish but too afraid to go all out black. This color is a good transition to darker colors. I am black with light golden skin and this color compliments my skin very well. It looks very professional and classy. It will look great for a night out or a romantic dinner... Seems to suite every occasion. As far as this brand of nail polish, I love it. It dries very fast and lasts pretty long, just make sure to clean and buff your nails before you apply nail polish to help prolong the staying power of this nail polish.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t know Jaques goes great with grays, browns, and purples. Shipped fast and was just what I expected. I would purchase from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> It is a beautiful color!!! I love it and the shipping was quick.  I have been putting it on every week since I got it.  I love OPI!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite shades.  It&#x27;s like a purplish/brownish color that looks add but is beautiful for fall and winter.  It is a bit dark but I love that, it a sophisticated color age appropriate for anyone.  The formula is great, requiring two coats to obtain full opacity but well worth it.  I have very pale skin and I love how it looks.  I suppose if you have darker skin it&#x27;ll look somewhat neutral but beautiful none the less.</li>
    <li> It really is a nice color, subtle, muted and sultry.. yes sultry! Coats brush on evenly and beautifully and lasts longer than average without chipping. Will buy again</li>
    <li> This nail polish had a very bad texture, and I have bought the same one before, same brand, same shade, and it&#x27;s texture was nothing like this one.  It was very thick (yet the color was more sheer than before!), like the bottle had already been either used or returned by someone and the seller OR whoever they bought this from added a thickening agent or some kind of filler.</li>
    <li> I did not care for this color against my dark skin tone - I think that it would look better on a lighter skin tone.</li>
    <li> You Don&#x27;t Know Jacques! is a perfect mix between khaki and a deep purple. This color goes with everything, and I love having OPI at hand.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and product was as expected.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s a little pricier than other polishes, but OPI&#x27;s quality blows everyone else outta the water. I was kinda skeptical about this shade because of my skin tone, but it turned out really nice. I didn&#x27;t even have to schlop on multiple coats to get the bottle color! Very chic...must buy imo!</li>
    <li> Opi is a great quality of nail polish. I will only by opi for this reason. Opi seems to not chip as much as other nail polishes. Love the different names!</li>
    <li> Great color. I have received so many compliments on it. It goes with lots of colors. It looks great with grey, brown, purple. Very versatile shade. Looks a little more like a fall color but I&#x27;m wearing it all spring because I like it so much.Love OPI polish. Great finish and long lasting.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail polish. I am an african american, and the polish is perfect for my color. I love this shade, this is the new black. Love it.</li>
    <li> In the picture this polish looks more grey but in person it is more brown. Still like the color though!</li>
    <li> I was pretty hesitant about this nail polish.  I tried black and it was all lumpy an bumpy.  But this color dried perfectly, nice and smooth.  Love Love Love It!!!</li>
    <li> The three polishes I ordered (Tickle My France-Y, Don&#x27;t mess with OPI &amp; You don&#x27;t know Jacques!) arrived safely, individually wrapped in bubble pack, in a small padded envelope.   I really love the colors! OPI has SUCH a great selection of colors, one for ANY occasion and color of clothing! :))    Note to other buyers (&amp; reason I only gave 4 stars):  the bottles are not sealed (i.e. kind of leave the impression they have been very very slightly used &amp; cleaned up again....).\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This, along with Over the Taupe, is one of my staple fall colors. It works for almost any skin tone in my opinion, and is such a wonderful creamy taupey gray brown.</li>
    <li> Perfect Fall color. You can not go wrong with the color, it will go with anything. I have had so many compliments when I wear this color. Better to own the colors you like than to go around to salons looking for it.</li>
    <li> Very pretty neutral color</li>
    <li> This nail polish looks really nice in the picture and even in the bottle, but because of its texture it looks really bland on medium or dark skin.</li>
    <li> I originally saw this on a friend&#x27;s nails and immediately knew I had to buy it. This is one of the most unique nail polish colors I have encountered in a long time; it&#x27;s like a mix between gray, brown, and purple - it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Best color ever!!! I still wish they made it!!!</li>
    <li> AMAZING color .. goes great with &amp;#34;samoan sand&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was crazy neat!! and secure!</li>
    <li> Great color! Polish lasts longer than most, especially when you use a clear overcoat. Arrived on time, and in good condition.</li>
    <li> this nail polish is different and unique!this looks great on olive or perhaps african american skin.i got many compliments on the color &amp; i did have to use two coats of this.it is one of my favorite polishes.</li>
    <li> I have this one now and have gotten a lot of compliments on it.  I ordered it after having it put on at the salon.  It will be one of my top colors. My daughter isn&#x27;t a fan of brown ... but she is now.  It pairs good with Thanks a Windmillion.</li>
    <li> I love OPI nail polish but this color looks like mud.  If you want mud colored nails then this color is for you.  Otherwise try any other color.  I have bought several of the mini sets and they are all fun and pretty.</li>
    <li> This is a great new color, I&#x27;ve also used OPI &#x27;Suzi says Da!&#x27; and find that OPI polishes wear well.  Great seller!</li>
    <li> You Don&#x27;t Know Jacques!is the perfect shade of gray. It is a combination of a gray and taupe-brown shade. This makes it very wearable on any skintone and not as harsh as other blue-based gray shades. This dark color is suprisingly neutral enough to complement a range of styles yet maintain a fresh edge. I was able to wear it all week and it paired well with a red shade called Vodka and Caviar,also by OPI.</li>
    <li> Perfect winter color...goes with everything.</li>
    <li> This color is amazing and might look a bit like purple mud in the picture, but it looks wonderful on and I get tons of compliments when I wear it!!</li>
    <li> I really like the taupe color, great for winter/fall or just a neutral look. I love OPI polish too, it seems to be fairly durable and looks really nice.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter who was into grays-she loves it. OPI has great quality products.</li>
    <li> great polish and received a lot sooner than estimated, very satisfied!</li>
    <li> My favorite nail polish for years. Looks great on my toenails and matches witheverything. I just stocked up with 2 more bottles in case they stop making this color.</li>
    <li> This OPI color is a must have in your personal or mani biz collection. It is so stunning on toes and looks amazing no matter what the season is. Most impotantly, this color doesn&#x27;t detract from your fancy over priced high heels at all. This color goes great on toes with any color open toe shoes!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a biege-brown color that doesn&#x27;t make your hands look \\&quot;corpse-like,\\&quot; you&#x27;ll like this. It&#x27;s the color of mud... or khakis that sat in mud. And it looks good on fair skin. I deducted two stars because 1) It requires three coats and the consistency is streaky (maybe I got a bad bottle). I even used Seche on top and it still didn&#x27;t dry. 2) It&#x27;s one of those colors that&#x27;s easy to get sick of. On day three, it had to go. It was beginning to remind me of cat barf. Sorry, but true. Good to have in the collection... but probably for no more than a season or two.</li>
    <li> It goes on really smooth and shiny :)  doesn&#x27;t really chip...it&#x27;s been on my fingers for 6 days and I only had to do small touch-ups    You do have to apply 2 layers to get that full color though    Overall, I would definitely get more nail polish from OPI.</li>
    <li> I love OPI nail polish and this color although at first does not look all that good from the bottle is amazing on. I am in my sixties and it really is a nice neutral color that goes with everything. I am usually a pink, red, mauve person but am adventurous so I tried it. I even had my toes done in it too. Great color for any season although I am not sure I will give up my reds in the winter especialy during the Holidays. OPI goes on smoothly and I like having my own bottle of polish when I have my nails done because that way if I need a touch up I can do it myself.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. The price was very fair, and the packaging was very nice as well. Thank you</li>
    <li> Great shipping time and was exactly what i ordered. I was a little skeptical that the color wasnt going to look the same on me as in the pic but was dead on. VERYYYY HAPPY.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this color, out of all the colors I ordered this was the one my fiancé wanted me to try on first! It is a bit darker and more purpely than I thought but it is still beautiful! I was going to buy a mocha color but this one seems to do the trick with a slight plum shade &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I admired a grey/brown shade of nail polish on a friend. I looked for the same color and found this color, &#x27;You Don &#x27;t Know Jacques&#x27;.It seemed like the same shade, but alas, it was not. It looked sort of muddy on my fingernails. I realize that each person has their own shade that fits their coloring best. This color does not look good on me. No fault of the nail polish, it is my nails and body color that don&#x27;t match. Just like make-up must be suited to you&#x27;re coloring, I have found that some shades of nail polish are the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opi has always been my go to nail polish,and it will continue. It was a revelation to me to find that some nail polish colors don&#x27;t suit me. When I think about it, of course, I realize how true that must be for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Recommended for me. prisrob 08-06-12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005SAAM2S OPI Best of the Best - 10pc limited edition mini lacquer collection]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001E23YV0 OPI Tickle My France-y]]</li>
    <li> ( My skin tone is between medium and light )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- The formula is GREAT as usual and so the result&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- Requires 2 coats to get the fabulous color.&lt;br /&gt; (with 1 coat you get some ugly uneven brown, with 3 coats you get THE SAME COLOR as with 2 coats)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3- The color is hard to explain. it&#x27;s almost like #413540. Not so bold &amp; sharp as black&lt;br /&gt;  ( Use PS or something to see the color ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4- Classy,elegant and chic.&lt;br /&gt; (whenever I wear it, I feel like I&#x27;m in some black/off white classic mini dress).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5- I would say it&#x27;s more beautiful on grown up hands.&lt;br /&gt; (university girls and beautiful mommies &lt;3 )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6- Definitely, 1 out of 1000000 female wear such a unique color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are welcome :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. : I feel like it gets slightly ( I mean 0.99 ) darker in the next day??!! maybe it&#x27;s just my eyes @-@</li>
    <li> This is a perfect neutral nail polish!  I like dark colors, but black is a little too harsh.  I really liked that it is kind of a cross between gray and taupe, because it looks good with either black or brown.</li>
    <li> My favorite OPI color that never goes out of style. I&#x27;ve bought a few more bottles since this last purchase.</li>
    <li> It is elegant when I use this color and it is very suitable color for winter. Very easy to apply this on my nails.</li>
    <li> Love the color and it&#x27;s exactly what I requested so I&#x27;m happy with it.  Great job and I&amp;#34;d recommend this site.</li>
    <li> Love this color!  Great!</li>
    <li> This is not &amp;#34;gel color&amp;#34; this is a regular OPI polish. Disappointed. Wish I could return, I guess it&#x27;s my fault for expecting to get gel polish for so cheap!</li>
    <li> Sad to say I do NOT like this product :o(  Had to wait for this much-anticipated item to arrive. Unfortunately, upon applying it, I found it to be of a very thin consistency, requiring literally 4 coats to finally cover the nail without streaks or see-through.  Added a protective top coat afterward.  Within a day, this polish began chipping, and on the 3rd day, I had to begin the touch-ups.  I always hope to get about a week out of a well done nail polish application, but this didn&#x27;t even come close.  I finally just got tired of the touch-ups and rough appearance, and just removed it from my nails entirely.  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just this particular color, or if OPI polishes are all like this.</li>
    <li> Great color, classy for winter at work.</li>
    <li> My partner&#x27;s name is Jacques and I thought this polish is a great play on words. I also really love the color so I bought 2 bottles.</li>
    <li> This OPI nail polish you don&#x27;t know jacques is very pretty color ,no matter what color of clothes you wear it goes with everything no changing of your nail polishes saved me a lot of time to do my nails and spend more time with my children.Great quality and no chips on my nails I had it for 2 weeks stil looked good on my nails.</li>
    <li> I really like this color and it goes on smooth with no bubbles. Its a little thin but that&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;d rather it be thin and have to do an extra coat than have it thick and goopy. 3 stars just because I have a shade that&#x27;s almost identical and goes on just as well and lasts just as Kong by the NYC brand. And that was $1.50 a bottle vs the hefty price tag of OPI polish.</li>
    <li> My favorite OPI color. I think it&#x27;s classic yet edgy.</li>
    <li> i really like this color it fits me. i am a lil disapointed that it started to chip after a couple hour wear. but i keep it on hand to do a little touch up</li>
    <li> To me this is nor just a brown color, it has some purple in it. So for me it is a perfect dark brown/purple for your nails. When my nails are short I do not like to use this color. it does not look right to me. but I have light skin color and this is a wonderful color. it also looks really good on my friend she is a dark chocolate brown skin color.</li>
