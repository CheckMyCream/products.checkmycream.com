      <li>smooth looks</li>

      <li>Super relaxing before a night out.</li>
      <li>Especially where my eyes kind of sink in...</li>
      <li>You can see a difference the first time you use them.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any distinguishing results after the first mask</li>
      <li>It is the same the spas use  where they used charge me a lot more..</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t notice any positive results whatsoever.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely saw a lifting of the cheeks and above the jaw line; also the marionette lines filled in a bit as well.</li>
      <li>and it really helps with my eye areas and forehead.</li>
      <li>Absolutely Devine ....skin looks and feels</li>
      <li>but there&#x27;s nothing much else to it.</li>
      <li>It arrived fast to me.</li>

      <li>I feel certain that if used on a regular basis, there will be significant results in dryness.  </li>
      <li>It provided that extra &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; for a special occasion and gave my confidence a boost too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Be prepared to spend the time laying flat on your back - a great excuse for a nap!!  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a trick getting from the bathroom mirror to where you can down because it slides off so easily.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried them at home, my fiance actually remarked on the results (unprompted).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, and these don&#x27;t make me break out -</li>
      <li>After a single use, the dry skin on the face seemed to be moisturized better than any cream can do.  </li>
      <li>Wow, Wow, Wow!</li>
      <li>This is, in fact, the same mask I&#x27;d been paying through the nose for all those months (12 times as much as the Amazon price).  </li>
      <li>I still look old</li>
      <li>It left my feeling skin soft.</li>
      <li>: I put the bottom on first while standing up then I lied down with a hand mirror at arm&#x27;s reach.</li>
      <li>At least for me, in only one use, wrinkles are unaffected, but I will update if there are any changes as I use more.</li>
      <li>If you live in a dry climate!  </li>
      <li>The mask is rather slippery and will slip off the face if you are not flat.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> WORKS WELL FEELS PLUMPER AND SMOOTHER  NOT TO FRAGRANT  FEELS GENTLE</li>
    <li> A lot of collagen but quite messy - thick so extra collagen that collects at the bottom of the packet cannot be used on top of the mask.  It&#x27;s a trick getting from the bathroom mirror to where you can down because it slides off so easily.</li>
    <li> total crap big waste of money</li>
    <li> If you live in a dry climate!  Order these collagen face lift masks!  They moisturize wonderfully especially after any exfoliation!  I am in the skin care business and my customers keep coming back for these masks!</li>
    <li> Be prepared to spend the time laying flat on your back - a great excuse for a nap!!  The face is covered with this collagen mask, by placing it over your face (it comes in two sections.)  The instructions say to lie down to use, and this is essential.  The mask is rather slippery and will slip off the face if you are not flat.  From the warmth of your face, the mask will conform to the shape of your face while you rest.  After a single use, the dry skin on the face seemed to be moisturized better than any cream can do.  I feel certain that if used on a regular basis, there will be significant results in dryness.  At least for me, in only one use, wrinkles are unaffected, but I will update if there are any changes as I use more.</li>
    <li> Paid tons for this at the Salon - just as good at home for a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> My aesthetician gave this brand&#x27;s name when I moved from coast to coast.  This is, in fact, the same mask I&#x27;d been paying through the nose for all those months (12 times as much as the Amazon price).  The masks are very effective at giving me a nice glow, tightening any smile lines, and overall making me look great.  The first time I tried them at home, my fiance actually remarked on the results (unprompted).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, and these don&#x27;t make me break out - in fact, they calm redness very nicely.  I also find I can refrigerate them and use them at least three times before the serum is gone.  I toss them even if there&#x27;s  serum left at that point, since I&#x27;m concerned about bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be looking for a new spa, after all, given the results at home.  The brand&#x27;s neck masks are also good.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this product I&#x27; m 36 and after a good scrub on my face I apply this collagen mask and lay down for 10 min as indicated in the label &amp;#34;It Works Baby!!&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This mask is the same mask they use as the collagen treatment in spas - when you buy it and do it yourself you save tons of money. Awesome product. I can always tell the difference after I use it. You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> This really was pretty great! Especially where my eyes kind of sink in... Why go to the spa and spend a fortune?!?!</li>
    <li> Good product and the  price is very reasonable. It is the same the spas use  where they used charge me a lot more..</li>
    <li> Absolutely Devine ....skin looks and feels smooth looks glowing&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;Shirl</li>
    <li> It is hard to handle very slipper, it feels relaxing on and you can feel the tingling.  Can see skin a little brighter when I take it off.</li>
    <li> They really work at keeping skin looking smooth,soft and glowing. I save for special occasions. Super relaxing before a night out.</li>
    <li> Wow, Wow, Wow! Use this weekly and it really helps with my eye areas and forehead. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> my sis said she loves it</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, slippery, slimey, I really wanted a relaxed 10-20 minutes but this was too messy for me!</li>
    <li> havent seen a difference</li>
    <li> These are the best masks I have ever used.  They leave the skin silky soft and excellent moisture.</li>
    <li> Amazing- I will order again</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any distinguishing results after the first mask but I used it again a few days ago (about 5 wks since last mask) and I absolutely saw a lifting of the cheeks and above the jaw line; also the marionette lines filled in a bit as well. It provided that extra &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; for a special occasion and gave my confidence a boost too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My application: I put the bottom on first while standing up then I lied down with a hand mirror at arm&#x27;s reach. After applying each section, use the mirror to position the masks so everything is in place. Use the box cover as a guide. It&#x27;s very slippery but there&#x27;s nothing much else to it.</li>
    <li> It left my feeling skin soft. I definitely noticed that it minimized my pores for a good 24-48 hours. I thought it was my imagination, but the second time I used the mask, it did same thing. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> These are awesome for the face. You can see a difference the first time you use them.</li>
    <li> Some products are over priced</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works fast its gentle to the skin. I would recommend it especially for those who have dermotogly skin issues. It arrived fast to me.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any positive results whatsoever. I used the last mask for a little bit longer and my face was red and burned for a whole week, makeup could barely cover it :(</li>
    <li> .My facial lines are much less visible after the mask and the effect lasts for days.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes I my skin.</li>
    <li> Was messy to use.  I still look old</li>
