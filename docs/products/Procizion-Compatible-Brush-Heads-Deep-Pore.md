      <li>These brush heads work great and are an amazing value.</li>
      <li>Just as good as the name brand Clarisonic heads.  </li>
      <li>But I am so impressed with these that I wanted to respond right away.</li>
      <li>and I shared the pack with family members and they are also pleased we will buy them again!</li>

      <li>Pleased with product.</li>
      <li>I would love to recommend this product and purchase it again.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think these have as many bristles as the Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
      <li>used several times and the best comment is</li>
      <li>I love the deep pore cleaning brush heads the best.</li>
      <li>That said, I love</li>
      <li>so far so good!  </li>
      <li>nearly* can&#x27;t tell the difference, and they are great given they&#x27;re a fraction of the price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It FIT, but didn&#x27;t connect somewhere, so there was no vibration/movement.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t yet had any issues with rusting or fit like others</li>
      <li>These replacement heads are really good and far cheaper than the Clairasonic heads.</li>
      <li>I purchased two at first and ordered four more</li>
      <li>...works just like the original brush head and</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t clean my pores as well as the Clarisonic.  </li>
      <li>MY FACE DID NOT FEEL CLEAN USING THESE BRUSHES</li>
      <li>After each use, I clean the brush &amp; it still smells.</li>
      <li>These are not anywhere close to the clairsonic heads, they don&#x27;t clean the face as well.</li>
      <li>Clean and slim package which is a bonus.</li>
      <li>I read such good reviews</li>
      <li>I love how soft the brush is, compare to the original one and</li>
      <li>once I found they were just right for me.</li>
      <li>Using the first one, I cannot tell a difference between these and the Clarisonic brand.</li>
      <li>packaging it came in wasn&#x27;t fancy, but at the end of the day, all I care about is how the brush performs, which it seems to do very well!</li>
      <li>I totally recommend :)</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a bit stiffer since it feels like even more of a deep pore cleaning.</li>
      <li>I love them for price especially...</li>
      <li>This absolutely did NOT work with my Mia2.  </li>
      <li>I also appreciated the informational email I received from Procizion once my brush heads were delivered.</li>
      <li>These are very well made and work</li>
      <li>had really, really hoped that these would be a good-enough alternative, but they aren&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend these for anyone who owns a Mia 2!</li>
      <li>Other than that, I think they are better than the originals.</li>
      <li>Though I was getting a good deal, BUT these brushes are not good.  </li>
      <li>Normally 1 refill brush would cost as much as the package of 4</li>
      <li>Other than that, everything else including the fit and overall feel are fantastic.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended them.</li>
      <li>so I had high hopes.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>Wow!!  </li>
      <li>The brush is soft and gentle however it does its work.  </li>
      <li>and I love the convenience of having replacement heads to switch them out every few months.</li>
      <li>I have the Mia 2 and am elated to have paid $25 for an entire year&#x27;s worth of replacements instead of $100.</li>
      <li>I feel that they exfoliate the face better without being too harsh or abrasive.</li>
      <li>They do not lock onto my Clarisonic as securely as the OEM ones do and, as other reviewers have noted, the bristles are softer (and cheaper</li>
      <li>Live and learn.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, these are NOT the Sam&#x27;s Choice, Kirklands equivalents to the real things....such good reproductions that buying the brand name is a vanity thing.  </li>
      <li>so far the quality is up to par!</li>
      <li>Maybe my first brush was a dud, we&#x27;ll see when I switch it out and if my review changes, I&#x27;ll come back to update.</li>
      <li>These are fairly soft and don&#x27;t do that.</li>
      <li>This experiment with the knock-offs will motivate me to pony up the big bucks to buy the real deal next time</li>
      <li>The seller seems to have great customer service, so in the worst case, you return them and go back to the original brushes.</li>

<li> They also gave to have the center of the head pressed in once you get it on the Mia in order for the head to move....</li>

<li> Very disappointed with the product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I don&#x27;t think these have as many bristles as the Clarisonic brush heads. They spray the soap and water if you lift the brush from your face while washing.  They don&#x27;t clean my pores as well as the Clarisonic.  Good for the money, but I would rather spend more for the quality.</li>
    <li> used several times and the best comment is I have NO complaints...works just like the original brush head and the price was a bargain.</li>
    <li> My skin feels healthier! The brush is soft and gentle however it does its work.  Clean and slim package which is a bonus.</li>
    <li> These replacement brush heads are perfect for my Clarisonic Mia 2, and the price is so much better than the name brand!! I also appreciated the informational email I received from Procizion once my brush heads were delivered. It contained some information about how the brush heads work, etc. I will definitely be purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> I tried these Pocizion replacement brush heads, which are compatible with my Clarisonic Pro, and I am very happy with them. Using the first one, I cannot tell a difference between these and the Clarisonic brand. These are very well made and work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had them a few day.

    <li> Great produce at a great price!</li>
    <li> so far so good!  it&#x27;s been 2 1/2 months.</li>
    <li> These work just as good as the name brand, maybe better.</li>
    <li> I have been buying the clarisonic replacement head for over two years but was not replacing them every three months as recommended due to the price.  I decided try these out to see if the &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; was the same.  Honestly, I cannot tell the difference between the clarisonic and these.  From now on, I will be buying these instead of the clarisonic brand.</li>
    <li> Wow!!  I have the Clarsonic Mia 2 and bought the refill package of 4.  Normally 1 refill brush would cost as much as the package of 4 I bought so I&#x27;m happy!  Amazing price and works just as good as the original.</li>
    <li> Bought these a few months back. Though I was getting a good deal, BUT these brushes are not good.  They get a moldy bacteria smell to them.  After each use, I clean the brush &amp; it still smells. I have tried several different things and nothing has helped or worked!!!</li>
    <li> Pleased with product. Will purchase from again.</li>
    <li> These are really great replacements for the Clarisonic. Way cheaper than the manufacturer&#x27;s brand and they seem to do a great job. I have purchased even cheaper replacements but those would &amp;#34;spit&amp;#34; the cleanser around and sometimes into my eyes. These are fairly soft and don&#x27;t do that. I purchased two at first and ordered four more once I found they were just right for me.</li>
    <li> I read such good reviews so I had high hopes. Maybe my first brush was a dud, we&#x27;ll see when I switch it out and if my review changes, I&#x27;ll come back to update. But for now, while the brush clips on and stays on my mia 2, it doesn&#x27;t oscillate. It&#x27;s basically a stationary face brush.</li>
    <li> These are not anywhere close to the clairsonic heads, they don&#x27;t clean the face as well. They also gave to have the center of the head pressed in once you get it on the Mia in order for the head to move.... I&#x27;m really not happy with these!!!! Live and learn.</li>
    <li> Terrific value!  Just as good as the name brand Clarisonic heads.  I totally recommend :)</li>
    <li> These are great brush head replacements! A great value over the name brand replacements. Highly recommended them.</li>
    <li> Fits the clairsonic and less expensive</li>
    <li> These brush heads work great and are an amazing value.</li>
    <li> It fits my Clarasonic Mia 2 perfect. I love how soft the brush is, compare to the original one and really \\&quot;deep hole\\&quot;. I would love to recommend this product and purchase it again.</li>
    <li> It does not work at all even after sending the 2nd replacement. Very disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks, and so far, it feels like a nearly identical replacement for my previous Clarisonic Mia 2 brushes. I *nearly* can&#x27;t tell the difference, and they are great given they&#x27;re a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one slight difference I can feel is that the brush is ever so slightly stiffer than the Clarisonic branded brush.

Try it out, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it. The seller seems to have great customer service, so in the worst case, you return them and go back to the original brushes.</li>
    <li> Fits my Clarisonic Mia perfectly and I love the convenience of having replacement heads to switch them out every few months. I love the deep pore cleaning brush heads the best. I feel that they exfoliate the face better without being too harsh or abrasive. Can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, well, that&#x27;s not entirely true.  The price of OEM Clarisonic brand brush heads is outrageous for what they actually are.  Unfortunately, these are NOT the Sam&#x27;s Choice, Kirklands equivalents to the real things....such good reproductions that buying the brand name is a vanity thing.  However, they aren&#x27;t so abhorrently bad that I can&#x27;t even use them either.  The build quality and quality of the materials are noticeably cheaper.  They do not lock onto my Clarisonic as securely as the OEM ones do and, as other reviewers have noted, the bristles are softer (and cheaper feeling.)&lt;br /&gt;I had really, really hoped that these would be a good-enough alternative, but they aren&#x27;t.  This experiment with the knock-offs will motivate me to pony up the big bucks to buy the real deal next time I need brush heads.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are really good and far cheaper than the Clairasonic heads. Can&#x27;t say a bad word about them</li>
    <li> This absolutely did NOT work with my Mia2.  It FIT, but didn&#x27;t connect somewhere, so there was no vibration/movement.</li>
    <li> I love them for price especially... Perfect fit !!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant buying these brushes but thought, &amp;#34;what did I have to lose?&amp;#34; It took my skin about a week to get use to them. Other than that, I think they are better than the originals. I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT EQUAL TO THE QUALITY OF CLARISONIC REPLACEMENT BRUSHES.  MY FACE DID NOT FEEL CLEAN USING THESE BRUSHES</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to try these but they have been excellent and I shared the pack with family members and they are also pleased we will buy them again!</li>
    <li> The compatible replacement brush heads are indeed compatible and I thank you for that!&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, they work!!  Thank you so much....purrrfect!</li>
    <li> Great price and so far the quality is up to par!</li>
    <li> These are an excellent alternative to the name brand Clarisonic brush head replacements. They are 4 times the value and work just as great. I have the Mia 2 and am elated to have paid $25 for an entire year&#x27;s worth of replacements instead of $100. I highly recommend these for anyone who owns a Mia 2!</li>
