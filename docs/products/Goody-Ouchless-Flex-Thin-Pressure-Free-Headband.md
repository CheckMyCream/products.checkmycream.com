### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These are the best headbands!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so happy</li>
      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>Plastic headband lends the look of &amp;#34;casual&amp;#34; but a good fabric or leather headband would dress it up quite a bit.  </li>
      <li>Love the adjustable part at the tips!</li>
      <li>sure hope they don&#x27;t stop making them!</li>
      <li>Great came quickly and as promised OUCHLESS!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve wished for this marvelous invention my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These headbands are actually very comfortable - and I&#x27;ve worn headbands for many years and have tried most everything out there.  </li>
      <li>I &#x27;m buying more of these for sure.</li>
      <li>Love love love these.  </li>
      <li>These worked ok.</li>
      <li>but these are okay too.</li>
      <li>I love the flexible sides so that I can adjust the tension on the sides of my head and eliminate the headband headaches.</li>
      <li>Top doesn&#x27;t conform to head.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these headbands.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t slip out of my fine hair and the miracle of it</li>
      <li>and I love these to get the hair out of my face when I am cooking or have to run out quickly.</li>
      <li>This is a huge benefit since I often wear these headbands when I&#x27;m working out or doing outdoor activities.</li>
      <li>I suggest you order them and find out for yourself how truly comfortable a headband can be.  </li>
      <li>I adjust the flex tips just so it&#x27;s comfortable and the band stays in place all day.</li>
      <li>Headband may not look like it will be comfortable</li>
      <li>but once you&#x27;ve got it, you will find a functional and comfortable headband.</li>
      <li>THIS ONE ROCKS and is soooooo comfortable and can wear all day.  </li>
      <li>The headband didn&#x27;t fit flush.</li>
      <li>Worth their weight in gold!</li>
      <li>The full and true description of the item.</li>
      <li>It may take you a day or two to get the fit flexed just right for your head</li>
      <li>The only improvement I can think of to make these more desirable to more women would be to offer them in a fabric.  </li>
      <li>And although this may certainly make me sound the fool....</li>
      <li>Great for little girls though.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s kind of strange -</li>
      <li>I just wish these were available in stores near me and</li>
      <li>This is such a innovative concept.....</li>
      <li>They fit my 2 year old, not me.</li>
      <li>Perfect for casual wear.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; on this headband - it&#x27;s really nothing much which is exactly as I like it!  </li>
      <li>No headaches, but they didn&#x27;t fit snug enough.</li>
      <li>Just a note: you don&#x27;t have to bend the tips all the way out, only adjust them until they&#x27;re comfortable.</li>
      <li>As an added benefit, the ends curve toward the back of my head allowing my sunglasses to fit over my ears too.</li>
      <li>Very strange at first when you put it on but in a matter of seconds, you can feel how it is much more comfortable than those headbands we&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
      <li>And if you feel any pressure behind the ears, simply remove the headband, slightly mold the ends outward a bit and try again until you find the fit that feels best to you.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;There is a right side and a left side to how this headband is worn.</li>
      <li>It also sticks out on the edges just like other cheap headbands.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s past where most people have it sitting where it will cause a headache or discomfort</li>
      <li>I ordered these for adult use, I do have a smallish head though.</li>
      <li>I much prefer the double strand headband</li>
      <li>The direction is indelibly marked on the inside.</li>
      <li>(mid to high 90&#x27;s with high humidity in the upper Midwest) with no problem - but not in the direct sunlight.</li>
      <li>Really - do you know of any other headband that a population of women can customize to their particular head shape?  </li>
      <li>The teeth are hard and the hairbands are so tight that they don&#x27;t fit an adult head, (or a seven year old&#x27;s head).  </li>
      <li>Does not fit an adult head (and my head is normal sized).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The full and true description of the item. Good price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these headbands. I adjust the flex tips just so it&#x27;s comfortable and the band stays in place all day. No pinching or pressure points. I wish my local stores still carried these!  Just a note: you don&#x27;t have to bend the tips all the way out, only adjust them until they&#x27;re comfortable.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  These are actually the opposite of &amp;#34;ouchless.&amp;#34;  The teeth are hard and the hairbands are so tight that they don&#x27;t fit an adult head, (or a seven year old&#x27;s head).  Also, there is a strange angle to the headbands and they don&#x27;t sit well on the head.</li>
    <li> Great came quickly and as promised OUCHLESS! I have thick wavy hair and I love these to get the hair out of my face when I am cooking or have to run out quickly.</li>
    <li> Worth their weight in gold! I needed headbands to help me grow my hair out. These are the only ones I can tolerate. I don&#x27;t get headaches or nerve pain when I wear them. I&#x27;ve been wearing them every day for weeks. It may take you a day or two to get the fit flexed just right for your head but once you&#x27;ve got it, you will find a functional and comfortable headband.</li>
    <li> Headband may not look like it will be comfortable but it is and, it stays put. No headache, no problems whatsoever. I ordered these for adult use, I do have a smallish head though.</li>
    <li> I got this so I wouldn&#x27;t get headaches from a headband. I got one of the worst migraines I have ever had wearing these. The &amp;#34;ouch less&amp;#34; part needs to be at least 2-3 inches long, it&#x27;s just an inch and that&#x27;s past where most people have it sitting where it will cause a headache or discomfort</li>
    <li> I much prefer the double strand headband but these are okay too.</li>
    <li> These worked ok. No headaches, but they didn&#x27;t fit snug enough. I would say my hair&#x27;s thickness is medium with a slight wave. The headband didn&#x27;t fit flush. Didn&#x27;t hold hair on sides tightly enough for my liking, but they did work overall.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t slip out of my fine hair and the miracle of it is that it doesn&#x27;t jab into the bones in the back of my ears. So ho massive headache from wearing a headband. I&#x27;ve wished for this marvelous invention my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a right side and a left side to how this headband is worn. The direction is indelibly marked on the inside. I &#x27;m buying more of these for sure.</li>
    <li> Did not hold my hair and still gave me a headache</li>
    <li> No headache One was purple though so I was sad. I wanted both black</li>
    <li> The part that sticks out is very weird and they are not comfortable. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not practical. Too flimsy.</li>
    <li> These are awful....they do not fit on the head properly and since one side sticks out, it actually shows through the hair.  Waste of money....</li>
    <li> too small, keeps popping of head.</li>
    <li> Weird shape. Top doesn&#x27;t conform to head. There was a space on each side not touching my head.</li>
    <li> Love love love these.  A headband that does NOT hurt my head.</li>
    <li> For years my daughter hated to wear headbands as they didn&#x27;t fit right and would be tight and give a headache and unable to wear all day.  THIS ONE ROCKS and is soooooo comfortable and can wear all day.  In fact we can&#x27;t find them in the stores in our area anymore and now have to order off the internet.</li>
    <li> Way to small for an adult size head. Great for little girls though.</li>
    <li> Does not fit an adult head (and my head is normal sized). It also sticks out on the edges just like other cheap headbands.</li>
    <li> These are the best headbands! I love the flexible sides so that I can adjust the tension on the sides of my head and eliminate the headband headaches. As an added benefit, the ends curve toward the back of my head allowing my sunglasses to fit over my ears too. This is a huge benefit since I often wear these headbands when I&#x27;m working out or doing outdoor activities. I just wish these were available in stores near me and sure hope they don&#x27;t stop making them!</li>
    <li> These headbands are actually very comfortable - and I&#x27;ve worn headbands for many years and have tried most everything out there.  I purchased these by accident at our local dollar store not realizing they were &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; in that you could bend the ends so that you have no pressure behind your ears.  And although this may certainly make me sound the fool....I like the idea that these have an &amp;#34;R&amp;#34; on one end and an &amp;#34;L&amp;#34; on the other so I know how to put it on my head.  You see, these are not your &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shaped headbands.  They have a curve to them that allows them to sit on your head in a very different way than the headbands we are so used to (you can see this if you click on the alternate view by the photo of the product).  Very strange at first when you put it on but in a matter of seconds, you can feel how it is much more comfortable than those headbands we&#x27;ve used in the past.  And if you feel any pressure behind the ears, simply remove the headband, slightly mold the ends outward a bit and try again until you find the fit that feels best to you.  The &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; on this headband - it&#x27;s really nothing much which is exactly as I like it!  A little bit so that it holds itself in place without causing pain on your scalp by &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; that are too big and sharp.  Really - do you know of any other headband that a population of women can customize to their particular head shape?  This is such a innovative concept.....and I&#x27;m so happy I got these and another style that also has the bendable ends.  The only improvement I can think of to make these more desirable to more women would be to offer them in a fabric.  Plastic headband lends the look of &amp;#34;casual&amp;#34; but a good fabric or leather headband would dress it up quite a bit.  If you have not tried these headbands I suggest you order them and find out for yourself how truly comfortable a headband can be.  I do not think you will be disappointed!  I think I read a review by someone that said it melted while out in the heat at the beach.  That&#x27;s kind of strange - I don&#x27;t wear them outside in the heat for any extended period of time so can&#x27;t validate or argue the validity of that claim.  I do wear them in the heat (mid to high 90&#x27;s with high humidity in the upper Midwest) with no problem - but not in the direct sunlight.</li>
    <li> Love the adjustable part at the tips!</li>
    <li> These are tiny.  They fit my 2 year old, not me.</li>
    <li> Durable and long lasting.  Perfect for casual wear.</li>
    <li> Hurts the side of my head after about 30 minutes.</li>
