### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product is a razors best friend.</li>
      <li>This product is awesome!  </li>
      <li>so when you are shaving up, it is perfectly balanced for the task.</li>
      <li>Both are excellent but the Dollar Club razor seems to eek out the Fusion Power.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe it works as good as it does!  </li>
      <li>While my HeadBlade razor works great, I have an odd-shaped head and</li>
      <li>After four-months, I can honestly say it works great!  </li>
      <li>Works Great &amp; Does what it says</li>
      <li>Very nice.</li>
      <li>Work so good.</li>
      <li>a good deal...</li>
      <li>Glad I bought this item!</li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>Just amazing.  </li>
      <li>This is an amazing product that works well.</li>
      <li>This works AMAZING</li>
      <li>You must sharpen after each use or it will not work effectively.</li>
      <li>You can tell that it has been sharpened as it does not pull any more</li>
      <li>I love this ...</li>
      <li>No one can ask more for a product.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>It works better on disposable razors.  </li>
      <li>I shave my face and head every day and many days, twice.  </li>
      <li>I bought a couple more as gifts.</li>
      <li>I am glad I was able to get it.  </li>
      <li>The Blade Buddy has more than paid for itself.  </li>
      <li>When I run out of Harry&#x27;s I will switch to my Schick Quattro and see if it is any better.</li>
      <li>I bought this with more than a bit of apprehension.  </li>
      <li>I am using a Shick Quattro and it has lasted well over a month and is still shaving just as good as it did the first day.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still on my original blade after two weeks!</li>
      <li>so it is getting a very good workout prior to each sharpening.  </li>
      <li>a blade lasts a month easy..</li>
      <li>you follow the EASY directions you will enjoy saving the money on replacing those overpriced blades.</li>
      <li>just fine</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s supposed to smooth out the nicks and bends in the blade.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price!</li>
      <li>Both together, fast and easy, as I don&#x27;t have to be thorough to be thorough!</li>
      <li>Clean shave every time;</li>
      <li>Comes apart nicely to clean it up -</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really say much more.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much money I wasted to Gillette before finding this wonderful device.</li>
      <li>Works great to clean out the blades but not really sure if it&#x27;s sharping the blade....</li>
      <li>Well worth</li>
      <li>The secret, I found, is to use an excellent shave gel on the sharpener to run the blades over.  </li>
      <li>yet it still worth the purchase price.</li>
      <li>So far, the razor I started using the Blade Buddy with is still going strong after one month.  </li>
      <li>Well, it&#x27;s not as nice as new, but it made a spent razor reasonably comfortable to use.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still using the first cartridge</li>
      <li>Interesting that it&#x27;s so simple to use.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Now, for 40 years I&#x27;ve also been going over my face first with an electric shaver.  </li>
      <li>I am still using my first blade for over a month now.  </li>
      <li>This really works!</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>You &amp;#34;whet&amp;#34; the blade (I use twin-blade sensor) 10 to 20 strokes daily (I do 20 to be sure) to &amp;#34;straighten&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>OK, been several months since I ordered this and started using it.  </li>
      <li>But it goes pretty fast.  </li>
      <li>It is easy enough to use:</li>
      <li>Use a TINY bit of shaving cream on the silicone pad and it sharpens very quickly.  </li>
      <li>(in spite of it saying that it&#x27;s for new blades only) and it seemed to sharpen it noticeably, and I&#x27;m assuming it will get even better with use.  </li>
      <li>While I can tell the difference between a 2-1/2 week old blade and a new blade in terms of a smooth shave, it is not by much.  </li>
      <li>My husband said it works very well keeping the &amp;#</li>
      <li>then you really need to throw the blades away and</li>
      <li>it really  works....</li>
      <li>I bought this Blade Buddy and experimented with it for a couple weeks before using it for real.  </li>
      <li>This thing really works.</li>
      <li>At first, I was surprised that the instructions asked me to swipe it 15 to 20 times (that seemed like a lot!)  </li>
      <li>Seems to work very well, I sharpened a new blade, I was so surprised at how smooth the shave was through my three day old beard.</li>
      <li>The shave for me is not like a new razor but rather as new as the 2nd shave with a good razor, but it keeps it at this state for a long time.</li>
      <li>Saves some money over time without having to buy new blades!</li>
      <li>I rarely write reviews but when something really works i think everyone should know, especially if it saves them money.</li>
      <li>After using it for several weeks, I can get a couple more shaves out of each blade, but it doesn&#x27;t make a razor last for months.   </li>
      <li>Highly recommend..</li>
      <li>will pay for itself in a little more than 2 months.  </li>
      <li>For me, at least, this has been a superb product, and has saved my hide, especially when the wife decides to use my razor on her legs and other body parts</li>
      <li>It will save us a lot of money this year on new blades.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called him this month after he had his new razors for 2 weeks</li>
      <li>ALL 4 RAZORS SEEMED SHARPER THAN NEW</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t start with new blades!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I then told him to use it on a brand new blade after every shave.</li>
      <li>The razor still feels clean and sharp.</li>
      <li>This is my second order on the Razor Buddy, and as long as you start with new blades and clean it after every shave, it will work.</li>
      <li>So far, this seems to be working.  </li>
      <li>i purchased this to see if it works so far</li>
      <li>I am using this on my Harry&#x27;s blades and so far do not see a difference.</li>
      <li>The sharper razor helps my sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue so far.</li>
      <li>(he used it on an old razor at first)&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not sure how important it is to keep the blue part dry and clean between sharpenings.  </li>
      <li>a tip: be sure to dry the blades after sharpening - adds a little additional life to blade by preventing rust.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m on the same new razor after a couple of months, so it must be working.</li>
      <li>but if you follow the directions and start with a new razor and sharpen it daily it will last for well over a month.  </li>
      <li>Again, I assumed the blades needed sharpening, but apparently not, only &amp;#34;straightening.&amp;#34;  I started on May 1st, 2015, with a new blade, and I&#x27;m still using the same blade today, July 4th, 2015.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been using the same old cartridge for several weeks now.</li>
      <li>I noticed just a little drag after sharpening but by no means is there really that much of a difference.</li>
      <li>As an experiment, I open a new package of Mach 3 blades last December, using Blade Buddy daily, I have only had to use 3 of the refills since, that&#x27;s over 6 months now.  </li>
      <li>All of this being said I can say that this is well worth your money and will pay for itself in only  few short months at the cost of razor heads these days.</li>
      <li>Everyday, followed the exact sharpening method of 25 reps with shave cream before starting to shave and it still is lasting over a month.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This thing works like a charm!  Saves some money over time without having to buy new blades!</li>
    <li> I can say I sorta like this product.  After using it for several weeks, I can get a couple more shaves out of each blade, but it doesn&#x27;t make a razor last for months.   It works better on disposable razors.  When I try sharpening razors with switchable blades, the blade tends to fall off the razor.  It also doubles as a resting place for my blade.</li>
    <li> Keeps my blades polished.  Seldom do iI buy blades anymore.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work &amp; at times it seems to dull the razor blades.</li>
    <li> My husband said it works very well keeping the &amp;#34;throw away&amp;#34; rezors sharper longer.</li>
    <li> So far, the razor I started using the Blade Buddy with is still going strong after one month.  Glad I bought this item!</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but when something really works i think everyone should know, especially if it saves them money. I purchased two types of blades that I have tested on the Blade Buddy, Gillette Fusion Power, the one with the battery and 4 blade razor, and the Dollar Club 4 blade razor.  Both are excellent but the Dollar Club razor seems to eek out the Fusion Power.  Why?  I noticed just a little drag after sharpening but by no means is there really that much of a difference. Everyone&#x27;s beard and skin is different when shaving.  Everyday, followed the exact sharpening method of 25 reps with shave cream before starting to shave and it still is lasting over a month. One thing I need to mention, the style of razor, the 4x,not the blade offered through the Dollar Club, has a curled end that your thumb rests on so when you are shaving up, it is perfectly balanced for the task. Until you try it, you will never change razors.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a month now, shaving my fairly thick stubble off every other day, and my blade is still nearly as sharp as the day I first started using it.</li>
    <li> This thing really works. I can&#x27;t believe how much money I wasted to Gillette before finding this wonderful device. I bought a couple more as gifts. Everyone agrees it works!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I usually go about 1 or 2 weeks max on a blade; with this I have gone 2 months on the same razor. Clean shave every time; no nicks or cuts.</li>
    <li> i purchased this to see if it works so far i use it on a daily basis with sensor razors and am going on 15 days on the same razor  i tried the same thing using mach 3 and those last a lot less time about 7-10 days dont know if its due to thinner blades on the mach 3 .</li>
    <li> I have only had the blade buddy for a few weeks, but I have to admit my blades are shaving closer than they were before.  Well worth the small amount of money I paid.</li>
    <li> I bought this from a catalogue, and it&#x27;s the oddest product.  I assumed it would be a whetstone, but it&#x27;s not.  The blue part is a dense rubber-like material.  The instructions say wet the blue rubber with shaving crème, but I use it without, maybe a little water.  You &amp;#34;whet&amp;#34; the blade (I use twin-blade sensor) 10 to 20 strokes daily (I do 20 to be sure) to &amp;#34;straighten&amp;#34; out the blades???  Again, I assumed the blades needed sharpening, but apparently not, only &amp;#34;straightening.&amp;#34;  I started on May 1st, 2015, with a new blade, and I&#x27;m still using the same blade today, July 4th, 2015.  I figured I&#x27;d change blades every 2 months, but I&#x27;ve run out of blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for 40 years I&#x27;ve also been going over my face first with an electric shaver.  I don&#x27;t like the sandpapery feel left then, so I then wet shave.  Electric shaver - not thorough enough.  Wet shave - too hard on face.  Both together, fast and easy, as I don&#x27;t have to be thorough to be thorough!</li>
    <li> This product is a razors best friend. I&#x27;m still on my original blade after two weeks!</li>
    <li> Husband loves it. Seems like it&#x27;s working to prolong razor life.</li>
    <li> Is working as advertised.  Getting, at least, twice the usage out of disposable triple blade (bic) blades.</li>
    <li> So far, this seems to be working.  I used it on a less-than-brand-new blade (in spite of it saying that it&#x27;s for new blades only) and it seemed to sharpen it noticeably, and I&#x27;m assuming it will get even better with use.  Interesting that it&#x27;s so simple to use.  At first, I was surprised that the instructions asked me to swipe it 15 to 20 times (that seemed like a lot!)  But it goes pretty fast.  Use a TINY bit of shaving cream on the silicone pad and it sharpens very quickly.  I believe it&#x27;s also designed to be somewhat of a stand / holder for your razor.  Comes apart nicely to clean it up - the blue silicone part just sits in the plastic tray, so you just turn it over to drop it out, and rinse.  Not sure how important it is to keep the blue part dry and clean between sharpenings.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue so far.</li>
    <li> I am using this on my Harry&#x27;s blades and so far do not see a difference. When I run out of Harry&#x27;s I will switch to my Schick Quattro and see if it is any better. If not it is going in the garbage. At least it wasn&#x27;t too expensive that I feel like it was a big waste. Enough other people seem to like it that it might just depend on the blades.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this thing! Blades stay sharp for weeks!</li>
    <li> Hard to tell if it really works. Can&#x27;t really say much more.</li>
    <li> Extends the life of my razors!</li>
    <li> Like others, I was a little skeptical about how well this might work. I can say after almost three months on the same set of blades, I am a believer. It is easy enough to use: before you shave, just put a little bit of shaving cream/gel (and water, if necessary to keep it lubricated), and slide the blade, as directed. For a while I stuck to the directions regarding the number of times to slide the blade across the Blade Buddy, but I have discovered that (for me, at least) sliding it at least 30 times achieves better results in keeping things sharp.</li>
    <li> OK, been several months since I ordered this and started using it.  It Works!  As an experiment, I open a new package of Mach 3 blades last December, using Blade Buddy daily, I have only had to use 3 of the refills since, that&#x27;s over 6 months now.  The Blade Buddy has more than paid for itself.  For me, at least, this has been a superb product, and has saved my hide, especially when the wife decides to use my razor on her legs and other body parts then doesn&#x27;t bother to mention it....!  Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Works great to clean out the blades but not really sure if it&#x27;s sharping the blade....</li>
    <li> Works for me, I like it.</li>
    <li> This works AMAZING I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews but if you follow the directions and start with a new razor and sharpen it daily it will last for well over a month.  I am using a Shick Quattro and it has lasted well over a month and is still shaving just as good as it did the first day.  I use the razor buddy every day in the shower with just a little dab of shaving cream and away we go.  I should also mention that I shave my entire head daily as well as my face with this so it is getting a very good workout prior to each sharpening.  All of this being said I can say that this is well worth your money and will pay for itself in only  few short months at the cost of razor heads these days.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t see the benefit. You can&#x27;t take a dull razor across it. How do you know it&#x27;s doing anything for your blade. I can&#x27;t tell. It&#x27;s supposed to smooth out the nicks and bends in the blade. I feel like I wasted money buyng it. Seems like you could just use an eraser instead.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. Can&#x27;t comment yet on how well it works but I&#x27;m on the same new razor after a couple of months, so it must be working. The razor still feels clean and sharp.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that works well. Highly recommend..</li>
    <li> Works Great &amp; Does what it says</li>
    <li> Seems to work very well, I sharpened a new blade, I was so surprised at how smooth the shave was through my three day old beard. I sharpen every time I shave. its been almost a month of being on the same blade, still cutting like its a new blade.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  I waited to write review until I put it to the test on several razors and I couldn&#x27;t believe the results-ALL 4 RAZORS SEEMED SHARPER THAN NEW and I didn&#x27;t start with new blades!&lt;br /&gt;This will pay for itself in a little more than 2 months.  No one can ask more for a product.&lt;br /&gt;Just a tip: be sure to dry the blades after sharpening - adds a little additional life to blade by preventing rust.&lt;br /&gt;If you follow the EASY directions you will enjoy saving the money on replacing those overpriced blades.</li>
    <li> Use this all the time before l shave my brothes. Work so good.</li>
    <li> This is my second order on the Razor Buddy, and as long as you start with new blades and clean it after every shave, it will work. At least it has worked for me.</li>
    <li> The instructions say to not start with a dull, worn out blade, but I did it anyway. I found a nasty old Mach 3 cartridge and went to work. The result? Well, it&#x27;s not as nice as new, but it made a spent razor reasonably comfortable to use.  I use it every time before I shave and I&#x27;ve been using the same old cartridge for several weeks now. If I owned Gillette, I&#x27;d definitely buy this product and take it off the market.</li>
    <li> it works on blade for a while then you really need to throw the blades away and yet it still worth the purchase price. thks iron brian</li>
    <li> It works. On my 8th shave on a 4 blade from dollar shave club. I&#x27;m still using the first cartridge and I didn&#x27;t even use this till the 3rd use of my blade. The shave for me is not like a new razor but rather as new as the 2nd shave with a good razor, but it keeps it at this state for a long time. I&#x27;m hoping to get 30 shaves out of one cartridge from DSC so one pack would last 4 mths &#x3D; 5 blades. Time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad got dollar shave club for christmas. He has a really tough beard. He said he only got 2 shaves out of 4 blade from DSC. (Dollar Shave Club). He used this and said it didnt work. I then told him to use it on a brand new blade after every shave. (he used it on an old razor at first)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called him this month after he had his new razors for 2 weeks and he says he gets 6-7 shaves out of a razor he use to get 2 out of.</li>
    <li> I bought this with more than a bit of apprehension.  I shave my face and head every day and many days, twice.  My razors normally last 4-days  before it starts to feel like I&#x27;m shaving with a hunting knife (yes, I have).  That&#x27;s approx  $160 per year in blades.  I bought this Blade Buddy and experimented with it for a couple weeks before using it for real.  After four-months, I can honestly say it works great!  I am changing blades every 2-1/2 weeks, not because the blades dull but because the blades-base looks so bad.  While I can tell the difference between a 2-1/2 week old blade and a new blade in terms of a smooth shave, it is not by much.  The secret, I found, is to use an excellent shave gel on the sharpener to run the blades over.  I run the blades 20-times before each shave, which is twice per session (once for my face and then again for my head).  While my HeadBlade razor works great, I have an odd-shaped head and the face-razor gets what the HeadBlade doesn&#x27;t...and yes, the Blade Buddy works on the HeadBlade just fine and that lasts for 2-1/2 weeks, too.</li>
    <li> extends the life of my 3 blade razor by weeks. I used to throw out my razor after a maximum of 3 uses. I shave dry and by that time the razor is not sharp enough any longer. You can still use if for your neck etc, but not for your face. After using the blade buddy (which I use after every use), just wet the blades and slide it over it 20-25 times. You can tell that it has been sharpened as it does not pull any more afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;All in all a nifty little thing that allows me to use the razor for several weeks (used 3 times per week) instead of one week of usage.&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review helpful, please click on the &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; button below.

    <li> It really works! It will save us a lot of money this year on new blades. You must sharpen after each use or it will not work effectively.</li>
    <li> This really works! The sharper razor helps my sensitive skin and I&#x27;m saving a fortune on razor blades. Recommended to all.</li>
    <li> Gave this to father-in-law who is into shaving.  A neat little gift for any man!</li>
    <li> I love this ...it really  works....a good deal...a blade lasts a month easy..I change blades because I am bored now!... will never be without....strops the blade and keeps them sharp...</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it works as good as it does!  I am still using my first blade for over a month now.  Just amazing.  I am glad I was able to get it.  I will be saving a lot of $$$$ as a result for sure!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!</li>
