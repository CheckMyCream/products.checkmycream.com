      <li>Once again, there is nothing on the market as effective AND great-tasting as Oasis spray.</li>
      <li>Great product that makes my mouth feel so fresh!  </li>
      <li>SO THAT WHEN NEEDED, IT IS EASY TO LOCATE AND ASSURE THAT MY BREATH IS IN GOOD WORKING CONDITION.</li>
      <li>The mouthwash works more effectively.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this probably works well for some people but not for me.  </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming taste and it doesn&#x27;t burn when using it.</li>
      <li>Like the therabreath mouthwash more, but give this a try if want to go all in</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the therabreath products.</li>
      <li>MORE UPKEEP TIME</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s more like a ointment then a paste.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting something that would just sterilize and freshen my breath like most sprays, but this has more of a drug like effect.  </li>
      <li>It works great and you&#x27;ll know that because you can really feel the taste of what you just ate</li>
      <li>but I love the product.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re able to digest sugar alcohols, you&#x27;ll probably be fine.</li>

      <li>THE MOST IMPORTANT</li>
      <li>Easy to use, fits in your procket.</li>
      <li>but I do believe that the ear oil and peroxide in the ears provided a huge impact on my tonsil health.</li>
      <li>Mild yet adequate and refreshing.</li>
      <li>I am impressed with the entire line of products because it gently removes food odors allowing fresh breath to prevail.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you suffering from tonsil stones I am going to provide you to my reviews of two products that did work to significantly reduce the amount of tonsil stones I get.</li>
      <li>I keep it in a small pouch for easy access and it is the best in keeping my mouth fresh after meals.  </li>
      <li>This product wasnt as great as I expected it to be.</li>
      <li>Absolute magic.  </li>
      <li>taste is not bad.</li>
      <li>It could be that I&#x27;m too used to the super cool minty feeling sugarless gum or listerine strips provide.</li>
      <li>but it sure does make your breath smell normal.</li>
      <li>If I could only get my teenager to use it more often!</li>
      <li>Nice for instant fresher breath but the fresh feeling goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>Gives me fresh breath</li>
      <li>Tastes good and goes well with the other Dr.</li>
      <li>I stuck that throat spray nozzle right up on them.  </li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s more powerful than I would like it to be.</li>
      <li>Delivered super fast and well packaged.</li>
      <li>I bought it with the mouthwash (the regular strength works for me) and I am glad I did.</li>
      <li>You are better off with the listerene pocket breath sprays, those work wonders and last for hours.</li>
      <li>it away the first day I bought it.  </li>
      <li>I think the mints and mouthwash of this brand are much better and more effective of killing bad breath germs.</li>
      <li>FOUND A LARGE BOTTLE OF THERA BREATH</li>
      <li>and this helps me get to sleep by making it much easier for me to swallow.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I FIND THIS REALLY HANDY.&lt;br /&gt;THERE</li>
      <li>I USE IT WHEN I GET READY TO ENTER ANY ACTIVITY WITH OTHERS</li>
      <li>This and the whole line of therabreath did not help prevent my tonsil stones.</li>
      <li>Generally takes about 5 sprays to get the full effect.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS BREATH FRESHENER.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s intense.</li>
      <li>LIKE MANY OTHER THINGS ON/</li>
      <li>Good design, but very small container.</li>
      <li>This tastes kinda weird at first, but the lingering aftertaste is pretty good.</li>
      <li>think we&#x27;ll try the probiotics next, because I wish this was not even an issue on the daily, and probiotics could be a more semi-permanent solution.</li>
      <li>IN OUR BODIES, AS WE GET OLDER, THEY LIKE TO FALL APART</li>
      <li>Not really that strong of a spray.  </li>
      <li>A HIGHLY NEEDED MOMENT.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I started thinking there was a relation because when I would clean my ears with a wet q tip and smell it, it had a similar smell to tonsil stones, not nearly as bad, but</li>
      <li>AND GIVE US MORE TROUBLE, AND</li>
      <li>you brushed your teeth?&amp;#34;)</li>
      <li>It is a little bit strong, but works quite well</li>
      <li>I stick with the brand of toothpaste and mouthwash, as well as oral spray, effective action is not a very long time to solve the fundamental body had to start with bad breath, proper diet reasonable sleep, improve good habits, regular brushing</li>
      <li>ALTHOUGH, I CARRY A HOLDER FOR SUCH THINGS IN MY PURSE, SOMEHOW THE MOST NEEDED ITEMS SEEM TO FIND A WAY TO MIGRATE TO A HIDDEN, INACCESSIBLE CORNER.</li>
      <li>THAN THEY DID WHEN WE WERE YOUNG AND SPUNKY.</li>
      <li>If you know you&#x27;re sensitive, I don&#x27;t recommend this item.</li>
      <li>They really don&#x27;t work that well, or only sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not as expected - breath not as fresh as I hoped for.</li>
      <li>That all helped for sure, but didn&#x27;t stop the occasional (like every few days)</li>
      <li>AND IT IS BIG ENOUGH, AND HAS AN UNUSUAL DESIGN</li>
      <li>It does freshen breath and does look exactly as pictured, however it does not last long.</li>
      <li>Sorbitol, maltitol, xylitol and other sugar alcohols cause problems with gas in certain sensitive people, and that population includes me.</li>
      <li>THERABREATH in general.</li>
      <li>Just a couple sprays near the back of your mouth after brushing and in the morning you mouth will be moist.</li>
      <li>Worked well at first but doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as initial use.</li>
      <li>Horrrrrrrrrrrrible taste....could barely swallow without almost throwing up</li>
      <li>Wonderful spray that does not tase bad like all other throat sprays!</li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s a little high-priced in the long run you get your moneys worth</li>
      <li>MORINING MOUTH TAKES ON A NEW MEANING AFTER HAVING SPENT THE NIGHT</li>
      <li>Very good product for bad breathe and helps when my throat hurts or have mucus down my throat.</li>
      <li>Outstanding product that helps you have a better security while around others due to sour, garlicy or bad morning breath....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this item after reading reviews and I have been very pleased. I keep it in a small pouch for easy access and it is the best in keeping my mouth fresh after meals.  I am impressed with the entire line of products because it gently removes food odors allowing fresh breath to prevail.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Thre it away the first day I bought it.  Should have just purchased some Listerine strips.</li>
    <li> this is the best stuff. it doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming taste and it doesn&#x27;t burn when using it. I love the therabreath products. they make my teeth and gums feel extra clean and take care of any bad breath I might have.  they are on the pricey side but the dentist is much more expensive if a problem arises.</li>
    <li> This tastes kinda weird at first, but the lingering aftertaste is pretty good.</li>
    <li> Nice for instant fresher breath but the fresh feeling goes away quickly. This made my mouth dry. I don&#x27;t have severe bad breath but to me, the minty feeling is too light. It could be that I&#x27;m too used to the super cool minty feeling sugarless gum or listerine strips provide. I guess I&#x27;ll stay with gum in the future because it helps with salivating.</li>
    <li> This product wasnt as great as I expected it to be. It does freshen breath and does look exactly as pictured, however it does not last long.</li>
    <li> Great. Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Mild yet adequate and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review just to let potential buyers know that this product contains sorbitol as its second ingredient (after water). Sorbitol, maltitol, xylitol and other sugar alcohols cause problems with gas in certain sensitive people, and that population includes me. Two squirts down my throat (had to swallow them, what else can you do?) and I was bloated, uncomfortable and smelly (not my breath this time) all night. Checked the ingredients in the morning (I should have looked before using it) and threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re able to digest sugar alcohols, you&#x27;ll probably be fine. If you know you&#x27;re sensitive, I don&#x27;t recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Alright.  Stop reading if you don&#x27;t want details.  THERABREATH in general. I use the toothpaste. I don&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s more like a ointment then a paste.  I&#x27;m getting used to it.  The mouthwash is great. People complain of bitter taste and I don&#x27;t experience. It&#x27;s intense. When I spit it out, i get a shudder.  Then it&#x27;s gone. Helps a lot with tonsil stones.    The throat spray. Yes!    I&#x27;m obsessed with the foul putrid disgusting tonsil stones.  Makes me feel like I have s*** in my throat it so gross.  I&#x27;m constantly poking around. Checking...checking...gouging my throat.    Now we all know they stink. Because we&#x27;ve all smelled the lil f$&amp;(:@!  I will push on my tonsil and even if I don&#x27;t have one that smell is on my finger.  Sometimes worse then others. And I know my tonsil is workin one up.    I stuck that throat spray nozzle right up on them.  One time..and.24 hours later no stone and no smell.    Oh I am gonna keep this in my life.  I actually did the Amazon subscribe plan.    I would gargle gasoline if it got rid of the bane if my existence.  I was looking for a doc that would take them out. The doc said it&#x27;s not that bad compared to what he sees.  Well...it is to me.    That throat spray makes me happy thinking about.    And you can pry it out of my cold, dead hands.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. I have HORRIBLE breath. I have seen two dentists and two doctors and undergone several lab tests to find out why...but no answer. Therabreath is the answer. The mouthwash works, where regular does not for me (15 minutes after brushing and gargling, my husband asked, &amp;#34;Have you brushed your teeth?&amp;#34;) When I am out, the breath spray is the only way to kill the bad breath that creeps up over time. I bought it with the mouthwash (the regular strength works for me) and I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> Works great for fresher mouth before meetings or close conversations. Easy to use, fits in your procket.</li>
    <li> This product is helpful when used in conjunction with other products because it can target the tonsil areas which can be a big source of bacteria in the mouth.  I think the best combo involves the use of this product, probiotics for the mouth (healthy bacteria), nasal rinse, and tongue brush, using the therabreath products.</li>
    <li> this is a good breath spray and reminds me a lot of their mouthwash which I use keeps the breath away</li>
    <li> It had no use for my symptom.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review as someone who gets tonsil stones, tonsiloths, if you get them you know what I am talking about. This and the whole line of therabreath did not help prevent my tonsil stones. I used the oral rinse, the toothpaste, and the throat spray. If you suffer from this read on because I will tell you what did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the above being said, this did work for general bad breathe. The gross white film on my tongue disappeared, and I dipped my floss into this before flossing to get rid of the smell between my teeth. I could tell there was a smell there because when I flossed I could smell it.&lt;br /&gt;The method I used was&lt;br /&gt;1. prerinse&lt;br /&gt;2. floss&lt;br /&gt;3.tongue scrape&lt;br /&gt;4. brush teeth&lt;br /&gt;5.post rinse&lt;br /&gt;6. throat spray&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you suffering from tonsil stones I am going to provide you to my reviews of two products that did work to significantly reduce the amount of tonsil stones I get. Please read my reviews as I discuss how I use them. I do not know why this helped to prevent my tonsil stones but I do know that I went from getting them several times a week to a few times a year. I don&#x27;t discuss my tonsil problems in my review of the ear oil but I do believe that the ear oil and peroxide in the ears provided a huge impact on my tonsil health. (I started thinking there was a relation because when I would clean my ears with a wet q tip and smell it, it had a similar smell to tonsil stones, not nearly as bad, but something similar to it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/review/R26OSUEX71PB1X/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B0001TNCK0&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HAYQERRJ10XQ/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B001E11CPQ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a tonsil stone sufferer and this helped you please vote it up so I can help others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comment if you have any questions at all, I would be happy to respond and answer any questions you have.</li>
    <li> Does the job as expected.</li>
    <li> If you are someone who suffers from extreme dry mouth,especially at night, this product really helps!  Just a couple sprays near the back of your mouth after brushing and in the morning you mouth will be moist.</li>
    <li> Very good product for bad breathe and helps when my throat hurts or have mucus down my throat. Using it more like a cold remedy now but I love the product.</li>
    <li> Good but needs a LOT of sprays. The mouthwash works more effectively.</li>
    <li> Very good for instant breath control</li>
    <li> Works well on onion and garlic breath. Even though it&#x27;s a little high-priced in the long run you get your moneys worth</li>
    <li> It works great and you&#x27;ll know that because you can really feel the taste of what you just ate/drink go away in seconds. It doesn&#x27;t leave your breath minty or whatever but it sure does make your breath smell normal. I like it like I like all other Thera products like Thera Drops. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I must say I was a little skeptical even though I use the mouth we wash but I decided to get everything including a tongue scapper, toothpaste etc... and it works</li>
    <li> A good thing to have in your car before you meet your date. Tastes good and goes well with the other Dr.Katz&#x27;s products</li>
    <li> Generally takes about 5 sprays to get the full effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works good, but to a limit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very small bottle, could be a lot bigger for the price.</li>
    <li> A quality product from TheraBreath.  Seemed to help with tonsil stones. It is a little bit strong, but works quite well and I have bought it multiple times.</li>
    <li> It smells like peroxide mixed with soda. Will not buy again. The taste of it made me sick a little.</li>
    <li> One of the best breath sprays I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This stuff saved my marriage.  I eat a lot - - no a ton of garlic.  If you know what I mean</li>
    <li> I tried this spray because I like Dr. Katz&#x27;s lozenges. The two do NOT taste alike in the least. This reminded me of the bad taste of Biotene spray. Once again, there is nothing on the market as effective AND great-tasting as Oasis spray. Disappointing since Oasis is so expensive.</li>
    <li> I swear this stuff actually keeps me from getting sick (with colds and such) AND reduces my tonsil stones too. I love it. Good buy.</li>
    <li> Like the therabreath mouthwash more, but give this a try if want to go all in</li>
    <li> Gives me fresh breath</li>
    <li> Not really that strong of a spray.  I think the mints and mouthwash of this brand are much better and more effective of killing bad breath germs.</li>
    <li> Horrrrrrrrrrrrible taste....could barely swallow without almost throwing up</li>
    <li> This is amazin! I am diabetic and was experiencing bad breath issues😞 I tried everything NOThing worked and I remembered years ago a friend told me she had gr8 results from using the products so went out and&lt;br /&gt;I brought the spray, toothpaste and mouthwash and let me tell you...it is phenomenal👏👏👏</li>
    <li> I stick with the brand of toothpaste and mouthwash, as well as oral spray, effective action is not a very long time to solve the fundamental body had to start with bad breath, proper diet reasonable sleep, improve good habits, regular brushing</li>
    <li> Great product that makes my mouth feel so fresh!  I got the toothpaste and mouthwash, too!  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product is mouth-friendly. I mean doesn&#x27;t sting and gentle to the throat. Started using TheraBreath &amp;#34;for a try&amp;#34; but now it&#x27;s a regular item in my dental care shelf. Hello TheraBreath...GOOD BYE BAD BREATH!</li>
    <li> More wonderfulMore wonderful</li>
    <li> It arrived broken. The sprayer never worked. I tried using it like mouthwash, but it is supposed to be misted, so I ended up tossing it. I like their other products. As an occasional cigar smoker, I was hoping this would do the trick after a smoke. I cannot recommend it.</li>
    <li> The smell and taste is terrible</li>
    <li> If I could only get my teenager to use it more often! Works well though!</li>
    <li> LIKE MANY OTHER THINGS ON/IN OUR BODIES, AS WE GET OLDER, THEY LIKE TO FALL APART AND GIVE US MORE TROUBLE, AND MORE UPKEEP TIME THAN THEY DID WHEN WE WERE YOUNG AND SPUNKY. I HAVE TO USE ONE OF THOSE BREATHING MACHINES AT NIGHT NOW...SEEMS LIKE HALF MY FRIENDS DO, AND IT CAUSES ONES&#x27; MOUTH TO DRY OUT, INCLUDING THE TEETH WHICH LEADS TO CAVITIES AND OTHER TROUBLES. MORINING MOUTH TAKES ON A NEW MEANING AFTER HAVING SPENT THE NIGHT BREATHING UNDER THE AUSPICES OF SOME MACHINE, AND THE DENTIST TOLD ME IT WAS CAUSING LITTLE CAVITIES IN MY TEETH.&lt;br /&gt;(SEEMS LIKE THE SOLUTION TO ALL PROBLEMS...FIX ONE AND IT CAUSES ANOTHER!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I FOUND A LARGE BOTTLE OF THERA BREATH AT AMAZON AND ALSO THIS SMALLER SPRAY CONTAINER THAT I CAN CARRY AROUND WITH ME IN CASE I AM AFRAID OF A BAD BREATH EPISODE. I USE IT WHEN I GET READY TO ENTER ANY ACTIVITY WITH OTHERS, I CERTAINLY DO NOT WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE A HUG AND GROSS THEM OUT WITH BAD BREATH. I FIND THIS REALLY HANDY.&lt;br /&gt;THERE ARE OTHER BREATH FIXER UPPERS ON THE MARKET, BUT THEY TEND TO COME IN TINY CONTAINERS WHICH GET LOST IN THE BOTTOM OF MY PURSE; ALTHOUGH, I CARRY A HOLDER FOR SUCH THINGS IN MY PURSE, SOMEHOW THE MOST NEEDED ITEMS SEEM TO FIND A WAY TO MIGRATE TO A HIDDEN, INACCESSIBLE CORNER. IMPOSSSIBLE TO FIND AT A HIGHLY NEEDED MOMENT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS BREATH FRESHENER. IT WORKS...THE MOST IMPORTANT AND IT IS BIG ENOUGH, AND HAS AN UNUSUAL DESIGN SO THAT WHEN NEEDED, IT IS EASY TO LOCATE AND ASSURE THAT MY BREATH IS IN GOOD WORKING CONDITION. I DO RECOMMEND IT TO ALL WHO HAVE BREATH CONCERNS...AND FOR YOUNGSTERS....YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THE BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR A KISS WILL COME ALONG. SO THIS IS FOR ALL. DO BUY.</li>
    <li> Not great &amp; actually tastes gross.</li>
    <li> Good design, but very small container.</li>
    <li> Not as expected - breath not as fresh as I hoped for.</li>
    <li> I felt this was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference. Does not leave a minty taste either. You are better off with the listerene pocket breath sprays, those work wonders and last for hours.</li>
    <li> Short term oxygenating effect for a dry mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this probably works well for some people but not for me.  I was expecting something that would just sterilize and freshen my breath like most sprays, but this has more of a drug like effect.  I don&#x27;t mean that it affects you mentally I just mean that it causes you to generate a lot of saliva.  This helps with bad breath but I didn&#x27;t care for it.  It left a strange taste in my mouth as well.  Overall, it&#x27;s more powerful than I would like it to be.</li>
    <li> I have very dry mouth and this helps me get to sleep by making it much easier for me to swallow.</li>
    <li> Absolute magic.  Several medications connive to give me a problem with drymouth, which far too often leads to thrush (which kills sense of taste and causes sore tongue and throat - not fun.)  Thera-breath came up in a search for anti-thrush treatments.  It works wonderfully.  It also ensures inoffensive breath.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Wonderful spray that does not tase bad like all other throat sprays!</li>
    <li> Oh man, just the best thing. My guy suddenly starting having breath issues out of the blue like a year ago. We bought the Therabreath toothpaste and mouthwash and mints. That all helped for sure, but didn&#x27;t stop the occasional (like every few days) flare-up. I was especially disappointed in the mints. They really don&#x27;t work that well, or only sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray is GREAT. KILLS the bad breath, instantly, every time. LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think we&#x27;ll try the probiotics next, because I wish this was not even an issue on the daily, and probiotics could be a more semi-permanent solution.</li>
    <li> Kills your bad breath. But it is tough in your mouth.</li>
    <li> great product! Delivered super fast and well packaged. Will order again!</li>
    <li> For my wife. Worked well at first but doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as initial use. Need to consult physician again.</li>
    <li> Seems to work...taste is not bad.</li>
    <li> Not sure how this is working</li>
    <li> Outstanding product that helps you have a better security while around others due to sour, garlicy or bad morning breath....two to three squirts and you are good to go.</li>
