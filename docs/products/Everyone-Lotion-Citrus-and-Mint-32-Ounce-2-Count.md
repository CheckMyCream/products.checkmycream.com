<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The perfect face and body lotion.  It makes your skin soft and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Good amount for the price. Some people do not like the smell, but I do!</li>
    <li> Too liquidity and doesn&#x27;t moisturize well.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! I&#x27;ve been looking for a good, all natural body lotion and I&#x27;m so happy I finally found a good one. I used to use burts bees but it just wasn&#x27;t as good to me.</li>
    <li> Really good lotion.  Great price, nice scent.</li>
    <li> Product is good so far. Will buy it again</li>
    <li> Oh I should have known... Any lotion with a scent is not for me.  It is LOUD, if you can call a smell that.  Overpowering is more like it.  It was pleasant enough, but not for me.  Can&#x27;t say much about the feel because I had to wash it off.  I am not saying that it is a bad lotion, I just can&#x27;t handle scents... migraines.</li>
    <li> I am almost finished with the Every Day Shea Moisturizing Lotion, Sent Lavender.  I wanted to order something different as the everyone lotion Lavender and aloe has a better sent to it and a little bit more moisturizing than the Shea Body Lotion.  The sent from the lotion disappears a few moments after you put the lotion on.  Your skin feels a little smoother with Everyone Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aspects of the product that I don&#x27;t like are some of the ingredients which are in every lotion no matter what is bought.  The organic ingredients are alright for you but the other  added ingredients are not.  The quality of the product seems pretty good as far as feel of it.  The other non organic ingredients in it makes it very low quality.  That goes for every lotion on the market.  The one good thing is that is is certified Non GMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will up date in regards if I receive a replacement Lotion or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received the replacement lotion today the second one and It is delivered the same way as the first one.  Web Vitamins do not take returns at all.  It looks like I am stuck with both of them.  I just called them again today and customer service is suppose to get back to me and as she is going to call the manufacturer to find out what is wrong concerning their packaging and delivery.&lt;br /&gt;When I find out I will write more.  I am not going to order from them again even since they sent me a second one opened with a tape around the pump part.  I will buy it from Whole Foods Store from now on as at least I will know it was not used ant not a completely full bottle as some of the lotion leaked out of it again. What I am thinking it was opened and taped before it was packaged and delivered to me. I don&#x27;t think it is unsafe but I don&#x27;t like products opened before they are sent to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are better off buying it from the Whole foods Store as you won&#x27;t have to pay shipping costs plus tax.  Whole foods it costs $10.00 plus 6.35% tax which comes toa total of $10.64 As the shipping and handling was approximately $3.00, This is in detail $10.00 + $3.00+ .64 &#x3D; $13.64.  Why spend the extra $3.00 when you don&#x27;t have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is another update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I got in touch with Web Vitamin Customer Service.  They said they called the manufacturer and was told there was nothing wrong with the lotion.  I called the manufacturer today and was told which they are not sure of if it was opened by web vitamin and taped it themselves.  I also noticed on there box from web vitamin comes from somewhere else as it has a name on it (Boiron), and another label which has Arnicare  Gel 2.6 oz. Twin pack, 12 twin packs, contains 12 units Arnicare Gel twin packs, Product No# A4704 with a barcode, a lot No# M3033272TW with a barcode, there is also another barcode on it and another barcode with another number. This box comes from somewhere else which is in parentheses.  This label was covered over with my shipping label over it. That was the second box the lotion was in.  The first box that was sent to me with the lotion there were no markings or other labels.  Another thing I almost forgot to say is web Vitamin is refunding me $9.37. Web Vitamin is keeping $4.83 more than I paid for shipping and handling on me.  The Shipping must have been actually $1.83.  This is what I paid Total For this product $14.20 when I bought it from web vitamin seller from Amazon.  The product cost me $9.57, they are keeping $4.63.  In other words the shipping and handling didn&#x27;t cost that much for them.  I believe every time the shipping and handling is always more than the actual price.  The venders make more money than you think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UP Date  Oct 15, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I am not to crazy about the lotion.  It is not that moisturizing, when it spreads on my skin I have to put a lot on as it feels watery and sticky until it soaks in.  It doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel smooth as it feels like you never put any lotion on at all.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy this lotion.  Eventually I am going to try 365 organic lotion from whole foods, I believe it doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals in it like the regular lotions do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different lotions, I have unusually dry skin so I&#x27;ve done a good amount of experimentation. While it isn&#x27;t a cure-all. I really like this lotion. The lavender smell is nice and not over-powering. The lotion isn&#x27;t super thick or oily once rubbed in. I can&#x27;t stand slippery oily hands, so this was a good fit. I&#x27;ve used it on my hands, feet, and face and it is very gentle and hasn&#x27;t created any reaction. Definitely recommend trying. You get a lot for your money and it&#x27;s not filled with chemicals that are not good for your skin. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> My favorite body lotion. I love the smell and hydration. I am very disappointed with Amazon. The cream was spilt all over the packaging. What a loss!! I have reported this and shall wait and see.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with this lotion.  It has a great scent, not greasy, and very moisturizing.  My entire family (including my newborn) use it.  I love it and have added it to my Subscribe and Save list.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I was really excited to find this lotion on Amazon (and read all of the great reviews). It&#x27;s an okay lotion... but it doesn&#x27;t really moisturize that deeply. It&#x27;s not greasy, which I like, but when it sinks in quickly, it feels like I didn&#x27;t even moisturize my skin. I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I wrote this on Facebook just a bit ago -but also want the Amazon Community to read my opinion on this lotion too! I picked up a bottle in Lavender and Aloe. this lotion is very light , non greasy and easily absorbed. My skin is left with a very soft well moisturized feel. I usually get frustrated with lotions for never really sinking in and just staying on the surface making me hot sticky and feeling like I&#x27;m covered in plastic LOL This is not the case for the everyone lotion on me!! I really love it. My skin is lightly scented with a mild clean smell. It is not overwhelming at all. The biggest test in how I would like this overall is the sweat test. I run, cycle, and take dance spin and body pump gym classes. Spin is a total sweatfest- and I noticed all kinds of moisturizers burn my eyes and sting my face when sweating. Everyone lotion does not! I am very picky with moisturizers, to the point that I even make my own body butters! But for the summer I always hunt for lightweight lotions that do the job and have a nice pump dispenser. This is it! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I am also happy with the price point too. You really do get a bang for the buck. Thanks &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR? (too long didn&#x27;t read?!!lol)&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs well&lt;br /&gt;workout friendly (doesn&#x27;t sting my face while sweating)&lt;br /&gt;great price&lt;br /&gt;smells fantastic&lt;br /&gt;Happy Customer!&lt;br /&gt;Buy it peeps!!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Fragrance is not over powering.  I have sensitive skin and it works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;Better Ingredients &#x3D; Healthier alternative to lotions that you apply to your bare skin!!  Remember the skin is our biggest organ....you want to be careful of the chemicals you expose it to.  Most brand name super popular brands have some pretty scary ingredients.  EDUCATE YOURSELVES!!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful lotion, real good price.</li>
    <li> This lotion is what I and my family have been looking for. The smell is nice though some in my family say they don&#x27;t like the smell of lavender and mint. Overall a go to lotion and I would buy it again, I plan on buying the soap next time.</li>
    <li> The scent is not what I expected. Doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender scents I am use too. Lotion itself is mild and goes on easy. I wont purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is really good skin lotion  absorbs quickly and non greasy..will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Great smell (although it is strong, so make sure you like lavender), not sticky at all, even if you apply a lot. It&#x27;s not super moisturizing if you have very dry skin, but I have dry skin and it works well!</li>
    <li> This lotion not only smells amazing, but it is also very soothing. I putchased a few lotions with this one to try out on my hubby who has sensitive and dry skin due to the change in weather. This lotion is not watery or too heavy. It soaks right in to your skin with no greasy residue. I highly recommend giving this well priced lotion a try. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I love it but the scent on this one is quite strong.  I preferred the citrus + mint one but they stopped offering it as the &amp;#34;subscribe &amp; save&amp;#34; so I might just pay the extra couple dollars because that scent was wonderful.</li>
    <li> My standard all over body lotion. Love the scent and the applicability. Very moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product becauase of the amount of lotion you receive for the price. I have made the switch to all natural lotions that do not contain a plethora of chemical ingredients. Before buying this product I thoroughly read the list of ingredients before purchasing. When I opened the package I also read the label on the lotion only to discover that it contains DIMETHICONE. I do not use products that contain this ingredient and I was very upset to find that they leave the last few ingredients on the bottle OUT of the description on the amazon listing. This is extremely misleading and upsetting. I am filing a return right now and I will not purchase from this company again.</li>
    <li> This lotion is fantastic! It&#x27;s very light, moisturizes well, feels very natural, and is not greasy at all! The lavender smell is great! It&#x27;s slightly strong when you&#x27;re applying it, but it goes away after a few minutes. I LOVE it! The only thing I would change is to make it Prime eligible instead of an Add-On.</li>
    <li> Good size bottle and smells so good.</li>
    <li> Really nice scent and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel to your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Minimal ingredients, wonderful size, great price for the quality/quantity. I will be purchasing it again when I (one day) run out!</li>
    <li> I love the fact that you can use this from face to feet! I have dry skin and this is a great item. I like the fact that it is in a large jar instead of an itty bitty jar, so there is less waste. I like the smell (lavender) and it is not sticky. I think this is a great item and will continue to order it. Also there is a liquid soap, which I like because I like to layer the lavender fragrance.</li>
    <li> This lotion indeed does smell great and is not greasy.  My only point to bring up is that the bottle is huge so if you have a smaller shower, this might take up half of the space.</li>
    <li> This is a light lotion and will not serve as an adequate substitute for those who need a thick cream such as [[ASIN:B001ET76EE Cetaphil]]. However, for those who are looking for a hand lotion, or who do not have excessively dry skin, this might work. I&#x27;ve listed below the ingredients and explanations for those whose meaning is not obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of particular note: There are a lot of different preservatives in this product, and to me, at least, it seems like overkill. These include: Vegetable Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sodium Phytate, Tocopheryl, Sodium Phytate, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, and Potassium Sorbate. It would be great if they could have kept the natural preservatives, and left out the questionable ones. The safe, natural ones include: Vegetable Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Tocopheryl, Citric Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, and Potassium Sorbate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Purified Water, Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Stearyl Alcohol, Organic Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Lecithin, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetyl Esters, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, EO Organic Herbal Blend [Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf, Organic Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Organic Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, and Organic Camelia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Organic Camelia Sinensis Leaf Extract, EO Essential Oil Blend [Lavandula Augustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Lavandula Hybrida Oil], Xanthan Gum, Sodium Phytate, Dimethicone, Citric Acid, Phenoxethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Vegetable Glycerin: This substance is used in commercial foods and beverages to impart moisture, provide sweetness, and emulsify and preserve food. It is used in cosmetic and medical preparations as a humectant, emulsifier and preservative. It imparts a smooth sensation to the skin or a smooth mouth feel in foods. Glycerine can be made from food-grade fats and oils or petroleum products, but neither food, cosmetic, nor pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. are required to reveal the source of the glycerine they use.&lt;br /&gt;*Glyceryl Stearate: This ingredient is created in a lab by reacting glycerin with stearic acid (a fatty acid obtained from animal and vegetable fats and oils). It functions as a moisturizer, but it can be a skin irritant for people with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;*Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride: This is a substance produced from fatty acids of coconut or palm kernel oil via esterification, a chemical reaction between alcohol and the fatty acid. This process gives the oil a silky feel on the skin. This ester has antioxidant properties, making it a natural preservative, and it is considered safe for sensitive skin. It is often used as a neutral carrier oil for an active ingredient, for example, bioidentical progesterone.&lt;br /&gt;*Cetearyl Olivate &amp; Sorbitan Olivate: These hypoallergenic emulsifiers are derived from olive oil and are used in \\&quot;natural\\&quot; cosmetics as a substitute for polyethylene glycol (PEG), a more problematic emulsifier. The fatty acids in olive oil undergo a process called esterification, a chemical reaction between alcohol and a fatty acid. Afterwards they are combined with sorbitol (a sugar alcohol) and cetearyl alcohol (a combination of stearyl alcohol and cetyl alcohol, fatty alcohols derived from coconut oil).&lt;br /&gt;*Stearyl Alcohol: This is a fatty alcohol derived from coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;*Tocopheryl: This is a form of vitamin E, a safe preservative. It is generally healing to the skin, but some people can develop an allergy to it, resulting in skin rashes, especially around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;*Lecithin: This substance is prepared by extracting and purifying phospholipids from products such as eggs, soybeans, sunflower and canola seeds. In food products and cosmetics, lecithin is used as an emulsifier. At issue is how exactly it is derived. Lecithin is a fatty substance that is extracted either chemically or mechanically. Certainly some small businesses around the world exist which employ non-toxic, cold-press methods of extraction, but big factories do not. They create lecithin by means of highly toxic, carcinogenic chemicals such benzene and hexane. The food and cosmetic industry are not required to report on their labels how the lecithin they use is extracted, so we have no reliable way of knowing how safe it is.&lt;br /&gt;*Cetyl Alcohol: This oil is produced by hydrogenation of vegetable oils such as palm oil and coconut oil. It is used by the cosmetic industry as an emollient, emulsifier or thickening agent in skin creams and lotions. In rare cases people with eczema find it a skin irritant, but that may be due to impurities in the cetyl alcohol rather than the cetyl alcohol itself.&lt;br /&gt;*Cetyl Esters: This is a type of wax derived from saturated fatty alcohols and saturated fatty acids. It is an emulsifier; it increases viscosity, and it imparts a smooth feel to cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;*Xanthan Gum: This is a food and cosmetic additive used as a thickening agent and as a stabilizer that keeps ingredients from separating. It is produced by fermenting glucose, sucrose, or lactose with the Xanthomonas campestris bacterium, then processing the resulting polysaccharide with isopropyl alcohol, and drying and grinding the resulting product into a fine powder.&lt;br /&gt;*Sodium Phytate: This compound is a complex sodium salt of phytic acid, which occurs naturally in beans, seeds, nuts and grains. Plants store the mineral phosphorus in phytic acid in a tightly bound molecule which is not easily bioavailable to humans and animals with one stomach. Phytic acid, from any source, is a natural chelating agent. This is a good thing if you wish to remove heavy metals from the body, but a bad thing if it binds with necessary minerals in one&#x27;s food, such as calcium, magnesium, iron and zinc, making them non-bioavailable to the body. Phytic acid can also inhibit digestive enzymes. Nutritionists who decry phytic acid, insist that it is important to avoid beans, seeds, nuts and grains--and any other source of it. Phytic acid has the following uses in cosmetics: it blocks the formation of melanin in the skin, so it can bleach it; it inhibits free-radical formation which makes it a natural preservative; it chelates calcium ions, preventing tartar and stain buildup on teeth; it prevents the fatty acids in cosmetics from oxidating (becoming rancid).&lt;br /&gt;*Dimethicone AKA Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS): This is a lab-created polymer derived from silicon (silicone), a naturally occurring earth element. It is approved for internal and external use. Allergic reactions usually occur when exposed to this substance in the form of a powder. They include itchy, burning skin, hives, dermatitis, swelling of the mouth and breathing problems. Silicone derivatives act as anti-foaming agents and emollients. They make anything they are in more spreadable. They cause skin and hair to feel silky smooth. They create a protective barrier on the skin that acts as a water repellent, much like petrolatum. They can fill in fine lines on the skin and temporarily smooth out wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;*Citric acid: This is a natural acid found in many fruits which is a safe preservative. It softens water because it has a chelating effect, that is, it binds with minerals and impurities to allow a cleaning formula to work better.&lt;br /&gt;*Phenoxyethanol: This is an organic glycol ether frequently used in cosmetics, vaccines and pharmaceuticals as a preservative. It is also used as a topical antiseptic, as an insect repellent, and as a solvent for dyes, inks, and resins. When information about the dangers of parabens became widely accepted, quite a few cosmetic companies switched to this preservative which initially seemed safe. Unfortunately, research has begun to reveal that it also may be toxic. Many people develop dermatitis from prolonged exposure to it. It can worsen skin conditions like eczema, and there is growing evidence that it may be a xenoestrogen like the parabens.&lt;br /&gt;*Benzyl Alcohol: This substance is used as a preservative in IV medication solutions and in cosmetics because of its bacteriostatic and antipruritic properties. It is considered very low risk. It is produced naturally by many plants and commonly found in fruits and teas. It is found in many essential oils, such as jasmine, hyacinth, and ylang-ylang.&lt;br /&gt;*Potassium Sorbate: This is a preservative that prevents the growth of mold, fungi, and bacteria. It is a potassium salt version of sorbic acid, a naturally occurring polyunsaturated fat. It is derived naturally from the mountain ash tree, but the food industry uses a synthetic version. It is considered non-toxic as it breaks down in the body as water and carbon dioxide.digestive enzymes. Nutritionists who decry phytic acid, insist that it is important to avoid beans, seeds, nuts and grains--and any other source of it.

    <li> works great, smells great, and great value. Also has a very nice and pleasant scent. Hopefully, it will still be available when I need it again.</li>
    <li> Lotion is good quality, but the real lavender fragrance is too strong. We only use it in the office if we need to cover up another odor, which does happen in a pet hospital.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of lotion! I love the price for the size and the quality and natural ingredients are excellent! It&#x27;s light enough for summer and absorbs quickly. I don&#x27;t find it too lightweight, but it&#x27;s definitely not heavy. My skin is usually normal, I just like to keep it moisturized. However, I&#x27;ve  noticed that this winter, my skins been a little bit on the dryer side and this wasn&#x27;t really enough so I&#x27;ve had to switch to body butter, but I will go back to this come spring, summer and fall.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the Lavender and Aloe scent. I was horribly disappointed: it smells like rosemary, which I hate. I love the lemon and coconut one, though the lemon is more prominent. Both scents are strong right out of the bottle but fade quickly once absorbed into the skin. I still didn&#x27;t like the Lavender/aloe, just a weird scent. My friend did, so I gave it to her instead of returning it so I don&#x27;t feel like I lost out, I&#x27;ll just stick to the Lemon/Coconut from now on.</li>
    <li> Love the texture, ingridients, smell and price of this lotion. And customer service is amazing as too!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect lotion! Not too thick or thin. Light fragrance. Works to moisturize, and there is just something refreshing about it. It is also a good deal as you get a lot for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion and it smells like real fresh lavender. The smell is at first strong but fade away in the following 5 min. The texture is just write, a good emollient but not greasy at all. Hey, 32 oz! No parabens or chemicals that are toxic for your body...it&#x27;s a very good product at a very low price. I hope Amazon is going to keep selling it! I recommend it for those who like the aroma of lavender.</li>
    <li> This is a nice lotion for everyday use.  I have been using it on my face (and I am 65+), moisturizes without looking greasy all day.  It&#x27;s also good for all over use.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent and it works great and is cheap for how big of a container you get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy to find a more natural lotion for my family but it is very thin, I dont use it.  And the smell is quite strong, and I usually like the smell of lavender, but this is a little too much. I won&#x27;t get it again.</li>
    <li> This arrived ontime and in excellent shape. I really like the fact that this lotion has less man made ingredients in it than in most I have seen. The lavendar smell is also very good but not overwhelming. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Nice Lavender smell. Goes on nice on the skin. Use it currently for my hands and it seems to keep them nice and soft. However, i do not have very dry skin so can&#x27;t review that aspect of the product. But as a cream and a scent that dissipates it is a nice cream and others who saw that I had it liked it to.</li>
    <li> I love this Lotion! If you want a lotion that is toxic free and smells great this is the product for you.  I apply it on my feet and over my knees and elbows in this horrible winter we are having in New York City...Brrrrrr! and my feet are smooths as a babies b___T! No itching from dry skin and a light Lavender scent...:-)  Im happy and have to order more.  Thanks hope this help anyone with the winter blues and dry skin....&lt;br /&gt;Rebecca</li>
    <li> they were a quick shipper and the product was as described.  the price was far and I would recommend them to my friends</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! Its not greasy although there are essential oils in it.  I like that you can use it everywhere on the body!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Smells great and makes my skin feel super smooth. My boyfriend uses it and doesn&#x27;t complain that it&#x27;s a &amp;quot;girly smell&amp;quot; since it doesn&#x27;t linger. Love it and will buy again!</li>
    <li> This lotion is too runny. It smells nice though but not great for dry areas that&#x27;s why I gave it three stars</li>
    <li> I LOVE their coconut lemon lotion and soap so I thought I&#x27;d try this one for a change. I think it smells very medicinal and simply nasty. I hate to waste it by throwing it away, but don&#x27;t know who on earth would want it if I were to give it away. I can&#x27;t believe how they hit a home run with one scent and somehow created another that makes me want to puke.</li>
    <li> The scent was not great at all.  Had to throw it out.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Gentle enough for the face and body.  Family loved it so much I had to order more.  Leaves the skin soft without excess oil.</li>
    <li> Works good, is light and absorves well. i wouldn&#x27;t recommend for very dry skins but it does the job and does not irritate.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this lotion, it is huge for the price and I use it on my body and recently my face.  My skin feels softer than before.</li>
    <li> I bought the Everyone Soap a while ago in Citrus Mint when I was looking for a decent soap to use on my sensitive skin. I was impressed with the size for the price, so when I went to buy some lotion, naturally I considered this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent of lavender, especially since I apply lotion at night before I go to bed. This lotion smells great, but it is a bit strong -- if you&#x27;re looking for a more delicate lavender scent, this might not be for you. I really enjoy it, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is lightweight and feels good on the skin. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft and moisturized. As someone with very dry, itchy skin, this is a good summer lotion, but I doubt it will work for the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product with great value. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> What is not to love?!  The ingredients are fairly good in this lotion and it isn&#x27;t so thick that you spend a half hour rubbing it in.  We prefer lotions that you can apply quickly and soak in quickly.  This is a great basic lotion for everyone.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last very long but that is honestly preferred.  The unscented one has better ingredients but this one has a nice, light, refreshing scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this when Amazon offered a 20% off coupon.  To get the free shipping I went ahead and sprang for the matching body wash, and coconut lemon lotion along with another small item.  This lotion is pretty close to perfect.  It moisturizes without being greasy, and smells great.  I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> First time user of this stuff but so far so good and my husband and I both like the scent.  Always willing to try something new in lotions if it is a good price.  It says you can use this all over, even your face but I have not tried it on my face yet, everywhere else it works well.  Think I will buy another bottle in another scent and see how we like it.  Love the big bottle as well as the pump.</li>
    <li> My husband and I rub each other&#x27;s feet every evening while watching tv, and this lotion has been great for that. It&#x27;s not greasy, and yet it retains the &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34; that is so critical to massaging. Leaves the skin feeling very satiny. Nice fragrance also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We like the price, only $9.99--much cheaper than a lot of lotions, and much healthier for you than most too. We try to be very conscious of what&#x27;s in the lotions we use--so many preservatives, etc. and this one is better than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have, however, recently began using pure, extra-virgin coconut oil, and while it is super greasy, it does feel heavenly once it&#x27;s absorbed. We like that it doesn&#x27;t have anything harmful in it at all, but again, it&#x27;s pretty greasy.</li>
    <li> The lavender lotion fragrance is nice at first sniff, but then has a horrible after and lasting s.  Its kind of a spoled food smell, as if u left mayonnaise in the sun.  it bothers me so much that I had to shower it off each time I tried it. I gave it multiple times to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a fluke. It just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> This is Non- GMO and organic. Love that about this lotion. We are not putting a ton of chemicals we can&#x27;t pronounce on ourselves for our body to absorb.Has a pleasant smell too.</li>
    <li> I really like the scent and the fact that it&#x27;s mostly free of chemicals.  It&#x27;s not greasy either and absorbs well into the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about 1 yr now and I absolutely love the product, the price, and not to mention the nautral ingredients! I use this on my hands and feet every night before bed because the Lavendar and Aloe scent is so soothing. Looking forward to trying more of this companies scents and products!</li>
    <li> We all use this lotion and we all love it. It smells great and leaves our skin nice and smooth. It is light, but not too light. I use it all over my body and so does my toddler. I love a lotion that she can use too.</li>
    <li> False advertising. Product contains dimethicone which is not listed until you get the bottle! I returned upon receipt. I am so disappointed.</li>
    <li> Our whole family uses this lotion, including the babies.  Very light, but gets the job done.  The smell is just amazing (if you like lavender), even the hubby uses it.</li>
    <li> I Love this lotion!.. My most sensitive clients can use it on there skin with no issues.  The sent is very pleasing is not overwhelming at all.. great find!..</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It has a nice smell and feels good and is not very expensive.</li>
    <li> Consistency is more creamy than lotion-y. Runs smoothly on skin though. Smells good.</li>
    <li> I made sure to read the reviews when I ordered this product. The first time I tried it the first thing I noticed was the overwhelming smell. Lavender is supposed to have a calming effect. I would say this did the opposite. There was also kind of an earthy smell that came with it. That being said. I don&#x27;t want to waste the lotion so of coarse I&#x27;m going to use it. It does the job and leaves me feeling fresh but the smell is too much for me.</li>
    <li> too liquidy. Looking for something that actually feels like lotion not water.</li>
    <li> This lotion has been great! It absorbs well, leaving no greasy feeling. Sometimes lotions that absorb like that, don&#x27;t really quench my dry skin, but this lotion has done a great job of moisturizing. I love having one bottle for face, hands, and body. And the lavender is lovely!</li>
    <li> This lotion made me break out on my arms and legs with some sort of rash/pimples.  I  previously bought the lemon + coconut lotion and I had the same reaction to it. I thought it was the lemon in the lotion that caused my reaction to it, now I know it&#x27;s something else  in their lotion that I am allergic to.  If you have  sensetive skin like me please do some testing on a small part of your body  for a couple of days before you start using it on a regular basis. I had to threw away the first bottle and this one is sitting on my dresser only used once. This one is also going to the trash if I don&#x27;t find some to give it to.</li>
    <li> Great price for the lotion amout considered it has organic ingredients. Soaks into skin fast enough and keeps it moisturized all day. Paraben and other cancer causing chemical free. It has a lavender smell to it but not everyone might like it (my husband doesn&#x27;t). Lotion has stronger smell then then the soap. Safe to use on hands, face and body. My 6 year old also likes this lotion :)</li>
    <li> I am always skeptical about what I slather on my skin.  I have to say that I really appreciate how natural and effective this lotion is. True to its name, EVERYONE in our family uses it. Love the smell too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m crazy about lavender  I love that spicy, almost citrusy scent of pure lavender oil and how it does soothe my nerves.  I have a variation of dermatitis and my skin dries out very quickly, so I wanted something closer to organic (fewer harsh irritants) but in a good quantitiy so I don&#x27;t have to buy lotion again every two weeks or so (I have to lotion every day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man does this fit the bill!  It&#x27;s thcker than I thought which is great, but absorbs pretty quickly.  While I was putting it on I was overwhlemed by the strong lavender scent.  I was worried it was going to stay that strong all day, but after a few minutes it had reduced to the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; lavendar scent, no spicy undertone.  Within an hour there&#x27;s really no scent to it at all.  This works for me because I do like to wear different perfumes and body mists.  So I can use this lotion and my perfumes without worrying about the scents clashing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin stays well moisturized all day - I&#x27;ve even done the scratch test the folliwng morning before my shower and my skin is still not dry. 32 oz. will easily last me a month and a half, maybe 2 months.  And at 10 bucks a bottle that definitely works for my budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new staple and I will be signing up for the subscribe &amp; save program when I order my next bottle.  I hope they don&#x27;t change a thing about this stuff, it&#x27;s perfect as is and I love it!</li>
    <li> My husband said it&#x27;s my best smelling lotion yet. Great for face and body as it&#x27;s not heavy. Love the large size.</li>
    <li> Light feel with a scent that works for everyone! We use it at the sink as a hand lotion.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Definitely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Great product, great scent. Just tried the lemon-coconut and it smells even more heavenly.</li>
    <li> Pretty bummed -- this lotion makes me break out into a red rash when I put it on after a shower! I noticed it on my chest, shoulders, &amp; back. Bought it for cold, dry winters in MN... but unfortunately can&#x27;t use it :(  I&#x27;m only giving it 2 stars because it does smell nice. I can use it on my hands &amp; feet maybe, but its not good on everyone&#x27;s skin. I don&#x27;t even usually have &#x27;sensitive&#x27; skin, but damn, this stuff burns!!</li>
    <li> I use EO lotions in combination with dr bronners soaps and love it. I even massage a couple pumps of this into my hair after  showering with dr bronners and it makes my hair smooth and easily detangles without leaving any sort of greasy feeling that most conditioners leave. Same with the skin, it doesnt leave that greasy film behind. Only lotion i use now</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell whether a lotion isn&#x27;t doing its job or whether the weather is just really, really bad and no lotion would help. This lotion is great for light-duty moisturizing, but my hands crack and hurt in the winter. This stuff couldn&#x27;t really keep up. I had to apply it multiple times a day to really keep my hands supple. It does smell good, but the smell evaporates almost instantly on rubbing it in. It does absorb well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short version: Good for very light moisturizing. Not good for serious moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Our favorite lotion - light, moisturizing, and a nice natural smell. My hubby uses it, my 3 year old, my 3 month old, and myself. It goes on my face and body every day. This lavender/aloe scent is the second we&#x27;ve tried and have liked them both.</li>
    <li> Its more on strong lavender scent, and also more on the lighted less sticky formulation. Good buy for it&#x27;s price</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have been using the Everyone line since they came out for our whole family.  We enjoy the lightness of the scent and feel.</li>
    <li> Smells excellent. The lavender smells strong, my husband wont use it. But moisturizes the body well, absorbs quickly &amp; I LOVE the scent. Reminds me of EO&#x27;s French Lavender. (almost seems like a a copy of their stuff) but I like it and you can&#x27;t beat the price for this large bottle. Packaging is a little lame but its OK.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t break out with this lotion. Great ingredients, great smell, and leaves my skin soft. I usually put it on after I shower.</li>
    <li> When I received this, the lotion was all over the box which was disappointing. Other than that I would give 5 stars for such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and how soft it makes my skin feel. Even my college sons like it. It is a universal awesome body cream that does not have  &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; additives!! worth it !!!!!</li>
    <li> Best lotion my wife has ever used! She loves that it is light, not greasy, absorbs quickly, and has a nice light scent. The bottle is large and lasts at least 6 months with daily use.</li>
    <li> When the product arrived at the house it was 3/4 full and product has spilled out in the box.</li>
    <li> it would be nice if it hydrated more, but i added a little EVOO to it, a couple drops of lavendar oil and shook it up. perfect! would rather do that then buy products tested on animals.</li>
    <li> Hands down these lotions have become my favorite. They absorb quickly and smell amazing!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and love that it&#x27;s not toxic for my body.</li>
    <li> This is great lotion.  Love the brand</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  Used by both men and women in my household.  Everyone loves it.</li>
    <li> I work in healthcare and wash my hands and forearms dozens of times each shift in order to avoid cross-contamination between patients. I carry a small refillable bottle of this lotion in my pocket and apply it to my skin after each washing. It keeps my skin lubricated and soft and I have gotten many compliments from patients and co-workers alike on its lavender scent. It is relatively inexpensive, so I use it on my entire body after a shower/bath. It spreads nicely for even coverage. This lotion is so gentle that I have also started using it on my face instead of expensive creams that I used previously. My sensitive skin is loving it! I recommend this lotion for its gentleness, effectiveness, and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Got this along with the soap, and works great! Soaks in fast, smells amazing, no residue, and natural. Great deal!</li>
    <li> Wow, great smooth feeling without chemicals in it. Great for whole family. Lasts a very long time!</li>
    <li> Great lotion at a great price. The scent is fresh and not overpowering. The lotion works wonderfully. Just love this. My only gripe is that it is an add on. I wanted to send it as a gift to a friend and would have been happy to pay shipping, but I don&#x27;t think Amazon lets you do that. At least I couldn&#x27;t figure out how!</li>
    <li> Light-weight and easily absorbed.  Nice subtle scent of lavender (could stand to be stronger), and I feel good about using this product!  I go through one of these big boys every 3 months.</li>
    <li> Is it perfect? No, but it makes for a great overall lotion and you get lots of it. The ingredients are pretty darn good for what it is. &amp;#60;- For what it is...for the price, don&#x27;t even think about it. Just try it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for months and I&#x27;m thrilled to say that it is one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve used.  It soaks in fast and makes my skin feel soft and moisturized but not oily.  I have really sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts but I&#x27;ve been using it generously on my face twice a day and haven&#x27;t had a problem, and actually I think it makes my skin look great! It has become the only lotion I use at all on hands, face, and body, and it has worked wonders on my dry skin. I avoid artificial fragrances, so I was thrilled to see that this giant and affordable bottle of lotion is scented only with essential oils. I find the lavender fragrance to be on the strong side, but still pleasant, and since it is a natural fragrance it doesn&#x27;t stick around all day. Best of all, despite slathering this on day after day for six months, I still have about half a bottle left, making this the best value in &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; lotion I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
    <li> Love it! It is very moisturizing, smells great and great price! Smells like natural lavender -- wonderful!</li>
    <li> Smells great, absorbs well.</li>
    <li> Nice scent, absorbs easily.</li>
    <li> This lotion leaves a clean and refreshing feeling, providing day-long moisture, without the irritable side-effects. Always remember; the skin is an organ.</li>
    <li> At first it looks like a great value because of the amount you get but the lotion is very thin. If you have dry skin look for something else.</li>
    <li> I love the strong scent of lavender in this lotion! After applying it, my entire bedroom is smells wonderful! Pros: amazing scent, absorbs well (no greasiness), leaves my skin soft, and it&#x27;s very economical (both size and price!). I would describe it as a medium-to-light moisturizer. My one con for this product is that I wish it were a bit thicker and even more moisturizing. I have pretty dry skin, so I need something to really slather on and lock in the moisture all day, especially after showers. I usually mix this lotion 3:2 with another thicker lotion I have (but don&#x27;t like the scent), and that gives me the perfect amount of moisturizing power I need (without the nasty smell of the other product). I have already purchased this product twice and I will buy it again. I highly recommend it for anyone who loves the smell of lavender. It&#x27;s heavenly!</li>
    <li> I really like the size, price, and the smell of this. I would like the consistency to be a bit thicker. But all over good product. I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff Rocks!!! It isn&#x27;t overpowering on smell and keeps me soft all day. What more could you ask of a lotion? The Shower Gel Rocks too... But that&#x27;s another review.</li>
    <li> Lite, non-greasy, absorbs real quick. Works fine on face &amp; body. Perfect for oil skin - no break out from it.&lt;br /&gt;Good price for a big bottle with mostly happy ingredients.</li>
    <li> non greasy and perfectly scented formula will put you right to sleep. I apply it every night and the stress just goes away. Plus it has no nasty ingredients like parabens etc. really nice night time lotion!</li>
    <li> Bought this because the ingredient list looked good, natural, oils and humectants, no silicones or skin-clogging ingredients.  Texture is a little bit sticky, and the lavender/aloe smell is strong and not really pleasant to me, though that is obviously a YMMV thing.  I would try a different &#x27;variety&#x27; of this, the body washes by this company are good.  I like that it comes in a big pump bottle, the pump works well, no issues with the packaging.</li>
    <li> One of the best lotions I have ever purchased.  I purchased this lotion for my students to use in class.  They love how soft and smooth their skin feels when they use it after washing their hands.  They make me smile when I see them walking over to the sink just to use the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> I started noticing that my skin started getting extremely dry and I couldn&#x27;t quite point my finger what was causing my skin to get extremely dry, and I noticed that it was this product. I do not recommend this at all if your skin is sensitive or dry. Another thing, you can smell the chemicals it contains.</li>
    <li> It is a little strong on the fragrance but overall I love the result on my skin.  Good for dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful lotion. The first one I ordered was damaged in shipping and the pump broke in half. They immediately gave me a refund, so I ordered another. It came very quickly. I keep the lotion in my shower and use it daily. The scent is very nice and mild.</li>
    <li> love this lotion! it doesn&#x27;t have to strong of a smell and since it has lavender and aloe in it, it helps sun burn and bug bites so you don&#x27;t have to use itch cream, sun burn cream and lotion. It&#x27;s also is scented with essential oil instead of a ton of chemicals. Would definately reccomend, I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> I love this product so much!&lt;br /&gt;The lavender aroma is incredible on application, yet dissipates quickly so you don&#x27;t carry such a strong scent around all day - which I love.  When I put it on, it is such a fabulous, relaxing experience to have such a pure lavender aroma all around.&lt;br /&gt;While I have not yet used the product on my face, I love it for the body and hands.  In the warmer months, I prefer a light moisturizer that I can layer if needed and this lotion is the perfect match!  Not greasy or heavy and dries very quickly.  I also love that it contains aloe - it works wonderfully for after-sun use.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try other products in the Everyone lineup.</li>
    <li> Smells great, not heavy or greasy and the volume of lotion for the price is a great deal. I am using this for a homemade sunblock and I really appreciate that it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
    <li> Great smell, great consistency.  I love this lotion.  It&#x27;s a great buy! I recommend this for the whole family, even my husband will use it because it&#x27;s not too floral smelling.</li>
    <li> I bought it expecting it to smell like lavender and it didn&#x27;t,  Nowhere near it. No No No No No</li>
    <li> Safe lotion and it works well. My daughter has sensitive skin and can use this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m being treated with a type of Chemo, for Melanoma, that causes rash/itching.  This lotion works better than anything the Oncologist suggested.  Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> This all-around lotion is fast becoming one of my most used products in my daily beauty routine.  It&#x27;s advertised as &#x60;for everyone&#x27; and &#x60;for everybody,&#x27; and so far, it more than meets my expectations.  First, it&#x27;s gentle enough to use on my face (I have very sensitive skin, and I can&#x27;t remember the last time I was able to actually use an all-around body lotion on my face - they&#x27;re usually much too irritating for me).  Second, it&#x27;s non-greasy but extremely moisturizing;  I have very dry skin (even with the high humidity here in Hawaii), and it&#x27;s a struggle to find an affordable body lotion that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out more or need to be reapplied every few hours.  I am also very sensitive to certain odors and smells - some scents in lotions or perfumes can trigger migraines for me - but both scents that I&#x27;ve tried in this brand so far are amazing! The Lavender and Aloe is calming and soothing; the Coconut &amp; Lemon is simply delicious; neither scent is overwhelming or sickeningly sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you factor in the more-than-affordable cost per ounce and the free shipping provided with an Amazon Prime membership, this product rates 5 stars in my book.</li>
    <li> Arived on time, as described, works well.</li>
    <li> My skin never looked better,  Love that I can apply anywhere on my body.</li>
    <li> As a moisturizer, this works great for me.  Keeps my normal skin moist for 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am VERY disappointed to learn that it contains cetyl esters.  Good grief!  What&#x27;s the point in leaving out parabens and sulfates if you&#x27;re going to leave in esters?  It completely defeats the purpose as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies should stay away from this, particularly anyone who is genetically predisposed to cancer.</li>
    <li> I will purchase this item again. It&#x27;s a great full body lotion and the scent works for both male and female.</li>
    <li> Put the lotion in the basket! I was afraid this smell would make me smell like a broad. Nope. Feel like a lady and spell like a clean man. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> This lotion is now my favorite! I use it at home and I have another at work. I apply it after my daily shower.</li>
    <li> This lotion is truly fab for face, body and hands. It&#x27;s hearty enough to moisten the driest hands but doesn&#x27;t leave a film. It&#x27;s smooth enough for the whole body and gentle enough for the face. It makes you feel great, head to toe!!!</li>
    <li> This product goes on smoothly.  It is not sticky.  It can be used as a face or body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Betty Larsen</li>
    <li> Great lotion! Smooth, creamy, blends in well. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Very good lotion. A nice price and good bottle size, too.</li>
    <li> Best Lotion! It goes on your skin really smooth and dries very fast. I use daily. The smell is also very nice</li>
    <li> i love this lotion. it smalls great and does the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion,the smell of lavender is not overpowering.It just smells very fresh and clean.It&#x27;s not greasy which is my main gripe with most lotions.Also these big bottles last forever,and my whole family uses it, even my 7 month old.I think it is a really good value at this price.</li>
    <li> Really like this lotion, has heavy fragrance of lavender, calming. Its a large bottle definitely get your moneys worth</li>
    <li> All day moisturizing with a non-overpowering scent that relaxes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for over a year now. It works very well and for a good price.</li>
    <li> Celiac Disease prompted me to change from Aveeno to Everyone Lotion, which is thankfully labeled &#x27;Gluten Free.&#x27; I first bought the coconut &amp; lemon, which I quite liked. Then I bought the lavender &amp; aloe, and even though I like lavender in general it was just way too strong for me. I am still using it since it&#x27;s too late to return it, but I really wish they had dialed back the amount of fragrance by about 75%. It probably would have smelled really nice at that concentration. Anyway, it does moisturize well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy at all. I am really glad to have found Everyone Lotion, but my future purchases will definitely be coconut &amp; lemon.</li>
    <li> Nice smell. Everyone in the family loves it!</li>
