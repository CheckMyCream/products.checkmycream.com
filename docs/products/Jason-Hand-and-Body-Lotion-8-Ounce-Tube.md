      <li>am giving it 3 stars purely based on the ingredients, because although calling it &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; seems misleading to me, it still has  better ingredients than most hand and body lotions.</li>

      <li>i also use this as an after tanning lotion and it is fantastic at prolonging my tan and moisturizing my skin...</li>
      <li>i absolutely looooove this lotion!!!</li>
      <li>And then you are very pleasantly surprised because it&#x27;s actually clean AND smells good?  </li>
      <li>i have used sooooo many types and this is the best and it absorbs fast.. and the smell is a slight hint of coco butter (not coconut)...</li>
      <li>I have used and loved this product for years, and apparently they have changed the formula.</li>
      <li>A light sweet scent.  </li>
      <li>Whether for Hair or Body when they promise moisture its true moisture without the residue.</li>
      <li>It did go on smooth, but there was nothing about the product&#x27;s texture or result that is worth dealing with the smell.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite alongside Jason Aloe lotion &amp; gel.</li>
      <li>the JASON website, the full list of ingredients is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I liked it but personally think the fragrance is strong.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
      <li>They should take the word natural right off this product and throw any old junk in it instead of getting our hopes up that a truly remarkable lotion is available.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;Benzyl benzoate has low acute toxicity in laboratory animals.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;Benzyl benzoate has low acute toxicity in laboratory animals.</li>
      <li>Great lotion, no overwhelming smell.</li>
      <li>and it is their only brand that has salicylic acid in it plus aloe and all the other wonderful high quality herbal ingredients that sooth skin.</li>
      <li>I took a chance and ordered this without testing out how it feels or smells and trusted all the positive amazon reviews.</li>
      <li>I like a nice clean outdoor bathroom, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I want to smell like one.</li>
      <li>However Honey House and Happy Hands both make REALLY pure and natural lotions and you can also buy the pure Shea Butter, Cacao Butter, Almond Oil etc.  in bulk and mix up a lotion that is really pure and natural for 8x less.ng as well as testicular atrophy and interference with reproductivity in mice for other Glycol Ethers, although Phenoxyethanol is not mentioned in the abstract.[11]&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
      <li>Since these chemicals are often present in cosmetics and lotions applied to the hands and are easily ingested, caution should be exercised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice vanilla-y smell that isn&#x27;t too sickly sweet, thick without being pasty.</li>
      <li>When given in large doses to laboratory animals, benzyl benzoate can cause hyperexcitation, incoordination, ataxia, convulsions, and respiratory paralysis.[4]&lt;br</li>

      <li>Its so thick that when I can&#x27;t squeeze any more out, I cut the bottle in half and am able to get 4 or 5 more uses..</li>
      <li>It absolutely DOES NOT smell like cocoa butter.  </li>
      <li>What I like about this lotion is that it absorbs fast but is still moisturizing</li>
      <li>Absorbs fast.</li>
      <li>Yes, it really works.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>the whole point of moisturizing lotion- and enters my blood stream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and you get that really apprehensive feeling about what you are going to find?  </li>
      <li>The very skin rash</li>
      <li>Obviously to make the product look more natural than it</li>
      <li>Love the buttery slightly sweet smell of this, though the smell doesn&#x27;t last long on your skin so as to conflict with perfume.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a new to the Jason line</li>
      <li>its sooo hard to find a good lotion that will not only moisturize..</li>
      <li>I used it all through winter for super dry skin.</li>
      <li>This lotion is full of wonderful ingredients and leaves out parabens, then, they ruin the lotion with one of the worst preservatives: potassium sorbate.</li>
      <li>This lotion is light with a faint cocoa vanilla scent, gets the job done when you need a light, non greasy, moisture boost.</li>
      <li>but make you sooo soft your skin feels like silk...</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am careful about what I put on my skin because some of it gets absorbed-</li>
      <li>I usually like Jason, should have gotten the aloe I usually get or the rose, this stuff if smells ratchet</li>

<li> No matter how nice the lotion is, if it smells bad, it can&#x27;t be used.</li>

<li> The cocoa butter smell is very artificial and overwhelming.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s thick so a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I usually use the Alba botanica brand and it is less fragrant.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not too thick nor watery, not too oily and moisturizing..</li>
<li> I put it on and it immediately reminded me of something...something not good.  </li>
<li> If you tend to shy away from artificial fragrances or additives</li>
<li> So disappointed.</li>
<li> Truly disappointing!</li>
<li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
<li> It moisturizes well, but the smell is horrible!  </li>

It&#x27;s not too thick nor watery, not too oily and moisturizing..and I always get compliments on how good it smells! Will definitely order this regularly!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best. Nice vanilla-y smell that isn&#x27;t too sickly sweet, thick without being pasty.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, no overwhelming smell.</li>
    <li> Adore the coca scent-husband compliments it frequently-and the cream itself has a very good creaminess to it but absorbs well</li>
    <li> This lotion is very good. I am very pleased with this lotion. What I like about this lotion is that it absorbs fast but is still moisturizing, Amazon is the only place I have found this specific type of lotion and it is their only brand that has salicylic acid in it plus aloe and all the other wonderful high quality herbal ingredients that sooth skin.</li>
    <li> It is much thinner than I was hoping for, but it smells great!</li>
    <li> Yes, it really works.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed.  I have used and loved this product for years, and apparently they have changed the formula. It is much runnier than previously, and as far as I can see, does my skin no good whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Love the JASON products. Whether for Hair or Body when they promise moisture its true moisture without the residue. Love the buttery slightly sweet smell of this, though the smell doesn&#x27;t last long on your skin so as to conflict with perfume. I used it all through winter for super dry skin.</li>
    <li> I liked it but personally think the fragrance is strong. I usually use the Alba botanica brand and it is less fragrant.</li>
    <li> My favorite hand cream. Love how it moisturizers and the smell is pleasent. Very happy to be able to have it delivered and its cheaper than the health food store which I have to travel to. Happy, happy!</li>
    <li> The cocoa butter smell is very artificial and overwhelming. I used this product after a bedtime bath and the smell lingered until i bathed again the next night. If you tend to shy away from artificial fragrances or additives i&#x27; skip this one. It did go on smooth, but there was nothing about the product&#x27;s texture or result that is worth dealing with the smell.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite alongside Jason Aloe lotion &amp; gel. It sells itself! Many of my friends use it now.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s thick so a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s organic. It doesnt have a strong smell. It absorbs quickly into my skin. Its so thick that when I can&#x27;t squeeze any more out, I cut the bottle in half and am able to get 4 or 5 more uses..im fruggle that way.</li>
    <li> Picked this up on a whim.  I love it.  Absorbs fast. I like the smell. **It works!!!** A light sweet scent.  Wonderful smoothing effect that lasts.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new to the Jason line but I love the body wash so wasn&#x27;t at all hesitant to try the lotion. The Shea butter and cocoa moisturizer well and smells well</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on and absorbs really nice.  It smells like cocoa or chocolate with a hint of almond.  I think its a great luxery and love it.</li>
    <li> This lotion is full of wonderful ingredients and leaves out parabens, then, they ruin the lotion with one of the worst preservatives: potassium sorbate. The very skin rash I purchased this product to cure is caused by this preservative and it&#x27;s cousin poly sorbate. Why would a company that touts how natural its products are destroy these wonderful ingredients by including such a terrible preservative? They should take the word natural right off this product and throw any old junk in it instead of getting our hopes up that a truly remarkable lotion is available. Truly disappointing!</li>
    <li> It moisturizes well, but the smell is horrible!  It absolutely DOES NOT smell like cocoa butter.  I put it on and it immediately reminded me of something...something not good.  It took me a bit, but then I figured out what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, you know when you are about to enter a porta-potty and you get that really apprehensive feeling about what you are going to find?  And then you are very pleasantly surprised because it&#x27;s actually clean AND smells good?  Well, good for a porta-potty?  Yeah, it smells like that.  I like a nice clean outdoor bathroom, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I want to smell like one.</li>
    <li> For the cocoa butter lotion:  it smells gross! Totally yucky. I should have paid closer attention to the reviews. No matter how nice the lotion is, if it smells bad, it can&#x27;t be used.</li>
    <li> i absolutely looooove this lotion!!! its sooo hard to find a good lotion that will not only moisturize..but make you sooo soft your skin feels like silk... i also use this as an after tanning lotion and it is fantastic at prolonging my tan and moisturizing my skin... i have used sooooo many types and this is the best and it absorbs fast.. and the smell is a slight hint of coco butter (not coconut)... my husband says i smell like heaven :)  i literally stock up on this lotion.. its really amazing..</li>
    <li> It smells like urine. So disappointed. I usually like Jason, should have gotten the aloe I usually get or the rose, this stuff if smells ratchet</li>
    <li> This lotion is light with a faint cocoa vanilla scent, gets the job done when you need a light, non greasy, moisture boost.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the smell of it at all.  Smelled kind of like coconut and the smell didn&#x27;t dissipate after having it on awhile.</li>
