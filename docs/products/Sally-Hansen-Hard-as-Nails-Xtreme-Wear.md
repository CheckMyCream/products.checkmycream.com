      <li>So happy I found this one and snagged it!!</li>
      <li>amazing!!</li>
      <li>really great coverage--fully opaque with two coats.  </li>
      <li>Sally Hansen has on of the best quality polishes for sure.</li>
      <li>It flows nicely, and is beautiful, but be very sure to shake it well before application.</li>
      <li>Sally Hansen ORIGINAL FORMULA Pacific Bkue is THE BEST!!!!</li>
      <li>Beautiful color, goes in so smoothly!</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments whenever I wear it!</li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>This gets my nail-polish-snob approval for sure!</li>
      <li>Amazing color for summer.</li>
      <li>This is the ORIGINAL formulation which is gorgeous and opaque in one coat.  </li>
      <li>I had to buy it, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this color</li>
      <li>You wont be able to stop looking at your hands or toes.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
      <li>The original was a beautiful bright and creamy cobalt blue.</li>
      <li>I want a full refund!</li>
      <li>I first saw this color on a beauty guru&#x27;s blog on youtube; it looked amazing on camera</li>
      <li>The formula is deliciously creamy, but it definitely requires two coats, since the first coat is a bit streaky.</li>
      <li>This is NOT the original formula.</li>
      <li>No the original formula</li>
      <li>Long wearing and great color payoff, although you still need to use a top coat when using this polish, its still great and takes at least 3 days before i see any wear/chips on it.</li>
      <li>What I love is that only one coat is needed for this nail polish :)</li>
      <li>It is very pretty, but not what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>This is by far the most gorgeous shade of blue I have ever used</li>
      <li>The original Pacific Blue was beautiful shade of blue and much more unique looking than the new one.</li>
      <li>Not sure why the picture looks like it&#x27;s light blue when in reality this is a gorgeous, most beautiful shade of periwinkle blue!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty!</li>
      <li>Dries pretty quick.</li>
      <li>It is so pretty.</li>
      <li>This is the real deal folks!  </li>
      <li>did my nails this afternoon for the first time with this color, and got three compliments before the evening.  </li>
      <li>this is seriously one of the best blue nail polishes you can find.</li>
      <li>and the new version is a completely different color and texture (more of a jelly instead of a creme color).  </li>
      <li>It is indeed a fantastic shade of blue, almost periwinkle.</li>
      <li>One of my absolute favorites.</li>
      <li>Please Sally Hansen bring back the ORIGINAL formula.</li>
      <li>It dries a bit darker than when applying; It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite polishes- I&#x27;ve received compliments every single time I wear it--crazy right....</li>
      <li>I previously owned Sally Hansen&#x27;s Pacific Blue and loved it so much, I decided to get a new bottle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn hundreds of different colors of nail polish, but this is definitely my all-time favorite.</li>
      <li>Pictures do not reflect true color, which is different, a much darker, medium blue.</li>
      <li>And at $2.99, I&#x27;m tempted to go straight back to the store and buy a second bottle for when the first one runs out.</li>
      <li>I have the real version of this polish and bottle was low and can&#x27;t find in stores anymore, this stuff is not it</li>
      <li>On the nails, it&#x27;s a very glossy hue somewhere between violet and ultramarine blue.</li>
      <li>Not the old version as the photo would indicate.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve had it on my nails for 4 days and so far no chipping.</li>
      <li>They really need to go back to this color and formula, and stop calling what they sell now Pacific Blue...</li>
      <li>Bring the old one back!!</li>

<li> Imagine my disappointment when I opened my package to see they changed the original color!!</li>
<li> This blue nail polish is NOT the same one pictured nor the formula, logo and color are not accurate.</li>
<li> So I had to break down and get it through Amazon.</li>
<li> Sally Hansen changed the formula of this color (along with a few others)</li>
<li> This one is shimmery and just plain ugly.</li>
<li> I tried it out for myself, skeptical of the raving reviews.</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s overpriced and FAKE</li>
<li> So disappointed.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m so disappointed!!!!!!!!!</li>

    <li> Pictures do not reflect true color, which is different, a much darker, medium blue. So disappointed. I posted a pic of actual bottle next to my screen.</li>
    <li> This blue nail polish is NOT the same one pictured nor the formula, logo and color are not accurate. I want a full refund!</li>
    <li> everyone on youtube talks about this color.  I couldn&#x27;t find it locally, so I bought it here instead. It&#x27;s pretty!</li>
    <li> this is seriously one of the best blue nail polishes you can find. it is like a neon periwinkle. did my nails this afternoon for the first time with this color, and got three compliments before the evening.  amazing!! really great coverage--fully opaque with two coats.  love it!</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen ORIGINAL FORMULA Pacific Bkue is THE BEST!!!! They really need to go back to this color and formula, and stop calling what they sell now Pacific Blue... Because it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> I have the real version of this polish and bottle was low and can&#x27;t find in stores anymore, this stuff is not it, it&#x27;s overpriced and FAKE</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, goes in so smoothly! Sally Hansen has on of the best quality polishes for sure. Dries pretty quick. What I love is that only one coat is needed for this nail polish :)</li>

    <li> This nail polish has to be seen to be believed. I tried it out for myself, skeptical of the raving reviews. It is indeed a fantastic shade of blue, almost periwinkle. The formula is deliciously creamy, but it definitely requires two coats, since the first coat is a bit streaky. It flows nicely, and is beautiful, but be very sure to shake it well before application. This gets my nail-polish-snob approval for sure!</li>
    <li> This is by far the most gorgeous shade of blue I have ever used and I&#x27;ve had a lot of different colors on my nails. The image doesn&#x27;t do it justice. Two coats will do the trick and I&#x27;ve had it on my nails for 4 days and so far no chipping.</li>
    <li> YES YES YES YES YES !! I love this color, it&#x27;s beautiful&amp; my fave!! This is my go to nail polish</li>
    <li> This is the real deal folks!  Sally Hansen changed the formula of this color (along with a few others) a while back and the new version is a completely different color and texture (more of a jelly instead of a creme color).  This is the ORIGINAL formulation which is gorgeous and opaque in one coat.  So happy I found this one and snagged it!!</li>
    <li> BEWARE: This is NOT the original formula. Sally Hansen reformulated the product. The original was a beautiful bright and creamy cobalt blue. This one is shimmery and just plain ugly. Please Sally Hansen bring back the ORIGINAL formula.</li>
    <li> Not the old version as the photo would indicate. Misleading.</li>
    <li> I first saw this color on a beauty guru&#x27;s blog on youtube; it looked amazing on camera and I absolutely LOVE it. It dries a bit darker than when applying; It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite polishes- I&#x27;ve received compliments every single time I wear it--crazy right....</li>
    <li> I saw this color at Walgreens today and I couldn&#x27;t take my eyes off of it. I had to buy it, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. On the nails, it&#x27;s a very glossy hue somewhere between violet and ultramarine blue. I&#x27;ve worn hundreds of different colors of nail polish, but this is definitely my all-time favorite. And at $2.99, I&#x27;m tempted to go straight back to the store and buy a second bottle for when the first one runs out. If you like painting your nails, this is a must have!</li>
    <li> No the original formula and I&#x27;m so disappointed!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It is so pretty. Wait till you put it on. You wont be able to stop looking at your hands or toes. I had been looking for this all summer and couldnt find it anywhere. So I had to break down and get it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Not sure why the picture looks like it&#x27;s light blue when in reality this is a gorgeous, most beautiful shade of periwinkle blue! I get so many compliments whenever I wear it! One of my absolute favorites.</li>
    <li> I got this thinking it would be a holy-grail color. It is very pretty, but not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Long wearing and great color payoff, although you still need to use a top coat when using this polish, its still great and takes at least 3 days before i see any wear/chips on it.</li>
