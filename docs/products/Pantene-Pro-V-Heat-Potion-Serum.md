      <li>The results are good, if not amazing; leaves hair with a smooth healthy finish.  </li>
      <li>I like the texture and appearance of my hair fairly well, but like to use a product like this Heat Potion Serum one to protect my hair when I blow dry it.  </li>
      <li>I have also used a dab on dry hair to combat the frizzies with good results.</li>
      <li>I virtually can&#x27;t tell the difference between this serum and the previous two I&#x27;ve used, which is amazing since this one is much more affordable.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a very lightweight product that tames my fine hair without adding weight or making it greasy.</li>
      <li>, I used a fine tooth comb to comb the product through and get it really coating each strand.  </li>
      <li>does a little happy dance*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw</li>
      <li>But for the price, I think it is worth a try if you are looking for a heat shield product.</li>
      <li>and I thought this would be worth a try.</li>
      <li>I apply it just before blow drying or flat ironing and  have received amazing results</li>

      <li>It wasn&#x27;t right for my type of hair.</li>
      <li>There are so many new \\&quot;leave in\\&quot; hair products on the market these days and this Pantene Heat Shield Serum is definitely one of the better ones I have tried.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the texture and appearance of my hair fairly well, but like to use a product like this Heat Potion Serum one to protect my hair when I blow dry it.  The instructions say to use 2-4 pumps of this product and to then style the hair as normal, when applying this product to wet hair.  I had to pump it several times to get product out the first time and ended up using three pumps.  I used it with my mousse (Redken Guts 10), which resulted in a weird build-up of product.  It looked super greasy and I had to wash my hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time, I used the Pantene Heat Potion Serum alone and restricted it to one pump.  The serum did it&#x27;s job - my hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy and it was shiny.  However, my hair didn&#x27;t have it&#x27;s usual body.  A friend told me that it looked nice, but I just felt like it was super limp.  I think I&#x27;ll stick to my old heat protecting standby, [[ASIN:B00068A0A6 Sexy Hair Power Straightening Balm for Unisex, 3.4 Ounce]].</li>
    <li> The bottle is rather small for me, someone with very long hair.  You have to squirt it into your hands, then put it on your wet hair.  It takes me a few squirts to make sure I&#x27;ve got most of my hair covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice.  It has the nice fresh Pantene fragrance.  It&#x27;s a mixture of oils- it feels a bit like smoothing serum going on, but it is a mix of oils that help protect your hair from heat damage.  It didn&#x27;t interfere negatively with my curling or drying my hair- the appliances worked about the same as always, but it did leave my hair feeling more moisturized and looking smoother than when I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just seems a bit high for the amount you get to me.  Folks with short hair probably won&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> Overall, I like this product.  Like most Pantene products it has a vaguely pleasant perfumed smell.  The results are good, if not amazing; leaves hair with a smooth healthy finish.  The texture of the product is a bit on the tacky side.</li>
    <li> Great product. I put this on my hair before I use a flat iron. Good protection for the hair, and it makes my hair easier to comb through.</li>
    <li> Works well and does not weigh down my hair.</li>
    <li> There is really no need to spend a lot of money on silicone smoothers when you get the same results with an inexpensive brand like this one.  If you want to increase the conditioning, put a dab of argan oil in your palm along with this \\&quot;heat-shield\\&quot;, rub your hands together to distribute &amp; then gently smooth through your wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally don&#x27;t like to use a lot of hair products with silicone because I find they build up &amp; dry out my hair if used too frequently. If you do like the effect of silicone products on your hair, it is a good idea to use a shampoo with \\&quot;sulfate\\&quot; ingredients such as \\&quot;sodium lauryl sulfate\\&quot; to remove the buildup. Dimethicone is an especially non-soluble (won&#x27;t wash out with water) silicone &amp; may even take more than one wash to remove. Sulfate shampoos can be more harsh on hair so if you are prone to damaged/dry hair, you may want to avoid those shampoos or use them occasionally to remove buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a short ingredient list:  Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Fragrance/Parfum, Panthenol, Ceteareth-20, Alcohol Denat.  The fragrance is not heavy &amp; has that typical Pantene smell; to me the perfume is not good or bad &amp; it doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cyclopentasioxane: This is silicone in liquid form. Evaporates so doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair or leave a \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feel.&lt;br /&gt;-Dimethicone: A silicone-based polymer that provides smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;-Panthenol: Derivative of vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) and is known as a provitamin.  It is very humectant so provides moisture retention.&lt;br /&gt;-Ceteareth-20:  Fatty alcohol that is used as an emulsifier (keeps ingredients mixed together).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works almost as well as the \\&quot;Paul Frieda Frizz-Ease Sheer Solution\\&quot; but not quite as good.  The Pantene is a few dollars cheaper so if it works better for you - you can save some money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve head several of my friends test out this product and we all agreed that it lived up to the Pantene Pro-V standards.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it&#x27;s easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad like other heat protection products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely use the amount recommended on the label, don&#x27;t skimp, and make sure to get it through all your hair with a brush or comb. Give it a minute or two to set in, then go ahead with your usual routine. I normally use a flat iron on my hair, and I noticed that with this serum I end up with less frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside with this bottle is that if you have a tendency to heat style every single day you&#x27;ll end up running out of product fast, so keep that in mind when purchasing.</li>
    <li> I have just enough awkward wave in my hair that I need to blow dry and/or straighten it every day. Those heating elements damage hair fast, so this is a great product for me to us. It smells good and makes my hair feel smoother after applying it. You are supposed to put a few squirts in your hand, rub it around and then apply it to your wet hair - this process leaves my hands feeling greasy and I have to wash them well to get rid of it. But for the price, I think it is worth a try if you are looking for a heat shield product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use a flat-iron but I love Pantene products and I thought this would be worth a try. I do have a hair-dryer that I call \\&quot;the flame-thrower\\&quot;. It drys my hair almost instantly but it&#x27;s hot enough to fry my brains. I use about four pumps of the Pantene serum  massaged through my  towel dried hair. It leaves my hair very soft and shiny. Call me \\&quot;surprised\\&quot;.  Only 1.7 ounce bottle but a little goes a long way. Of course all hair won&#x27;t have identical results but it works for me.</li>
    <li> I will admit that between my blow dryer, flat iron, and curling iron my naturally dry hair gets put through a lot.  I typically rely on hair products meant for heat styling to keep my hair looking soft, shiny and healthy, even with my frequent abuse.  Hair serums have been typically part of my routine.  In the past I&#x27;ve used [[ASIN:B000VNIZGM Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum Unisex, 8.5 Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B005OW7UCK It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Style Serum - 4 Oz]].  I was skeptical about how this product would compare because I don&#x27;t tend to like how Pantene products work with my hair.  But this serum blew me away!  I virtually can&#x27;t tell the difference between this serum and the previous two I&#x27;ve used, which is amazing since this one is much more affordable.  For me that is saying a lot because I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding affordable drug store hair products that work as well as the ones I find at the salon.  Like the other serums, this minimizes damage to my hair and leaves my hair looking and feeling shiny and healthy.  I also only need 3-4 drops, even with very thick hair that a few inches below my shoulders so this bottle lasts me quite awhile.  Generally I am quite doubtful that drugstore products can give salon quality but at least for this product, I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
    <li> I was wary of this at first because I&#x27;ve tried similar heat treatment products in the past but found them too heavy for my hair. My hair is fine and always looked and felt greasy/dirty after using these kinds of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised that it was not the case this time. I use a couple of drops (they come out very sparingly) after towel drying and before turning on my hairdryer. I actually use both a hair dryer and a curling iron (my hair is between chin and shoulder length). The result is that my hair does look smoother and feels softer, with less flyaway. (I sometimes forget to use it and can always notice the difference.) It&#x27;s a serum so it does leave a greasy feeling on your hands, but it&#x27;s not too bad and somehow goes away. The smell is also pleasant and not overly strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a miracle product but I am not expecting any product to transform my hair into what I see on shampoo commercials. I&#x27;m pleased that it does make a difference when I use it. Whether or not it actually restores health to my hair over time I cannot yet say.</li>
    <li> I have always used serum-type products on my hair because I blow dry my hair daily, sometimes twice a day.  I am worried about my hair splitting and drying out with excessive heat and have tried all sorts of serums.  Pantene&#x27;s product is a lot lighter than what I am used to, which is probably good because I often use too much serum, making my hair weighted down and greasy.  Pantene&#x27;s heat potion serum is very light and I love the say it smells.  I rub just a small amount in at the ends of my hair after I have squeezed out excessive water;  I then blow dry it.  I  haven&#x27;t had any problems with it and it&#x27;s one of my regular daily hair routines after I wash my hair.  I will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have short, fine, thin hair. My granddaughter has long hair that is extremely thick and unbelievably curly. We have a hard time getting a brush through her hair and it&#x27;s hard to style. I tried Pantene Pro-V Heat Shield Heat Potion Serum on my own hair and it left it feeling flat, although it did feel soft and healthy. It wasn&#x27;t right for my type of hair. I tried it on my granddaughter&#x27;s hair and it worked wonders on it! We used 6 squirts instead of the 4 that the bottle recommends, because she has so much hair. We were able to disperse it throughout her wet hair and it was just enough for it. Her hair was much easier to comb out, then we styled it with a hair dryer and flat iron. We were shocked by how good her hair looked and how manageable it was! We were especially surprised because this is not an expensive product. She&#x27;s a very happy little girl right now and is proud of how beautiful her hair looks. We&#x27;re going to buy the coordinating heat shield shampoo and conditioner next.</li>
    <li> My hair is more on the fine side but still frizzes up -didn&#x27;t use to be this way.  I have other products that have helped a bit but wanted to give this one a try.  It worked out ok but left my hair more flat than bouncy.  It smells really good but it was too much silicone for my hair.  It gave me some shine but unless I want to use an iron, it won&#x27;t work with my natural waves.  I used very little, barely a drop so maybe that&#x27;s as much as I can use.  Better for people with thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I really thought the spray worked well and was impressed with the price when compared to other sprays.  A strong, solid thumbs up!</li>
    <li> The bottle is small but it works fine 😊</li>
    <li> This is a very good heat protecting serum. I love the fact that it is very light weight and non greasy. A little goes a long way. I apply it just before blow drying or flat ironing and  have received amazing results and it also helps to tame frizz. One of my staple products now!</li>
    <li> Blow drying, curling &amp; straightening can all damage your hair, making it fuzzy and hard to control.  A few drops of [[ASIN:B00CP0R5LK Pantene Pro-V Heat Shield Heat Potion Serum]] might just be the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is baby fine and so long I can sit on it, but impossible to control and sometimes prone to frizz, particularly at this time of the year.  I&#x27;ve been using a few drops of this after shampooing while my hair is still wet with good results. My hair has been shinier and far more willing to stay put in its braid than it usually is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - Pantene is a reliable brand.  With a very reasonable price point, [[ASIN:B00CP0R5LK Pantene Pro-V Heat Shield Heat Potion Serum]] is worth trying if you need to tame your unruly mane!  To avoid the \\&quot;oilies\\&quot; remember that less is more.</li>
    <li> Works really well on my hair and I got thick natural curly hair. It leaves my hair smooth. I would definitely repurchase this.</li>
    <li> This product is great--I just smooth a little bit of it into my hair, either damp or dry, and then curling and straightening is no problem. This serum leaves my hair feeling smooth and soft and definitely not oily.</li>
    <li> This is another successful product from Pantene. Designed to condition and  protect hair from heat, the clear pleasant smelling liquid is dispensed into the hands then applied to wet hair. It left my hair feeling and looking sooth, soft and shiny. I have also used a dab on dry hair to combat the frizzies with good results. I have fine color treated hair and generally less is more. Too much leaves my hair flat and oily looking. Regular use mandates an occasional clarifying shampoo because it does tend to build up. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the coated feel of my hands. Granted that is remedied with a thorough washing and certainly is not a deal breaker. This product is most effective for those with thick, coarse or curly hair but it works well if used sparingly on finer locks. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair - it is currently halfway down my back - and it is slightly oily. My hair doesn&#x27;t style very well if I don&#x27;t wash and blow dry it every morning. Of course, even given its oily nature, I worry about heat damage. I condition every day, but I also use a product to protect against heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, my favorite product for this protection has been [[ASIN:B000RHDN00 Citre Shine Miracle Anti-frizz Serum, 4-Ounce (Pack of 2)]]. I like the consistency, I like the dispenser on the bottle, and I like how it works in my hair. I recently replaced the Citre Shine Serum with Pantene Pro-V Heat Shield Heat Potion Serum to see how it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about the Pantene Serum is that I really don&#x27;t like the dispenser. Where the Citre Shine comes in a bottle you simply tilt and squeeze until you get the amount you need, Pantene&#x27;s bottle has a pump. My hair needs 4-5 pumps and I have to say that I found it clumsy to operate the pump one-handed while dispensing into the palm of my other hand. This alone is enough of a reason for me to not buy this product in the future. I&#x27;m not a morning person, so to add even a minor irritant or delay such as this to my morning routine is not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once dispensed, I do like the serum itself. It is light, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair style, and it helps tame frizzies, even on rainy days. As far as heat damage goes, so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pantene Serum works no better and no worse than my old favorite, Citre Shine. Since I prefer the dispenser on the Citre Shine product, I will continue to use that. Should Pantene change the dispenser on their serum, I may give it another try.</li>
    <li> I have used several heat protective serums over the years. I have very long hair and protection is key. I live in a very dry environment and my hair easily get dry and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pantene Pro-V Heat shield serum did not work well for me. My hair is thick but fine. By the time I applies enough serum to manage the frizz my hair was a little sticky. This made it tangle more easily. I tried using a lot less but then I got no results at all. Additionally, after I flat ironed my hair it was really staticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell good. and it spreads nicely. It just may not be great for fine hair.</li>
    <li> I am always trying new hair products, but I was disappointed in Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V Serum.  I was careful to use just a tiny amount, but it made my hair flat and with no body.  It also felt greasy, which I hate. I don&#x27;t use a lot of any hair product and I was cautious with this one.  I had to wash my hair again that night.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other hair products with a flat iron that worked great, but this one failed.  It may work on someone with hair that is more coarse than mine.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and feeling amazing, reduces frizz. I love it.</li>
    <li> I try to take good care of my hair, so I use heat sparingly.  When I do, I use a heat shield liquid like Pantene Pro-V Heat Shield.  Unlike some other heat shields I&#x27;ve used, this one doesn&#x27;t spray in a mist.  We&#x27;re supposed to pump it into our hands and then apply to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does weigh down the hair more than other heat shields, but it also give it more sheen and I feel it protects better - maybe because I get more coverage when I slather it on with my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I don&#x27;t like is how my hands look when I&#x27;m done.  It makes me want to keep wiping my hands on my hair, or wash them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I like how my hair looks when I&#x27;m done styling.  It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Pantene Pro-V Heat Shield Heat Potion Serum 50 Ml, 1.7-Ounce&lt;br /&gt;Category: Hair Care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair fine is waist length and super thick -- I use a hair dryer (on high heat setting) and a couple of different curling irons, also on high heat, daily. Always looking for new products that will protect My valuable asset from heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  450 Heat Degree F Protection&lt;br /&gt;  Protect: Helps shield from heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;  Repair: Instantly transforms heat damages hair into soft, silky manageable hair.&lt;br /&gt;  Finish: Leaves hair smooth, sleek, and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;  With weightless heat activated oils for guilt-free styling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I&#x27;ll try it! *into My Shopping Cart it goes*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes after using Pantene Pro-V Heat Shield Heat Potion Serum, a couple of times:&lt;br /&gt;After the usual shampooing and conditioning, toweled dried and then combed through damp hair with wide toothed comb (cuz that&#x27;s the way I roll :) ).  Directions on Pantene Pro-V Heat Shield Heat Potion Serum - pump bottle - are pretty straight forward, just dispense 2-4 squirts of product into palm, rub hands together, massage through damp hair. No tacky or greasy feeling, or funky residue left on My hair.  A light, hair-product-like scent that quickly disappeared. Easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*gets out blow dryer and blow dries hair, using round brush, as usual*  Hair dried fast. Absolutely, No weighted down look. Hair is super soft, light weight, but not shiny -- at this point. Also, it appears that the usual brassiness, of my blonde hair, has been toned down, quite a bit. Using the curling irons really brought out the shine. If You use heat rollers (which I don&#x27;t) the shine will probably be there, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair is extraordinarily Beautiful. *does a little happy dance*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw, the pump action container dispenses a very small amount, at a time, so the 1.7-Ounce container of product should last quite a while.  I used, a mere, 3 squirts of product, and that was enough for my long hair. The container is also small enough for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the Pantene Pro-V Heat Shield Heat Potion Serum sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Off to buy a few more bottles, as I don&#x27;t want to ever run out! Highly Recommended! --Katharena Eiermann, 2013hair.

    <li> I love using this on my hair.  This Pantene serum makes my hair feel so soft and silky.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all or limp.  It&#x27;s still bouncy but with a lot of shine.  This really tames my frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice and light and very easy to smell in the morning.  I can be sensitive to strong smells (they can make me gag) but I had no problems with this one.  And my hair smells really fresh and clean all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on dry hair to smooth out my look and that also works great.  On dry hair, it adds shine and manageability without weighing my hair down, and my hair looks and smells newly washed and styled.</li>
    <li> If your hair tends to frizz and you use hot tools on your hair this is a good product to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY?&lt;br /&gt;*Frizzy hair tends to lack shine, this serum provides it.&lt;br /&gt;*You use hot tools to smooth your hair and need a heat protector, that&#x27;s provided too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a 2 in 1 product AND one less step in haircare.</li>
    <li> My wife has very kinky brown hair-and I say this as she is reading this as I type it-LOL-so she is always ready to try any new products that will keep her hair manageable. She liked the scent and she said it held her hair pretty well but did not last a very long time-that being she noticed her hair slipping 3 hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said that she would use in the future if the price was right.</li>
    <li> I have lots of hair but the texture is fine and years of aging, bleaching it and blowing it dry have made it much dryer and \\&quot;flyaway\\&quot; than it used to be.  This product does make my hair more manageable without leaving a greasy or heavy feeling which I really appreciate.  The price is low for something of such high quality and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to make a smoothing difference.  There are so many new \\&quot;leave in\\&quot; hair products on the market these days and this Pantene Heat Shield Serum is definitely one of the better ones I have tried.</li>
    <li> I was using very pricely items out of the salon because I have really dry hair and it damages easy. Not to mention I have many blonde highlights&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled over this product in walgreens because I didnt have the $20&lt;br /&gt;At that moment to buy what I normally used so I bought this for 7$ and I was so impressed that ive stopped using the salon products for heat shield. Absolutely love this stuff and would highly reccommend it .Really&lt;br /&gt;Amazing for the price :)  thanks pantene pro v</li>
    <li> Works great. Doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy and nasty. Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have very fine thin hair.  Most products just weigh down my hair.  -- not this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was smooth and hung down straight (little frizz) with just a blow dry.  It felt good to the touch and by end of day hair still looked good (did not look greasy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very lightweight product that tames my fine hair without adding weight or making it greasy.</li>
    <li> I have been using silicone based hair serums for many years. I love them.  I have tried many different brands over the years. They all seem to do basically the same thing. They are great for frizzy hair. They help hold in the style when I flat-iron my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main differences I have noticed with the different brands over the years are the consistency, the scent and the price. I find this one to be a touch on the thin side. The scent is subtle and nice. The price is a bit on the high side for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does the job, but nothing about it makes it stand out from the pack.</li>
    <li> This is so oily !! Hate it!</li>
    <li> Full disclosure:  I have long, fine, thin hair.  On it&#x27;s own, it hangs straight and limp but with fuzzy ends, as it is colored.  My ends are now 7-8 years old, and even with regular trims they still tend to &#x27;poof&#x27; up a bit after blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;I regularly use salon shampoo and conditioner, but am a bit more experimental with my styling products.  (It irks me to pay $25 for hairspray.  I like to see what works from the drugstore.)&lt;br /&gt;I have used Biosilk serum on my ends to tame them and also John Frieda Frizz-Ease.  I have also used a TIGI product, I think was S-Factor?  I can&#x27;t recall.  All of these felt nice going on but DID NOT do what I wanted, which was to make my ends lay flat, glossy and swingy.  However, for $7 I now have the ends of my dreams.&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you how I used this product.  My hair is long, down to about mid-back.  Like I said it&#x27;s fine - so it tends to go limp with the addition of styling products.  While my hair was wet, I used a wide tooth comb to get out the snarls.  I used 2 pumps of this serum, emulsified it between my palms, and then smoothed in on my combed, wet hair from just slightly above mid-length to the ends.  I smoothed it several times to ensure I got as much product off my hands as I could.  Then, I wiped my hands on a towel just a little bit to get rid of the slippery feeling, and then lightly smoothed what was left on top of my crown.  (I did this step because I was planning to use a flat iron and I usually start closer to my roots, and wanted some heat protection there - but as I have fine hair, I knew full well that this could make my hair flat and greasy if I used too much of it.)&lt;br /&gt;Next, I used a fine tooth comb to comb the product through and get it really coating each strand.  All this takes about a minute and 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I blew dry as usual, and used my flat iron when it was dry to get gloss and swing.  I&#x27;m now on day 3 and my hair is still hanging straight down and has some &#x27;swing&#x27; and weight to it (fine-haired gals will get what I&#x27;m talking about) and it looks amazing.  My temples and the hairline at my forehead are starting to get a bit dirty, but that&#x27;s normal for me at 3 days after a blowout and a little dry shampoo will take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am LOVING this product much more than anything I have ever used, even the more expensive heat serums.  If you are looking to find something that delivers what it promises, you can&#x27;t miss for $7!  I will definitely buy this product again and have recommended it to a friend AND gotten lots of compliments on my hair at my high school reunion.&lt;br /&gt;This is a buy.  Works great, my hair ends are sealed and felt very protected after using a heat styling tool.to it (fine-haired gals will get what I&#x27;m talking about) and it looks amazing.
