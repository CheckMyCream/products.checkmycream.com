      <li>I was also told that they&#x27;ve switched containers and that the new ones travel better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a big deal cause you can download the book from their site and use your own scoop...</li>
      <li>The mask felt good on my face, with no burning or other sensation.</li>
      <li>Other than that it seem good.</li>
      <li>smell very much like seaweed</li>
      <li>make sure you have an essential oil in hand</li>
      <li>Based on this I&#x27;d definitely do business again :)</li>
      <li>my first order of business was to make a homemade face mask.</li>
      <li>seaweed powder is a fine powder, so you can easily use it in a variety of ways by mixing it with other ingredients.</li>
      <li>You can use it as a face mask to help with things like acne, eczema, dry skin, and more - or you can also use on it your body as a scrub or wrap, which can help with the appearance of cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Once you buy it the company also sends you a free e book with recipes for different kinds of masks.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried others and this is much smoother to mix</li>
      <li>I was very upset....</li>
      <li>This is a very well made high quality seaweed powder.</li>
      <li>So far i have used it as a honey-sea-weed face mask and it has worked pretty well.</li>
      <li>It is important to me to use only natural skin care products, and I also always looking for ways to keep my skin looking healthier.</li>
      <li>After it dried, I showered and my face felt very smooth.</li>
      <li>I use an Indian Clay mask for my face to clear up clogged pores, but this is much gentler on the skin.  </li>
      <li>and I reordered another new Botlle ....</li>
      <li>Many other powders come in bags and if you make soaps, creams, masks, and such; you know you don&#x27;t want bags drooping all over your shelves.</li>
      <li>Normally I am used to masks that make my face feel dry and tight, but this had a nice soothing feel to it, and my face just felt soft and</li>
      <li>Very good but smell bad.</li>
      <li>and/or if you are looking for natural ingredients to use in your recipes.</li>
      <li>They send coupons all the time, which are so helpful when you buy any natural products that are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it in my facial masks and it works really well.</li>
      <li>I try to use this once a week, makes my skin really soft.  </li>
      <li>and/or if you are looking for natural ingredients to use in your recipes.were complaining that it smelled (like seaweed or fishy).  </li>
      <li>Dry, it has a light seaweed scent and when wet, it does smell</li>
      <li>It has relieved my dry skin problem and makes my skin so much softer.</li>
      <li>Appreciated, but not worth the hassle for me.</li>
      <li>The consistency was a little different from other types of face masks I have used, so I was wondering if this would dry, and sure enough, it did.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this product after having a seaweed wrap at the spa and must admit this is a great feeling after using.  I use it along with my body scrub by just putting a scoop in with the scrub or just adding a scoop to my bath.  It has relieved my dry skin problem and makes my skin so much softer.</li>
    <li> Okay, honestly I have not used this product yet, but I have what to say about the company and their products. I bought their zinc oxide as well and I am so happy. Their products come so clean, neat, and easy to use. I love that it comes with a screw top and a scoop inside. Many other powders come in bags and if you make soaps, creams, masks, and such; you know you don&#x27;t want bags drooping all over your shelves. They want that each customer is completely satisfied, where do you ever see that? They send coupons all the time, which are so helpful when you buy any natural products that are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy that I found them. You will be very happy. Happy natural product making! I hear these make an awesome mask and cellulite wrap....</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it. smell very much like seaweed but i like it. Only thing is i did not get the spoon it said it come with. Other than that it seem good. Love that it is organic and FDA approved. But I emailed the company about the missing spoon and they are sending it.</li>
    <li> It is important to me to use only natural skin care products, and I also always looking for ways to keep my skin looking healthier. Although I have used a lot of masks over the years, I have never used a product like the La Lune Seaweed Powder on my skin before. However, I do like making homemade skincare products (like lotions and body scrubs), so this is a great ingredient to keep on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seaweed powder can be used in a variety of ways. You can use it as a face mask to help with things like acne, eczema, dry skin, and more - or you can also use on it your body as a scrub or wrap, which can help with the appearance of cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients in skincare products are important to me. La Lune Seaweed Powder is simply that - seaweed powder. It doesn&#x27;t have additives or preservatives, and a great bonus is that it is certified organic! This seaweed is packed with lots of great nutrients and benefits for your skin. I am happy to find skincare products that don&#x27;t contain parabens, sulfates, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seaweed powder is a fine powder, so you can easily use it in a variety of ways by mixing it with other ingredients. Dry, it has a light seaweed scent and when wet, it does smell strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have problem skin and I love face masks, so my first order of business was to make a homemade face mask. For this I just mixed the seaweed powder with water. The powder mixes easily enough, and I used a brush to apply to my face. The consistency was a little different from other types of face masks I have used, so I was wondering if this would dry, and sure enough, it did. The mask felt good on my face, with no burning or other sensation. After it dried, I showered and my face felt very smooth. Normally I am used to masks that make my face feel dry and tight, but this had a nice soothing feel to it, and my face just felt soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the mask was definitely that of seaweed. I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all, but my kids were complaining that it smelled (like seaweed or fishy).  If you mind the scent, I would suggest adding some essential oils. You can use this in lots of recipes, and add other nutritious ingredients like honey or aloe vera.  And you can make a variety of products with this, like salt scrubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review. I love making homemade body products at home, such as lotions and scrubs, so this is a perfect addition to my supplies, and I only use natural products on my skin and in my home.

    <li> I have used this product as a face mask and am loving it so far! I have very dry skin and this is better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before! I love that it&#x27;s all natural and has so many uses! I will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> So strong, loving it!!!!</li>
    <li> Very good but smell bad. I mix it with lemon Joice.</li>
    <li> Smells like rotten fish. Can&#x27;t use this product without wanting to pewk</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the product itself, but I didn&#x27;t receive the scoop and beauty recipes as indicated. It&#x27;s not a big deal cause you can download the book from their site and use your own scoop...make sure you have an essential oil in hand so you don&#x27;t smell like Sea World, though.</li>
    <li> This is a very well made high quality seaweed powder. I&#x27;ve tried others and this is much smoother to mix and I love the recipe ebook that they send through email after I purchased. I&#x27;m going to try the Indian Healing Clay next!</li>
    <li> The product is great. Tried it on myself and my husband... Love it!</li>
    <li> i love the product and highly recommend it. The packing is good too. The awesome thing is the booklet they offer to try it ion many different ways. So far i have used it as a honey-sea-weed face mask and it has worked pretty well. Also good for sensitive skin (mine) as no break outs seen after 2 consecutive uses (though i strictly follow my doctor&#x27;s prescription  to follow up lotion so i dont break out). The weeds really smell like weed lol and after washing give really silky feeling to face.&lt;br /&gt;Cant wait to try other ideas.&lt;br /&gt;Also, i use it while i enjoy a relaxing bubble bath and save tons of money of having great facial at home.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> Ok ok ok ... Their Customer Service is GREAT!!!! I got my frirst 16 oz Botlle BUT I WAS BROKEN OMG ... I was very upset.... So I call them ( AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE) and they treat me fine ... I got my Money Back and I reordered another new Botlle ....&lt;br /&gt;Talking about the product YESSSSSSS IT WORKS!!!!! Try it ... You will love ... I promise you....&lt;br /&gt;I use it for face and legs.... Wonderful !!!!</li>
    <li> I use it in my facial masks and it works really well. If you need ideas they include an email with a .pdf of recipes and uses.    The jar is plastic and it came cracked. The lid doesn&#x27;t seal well and green powder gets everywhere so I have to keep it in a bag.    I recommend it, I just wish it didn&#x27;t leak.      EDIT  The company emailed me immediately letting me know it was refunded and that I should initiate a replacement through Amazon. Appreciated, but not worth the hassle for me. I&#x27;m deployed and the post office is no fun here.    **I was also told that they&#x27;ve switched containers and that the new ones travel better. Based on this I&#x27;d definitely do business again :)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I use an Indian Clay mask for my face to clear up clogged pores, but this is much gentler on the skin.  Once you buy it the company also sends you a free e book with recipes for different kinds of masks.  Also, they keep sending me coupons which is nice.  I try to use this once a week, makes my skin really soft.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Perfect for facial masks and body wraps!!! Love it)</li>
    <li> Seller contacted me ASAP and directed me to the site for the ebook. Awesome!!!!</li>
