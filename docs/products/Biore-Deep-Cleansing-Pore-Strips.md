      <li>That, if anything, causes these to win for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It feels good to the touch.</li>
      <li>Loved them will have to buy soon again.</li>
      <li>and although I have good skin</li>
      <li>so I had a good idea of what to expect with these</li>
      <li>I received one as a sample and loved it</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re great, but the pores on my nose hold onto blackheads like Americans cling to the thought that bacon makes everything better.</li>
      <li>With a couple of teenagers at home it is always good to have these handy.</li>
      <li>It was amazing.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve always liked them.</li>
      <li>These were nothing spectacular.</li>
      <li>When I read the good reviews saying these were even more effective</li>
      <li>Still knowing they are there kind of drive me</li>
      <li>They do give a nice tingly sensation though which feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Biore strips --</li>
      <li>These are very good and the general landscape of my nose looks great.</li>
      <li>mileage may vary, but while I would recommend Biore&#x27;s normal strips without hesitation, these weren&#x27;t as impressive.</li>
      <li>I have reviewed both on Amazon, but the addition of the charcoal seems to be a more effective fighter when it comes to blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but these are good in a pinch for a quick fix.</li>
      <li>What I can say is to make sure you wait until the strip has hardened on your face.</li>
      <li>this point, I think it makes more sense for me to wait until summer to use my two remaining strips.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>I found a comparable brand at Forever21 which contained charcoal which were better.</li>
      <li>Sure, it worked well to remove the blackheads -</li>
      <li>I looked at my pores before and after using the strip, and I noticed that most of blackheads were gone.</li>
      <li>However, I will update my review when I have more information.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>If anything, it&#x27;s better now that I use oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works OK, but couldn&#x27;t be bothered.</li>
      <li>However, I will update my review when I have more information.nt.  </li>
      <li>It is VERY important that you follow the instructions and clean your face thoroughly to allow the strips to function most effectively.  </li>
      <li>I remember trying pore strips when they first came out years ago--what an ingenious item!  </li>
      <li>(I don&#x27;t believe that my nose is that much more clean than it has been in months past.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
      <li>This is easy to use--takes 15 minutes.  </li>
      <li>For the asking price, i do not feel like these are a worthwhile investment for keeping a clean face.</li>
      <li>I felt like these did their job just fine</li>
      <li>They came off very easily, and i didn&#x27;t feel like there was very much on the strip.</li>
      <li>(oil is a huge problem for me</li>
      <li>decided to try this out when I had the opportunity to try a free sample.</li>
      <li>These work great, but I have used the regular Biore strips and will continue to do so.</li>
      <li>instructions are easy to follow: clean your face, thoroughly moisten your nose and cheeks, then apply.</li>
      <li>Overall a great product, does what it says.</li>
      <li>and I feel like the charcoal absorbed more than the original.</li>
      <li>My skin is always clean and smooth where I removed the strip.</li>
      <li>Clean, smooth skin with reddening or irritation.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to give them a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>product that is an improved version of the original Biore strips.</li>
      <li>They yanked some, but not all, of my pores clean.  </li>
      <li>Well, there seems to be a special product nowadays for everything.  </li>
      <li>They were ok, but it always seemed that I wasn&#x27;t getting out as much as I wanted from them.</li>
      <li>This is a good tool in your arsenal to fight overly oily, acne prone skin, but it is by no means the only tool that you should have.  </li>
      <li>but I love them so much</li>
      <li>I have a fairly oily nose, and regularly use pore strips as part of my regimen.</li>
      <li>The fact that charcoal has been proven good for ridding the body of toxins makes me want to continue using them for this reason only.</li>
      <li>NOT as good as the regular strips.  </li>
      <li>They are pretty pricey for 6 strips but they work and they are easy to use.</li>
      <li>They leave my skin feeling so clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>My skin definitely becomes more oily in the summer, so perhaps I&#x27;ll see greater results then, if not with blackheads then perhaps with oil control.  </li>
      <li>A good, effective product, definitely far better than the creams I&#x27;ve used in the past..</li>
      <li>Well, I can&#x27;t say that these are any more or less effective than the regular Biore strips insofar as getting things nice and clean...</li>
      <li>I thought my nose was pretty clean as I always wash my fact</li>
      <li>I definitely think they&#x27;re effective</li>
      <li>they are worth the 10-15 minutes of annoyance.</li>
      <li>My daughter has used two of the six so far and is pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>The strip looked like a hedgehog, and my nose looked nice pink and smooth.  </li>
      <li>soon as i tried these and pulled off the strip, i can not described the joy and satisfaction that comes from seeing all the dirt from your pores come off and stick to the strip (like the commercial says: porcupine!)&lt;br /&gt;i still have blackheads, and the strip isn&#x27;t full when i pull it off, but it is definitely an improvement!</li>
      <li>After using for the first time my skin felt so soft and smooth and looked so clean.</li>
      <li>with the others, wash your face with warm water, dry your hands and apply the strip to your damp</li>
      <li>Well, they worked fine, just like the old ones.  </li>
      <li>My nose looked and felt so clean and fresh after using this, my pores were clear and</li>
      <li>Biore strips i&#x27;ve used in the past had a lot more pull power and got more gunk out.</li>
      <li>maybe a copy cat version of the higher end</li>
      <li>(they are pricey, so a &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34;) --</li>
      <li>my opinion, it leaves the skin softer and more velvet-like than regular Biore strips.</li>
      <li>I used them for the first time today.</li>
      <li>But much to my surprise, it was worth the annoyance as it cleaned out a lot of gunk from my pores.</li>
      <li>And they will refill within a matter of weeks, because they&#x27;re supposed to be there and doing exactly what they</li>
      <li>It took a bit to dry out, maybe because of the warm shower really warming my face.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know that they&#x27;re any more or less effective as the standard Biore strips.</li>
      <li>This does a good job of deep cleaning but as the directions say they are pore strips only to be used on the nose.</li>
      <li>My nose was a little blotchy with big humpy pores and after the 15 minute application and peeling away it was smooth and looked good.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to stick very well at first</li>
      <li>I wonder is how useful it actually is to yank our pores clean.  </li>
      <li>With the charcoal version I had to do a quick rinse to clear off the residue.</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin, but have no issue using these.</li>
      <li>At my age, dry skin is more an issue than oily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Applying a strip to my nose was easy following the instructions.  </li>
      <li>As with any nose strips, application of the Biore Charcoal Pore Strips is very simple and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Now, I am all about new products for face cleaning and this was kinda familiar and kinda new, so I just had to try it.</li>
      <li>also used this on a large blackhead that had formed elsewhere.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So despite trying every single acne product and being on prescription antibiotics and cream on and off since my early teens, my blackheads have persisted. my dermatologist told me they are genetic because of my oily skin- they used to only be on my nose, but now have spread to my chin as well. i didn&#x27;t think the normal biore strips worked exceptionally well, but i still did them in hopes of removing even a few blackheads. The ultra version of the regular ones did work better, but i would still pull off a strip that was mainly empty of the black/whiteheads and see no difference in my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as soon as i tried these and pulled off the strip, i can not described the joy and satisfaction that comes from seeing all the dirt from your pores come off and stick to the strip (like the commercial says: porcupine!)&lt;br /&gt;i still have blackheads, and the strip isn&#x27;t full when i pull it off, but it is definitely an improvement!</li>
    <li> I am a guy and deep cleaning my nose pores is not a part of my beauty regimen.  However, I&#x27;ve decided to try these strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying a strip to my nose was easy following the instructions.  After 15 minutes I removed the strip.  The strip looked like a hedgehog, and my nose looked nice pink and smooth.  I looked at my pores before and after using the strip, and I noticed that most of blackheads were gone.</li>
    <li> Biore Pore Strips are wonderful and fully deserve 5 stars.  I don’t find that the charcoal adds anything, so I debated on whether or not to remove 1 star for the Charcoal version.  I decided to stay with the 5 stars, since they do the same 5 star job as the regular strips and perhaps those with very oily skin would see a difference.  That said, I will be sticking with the regular, less expensive Biore Pore Strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could find so scientific studies which addressed the use of charcoal to control acne.</li>
    <li> this product didn&#x27;t do anything for my pores. I have tried biore strips before, I thought the new charcoal might be better but it was useless. It was fun to peel off, but otherwise useless</li>
    <li> NOT as good as the regular strips.  I have big pores and oily skin.  These were nothing spectacular.</li>
    <li> Did not work well and irritated my skin. Very itchy after effect.</li>
    <li> Originally bought these because I saw them on Amazon and was curious. I figured with such a good review rating it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try, and I also use charcoal on my body for other issues. Gonna echo a few others here and say they&#x27;re not as effective as the regular white strips. They do a wonderful job of removing oil (oil is a huge problem for me so I can say that it worked there) but blackheads not so much. I also had another issue others had, which is that it doesn&#x27;t stick as well. Don&#x27;t waste extra money, the regular strips work better.</li>
    <li> This does a good job of deep cleaning but as the directions say they are pore strips only to be used on the nose. They include charcoal which seems to give some added &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; in getting rid of the trapped dirt and oil, but you have to wash off the little bits of charcoal on your skin afterwards. A good, effective product, definitely far better than the creams I&#x27;ve used in the past..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used pore strips before because it sounded gross pulling black heads out and seeing the debri on a piece of tape. But, after using the Biore Deep Cleansing Strips I can understand the draw. After using for the first time my skin felt so soft and smooth and looked so clean. I was really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are easy to follow: clean your face, thoroughly moisten your nose and cheeks, then apply. After 15 minutes they feel like papier-mâch&amp;eacute;, almost bullet proof even. Slowly peel away. Rinse any remaining charcoal and viola! Clean, smooth skin with reddening or irritation. It&#x27;s that simple. The price is affordable and when I run out of my sample box I am going to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gross to look at, but highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I do not like these at all! They leave black residue when you use them and they hardly even work! Also they don&#x27;t stick on as well as the original white ones. Will not buy these again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> This product did not work well at all-I read the directions and I could not get the strips to even stick, I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really think these do much different than the regular blackhead strips already out there, even from Biore. Sure, it worked well to remove the blackheads - but I didn&#x27;t really notice these to really do too much difference. The packaging claims the charcoal helps reduce shine, but I can&#x27;t attest much to that because I don&#x27;t struggle too much with excess shine on my nose. So while these do the job, they aren&#x27;t stand out. These also did leave behind a bit of a charcoal residue after removal, which washes off easily, but take not of that. I didn&#x27;t have any issue with a skin reaction, though, nor did these hurt much to pull off. Application was very easy, and they didn&#x27;t feel really uncomfortable in the time they sit on.</li>
    <li> After using one on myself and my husband, i&#x27;m not sold on these. They came off very easily, and i didn&#x27;t feel like there was very much on the strip. the crease of my nose looks exactly the same as it did before. Biore strips i&#x27;ve used in the past had a lot more pull power and got more gunk out. For the asking price, i do not feel like these are a worthwhile investment for keeping a clean face.</li>
    <li> My daughter has used two of the six so far and is pleased with the results. She doesn&#x27;t really see a difference from other pore strips that she has used, but they don&#x27;t irritate her skin like the chemically laden ones seem to do. They work for her and she concluded that it can be another weapon in your beauty regiment. She&#x27;s just happy that these strips don&#x27;t leave behind redness on her face.</li>
    <li> So I had wanted to try these out for a while, but only got them today (at the store). All I can say is WOW WHY DIDN&#x27;T I GET THESE SOONER. I didn&#x27;t even get them on Amazon but I love them so much I just had to write a review to let other people know. I didn&#x27;t expect much, because the biore face washes and cleansers haven&#x27;t really worked for me. I have a few blackheads but my biggest problem is whiteheads and just oily clogged pores mainly. It makes my makeup get caked up and gross and it&#x27;s very frustrating. I&#x27;ve tried countless washes and cleansers and pore minimizers and steam treatments and face masks and NONE OF THEM worked any where near as well as these little strips. I didn&#x27;t realize how disgusting my pores really were until I peeled the strip back and saw little white porcupine needles sticking out from it. And by porcupine needles I mean little strings of dirt and oil and makeup that have been clogging my poor pores for god knows how long. I now understand why my makeup always looks weird on my nose: BECAUSE I HAD NASTY GOO STUCK INSIDE MY SKIN. The pictures are gross, but you can&#x27;t deny, the results are fantastic. I&#x27;m so glad this disgusting gunk is out of my body. My nose is very happy. Will definitely be trying their other pore strips and masks.</li>
    <li> These are a wonderful product and they work! I know we hear that a lot in the world of beauty, but these truly do deliver. After using them, my husband and I both noticed a much clearer region of skin on our nose. You can literally see the blackheads on the paper after you take it off. Gross, I know, but it goes to show that the product works.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great, but the pores on my nose hold onto blackheads like Americans cling to the thought that bacon makes everything better.</li>
    <li> In the past few years, I&#x27;ve been slacking off on using the Biore nose strips. They were ok, but it always seemed that I wasn&#x27;t getting out as much as I wanted from them. But I was recently in dire need of a nose pore cleaning. Off to Amazon I went and I then saw these little beauties. Now, I am all about new products for face cleaning and this was kinda familiar and kinda new, so I just had to try it. So, usually I will do a quick face wash and then pop the strip on. But today I decided I would do it after the evening shower. So I got out of the shower, didn&#x27;t dry my face and popped this on. Then dried the rest of the face and went about getting ready for bed. It took a bit to dry out, maybe because of the warm shower really warming my face. But when it came off. My goodness. It was amazing. The black charcoal really lets you see what came out, aside from blackheads I guess, it is so much easier to see than on the white ones. I suggest you get it just for the contrast. I felt so much cleaner. There was a little black residue left over from the strip, but it washed off super easy. I think I will let it set a little longer next time because it was slightly less dry in areas. I did find that slowly peeling it off as I held the skin felt like it may have helped the unwanted stuff to stay attached to the strip rather than my nose. I expect I will be a monthly subscriber to these. I need to see if they have those forehead/chin ones too!</li>
    <li> I used them for the first time today. I&#x27;m having a few issues with these. 1st off if your have sensitive skin do not use these...no nose itches so bad. Secondly i I used it for the 15 min when I pulled it off it was painful to pull off and thirdly it only got a few blackheads and it pulled out a ton of fine hairs and I still have a ton of blackheads ob my nose. Not worth your money.</li>
    <li> I hate the way this feels on my nose, and it makes me itch. I couldn&#x27;t wait to take it off. But much to my surprise, it was worth the annoyance as it cleaned out a lot of gunk from my pores. They weren&#x27;t exactly blackheads, but enlarged pores with some white gunk. It really worked and after removal there was no irritation despite the itch and icky stiff feeling as the strip dried on my nose. I recently brought the regular Biore strips, and they did not work nearly as well for me. I totally recommend these are they are worth the 10-15 minutes of annoyance.</li>
    <li> No viable difference. I used this on my nose several times. It would be really cool if it could shrink my pores, but all it seems to do is clear my black heads so they can fill up again the next day. I don&#x27;t have really bad black heads so I might not be the best judge. This does make a bit of a mess tho. You need to have your nose wet and then apply the strip. It didn&#x27;t seem to stick very well at first and I did have to keep getting it wet. Every time I would get it wet black water would run down my face. The strip also started to break. There was lots of gunk on the strip after I let it dry and pealed it off so I know it did do something. So not  too impressed.</li>
    <li> Personally I can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the plain white strips.  They both do the same job.  If you&#x27;ve never used Biore strips before here is what you need to know.  Wash your face.  Then splash water on your nose.  Make sure your nose is wet (like a puppy&#x27;s!)  Do NOT wet the Biore strip.  If you do you will simply ruin it.  Once your nose is wet, remove the clear plastic strip from the Biore strip.  Then place it on your nose, shaping it so there are no gaps between your skin and the Biore strip.  Then wait for it to dry.  When you are sure it is dry (really really sure), then slowly peel it away from your nose.  If you look closely in a good light, the part of the Biore strip that was against your skin, will sadly look like a minuscule forest of trees.  This is the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; that was inside your pores.  I recommend that you don&#x27;t do anything that involves a lot of dust and dirt (or putting on make-up) immediately after using a Biore strip.  You&#x27;ve just cleaned your pores out, let them rest before doing anything that might &amp;#34;fill them up&amp;#34; again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I recently purchased the regular biore strip with no charcoal and I feel like the charcoal absorbed more than the original. My skin is always clean and smooth where I removed the strip. It feels good to the touch. There is often some black residue left on the skin afterwords, but it rinses off easily with water. What I can say is to make sure you wait until the strip has hardened on your face. If you take it off too soon, it will definitely cause discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;If you are someone who deals with congested skin in the t-zone area, this is a wonderful solution. I will be going back to the charcoal once my new strip are used up.</li>
    <li> Charcoal seems to be the star ingredient in Biore&#x27;s new line- maybe a copy cat version of the higher end Boscia line sold at Sephora?&lt;br /&gt;I find that these strips worked no better or worse than the usual white ones. The only difference being these are more expensive</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Biore nose strips before and generally have found these to be about the same as the other ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wonder is how useful it actually is to yank our pores clean.  Won&#x27;t they just fill back up again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had clogged nose pores since I was about 12 years old.  I&#x27;ve tried just about everything.  At this point in my life, I don&#x27;t even use soap on my face anymore, or cleanser, or lotion.  I was my face with a mix of olive and castor oil (yes, really--google it).  My face itself has been much happier because of this, no longer dry, lively and healthy.  Personally, I think soaps and cleansers are not good for the skin and that water is more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, just to clarify, even when I did use soap and cleansers, I still had big nose pores that got filled up.  If anything, it&#x27;s better now that I use oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, these are about like the old pore strips.  I actually worried they might not work if I didn&#x27;t use soap, and I wondered how it would work with my oil.  Well, they worked fine, just like the old ones.  They yanked some, but not all, of my pores clean.  I might try it a few nights in a row (you&#x27;re not supposed to do this) and see if I can get all the pores clean, but they&#x27;ll just fill back up again.  Seems a little pointless, but then, I&#x27;m also one of those people who finds it pointless to make the bed since you&#x27;ll sleep in it again the same day...</li>
    <li> I have a fairly oily nose, and regularly use pore strips as part of my regimen. As with any nose strips, application of the Biore Charcoal Pore Strips is very simple and easy to use. Just clean, wet, apply, let set for 15 minutes and remove. But in terms of effectiveness, I don&#x27;t see how the added charcoal offers additional benefits. The amount of oils/skin deposits was the same or even a bit less than what I normally achieve with standard nose strips. My pores didn&#x27;t appear nor feel any clearer than if charcoal had not been present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, every time I peeled off the strip, black residue was left on my skin, requiring further cleansing. This shouldn&#x27;t really be a multi-step process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, while these may work for some, I will continue using regular nose strips.</li>
    <li> It says 6 nose strips but only have 5 strips inside!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used Biore strips in probably ten years. I&#x27;m in my late 30s now and although I have good skin it&#x27;s often oily and there are always some visible pores. As long as you follow the instructions, these are easy as can be to use. When removing them definitely do so gently. They pull at your skin quite a bit and although I have sensitive skin I didn&#x27;t get a rash or any irritation. With the charcoal version I had to do a quick rinse to clear off the residue. If you look at the strip head on you&#x27;ll most likely see just some dead skin. If you turn the strip so you&#x27;re looking at it from the side you can see all the junk the strip pulled from your individual pores. I definitely think they&#x27;re effective but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re something I need to do very often. Also, I cut one in half and used it for my chin. It was an awkward fit but nearly as effective.</li>
    <li> If you only breakout or have black or white heads on your nose, you maay want to check Bioe out. Otherwise, I would recommend getting a product for the entire face. Works OK, but couldn&#x27;t be bothered.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time Biore strip devotee (I&#x27;ve used them all, regular, extra strength, nose and face). Depending on how clogged my pores are at the time I know the results will vary, but like many others I love that feeling of seeing a lot left behind on the strip and knowing you&#x27;re getting a ton out. When I read the good reviews saying these were even more effective I was really excited to give them a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using 3 of the charcoal strips over a period of 3 weeks, I&#x27;m not as impressed as I&#x27;d hoped. They do get out some gunk and as I mentioned, sometimes what you get out varies based on factors other than the strip itself, but I just wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34; by these. They do give a nice tingly sensation though which feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, these still work, but I don&#x27;t know that they&#x27;re any more or less effective as the standard Biore strips.</li>
    <li> Well, there seems to be a special product nowadays for everything.  This is for removing oily gunk specifically from pores in the  nose.  Does it work?  Yes. My pores looked immaculate after using this.  An incipient blackhead was gone.  I could see a clear difference. This is easy to use--takes 15 minutes.  Only used for the nose. It did not irritate my skin which was my concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some points about using this product--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really need to read the instructions carefully.  Don&#x27;t assume you will intuitively know what to do. You have to wet the nose before applying and you must apply the strip with the smooth side down.</li>
    <li> Like many, I love the satisfaction of Buire strips: pulling them off my nose and being disgusted at what comes with them is so cathartically cleansing. That said, I had high hopes for these charcoal strips and I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, they&#x27;re harder to use than my past experiences with Biore strips. You have to (repeat, HAVE TO) wet your nose - my first attempt fell off because I skipped that step in the instructions. My second attempt fell off because I didn&#x27;t wet my nose enoigh. My third attempt stuck, and I waited patiently and... voila... Next to nothing came off with the strip. Had they not stuck well enough? (I don&#x27;t believe that my nose is that much more clean than it has been in months past.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your mileage may vary, but while I would recommend Biore&#x27;s normal strips without hesitation, these weren&#x27;t as impressive.</li>
    <li> These are just awful. I don&#x27;t understand how they could mess up pore strips since it&#x27;s just putting a sticky strip on your nose and ripping the blackheads out, but these are terrible. I can just see someone in the marketing department thinking &amp;#34;Let&#x27;s try to appeal to the people that want to buy Glamglow but don&#x27;t want to pay for it, so let&#x27;s put charcoal in EVERYTHING even if it doesn&#x27;t work.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY reason I bought these was because I went to the store with the intent of buying pore strips in the first place and these were on sale because they were new. I don&#x27;t understand how these manage not to work, but they just don&#x27;t. They do not stick to the skin nearly as well as the regular strips so significantly less blackheads are removed. Stick with the regular pore strips, don&#x27;t even bother with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to come out of these strips is the black residue left on your skin and towel. Oh and did I mention that the black residue gets into to your pores so it actually looks like there are more blackheads than you started with?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A total ripoff. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see any difference between the regular ones and these charcoal ones, but I will use them either way.</li>
    <li> I received one as a sample and loved it so I ordered these on Amazon, because they were cheaper than at the drug store. Loved them will have to buy soon again.</li>
    <li> I periodically use the regular Biore strips, which by the way, haven&#x27;t seemed to change much over the years.&lt;br /&gt;As with the others, wash your face with warm water, dry your hands and apply the strip to your damp nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait until it&#x27;s dry, about 10 minutes. Don&#x27;t let it stay on much longer. If you do, it will be too dry to draw any impurities out.&lt;br /&gt;There is a bit of a learning curve. It might take a few tries to get the right amount of moisture and dry time correct for your particular face.&lt;br /&gt;when you do, there are visible results and very soft skin after wiping away the residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, it leaves the skin softer and more velvet-like than regular Biore strips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the regular Biore Pore Strips for a long time now.  I tried these to compare and found they worked pretty much the same. Unfortunately, they cost a lot more.  I only use the strips about once per month.  The directions say not to use them daily - no more than every third day.  It also says to use them only on the nose area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that they worked. My nose was a little blotchy with big humpy pores and after the 15 minute application and peeling away it was smooth and looked good.  The product performs as promised but I&#x27;m just not sure what the difference is with these charcoal strips vs the regular ones.</li>
    <li> This is a step up from the regular Biore Strips in that it seems to be not only supersized, but also has the addition of charcoal to aid in the removal of extra oil.  It is VERY important that you follow the instructions and clean your face thoroughly to allow the strips to function most effectively.  It also removes dead, flaky skin and leaves your face feeling smooth and non-oily, without feeling dry and cracked.  This is a good tool in your arsenal to fight overly oily, acne prone skin, but it is by no means the only tool that you should have.  I like the improvements in the new strips.</li>
    <li> I remember trying pore strips when they first came out years ago--what an ingenious item!  I was so impressed that this simple little product could easily remove blackheads from my face, something that was very difficult for me to do on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flash-forward years later.  I am now in my mid-40s.  My skin still leans towards oily, and I still get occasional breakouts, so I use several facial products to assist with this.  I was less certain as to whether I might still have blackouts.  I thought it was likely, as I have large pores, so I thought this product could be helpful to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used this product on my nose, following the instructions exactly.  After about 10 minutes, the strip did dry up--like paper mache, just as the directions said--and I peeled it off.  It did leave some black (charcoal) residue behind that I needed to wash off.  Did it clear anything from my skin?  I&#x27;m not sure.  Other reviewers have reported seeing \\&quot;results\\&quot; right on the strip itself (although notably, no one has posted photos of this), but at most, I saw skin residue.  It&#x27;s also hard to say if the strip helped with oil control, as it&#x27;s winter--a particularly harsh winter, at that, and my skin has been more dry than usual.  Although the directions say that these strips are ONLY for the nose, I tried them on my forehead as well, where 1) the skin is pretty tough, and 2) there seemed to be some darkening that might indicate blackheads.  The results were the same, which is to say, no real visible results.  I repeated the use on my nose about a week after the first time with no further progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I think it makes more sense for me to wait until summer to use my two remaining strips.  My skin definitely becomes more oily in the summer, so perhaps I&#x27;ll see greater results then, if not with blackheads then perhaps with oil control.  So although my experience with these strips has not been bad, I cannot give them a glowing recommendation at present.  However, I will update my review when I have more information.nt.  However, I will update my review when I have more information.</li>
    <li> Skin problems don&#x27;t go away with age, unfortunately, but essential skin oils do. Standard pore strips had never had ill effects on me before - like most people, I was simply in awe at the stuff collected on the little strip and relieved to be cleared of what seemed like filth. But the stuff you see clinging to the strips is generally not dirt or blackheads, but sebaceous filaments - a combination of skin cells and sebum collected in a channel intended to help get sebum to the surface of the skin. Sebum, of course, isn&#x27;t filth - it&#x27;s a necessary skin protectant. It helps keep bad stuff out (dirt, bacteria) and good stuff in (moisture). Without it, you get dry, flaky and perhaps even cracking skin. You can get rashes and, yes, even acne. What&#x27;s more, all the empty channels left behind when you remove the filaments don&#x27;t go away. They&#x27;re permanent. And they will refill within a matter of weeks, because they&#x27;re supposed to be there and doing exactly what they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d always regarded that tight-skinned feeling following use of a pore strip with cleanliness, good hygiene, but this time it feels more like a burn--and four days after use, my skin remains quite unhappy with me. I think I&#x27;ll leave my sebacous filaments where they are. At my age, dry skin is more an issue than oily.</li>
    <li> These are a beauty must have! They rip out all the nasty gunk cleansers leave behind. These are perfect for the tween/teens in your life. I have super sensitive skin, but have no issue using these. They leave my skin feeling so clean and fresh. I highly recommend Biore Pore Strips to remove those pesky blackheads and open up your clogged pores.</li>
    <li> In the past I tried the regular Biore strips multiple times and in the end stopped buying them because they didn&#x27;t do much for me. I generally don&#x27;t get many obvious blackheads, just mostly clogged pores and dry but oily skin on my nose. The regular ones didn&#x27;t seem to work on the hard to get clogged pores, only the big blackheads. But this new product with the charcoal seems to do the trick. I must admit I was AMAZED. I had totally given up on biore strips working for me until I tried a sample of this. It seemed to pull every bit of dirt and oil from every little pore, I could not believe it. My nose looked and felt so clean and fresh after using this, my pores were clear and all the oil and flakes of dead skin were gone. I will definitely continue to buy these. The charcoal seems to make all the difference. I definitely think these are worth buying over the regular ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the regular Biore strips for years and I&#x27;ve always liked them. They keep my nose soft and remove dirt and grime that have attached itself to my face, but I&#x27;ve never really been dependent on them. Really, I use them only when I remember or when I notice some out of control blackheads. They&#x27;ve definitely never left my face less greasy (unfortunately).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot about the power of charcoal and have used it in several different mediums, so I was excited to try out this one. These strips work exactly the same as the regular Biore strips. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin between the regular ones and the charcoal ones. They did leave behind a black residue, which scrubbed right off. My nose is still soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I didn&#x27;t notice a difference, I think I&#x27;ll continue using these over the others for a while. The fact that charcoal has been proven good for ridding the body of toxins makes me want to continue using them for this reason only. Who knows if it makes an actual difference, but I like the idea that it does.</li>
    <li> These work great, but I have used the regular Biore strips and will continue to do so. I felt like these did their job just fine but they left a black residue that the regular strips do not, and since I felt like there was no discernible difference the two; I will not repurchase these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you feel you are extra oily and like the added benefits or the idea of charcoal, then by all means try these. They work and make you nose feel great. And even though there are strips specifically for your chin I also use them on my chin.</li>
    <li> I have used the Biore strips to remove black heads for at least four or five years, once or twice a week depending on season. They worked well. I found a comparable brand at Forever21 which contained charcoal which were better. I have reviewed both on Amazon, but the addition of the charcoal seems to be a more effective fighter when it comes to blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this out when I had the opportunity to try a free sample. Subsequently, I ran out of my strips and bought a box of these at the store. These are very good and the general landscape of my nose looks great. The charcoal appears to extract the oil that forms blackheads and with continued use of the strips prevents further blackheads from forming or stops them before they actually are visible. I am lucky in this respect because my blackheads are very small and virtually unnoticeable. Still knowing they are there kind of drive me nuts.&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on a large blackhead that had formed elsewhere. Too much info here, but I am shameless when something works. Despite the fact that these strips are really for use on the nose, I put a strip on the offending blackhead and twenty minutes later it was bye, bye blackhead time. These work really well to the extent that I no longer feel self conscious about blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;Nice product that is an improved version of the original Biore strips.</li>
    <li> This really works as advertised.  I thought my nose was pretty clean as I always wash my fact but these strips pulled out things that normal washing did not get.  It actually made my nose a lot less oily and it really felt refreshing after using a strip.  Overall a great product, does what it says.</li>
    <li> With a couple of teenagers at home it is always good to have these handy. They are pretty pricey for 6 strips but they work and they are easy to use. It&#x27;s probably cheaper to get a charcoal mask product but these are good in a pinch for a quick fix.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these a few times and never really noticed a difference. They adhere just fine, and when I pull them off it definitely seems to pull up some skin cells (my nose does feel smoother) but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in blackheads or general pore-cleanliness. So I will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Biore strips -- have used them occasionally/as for probably the past 10 years (they are pricey, so a &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34;) -- so I had a good idea of what to expect with these; I was also looking forward to seeing if the new charcoal addition made any difference. Well, I can&#x27;t say that these are any more or less effective than the regular Biore strips insofar as getting things nice and clean... BUT, what a *huge* difference the black color makes for (kind of grossly) viewing what the strips remove. That, if anything, causes these to win for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll also add that these seem to DRY in less time than the regular version, and as another reviewer or two has noted, they tend to leave black marks on your nose (easily washed off).</li>
