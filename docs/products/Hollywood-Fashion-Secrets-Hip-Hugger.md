      <li>but it&#x27;s brilliant!</li>
      <li>This item works excellent.</li>
      <li>This thing is awesome!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s awesome!!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>perfect!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
      <li>We thought this would be the perfect solution.  </li>
      <li>Great idea though.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>idea is good...</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>This worked great at first, but when I moved it to another pair of pants the clip no longer held.</li>
      <li>With a couple of pairs of pants that are looser, I can cinch them so they stay in place, and I can safely bend over without anything showing in the back.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I love the way it fits without feeling like a belt in the front</li>
      <li>But I use it, it&#x27;s better than having to wear 2 belts.  </li>
      <li>They should have a better designer...</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love the simplicity of this product, and do not always want a belt.  </li>
      <li>Perfect answer for a woman w. curves and a smaller waist.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but saw it in Walmart, about the same price, this thing is amazing!!!!</li>
      <li>Need more colors.</li>
      <li>---sure does help keep your stretch jeans where they&#x27;re supposed to be--especially if the jeans have no elastic in the waistband</li>
      <li>Cheap elastic frays on the edges very quickly.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s face it, plumber&#x27;s crack is a huge turn off when MEN have it</li>
      <li>And it isn&#x27;t like I&#x27;m a huge person stretching it beyond it&#x27;s capacity--I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and 115 lbs.</li>
      <li>The clip does not stay clipped on the belt loop securely.</li>
      <li>I love these so much I am buying more.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for those jeans that are slightly loose at the waist, but not so much so that they need to be altered!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there, but my jeans fit just right now!</li>
      <li>Fixes the gap at the back of your pants nicely!</li>
      <li>I am so happy to be able to wear jeans without hiking them up every few steps!</li>
      <li>I am a person that absolutely hates belts, but also hates how my pants fit without one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got a very large bottom.</li>
      <li>the length adjuster piece is a little flimsy, but it&#x27;s otherwise pretty good.  </li>
      <li>the elastic strap rode ABOVE the waistband of my pants (as in, touching my skin).  </li>
      <li>Sir Mixx-a-lot was writing about women exactly like me.</li>
      <li>It keeps my jeans exactly where I need them to be.</li>
      <li>This really helps with that problem!</li>
      <li>First time I used it one of the clasps broke.  </li>
      <li>This is much, much more comfortable than a belt because it&#x27;s small and stretchy.</li>
      <li>Clip was strong enough.</li>
      <li>These worked well for tightening up the waistband of some loose fitting jeans.  </li>
      <li>Great idea, but poor execution.</li>
      <li>A friend gave me one, and I really like it</li>
      <li>it just looks so much like granpa suspenders...</li>
      <li>However, I found that if you tighten them too much the adjustment clasp will break.</li>
      <li>(just being real) and it acts as a belt holding pants up and in place but without a bulge in the front under your shirt.</li>
      <li>My daughter doesn&#x27;t like to wear a belt and she is very skinny.  </li>
      <li>I have three of these now, which tells you how much I like them.</li>
      <li>haha...</li>
      <li>So when I saw this item in Jo-Ann&#x27;s, I was intrigued (and I knew I could get it on Amazon for much cheaper</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe I am 33 years old and never found one of these!!!</li>
      <li>Wish there was some way to make it fit better other than the belt loops, as the elastic rubs my back sometimes.</li>
      <li>Plus I love other products from this brand</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not constantly pulling up my super comfy pants....</li>
      <li>I liked this even though it really only works if you have not so tight shirt covering it.</li>
      <li>I rarely wear jeans because of the gap I always have, I had one of those invisible belts, which I considered ok, but the small plastic buckle still cut into my belly, it just broke last week.</li>
      <li>but comes undone from the belt loop frequently.  </li>
      <li>But it does the job I need so far.</li>
      <li>A rapid weight loss from 125lbs to 80lbs left me with nothing to wear, and destroyed all normal belts.</li>
      <li>The one I&#x27;ve used so far keeps popping open on one end.  </li>
      <li>(I have a few male friends interested in having one as well!</li>
      <li>it really doesn&#x27;t work that well, while it does make your front smoother my pants still slip down and</li>
      <li>An Absolute must have for any one who pants are a little too big.</li>

<li> A bit hard to attach-but really works!</li>
<li> smaller waist, big booty and wide hips...</li>
<li> In reality this hiphugger gives a weird fit to my pants in the back and it does show anyway, unless you wear a very long top.&lt;br</li>
<li> Holds the back of the pants down</li>
<li> The elastic stays in place and the pants fall down in the middle.  </li>
<li> no thanks.</li>
<li> I am small, yet this is too short to reach between belt loops on some of my pants.</li>
<li> bought the hiphugger with the idea of not having a bulky belt in the front, which I hate especially when wearing light fabric tops.</li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t worry about my pants falling down or showing crack.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep wearing this under long tops, in the mean time wear my belts placing the bucklet on one side when needed.</li>
<li> My butt sticks out a little</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> This little jewel has solved that problem!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure how I survived to age 35 without this item in my life.</li>
<li> think you need pants with belt loops that are no more than about 4&amp;#34; apart.  </li>
<li> Not sure when they were invented</li>
<li> Hip hugger is a little awkward to use and my shirt still rides up in the back.  </li>
<li> Seriously.</li>
<li> All they did was bunch up in the back :(.  </li>
<li> Down with uncomfortable belts!)</li>
<li> If this is just a bad one, then the deserve 5 stars, but if this is common, then it&#x27;s not a good buy.</li>
<li> I tried belts, but they&#x27;re uncomfortable in the front.</li>
<li> Unfortunately these are useless for me.  </li>
<li> Useless.</li>
<li> ; sorry Jo-Ann&#x27;s).</li>
<li> Also, the length was difficult to adjust.</li>
<li> So disappointed.</li>
<li> So disappointed.  </li>
<li> I hate buckles and adding bulk to my waist;</li>
<li> It slips off probably 4x per day which is highly annoying.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My butt sticks out a little so sometimes pants don&#x27;t touch my lower back.  This really helps with that problem!</li>
    <li> Hip hugger is a little awkward to use and my shirt still rides up in the back.  But I use it, it&#x27;s better than having to wear 2 belts.  One to hold my jeans up and, sometimes, one I wear over a shirt.</li>
    <li> Wish there was some way to make it fit better other than the belt loops, as the elastic rubs my back sometimes.</li>
    <li> First time I used it one of the clasps broke.  Had to send back.</li>
    <li> This item works excellent. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to be able to wear jeans without hiking them up every few steps! Some of my jeans sit lower on the hips, and as they stretch out during the day, they just don&#x27;t stay up. This is much, much more comfortable than a belt because it&#x27;s small and stretchy. I don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there, but my jeans fit just right now! I put this on by threading it under the back middle belt loop, then clip it to the loops on either side. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> So disappointed. my weight is 50 k.g and i&#x27;ts too short on me !! i couldn&#x27;t make it longer !!!!</li>
    <li> I have three of these now, which tells you how much I like them. A rapid weight loss from 125lbs to 80lbs left me with nothing to wear, and destroyed all normal belts. Now back to 110lbs., this is allowing me to wear regular jeans without anyone realizing I&#x27;ve got a belt on.</li>
    <li> These worked well for tightening up the waistband of some loose fitting jeans.  However, I found that if you tighten them too much the adjustment clasp will break.</li>
    <li> Cheap elastic frays on the edges very quickly. Great idea though.</li>
    <li> perfect! it got rid of the chunky belt hiding under my blouse with my slacks. works well. over priced on here, found it cheaper at Ulta and Joanns, just saying</li>
    <li> The one I&#x27;ve used so far keeps popping open on one end.  If this is just a bad one, then the deserve 5 stars, but if this is common, then it&#x27;s not a good buy.</li>
    <li> Great idea, but poor execution. The clip does not stay clipped on the belt loop securely. It slips off probably 4x per day which is highly annoying. And it isn&#x27;t like I&#x27;m a huge person stretching it beyond it&#x27;s capacity--I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and 115 lbs.</li>
    <li> Fixes the gap at the back of your pants nicely! Perfect for those jeans that are slightly loose at the waist, but not so much so that they need to be altered!</li>
    <li> These are just what I needed when I was in between sizes.</li>
    <li> the length adjuster piece is a little flimsy, but it&#x27;s otherwise pretty good.  the clamps that attach it to the belt loops stay in place well.</li>
    <li> (This review is by Jeffrey&#x27;s wife, not Jeffrey)&lt;br /&gt;I think you need pants with belt loops that are no more than about 4&amp;#34; apart.  Even at its loosest setting, the Hip Hugger made my pants bunch up and the elastic strap rode ABOVE the waistband of my pants (as in, touching my skin).  Also, the length was difficult to adjust. Useless.</li>
    <li> I always have  to wear a belt because of my hourglass body shape.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the hiphugger with the idea of not having a bulky belt in the front, which I hate especially when wearing light fabric tops. Plus I love other products from this brand so I gave it a try....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But: 1. In reality this hiphugger gives a weird fit to my pants in the back and it does show anyway, unless you wear a very long top.&lt;br /&gt;2. it just looks so much like granpa suspenders...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea is good...&lt;br /&gt;1. I wish they would do it like a half-belt to wear only in the back, maybe in leather, anyway something that holds the pants and not something that is kept in place by the pants...&lt;br /&gt;2. They should have a better designer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep wearing this under long tops, in the mean time wear my belts placing the bucklet on one side when needed.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately these are useless for me.  All they did was bunch up in the back :(.  Was so hoping to lose the belt, not going to happen.  I may find another use for it...put it in my junk drawer just in case.</li>
    <li> but comes undone from the belt loop frequently.  the teeth on the adjustment clamp snags and catches on the elastic</li>
    <li> I am small, yet this is too short to reach between belt loops on some of my pants. For the others, it works well.</li>
    <li> Perfect answer for a woman w. curves and a smaller waist.  I love the simplicity of this product, and do not always want a belt.  With the fashions today, I can go beltless , and this HIp hugger does the trick.  With a couple of pairs of pants that are looser, I can cinch them so they stay in place, and I can safely bend over without anything showing in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived superfast. Love it.</li>
    <li> I could kiss the inventor of this contraption! I rarely wear jeans because of the gap I always have, I had one of those invisible belts, which I considered ok, but the small plastic buckle still cut into my belly, it just broke last week. I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but saw it in Walmart, about the same price, this thing is amazing!!!! I can now wear my jeans without constantly pulling them up. Let&#x27;s face it, plumber&#x27;s crack is a huge turn off when MEN have it, we don&#x27;t want to see a woman with plumber&#x27;s crack!</li>
    <li> I love these so much I am buying more.  I am in-between sizes in my pants and I love the way it fits without feeling like a belt in the front and I don&#x27;t worry about my pants falling down or showing crack.  An Absolute must have for any one who pants are a little too big.</li>
    <li> So disappointed.  I used it once on my daughter pants and it fell off.  Clip was strong enough.</li>
    <li> I liked this even though it really only works if you have not so tight shirt covering it. But it does the job I need so far.</li>
    <li> I am a person that absolutely hates belts, but also hates how my pants fit without one. This little jewel has solved that problem! Thanks</li>
    <li> it really doesn&#x27;t work that well, while it does make your front smoother my pants still slip down and the back gets kinda bunched up</li>
    <li> As another reviewer said... I can&#x27;t believe I am 33 years old and never found one of these!!! Not sure when they were invented but it&#x27;s brilliant! For girls with a body type like mine... smaller waist, big booty and wide hips... it&#x27;s perfect. Holds the back of the pants down so it doesn&#x27;t pop open and show crack haha... (just being real) and it acts as a belt holding pants up and in place but without a bulge in the front under your shirt. It&#x27;s awesome!!!</li>
    <li> This worked great at first, but when I moved it to another pair of pants the clip no longer held.</li>
    <li> doesnt work on pants with no belt loops... need one that works on pants that can not use a belt...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure how I survived to age 35 without this item in my life. Seriously. I&#x27;ve got a very large bottom. Always have. No matter how big or small my waist gets: the bottom remains large and in charge. Sir Mixx-a-lot was writing about women exactly like me. So the back of the pants gap has always just been this *thing* that I have had to deal with. I tried belts, but they&#x27;re uncomfortable in the front. I hate buckles and adding bulk to my waist; no thanks. So when I saw this item in Jo-Ann&#x27;s, I was intrigued (and I knew I could get it on Amazon for much cheaper; sorry Jo-Ann&#x27;s). It did not disappoint. It keeps my jeans exactly where I need them to be. Pro-tip: Clip it at the lowest part of the belt loops and loop it under the middle one. This way it doesn&#x27;t dig into or rub against your back at all. (I have a few male friends interested in having one as well! Down with uncomfortable belts!)</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome! Takes care of the waist gap so I&#x27;m not constantly pulling up my super comfy pants....</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift!  A friend gave me one, and I really like it---sure does help keep your stretch jeans where they&#x27;re supposed to be--especially if the jeans have no elastic in the waistband yet it&#x27;s made of stretch fabric, too.  The waistband stretches but doesn&#x27;t snap back to hold your pants up!</li>
    <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t like to wear a belt and she is very skinny.  We thought this would be the perfect solution.  But it isn&#x27;t.  The elastic stays in place and the pants fall down in the middle.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> A bit hard to attach-but really works!</li>
    <li> Great product. Need more colors.</li>
