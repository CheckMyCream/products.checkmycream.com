      <li>and I love how the curls turn out.</li>

      <li>Too many keys.</li>
      <li>Since I LOVE the the curl turns out.</li>

      <li>But I really like the curls. :)</li>
      <li>You get the hang of it really quickly. </li>
      <li>You can curl your hair rather quickly with it.</li>
      <li>The heat is perfect and can give those tight or big curls.</li>
      <li>It is probably me, the user error, who has a hard time curling own hair!</li>
      <li>I HAVE FRIENDS THAT WANTS TO BORROW THIS ITEM</li>
      <li>The curls hold very well</li>
      <li>Well,at least good for the price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what I did differently this time, but only had my hair get tangled once and the curls came out SO much better...</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t know what to think when I ordered this, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>The curler is clearly labeled as to which side should be facing the head.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I use this on my 9 and 11 year old girl&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>After the hair is drawn in the curler makes spaced apart short, high pitched &amp;#34;beeps&amp;#34; while the hair is being curled.</li>
      <li>As long as you put the hair in the slot correctly, (and not too much hair), and keep the proper side turned towards your head there is no issue.</li>
      <li>Because it&#x27;s heavy, and gets hot, and spins, just as with any curling appliance it shouldn&#x27;t be used by young kid.</li>
      <li>I have naturally very frizzy, wavy hair, but I have to wear it back in a ponytail or straighten it every single day because I can&#x27;t let it air dry...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this on my 9 and 11 year old girl&#x27;s hair. The curls hold very well and I never have to worry about burning them. It is very easy to use. I have used it on myself and I love how the curls turn out. I am not so great about curling the back of my hair. I thought that was the only downside to the curling iron. It is probably me, the user error, who has a hard time curling own hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to write reviews but had to if it helps someone that&#x27;s as undecided as I was. It heats up quickly, it&#x27;s lightweight and not cumbersome, it&#x27;s easy to use and gets the job done quickly. I&#x27;ve tried all three size curls and prefer the result from 10seconds at 210degree.</li>
    <li> I will use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Saves time and works great for hair that doesnt stay curl with regular curling iron.</li>
    <li> I HAVE FRIENDS THAT WANTS TO BORROW THIS ITEM ALL THE TIME. IT&#x27;S GREAT</li>
    <li> The color is great! The thing is that it is difficult to operate at the fist time. but i get hang of it now althought it will still take me a while.</li>
    <li> Well,at least good for the price.</li>
    <li> I tried using my curl pro again this morning and was amazed! I don&#x27;t know what I did differently this time, but only had my hair get tangled once and the curls came out SO much better... I plan on curling my hair much more often. I have hair down to the middle of my back and it took me a little over 25 minutes to get it done.. Pretty pleased!!!</li>
    <li> A little heavy. It will be better if the improvment is made in this aspect.</li>
    <li> The color is the same as the picture. Very nice. Have no time to try it yet.But it seems great.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before I bought this. Feel a little worried when they mention the hair got stuck. The seller gave me the proper explaination after I made the inquiry. If someone can&#x27;t ready the directions to use it properly then they are asking for trouble. As long as you put the hair in the slot correctly, (and not too much hair), and keep the proper side turned towards your head there is no issue. I really like this and only had trouble once since I didn&#x27;t put the strands hair in the slot properly. My bad. And I did get my hair unstuck.</li>
    <li> Too many keys.But I will pass it. Since I LOVE the the curl turns out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m learning how to use. But I really like the curls. :)</li>
    <li> The handle just fits my palm of hand.It is a little heavy but I can handle it..</li>
    <li> This is the golden gem of hair tools!! I have fairly long thick hair. Curling my hair used to take about 2 hours and I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the result. This curling iron takes only 35 minutes and looks great. The heat is perfect and can give those tight or big curls. It totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> Nice gadget to have. Really works great!!!</li>
    <li> I have naturally very frizzy, wavy hair, but I have to wear it back in a ponytail or straighten it every single day because I can&#x27;t let it air dry...it&#x27;s the biggest fro ever if I do. I can never get &amp;#34;nice,&amp;#34; defined curls to stay in my hair because it&#x27;s so thick and heavy. I just bought this curler from RC store thinking I would probably be returning it in a day, but It&#x27;s great! I really, really love it. It does have a learning curve, but the learning curve is, like, one trial run long. You get the hang of it really quickly. </li>
    <li> I&#x27;m learning how to use. But I really like the curls. :)</li>
    <li> I will use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I have several points to be shared.&lt;br /&gt;- The curler is clearly labeled as to which side should be facing the head.&lt;br /&gt;- After the hair is drawn in the curler makes spaced apart short, high pitched &amp;#34;beeps&amp;#34; while the hair is being curled. Once the curl is done it switches to a series of &amp;#34;beep beep beep beeps&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s the time to release the hair. Be sure to listen to these, the timing is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;- IF hair becomes tangled in the curler, unplug it and ease out the tangled hair. Usually this has happened because the section being curled is too wide, or the end of the section of hair was being held onto too tightly when the curler was drawing the hair in.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s fairly heavy, something to consider for anyone who doesn&#x27;t/can&#x27;t hold up a fairly heavy hair curler.&lt;br /&gt;- Because it&#x27;s heavy, and gets hot, and spins, just as with any curling appliance it shouldn&#x27;t be used by young kid.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to think when I ordered this, but I was pleasantly surprised. I am kind of master at curling irons, I could never achieve the perfect curl I get with this time and time again. You can curl your hair rather quickly with it.</li>
