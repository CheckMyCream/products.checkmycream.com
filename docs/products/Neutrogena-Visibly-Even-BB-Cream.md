### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;It gives great coverage!</li>
      <li>but I found the perfect solution!!</li>
      <li>As a moisturizer, this BB cream is as good as most Neutrogena products!</li>
      <li>Loreal BB cream much better!</li>
      <li>the cream is ok but too light for me although I have very fair skin</li>
      <li>looks nice, and goes on well, but i cannot stand the fragrance, had to give it away</li>
      <li>i think the Garnier version has a nicer texture and adds a nice sheen.</li>
      <li>Those are the best for me so far.</li>
      <li>It works very well as a sunblock and it smooths and evens out my face and provides great coverage that is light and feels good.</li>
      <li>, It helps even out skin and is very light weight.</li>
      <li>This may be a bonus for some, as it seems to also be a more pigmented BB cream than many.</li>
      <li>When will companies realize that fragrance in face creams is nothing but an irritant to so many people?</li>
      <li>I have used many types of BB Creme and makeup and have never found any</li>
      <li>It felt like there was nothing on my skin after I put it on, and my skin tone looked so much better.</li>
      <li>I use it on top of moisturizer and it lasts through most of the day.</li>
      <li>Better luck with Maybelline, Lumene, or even Garnier...</li>
      <li>I really love this BB cream.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the quality for the price!I believe Neutrogena is my new go to brand!</li>
      <li>This has good coverage if you need it, but as with all BB creams, I find that I had to use a combination of fair-light and light-medium to get the right color, and I&#x27;m pretty fair.  </li>
      <li>This product also has a strong odor.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best bb cream for reducing the need for multiple layers of correction.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I still look around for other alternatives but this is the best BB cream for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I am also on a budget and do not mind spending some good money on products but only if they work.</li>
      <li>I have super pale/fair skin with scarring</li>
      <li>After being impressed with other Neutrogena products, namely Rapid Wrinkle Repair, I expected better out of this product.</li>
      <li>have fair skin and very even skin, I&#x27;ve never worn foundation or a lot of makeup in general</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to wear a ton of makeup and love the natural look.</li>
      <li>All in all, good if you want a little coverage and don&#x27;t want to look like you are caking on makeup.</li>
      <li>It offers light concealment.  </li>
      <li>and I like the high SPF, as most BB creams are only a 15.</li>
      <li>but I like this for a little something to even out my skin tone and give my face a fresh healthy glow when I go out.</li>
      <li>very caking on my skin...</li>
      <li>This is a very &amp;#34;luxurious&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>really like this stuff</li>
      <li>I expected much better from Neutrogena.</li>
      <li>A bit too much coverage for me, though.</li>
      <li>and I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but yet it covered the flaws very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a big make up person, but am hitting that age where  no make-up at all &#x3D; haggard, and think this is a happy compromise between nothing at all and having to do foundation and powder, while still protecting my pale skin from the sun.</li>
      <li>I basically use it as a tinted moisturizer so for other purposes it may fair differently for someone else.</li>
      <li>visibly UN-even, what a waste of money this is the most unblendable bb cream I have ever used</li>
      <li>This bb cream is nice, not too thick, and not watery.</li>
      <li>It gives me a nice little tint that I am probably the only person who notices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Eventhough I&#x27;m 69, I like the BB creams to wear every day and Neutrogena is light enough for my taste but just enough coverage and moisture.  </li>
      <li>that meaning that it&#x27;s not very thick and won&#x27;t make your complexion look \\&quot;flawless\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Finally, Neutrogena came out with one and actually offered a shade light enough for my super-fair skin!  </li>
      <li>When I tested Neutrogena, I was very please how sheer it is</li>
      <li>As others have said, it is on the thick side, and this is especially true when you compare it to other BB creams like L&#x27;Oreal or Covergirl.</li>
      <li>When I had just gotten back after spending everyday in the sun in the Jordan desert it was just about perfect, but without out that slight &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; it&#x27;s simply too dark for me.</li>
      <li>If your someone like me who has trouble finding drugstore brands light enough, try Covergirl or Revlon.</li>
      <li>it goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way</li>
      <li>I was trying to replace old Daily moisturizer (tinted).</li>
      <li>This bb cream is very thick and has a strong odor, which is the reason I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, leave an oily sheen (at least, no worse than is my natural oil level), or anything else I wouldn&#x27;t desire.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> As a moisturizer, this BB cream is as good as most Neutrogena products! Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, leave an oily sheen (at least, no worse than is my natural oil level), or anything else I wouldn&#x27;t desire. As others have said, it is on the thick side, and this is especially true when you compare it to other BB creams like L&#x27;Oreal or Covergirl. This may be a bonus for some, as it seems to also be a more pigmented BB cream than many. However, it&#x27;s not my cup of tea. My biggest problem is the shade, it&#x27;s too dark for me! When I had just gotten back after spending everyday in the sun in the Jordan desert it was just about perfect, but without out that slight &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; it&#x27;s simply too dark for me. If your someone like me who has trouble finding drugstore brands light enough, try Covergirl or Revlon. Those are the best for me so far.</li>
    <li> the cream is ok but too light for me although I have very fair skin</li>
    <li> It has some shiny substance and feels powdery. Has opposite of moisturizing effect. I was trying to replace old Daily moisturizer (tinted). This is nothing like it. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am a boy and I have acne scars left over on my face and this helps not only provides sunscreen, but also helps cover and repair dark spots and scars. It is so subtle even a boy can wear it- that meaning that it&#x27;s not very thick and won&#x27;t make your complexion look \\&quot;flawless\\&quot;. I have super pale/fair skin with scarring, It helps even out skin and is very light weight. All in all, good if you want a little coverage and don&#x27;t want to look like you are caking on makeup.</li>
    <li> I always seem to go back to Neutrogena after trying the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; products.  Eventhough I&#x27;m 69, I like the BB creams to wear every day and Neutrogena is light enough for my taste but just enough coverage and moisture.  Goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> I still look around for other alternatives but this is the best BB cream for a reasonable price. I use it on top of moisturizer and it lasts through most of the day. I basically use it as a tinted moisturizer so for other purposes it may fair differently for someone else. But I switched from Clinique&#x27;s tinted moisturizer to using this and I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin and very even skin, I&#x27;ve never worn foundation or a lot of makeup in general but I like this for a little something to even out my skin tone and give my face a fresh healthy glow when I go out.</li>
    <li> The prolonged winter  air has wrecked havoc on my skin this time around, despite efforts to combat it. I have oily/combo skin and my skin tone was all uneven, oil of olay to keep it moisturized and sunblocked wasn&#x27;t helping the oil factor either, even in the teeniest amounts. I finally switched to a tea tree oil face wash, and soon after got this. A little dab will do you you, as they say, so this should last for a while. It felt like there was nothing on my skin after I put it on, and my skin tone looked so much better. I&#x27;m not a big make up person, but am hitting that age where  no make-up at all &#x3D; haggard, and think this is a happy compromise between nothing at all and having to do foundation and powder, while still protecting my pale skin from the sun. I want to note there is a scent to it, but it wasn&#x27;t overpowering and it didn&#x27;t bother me personally.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this really works... The smell is so terrible that I won&#x27;t be finding out. The visibly even moisturizer with SPF 30 does not have the same pungent smell so it must be the bb cream they have added. Yuck.</li>
    <li> For some reason this products causes my eyes to water all day long and burn. Also caused me to break out. I have used many types of BB Creme and makeup and have never found any I have had such a reaction to. This product also has a strong odor.</li>
    <li> very caking on my skin...even after i exfoliate and moisturize. It does not rub i well at all! very strange texture. Loreal BB cream much better!</li>
    <li> This has good coverage if you need it, but as with all BB creams, I find that I had to use a combination of fair-light and light-medium to get the right color, and I&#x27;m pretty fair.  A bit too much coverage for me, though. i think the Garnier version has a nicer texture and adds a nice sheen.</li>
    <li> I really love this BB cream.  Finally, Neutrogena came out with one and actually offered a shade light enough for my super-fair skin!  This has become my go-to product for this summer. It offers light concealment.  I read in another review that it had sparkle or shimmer and it does NOT.  It is also not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;However, I do find this product is thick and doesn&#x27;t absorb readily into my skin.  I recommend applying it either thinly (which seems to defeat the purpose of the SPF) or waiting about 10 min to let it fully absorb.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is actually showing improvement; I&#x27;m having fewer breakouts!&lt;br /&gt;I really like this stuff and I plan to keep it around--I just wish it were easier to find!</li>
    <li> After being impressed with other Neutrogena products, namely Rapid Wrinkle Repair, I expected better out of this product. Unfortunately, though, this BB cream falls short. The texture is very strange, does not blend well with either the fingers or a foundation brush, has lousy coverage, and an annoying mica &amp;#34;sparkle&amp;#34; which can only be corrected by the application of a matte powder. The product is utterly unusable. Better luck with Maybelline, Lumene, or even Garnier...</li>
    <li> visibly UN-even, what a waste of money this is the most unblendable bb cream I have ever used and it also smells awful like bug spray or something. I expected much better from Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little too oily for my naturally oily skin.</li>
    <li> I use this BB cream daily-it goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I bought this at Wal-Mart and tried it on my hand before I bought it like anything else. The garnier just had an orange tint and so did a couple of other brands. When I tested Neutrogena, I was very please how sheer it is but yet it covered the flaws very well. When I tried it on my face at home  it felt like it didn&#x27;t spread well enough but I found the perfect solution!! After putting a generous amount on I applied cetaphil sunscreen(purple and white bottle; $15) on my face afterwards to help it spread. It turned out beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I am naturally very pale with some red on my face. I am prone to breakouts, have oily yet dry skin. I am also on a budget and do not mind spending some good money on products but only if they work. I am just one of those people where 1 out of one million products will work for my skin. I don&#x27;t want to wear a ton of makeup and love the natural look. And this did just that.</li>
    <li> looks nice, and goes on well, but i cannot stand the fragrance, had to give it away</li>
    <li> A little dab will do! This is a very &amp;#34;luxurious&amp;#34; cream. I have used a few other brands that seemed watery. This bb cream is nice, not too thick, and not watery. It blends in with my really pale skin well. It gives me a nice little tint that I am probably the only person who notices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives great coverage! I have been surprised that I have to reach for the spot concealer less and less. Color corrector is not a necessity when using this.&lt;br /&gt;If you have pale skin, you probably know the pain of attempting to even out blemishes, and dark circles. This is by far the best bb cream for reducing the need for multiple layers of correction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the quality for the price!I believe Neutrogena is my new go to brand!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday.  It works very well as a sunblock and it smooths and evens out my face and provides great coverage that is light and feels good.</li>
    <li> This bb cream is very thick and has a strong odor, which is the reason I won&#x27;t buy it again. It covers well and I like the high SPF, as most BB creams are only a 15. I&#x27;m going back to Maybeline bb dream fresh, as I simply hate the fragrance added to this. When will companies realize that fragrance in face creams is nothing but an irritant to so many people?</li>
