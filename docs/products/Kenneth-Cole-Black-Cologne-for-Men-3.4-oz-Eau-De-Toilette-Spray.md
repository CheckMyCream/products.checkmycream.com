    <li> This has always been a favorite of mine! I melt at the scent when a man wears it! Shipping was on time! Very happy! Great price!</li>
    <li> Very good!!! very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> The shipping date said anywhere between Oct 4 and 22nd so I was a bit concerned&lt;br /&gt;I ended up getting it on the 7th and it was packaged really well&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it from them again for sure when this runs out</li>
    <li> The boyfriend loves Kenneth Cole Black and I got him the Vintage scent for Christmas (which smells absolutely delicious), but I know he likes this one too so I got it for his birthday. This smells really nice and I think he&#x27;ll like the option of going between the two.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, that is very hard to buy cologne for, and he absolutely loves the fragrance.  I would defiantly recommend this product to any man or woman that may be wanting to use it as a gift.</li>
    <li> this is one of my top fragrances i would purchase again i really enjoyed smelling it on my boyfriend amazing</li>
    <li> Great gift for son...Great Price...</li>
    <li> another product that is over hyped. scent doesnt last long at all!! money wasted as far as i am concerned.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my cousin,  he loved it. It really smelled nice and the bottle was bigger than I expected.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells yummy on my hubby</li>
    <li> For that seductive night out on the town dressed in black a real keeper</li>
    <li> Its a very good cologne with good frangrance. not to strong not to light. and it is VERY long lasting. Two or three sprays will get you through most days. I have had mine for about a month now and because you can see through the bottle you can see the amount of cologne in the bottle has hardley moved. It is highly recommended from me. God Bless</li>
    <li> Great smelling, but doesn&#x27;t last long ....sprays easily and great container, but would not recommend it because its lack of lasting power.</li>
    <li> Omg.. I love the smell of this! It&#x27;s my favorite cologne for my husband. I just want to walk around behind him all day!</li>

    <li> Excellent buy, perfect price, I love the scent. This is the perfect purchase for that guy who has good taste in mens cologne.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite cologne.  Subtle without a ton of musk, mild citrus, pine and caramel sweetness.  It&#x27;s gotten compliments from store clerks (chicks, not dudes :-)</li>
