      <li>I was also scratched by my cat right before bath</li>
      <li>Makes your skin feel so soft and clean afterwards!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love bentonite clay -  but will probably find a better price point than this brand.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!!!!  Wish someone would post exactly how to mix for external cleansing.  Have used to clean scalp and hair and as a facial mask.  The difference in my skin was noticeable immediately.  A week later, the pores that were visible are no longer as visible.  Be careful though, a little goes a long way.  I will be reordering this product.</li>
    <li> Thanks to other reviewers I decided to try this clay in my  detox program. Together with whole husk psyllium it saved my life this allergy season! I suffer from allergy,it is hay fever ,for more than 20 years.And it is first time I have dramatic improvement .We live at the farm and the house is surrounded by hay fields.I still have some symptoms here and there,but nothing to compare with previous years.I take 1 tsp.of clay in cup of water before I go to bed.And once a day I take 1Tbs of psyllium in a glass of water and it worked  like miracle for me! I am going  to research more about the healing properties of the Bentonite clay .But for now I sure would recommend it to those who is suffering from allergies!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it!!! This is my second order. And I will order thousand times more - at least. This stuff rocks!!! I also convinced my mom and dad to make and take their clay mixture on a daily basis. Great stuff!!! My son&#x27;s stubborn flu/cold like symptoms that persisted for months and even got worse after a series of antibiotics, disappeared within a week since he started taking this clay internally. Frankly, I was speechless. Also my candida is disappearing - slowly but surely. This product is a blessing to my family!!! I will spread the word for sure!</li>
    <li> High quality.  Does not clog my drain.  I add this clay to my Detox bath along with Epsom Salt, Apple Cider Vinegar, and Lavender Essential oil.</li>
    <li> Still waiting for the results I desire to come to fruition, but so far I feel great! I will add more later.</li>
    <li> I tried this at whole foods and liked the results, I used this mainly for my son he&#x27;s never been diagnosed with autism but I believe he could be slightly autistic. I have noticed a huge improvement. I also bought the pre-mixed liquid kind to drink. If you need better instructions on mixing or what have you... Just look on the living clay website. I used this on my teeth, made a mask and also put in my stomach which is my &amp;#34;problem area&amp;#34; after having 2 children I had a hard time losing the fat right there and I saw a huge improvement the next day! I used it like a clay mask but on my stomach. I&#x27;ve probably done everything you can do with this clay and liked all the results ! I will be buying again... And again !</li>
    <li> Excellent natural remedy for many ailments and for maintaining overall wellness.  This clay is for internal use.  Sodium bentonite clay powder is for external use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am old enough to remember women who had difficult pregnancies, eating clay to correct many problems related to their pregnancies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, remember the many home remedies my mother used to keep us well as I grew up in the late 40s - the 60s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had written them all down for use now.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Used it to make my homemade deodorant.  Turned out great and really works</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! When I read the back of the product label, it said,  &amp;#34;this product contains a substance known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.&amp;#34; Will be returning immediately. Not so good for you guys!</li>
    <li> I like this clay. It is a very fine powder and has a simple method of use that can be done by anyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because was doing a 21 day DETOX by D-HERB and  advised you to use the Bentonite clay in the bath . Your skin feels and looks great it also makes a wonderful facial mask too,</li>
    <li> Love this clay. I was pleasantly surprised to see the company is in Austin. I like keeping money in Texas.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Good externally and internally. I mix it and take it twice a day internally and I use it for a facial mask once a week.</li>
    <li> Love the living Clay - I am on my 5th container.  Originally purchases it from the Power Hour but it cost more there.</li>
    <li> Very pure stuff, does what it is supposed to!</li>
    <li> We bought this product due to intestinal irregularities and it did not perform as desired.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I came across this clay. I loved the purity of it and also looking at the video of the location of where this company gets the clay from. I will always order this as long as this company continues to process it. Will be ordering larger sizes on the next orders. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a friend and it is supposed to have amazing benefits. I have made it into a clay mask and love the feel of my skin afterwards.  I think I need to use it longer to get the benefits.</li>
    <li> I have never used the product before but was excited to give it a try! It was just like all the reviews said and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Seems like a really nice product!</li>
    <li> Love how my skin feels after using</li>
    <li> Works great we use it to drink and for the skin. My son&#x27;s Eczema was really bad one day and I made a bath for him and it worked great. Also our dog was sick and my daughter asked what can we do. I told her take her a bath with this bentonite clay and also to make her a dropper that same day she looked way better and the next day was running around..</li>
    <li> Works great for internal detox, face mask detox, etc.</li>
    <li> Excellently ground powder. I brush teeth with it, dip my deodorant in it before putting it on, Can only handle a sip per day of the clay water, *before breakfast then eat 2 hrs later) but I do love it. Hope to be able to tolerate more as I go. I bathe with a cheaper brand from ebay (one cup per bath to detox) Husband and niece just started taking for weight loss. 7 lbs in 2 wks for husband. Don&#x27;t know on niece yet. (for bath I use a screwdriver attachment for mixing up paint! Works great (in a 5 gal pail) Than add to the bath. Way easier than in the blender and less messy.!</li>
    <li> This product lowered the level of mercury in my autistic son.Believe it or not ,he is now a happy running around kid and very talkative too.  wow .Very happy with this product.After 3 weeks use of this product.</li>
    <li> I would recommend to someone else.  i enjoyed soaking in this product.  Well worth purchasing.  it was reasonable priced and came quickly.</li>
    <li> Used once so far.  Has strong drawing tightness when drying.&lt;br /&gt;Plan to do facial but have not done it yet.&lt;br /&gt;Used on my husband&#x27;s foot and ankle to help reduce edema.&lt;br /&gt;Increased his circulation but since we only tried this once it&lt;br /&gt;Did not immediately reduce the swelling.  Powder is very fine&lt;br /&gt;And mixes easily.  Will be using it more in the future.</li>
    <li> this is the best price i could find for calcium bentonite.  most bentonite clays are sodium based.  take a small amoiunt with food and it will absorbed the toxins, instead of the toxins being absorbed by your body.  it will not absorb the nutrients. i also use it in a paste to draw out deer ticks, and soothe bee stings.</li>
    <li> My wife used it and I was stunned to see her wrinkles vanish and pores close immediately after.</li>
    <li> I love this clay and will be reordering it.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I love how clean my skin feels after a bath with this stuff. It&#x27;s very soft and feels purified. I was also scratched by my cat right before bath and it inflamed a bit and was itchy but the bath took all inflammation away. I use it to detox all of us, including my 3yo son.  I also sneak in a small bite if this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t have any taste to it so easy to sample.</li>
    <li> I have used this four times for weekly facials and it feels wonderful after 15 minutes dry time I have tried to get my teen boy to try and he has refused so far I think this would really help clear up his acne will report later if he tries it and his outcome I would recommend its such a tiny amount needed for facial maybe size of dime with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is ok for internal use only select types of clay are rated that way I do not feel comfortable doing this nor do I think it necessary for me I believe you could also make toothpaste with this type of clay</li>
    <li> Very pure, soothing and immediately noticed impurities of metal extracting detoxing from body. Whole family has enjoy utilizing this product.</li>
    <li> I use this Calcium Bentonite Clay for treating my son&#x27;s eczema. It&#x27;s great. my son now less itchy and skin looks so much better. I also use for myself for detox. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! I have not used it internally yet. I&#x27;ve only used it as a mask so far.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Fast shipping. will buy again.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;tastes okay&lt;br /&gt;Makes my tea &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Makes my teeth feel good.&lt;br /&gt;Love brushing with this way better than traditional toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;As a mask on my nose helps prevent black heads. (my nose gets really oily)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Can be hard to mix</li>
    <li> I loved using this clay! I didn&#x27;t love the price. Thus 4 stars.</li>
    <li> My skin is sooooo soft after using this. Do not drink though!</li>
    <li> It is a great product, i used it as a mask and it gave me great results, i dont have acne but occationally i get some pimples and it helps with the redness and they fade easily, I also drink it every morning and i feel great. I read you can give it to your pet so i started pouring some on my dog&#x27;s food and i noticed improvement on his teeth and breath, he also seems more active and energized (he is 11 years old). Overall I like it and i will keep buying it. It has no flavor so drinking it is not bad at all.</li>
    <li> Externally this works nicely as an exfoliate. I hadn&#x27;t taken it many times as a liquid internally but started to feel stomach cramping a few days later. I was actually hospitalized with blockages in my small intestines. Is it related? Who knows. I just know I didn&#x27;t feel bad before taking this product, but after I was in terrible pain. It says it&#x27;s approved by the FDA, but I won&#x27;t drink it again.</li>
    <li> I made a paste and decided to try this on a small mast cell tumor my dog had on his back (about 6mm). The paste remained on it for 3-4 days before I washed it off.  The MCT was gone, I really didn&#x27;t think it was going to work I just tried it for the heck of it, but I can&#x27;t find the growth now. I think this stuff worked.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face and leaves a very smooth feeling. Leave a clean fresh look. Great way to maintain great skin. I make a mud like paste and allow it to dry before rinsing off.</li>
    <li> I am using this product in foot soaks, internally, and as a facial mask.  It really works in foot soaks!  After doing a foot soak the first few times, I had a nagging headache (which means it is working and drawing out the toxins from your body).  I got excited and overdid it though - doing a foot soak for an entire hour (instead of 30 minutes).  Afterwards I felt terrible and threw up once.  So don&#x27;t overdo the soaking, because this stuff is strong!  As far as facial masks, it is great!  Makes your skin feel so soft and clean afterwards!  Also, I mix it in a smoothie to take internally.  You can&#x27;t even taste it.</li>
    <li> I have just read the book \\&quot;Living Clay\\&quot; and assume that the author has some kind of relationship with the company of the same name that produces products with the name \\&quot;Living Clay.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clay might very well be all it is claimed to be.  However, my low rating is based on the company&#x27;s claims about superior standards and quality controls \\&quot;that are unmatched in the industry,\\&quot; which should convince us that their product is better than all the others.  Having read the book and looked at the Living Clay website carefully, I don&#x27;t find the information that would substantiate these claims.  I say this because...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The company does not give any information about the source of the clay (the location and mine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The company does not give any information about the mining or processing.  Even if the vein of clay is pristine, mines are dirty places, using heavy equipment to dig and transport the material.  Once the raw material reaches its destination it needs to be processed to insure purity if it is to be ingested by humans.  Bentonite clay is commonly mined for industrial uses which don&#x27;t require the safety and purity standards that a health product needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  I have read the three documents provided on the Living Clay website that are intended to demonstrate their standards of quality.  The first document is called Chemical Analysis.  It is dated from six years ago.  The document states that the testing was performed by \\&quot;International Oxidation Laboratories\\&quot; in Carson City, Nevada.  An internet search shows that the only single existing reference to this entity is on this Living Clay document.  The person who supposedly conducted the test is named \\&quot;Dr. MT Dodge\\&quot; (would that be as in Empty Dodge?), who also doesn&#x27;t appear to exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  The second document is the MSDS - Material Safety Data Sheet.  This is the briefest one I&#x27;ve ever seen and doesn&#x27;t contain most of the information usually appearing on an MSDS.  Maybe this is because the actual MSDS for this clay is produced by the mining company from which this clay is purchased.  That would be the MSDS to look at, except we don&#x27;t know the name or location of the mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  The third document provided is called Certificate of Analysis.  One would expect this type of testing to be done by an independent lab (one that actually exists).  But it is signed by Kyle Johnson who is the president of Living Clay, and who appears to be a rock musician, not a chemist.  And it begins by stating that this report \\&quot;is not intended as a substitute for strict quality control analysis by the purchaser of this product.\\&quot;  Translation:  if you really want to know what&#x27;s in this product, take it to a lab yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  Finally, both the book and the website make a big deal about this product being \\&quot;Calcium Bentonite Clay,\\&quot; and the book goes into a lengthy description of why most similar products are really something else (i.e., inferior).  However, looking at the first document - the Chemical Analysis from six years ago by Empty Dodge - the chemical composition was described as 45% silicon dioxide, 10.6% magnesium oxide, 8.9% calcium oxide, 6.9% aluminum oxide, plus eleven other minerals in smaller proportions.  Nothing wrong with this, I guess, except it might be more accurate to call it \\&quot;Silicon Bentonite Clay\\&quot; or \\&quot;Magnesium Bentonite Clay.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this clay might be all it is claimed to be, but when health claims are made for a product that is to be ingested and put on the skin, I think it is reasonable for people to expect verifiable information as to the source, as well as independent testing to verify composition and quality.  I&#x27;d be glad to raise my rating if the company will provide this data.this is because the actual MSDS for this clay is produced by the mining company from which this clay is purchased.

    <li> Yes like it and so far it is good</li>
    <li> I loved the clay. I mainly used it internally and for masks since I didn&#x27;t want to be wasteful with throwing cups of it in the bathwater since it is so expensive. I love that it isn&#x27;t dusty at all. However, the price is outrageous after I have researched and found much cheaper calcium clays online. However, this does work and makes you feel great.</li>
    <li> I have used it as a mask for me, as well as both of my kids. For my skin it has helped reduce the appearance of wrinkles as well as give me a &amp;#34;youthful glow.&amp;#34; Both kids ask for it now when they see a trouble area on their skin. I personally have used it internally; I am overall a healthy individual so there have not been MAJOR improvements but I feel energetic. I hope to use it in the bathtub soon but that will require a quiet night, which Living Clay cannot help with  :-)</li>
    <li> I use this to make homemade toothpaste. This clay, in conjunction with essential oils, coconut oil, baking soda, and mineral salt makes for one heck of an awesome tasting and feeling homemade toothpaste that clean better and is so much healthier than OTC toothpastes. Expensive, but worth it as far as quality goes.</li>
    <li> I have not taken this yet. I started a raw diet and not sure if I want to take it. I saw some videos on youtube and got concern about what I was seeing. I take medications and I plan to talk with my physician first. There should be a not sure star.</li>
    <li> I purchased and received promptly. Immediately began taking 1tsp in a bottle of purified water every morning on an empty stomach. My first two bottles were hard to stomach as i didn&#x27;t really like the taste. Knowing how beneficial this is for me, I continued to drink it first thing every morning. I have noticed an increase in my energy. A spotty itchy rash I had on my legs and forearms is completely gone. My skin is brighter and clearer. My waste elimination is more regular. I definitely see several benefits of taking the calcium bentonite clay internally. I will definitely purchase again and keep in my pantry.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves taking clay baths and it&#x27;s safe enough to ingest if she did accidentally.</li>
    <li> I love this clay. I sprinkle a little on my toothbrush on top of my toothpaste (Tom&#x27;s of Maine anti-cavity) &amp; brush my teeth with it. When I brush my teeth with it at night, my mouth still feels clean when I wake up! It also works great as a mask for my face, hands and feet, leaving them soft &amp; smooth, and it clears up blemishes on my face. I use a little it in my kale smoothies sometimes to help cleanse my liver. But if you eat or drink it and take meds, like I do, make sure you consume it at least 2 hours before and/or after taking any medications so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with them. Also great as a paste for treating bug bites and itchy rashes. This is a high quality clay powder that has many uses. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great clay I use  it externally and internally.  Seems to be a good quality. Clay.</li>
    <li> This clay has great drawing power. I love using it on my face-it has removed several flat warts---(Takes time to do this---put on overnight).  Itching stops almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also use it with my tooth powder---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mixes well.</li>
