<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My guy love this and I do to</li>
    <li> Smells great. Almost like a cool water copy. The only complaint is its not to strong. I spray about ten spurts on in the early morning and by early afternoon I cant smell it anymore. I also work outside and sweat a lot too.</li>
    <li> I really love the scent and have received two or three months ago , smell good  which is nice and i like the price too</li>
    <li> Great Cologne Like it a lot!</li>
    <li> I had the hardest time finding this full size bottle of Curve Wave in any department stores, even for retail price. I just received my order from Tuccini, and the packaging and product was just as expected. I was a bit hesitant with such a valuable price that the product may be a knock-off, but my hesitations are gone now.    I get so many compliments on this fragrance. I would describe the fragrance as a light smell that&#x27;s kind of summery. I use it year round, but it wears well whether you&#x27;re inside all day or outside. After a full day of wearing, it&#x27;s remnant smell is quite nice and doesn&#x27;t get muttled or leave your clothes smell like a cologne died.     People always think my cologne is a very high end brand, when in reality it&#x27;s a very affordable cologne. Much more affordable via Amazon!</li>
    <li> This came exactly as expected and is what I wanted very pleased</li>
    <li> this was great i tottaly expctd 2 get rippd off for lik a small version or atl3ast at 1.2 or sumtin but it was exactly wut thy stat&#x27;d n i was very impress&#x27;d also came with tha case show&#x27;n n tha pic... very pleasd will ordr more ccologn for sur... very good servic ...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s for my husband and he likes it! the scents stays long and its for young adult men between 20 - 35 ages.</li>
    <li> Smells great on my husband! Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I hate the produckt, when I got this product I was really excited, but when I used it, I hated it. It does not have any smell to it, looks like they filled the bottle with water. I wish I can return and get my money back. since I got it, I used it twice to see after a while it might have some smell to it. Please tell me if I can return this product I will really appreciate that.</li>
    <li> Please, Ladies... buy your man something amazing. Here&#x27;s my recommendation: http://goo.gl/rFo8uV</li>
    <li> All GooooooooooooD !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading so many positive reviews. But I realized the basic consumer theory \\&quot;you will always get what you pay for\\&quot; It&#x27;s not a bad cologne. Smells good, but cheap.</li>
    <li> As almost always prime shipping was on time, package was fine, and for the price how can you beat it! Has a strong smell like other curve fragrances with almost a hint of a cool water smell to it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear cologne much but this smells amazing it&#x27;s not strong really light when i first got it i fell in love with it right off back i would say buy it great price</li>
    <li> I love the different fragrances,it has a citrus and fresh tone to it. For the price you can not go wrong choosing this product, I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> To much alcohol smell</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Nice fresh smell. Much better price on Amazon, then anywhere else I&#x27;ve gotten it.</li>
    <li> Let me review this perfectly for you.  If you like the smell of the Curve Wave, then buy this product.  If you don&#x27;t know what it smells like, either go somewhere that you can sample it and see if you like it or get something else.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong by choosing this cologne, it is really nice, not overbearing, last awhile and you get recognized quickly, as you pass people in the market place, work or wherever..it gets you noticed, I highly suggest this cologne and I highly suggest getting it off Amazon, the price is unbeatable !!!</li>
    <li> Great for younger ppl. Nice citrus scent. Not overpowering, good for the price. I purchased from tuccini. Good service &amp; a authentic colone.</li>
    <li> I know this may sound odd, but I am female and I buy this for myself because the scent is that appealing to me.  I absolutely love it on guys and myself.  It has such a pleasantness about it. When I am around any friend, they usually question what I am wearing and ask to use it.(male and female.)  If you want something that just overall smells good, I would suggest this. I always look in stores around here, sometimes I get lucky and find it, but it is usually out of stock. Last time I saw it in stores was sometime last year. I will most definitely be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced and quick shipping. Great overall experience!By far my favorite scent and it is becoming increasingly difficult to find.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this product locally in any store and was hesitant that it would arrive and be a \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot;.  Instead it was just as advertised in the usual can and packaged the way I had always purchased it in stores.  The best part was that it was half the price so I bought two!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite Colognes out there and it is a great price. I personally would describe it as a fresh, more casual type of smell like a &amp;#34;going to the movies&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;hanging out with friends&amp;#34;  type of smell. It does not smell a like a formal and sophisticated smell, it is more youthful and energetic. It is hard to describe, but really awesome.</li>
    <li> When I smell the original Curve cologne, it reminds me of college and takes me back a number of years.  Would I wear it today - no, I personally wouldn&#x27;t as I find that unique, distinguishable \\&quot;Curve\\&quot; scent to be ideal for the under 25 crowd.     However, while searching for Men&#x27;s Cologne on Amazon, I stumbled upon this and figured, \\&quot;Hey, for this price, if I hate it, I&#x27;ll just give it away.\\&quot;      Well, Curve Wave did not disapppoint, and I will not be giving it to anyone!  It is an excellent \\&quot;next step\\&quot; for the mature Curve enthusiasts - fresh, clean.  It does not resemble the original Curve in scent, but rather, has a very \\&quot;summer-time\\&quot; scent that isn&#x27;t spicy or musky.      The item arrived quickly and I give both the vendor and the scent 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Ladys ask me when I go places.. Like my doctors or grocery shopping what kind of cologne do have on. When I say Curve they look at me googly eye looking and smile. Thin ask where did I buy it. And I tell them Amazon and if try to find it anywhere else they wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Really nice smell. The best Curve cologne in my opinion. Its fairly light, but not too light. Its fresh, but not over the top where you&#x27;ll smell like a bar of soap. Has a little sweetness to it, which is what I really like about it.</li>
    <li> For a cheap fragrance..its pretty good in comparison to the other high end... in a nut shell..if u not sure about purchasing fragrances online ..this is a safe bet.....but keep in mind these fragrances dont last long..I bought 6 fragraces. All different brands and not one of the lasted long</li>
    <li> I usually wear Aqua De Geo but got this because it was cheap and too good to pass up. I have to say the smell is a little more flowery than aqua de geo but overall a good smell. I get complements on it every once in a while from strangers. Overall a good buy.</li>
    <li> I believe reviews for Colognes need to be taken with caution since we all have a different sense of smell.  Having said that, I rated this 4 stars based on some comparisons.  My all time top favorite cologne is Cool Water by Davidoff.  For those of you who have smelled it know of the very &#x27;cool&#x27;, &#x27;refreshing&#x27;, &#x27;awakening&#x27; type smell that it has.  I have also tended to like the original Curve (Gold box) based on which I brought this Curve Wave.  After my initial use of Curve Wave, I can&#x27;t say I was disappointed but it was also not the wow factor or best cologne (as per my personal preference in smell).  Now I use it as my secondary cologne.  It was a good value at under $20 for 4.2 oz.  And if you&#x27;re wondering, I have not gotten any compliments (regarding my scent) in the almost 2 months I&#x27;ve been wearing Curve Wave, where as compliments were frequently received with Cool Water.</li>
    <li> I received a gift box of this product and other Curve colognes years ago as a teen, this was one of my favorites and also one that I got a lot of complements on. I&#x27;m now a young adult and am searching for nice colognes to wear on dates and to work so I purchased this. After years of not having it I was excited to try it again. I sprayed it on and was hit by the same aroma I used to smell as a teen, however as the day went on the scent faded away to nothing. Maybe I just got used to the smell, but when I was a teen I only had the sample bottle (about 1 oz) and I would apply the equivalent to one spray onto my neck and I could smell it and got compliments the entire day so I don&#x27;t believe that is it. This lasts about a hour. I usually work around women so I use them as tests (unknowingly lol) for my cologne, I also use Curve Connect and I get the most compliments on that throughout the entire day, but this...nothing. I don&#x27;t want to use Connect for work because to me the smell is too intimate and should only be used on dates so I&#x27;m searching for a nice cologne for work. Something a bit sweet but masculine would work for me. It smells nice to me and I know it smells good to women but I am disappointed on it&#x27;s poor duration. I will try two sprays next time and see if the duration and strength increases without over doing it. The smell is very nice and I do not want this to go to waste.</li>
    <li> I purchased a lot of colognes all at once on Amazon,&lt;br /&gt; so I have not used this product much, but it seems nice.&lt;br /&gt; Obviously it will not be as glamorous or have the long&lt;br /&gt;lasting smell as a really expensive cologne, but for the&lt;br /&gt; price this is still a dynamite deal!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this cologne I have the original curve Cologne I thought this would be different I really like the smell of it would buy this product again</li>
    <li> rapido y un producto de exelente calidad. era lo que buscaba y la empresa amazon me facilita esta y muchas compras mas de exelente calidad</li>
    <li> Great smell.  Very clean, fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this long time ago and it was supposed to arrive in a week, but they were not trackable online. And two weeks past now, I still don&#x27;t have it! I want my money back!</li>
    <li> I really love the scent and have received compliments from people I just met.  They made a point to tell me I smell good ..... so I&#x27;ve got that going for me, which is nice ..... :-)</li>
    <li> is a good perfume and I really liked the people that he loved Give the gift I recommend it to my family and friends</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  The description was accurate and I had received more than what I had expected.  The insert inside the can protects the cologne, which surprised me.  I have another type of curve and the can did not come with the insert to protect the cologne which is in a glass bottle.  I am very impressed, and would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to express how great this fragrance smells!!!  I purchased this cologne for my husband, and his first day wearing it, he received so much attention i had to tell him to stop wearing it. As a joke of course!</li>
    <li> Ordered and it was here in no time. 5 stars to the seller and the product. Great packaging also. Curve Wave is a very ocean powered scent with a well placed note of masculinity. Not musky at all with a citrusy, minty smell as well. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Great smelling cologne, very light and airy while still being masculine. Perfect everyday smell when you&#x27;re not doing anything particularly important. The smell doesn&#x27;t last extremely long, but you can always just spray more on. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff, therefore so do I</li>
    <li> Great Value! Great Price! I mix this sent with original curve sent, and I created a new sent that is unique to me alone!</li>
    <li> I really like it because it&#x27;s inexpensive and delivers what it promises. A great smooth aroma perfect for workplace or day activities. Also perfect for night... but not a special one. This is a perfume that you will use everyday or something like that.</li>
    <li> This smells so good! The price was amazing and my dad, husband, myself, and my mom all think that it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> it was a gift for a young boy and i felt the packaging was very nice and also the scent was very pleasant.</li>
    <li> This is a must have very nice and smooth not heavy. Last all day long. This is a must have to add to the cologne collection.</li>
    <li> Good price, but not crazy about the scent. Doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the original &amp;#34;Curve&amp;#34; scent.</li>
    <li> My son was so overjoyed he received this fragrance for Christmas. Please keep selling this product since we cannot find it in stores.</li>
    <li> Love most Curve colognes...this smells good and last almost all day...the only down side and the reason I don&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because the sprayer isn&#x27;t very good! Could definitely be stronger!</li>
    <li> This cologne was the balm meaning it was everything that I was anticipating, it had a soft scent that were not over bearing to the nose and received many compliments. Wonderful Item.</li>
    <li> Hard to find this version of curve at Ross where I usually buy outdated cologne for cheap..best value for cologne on market right now. Has clean and fresh smell!</li>
    <li> Do not buy! Fake! By the time I opened this garbage it was to late to return. Packaging and bottle seem authentic but the liquid is NOT curve wave! Buyer BEWARE!</li>
    <li> curve wave is very distinctive and light scented cologne... its not over powering like the curve crush... after a few squirts and minutes it mellows down..</li>
    <li> I bought this after smelling a sample. Nice for chilling or going out during the day.  Not formal enough for a date or dinner but get a lot of compliments on it when I do wear it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend. It was one of his favorite scents and one of mine on him!! It is not on over powering smell which I like because very strong smells trigger headaches for me and he can wear this scent with no adverse reaction on my end, its a win win!! It came packaged in the tine shown so it was extra protected during shipment. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son. Fragance is nice and light. Perfect for South Florida. He lives wearing it daily. I love the fresh,  sporty scent.</li>
    <li> This has a great scent, not overpowering yet very refreshing. The price is perfect without over-spending.  The Tin can be reused for things in your home, so it makes a great purchase. This scent has no age differentiation so teens to granps</li>
    <li> The expected. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Curve Wave by Liz Claiborne for Men, Cologne Spray, 4.2-Ounce is some good smelling cologne to have on, I like it</li>
    <li> if you are a fan of this brandname cologne, purchase it. Good price here, less than going to a department store.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy &amp;#34;wave&amp;#34; on Amazon but thought it would be better to sample the cologne first.  Found a sampler at a department store and tried it.  I recognized the scent but couldn&#x27;t put my finger on it.  When I got home it hit me...&amp;#34;Wave&amp;#34; smells identical to &amp;#34;Gucci Guilty&amp;#34;, which I own.  Sprayed some guilty on and confirmed it. I see a lot of complaints about how Curve doesn&#x27;t last very long and this is true.  The original Curve lasts maybe a few hours.  So, if you like &amp;#34;Wave&amp;#34; but want a cologne that lasts longer, buy &amp;#34;Guilty&amp;#34;.  If you like &amp;#34;Guilty&amp;#34; but don&#x27;t want to spend all the money on a bottle, buy &amp;#34;Wave&amp;#34; as a cheaper alternative.</li>
    <li> Nice cheap cologne.  You get a lot of cologne for the price. If you want a cheap cologne for everyday use I would recommend it. It lasts for about 4 hours though so I don&#x27;t recommend it for long term use.</li>
    <li> Great smelling cologne, came right on time. Can&#x27;t beat the price ! It&#x27;s a pretty big bottle. I get nice compliments, it just smells fresh, recommend it.</li>
    <li> Smell great!!! I love it!!! Im glad to the price was reasonably..n it also got delivered at a reasonable time.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cologne for my son because he doesn&#x27;t use the internet very often.  He loves this cologne and it has gotten very difficult to get.  Amazon was super and he had it in just a few days. Thanks for the fast service.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the real stuff,great price</li>
    <li> It is a good quality product with a good price, nice fargancias that remain on the skin for polongado time. Recomeindo buying this brand of perfumes.</li>
    <li> It is great. You get about 40$ discount from if you but it at a store l. It smells really great.</li>
    <li> Best curve cologne yet i&#x27;ve ordered yet I got most of them and I think wave takes top place buy it try it see if you like it</li>
    <li> Will always buy. Favourite scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered again, because I was getting low... And for some reason the new bottle and the scent are off. I have it next to an almost empty bottle and the scent is nowhere near the same. It smells watered down, extremely faint and just... Not curve wave.&lt;br /&gt;What happened here?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d guess as cologne scents go this is on the lighter side. Like an ocean scent with a bit of spice and citrus. I was looking for something subtle and this was it.</li>
    <li> Great smells great nd very inexpensive smells top excellent love it will Di business with u in the near future thank u again</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne, I bought 4 of them!!</li>
    <li> Disappointed.  The smell is not as manly as I expected.</li>
    <li> I have been using this now for about a month, and I love it. Sure it&#x27;s not overpowering, but do you really want to sit in your own cologne&#x27;s aroma all day? I think this is the perfect balance of strength. I may not smell it all day, but with some movement, you can definitely smell this. It kind of has a sweet flowery smell, and I love it. Will buy this again!</li>
    <li> GREAT VALUE FOR THE PRICE. PRICED HIGHER IN STORES.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know what is wrong with this cologne, well i guess as they say when you get a cheap thing be a able to get a cheap result. The scent doesn&#x27;t really last on me for more than 30 mins, don&#x27;t know if i have to just pour it on me or what. The scent is so nice but, my problem is the quality. i really like the curve.</li>
    <li> I will continue to buy this cologne!!!! end of story... My wife loves this cologne on me... I will wear nothing else... again... end of story</li>
    <li> Great product and Great service! I&#x27;m a happy Client!</li>
    <li> I just simply love this scent. It&#x27;s a Symphony of flavors playing all in sync.  If you close your eyes and just spray into the air, the aroma will pry open your senses into reality.  Its a flirty scent.  Many, many, compliments. Its a head turner, why even at the dry cleaner, the girl said my clothes smelled great.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed by this scent.</li>
    <li> Smells like your typical cheap cologne, I just bought it to have something cheapo for work because I have to be around a stinky co-worker that is a nasty smoker.  I hoped this would help keep me from stinking like an ashtray since anyone within 100 feet of a nasty smoker is going to stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne smells about the same as any other cheap sub-$25 cologne.  I would not buy it to wear out on a date but it is fine for something like what I am using it for.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> All I will say is &#x27;curvy ladies love a man who wears curve&#x27; . Best cologne out there!</li>
    <li> Nice sporty fragrance cologne for men.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband since I made him promise that we would give each other inexpensive gifts for our wedding anniversary. I was a little nervous when I gave it to him since I didn&#x27;t know how it smelled like and based my decision on user reviews. I admit I was disappointed when I sprayed it on my hand; you&#x27;ll probably feel the same way. But don&#x27;t let it fool you -- most colognes and perfumes don&#x27;t smell super nice a few seconds after application. Let it stay for a few minutes, let it dry out, and you&#x27;ll know what it really smells like. I love the scent on my husband and it lasts until late at night even if he only sprays it on in  the morning. A really good buy especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This was the first cologne I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve always loved the smell of it. Today, it reminds me of my freshmen year in college, as that it when I first started using it, to which I got a lot of positive comments on how good I smelled. Back then, I naively put too much on, and people could literally smell where I have been and tracked me down, &amp;#34;Hey! Brian was here!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this smell, but I can&#x27;t exactly describe it. It&#x27;s a very fresh smell, almost citrusy, but at the same time it&#x27;s not. It just smells clean.</li>
    <li> This review is for the cost/performance ratio. It&#x27;s an amazing fresh smelling cologne. It does smell a bit like the ocean so if you&#x27;re into a summer feel, spray this sucker! I paid $13 and it&#x27;s honestly my favorite &amp;#34;casual&amp;#34; cologne.</li>
    <li> Wow! I smell good.!! This this refreshing and aquatic, a day time cologne, definitely. I am sure to order another one i run out.</li>
    <li> you products are good and it cme in time. i really appreciate it</li>
    <li> excellent product recommend</li>
    <li> This is a wonderfully crisp, light fragrance which is as good as any that costs three times as much. I bought it without actually testing it based on the mix of mint, juniper, musk  and liquid oxygen mentioned. I am by no means disappointed. It actually reminds me of Halston&#x27;s Unbound, which is one of my all time favorite scents.</li>
    <li> First of all, I am a big fan of Curve colognes. I&#x27;ve tried Curve Chill and Curve Wave and I truly love them both. Curve Wave has a really nice scent and is not too overpowering. I love it tons and will be definitely buying more when my current ones are finished.</li>
    <li> Great price and smells good....its perfect.  I didnt wanna spend much and I wanted a simple scent, so this worked</li>
    <li> los felicitos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;me llego&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;en poco tiempo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;los felicitos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amigo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jose coronado&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;desde&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;venezuela&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mas fino&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok ...&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for male family members...&lt;br /&gt;bought it 1.5 yrs ago, my dad loved it and he&#x27;s been using it since then...it&#x27;s still half full!!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves wearing this cologne..It smells really good on him. Its light and not musky..He wears it year round.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as an add on to another gift for my hubby and we both agree that this is one of Curves best scents as we both use the fragrance line. Its not a heavy scent and it can withstand a days work. Very refreshing to smell on a man.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of it and it happens to be my boyfriends favorite cologne. A great product that I can only find now on this web site.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if i got a defective cologne, if there is such a thing but at a first spray its nice smelling, then in a couple seconds the nice scent goes away like a fake cologne....I&#x27;m sorry but i&#x27;m not buying anymore of that scent! I made a mistake!</li>
    <li> I was worried I would not like this but I bought it for my husband anyway. I have to say it smells great. Almost like Coolwater for women but with a manly twist. Fresh and Clean. I couldn&#x27;t stop sniffing my husband, he likes it too but mostly because I keep sniffing him!</li>
    <li> Pretty good cologne for the price. Smells similar to GIO. Overall, I would recommend this product based on the quality vs price.</li>
    <li> its kind of afternoon type of fragrance don&#x27;t last more than few hrs&lt;br /&gt;nothing wrong with seller its the product but for this price its worth it</li>
    <li> Good but the cap broke off second day I used it.</li>
    <li> Very good perfume for everyday work!!! It is soft and fresh!!! Like it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for conservative men! Good for the price!</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this cologne and it&#x27;s a great price. I constantly am getting complimented for this one.</li>
    <li> For the price we paid this was a steal! My husband loves this cologne and I do too! Its not a heavy scent. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is one of those products you buy without expecting too much, but when you finally got the product you just say WOW. I like this cologne, its sexy. I am not sure if this is a morning or evening cologne, i wear them anyway.</li>
    <li> I got it for a gift I love hope he love smell so good to I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gifts for family members and friends so I cannot rate this product at this time.</li>
    <li> i have been a fan of the Curve series of colognes and saw this on Amazon&#x27;s site. im very pleased.</li>
    <li> Excellent price with a very good scent! Good sized bottle and seems to last a fair amount of time. You can&#x27;t go wrong if you like this smell.</li>
    <li> The scent is a little too light. I guess it&#x27;s suitable for office professionals who don&#x27;t want a fragrance that&#x27;s too overpowering.</li>
    <li> Always what I want and at an unbelievable price</li>
    <li> it is a great perfume, but no perfect. I am so happy with all experience, buying and the final product, I recommend 100%.</li>
    <li> Great fast service. I was very pleased with the product and the price I paid. I will do business with this company again.</li>
    <li> me encanto todo lo que espere de la compra, excelente envió y muy rápida la entrega, excelente trabajo, muchas gracias</li>
    <li> really loved the the original curve and stuck with it for a while then i came across this and have found a new great fragrance to add to my collection.</li>
    <li> Came to my campus EXTREMELY fast, 100% REAL Curve cologne, no fake!</li>
    <li> Smells good,last long</li>
    <li> EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BEFORE BUYING.  It may look like the real deal, but this is junk. It&#x27;s a knock off, and so are all the others that you see that are really cheap. Not only is it a knock off, the smell literally, is gone in less than 20-30 minutes, so unless you want to walk around with the bottle to smell good, don&#x27;t waste your money.... I wasted it for you.</li>
    <li> bought for a gift for Christmas but son has used this before. All his friends take the bottle and spray on them.</li>
    <li> The product smells great, but will last about 15-20 minutes.  After a couple of hours, I could not tell I ever put this on.  This was not worth buying in my opinion.  If you are about to get your groove on, you better move fast.  You gotz 15 to 20 minutes before the party is over.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice clean smell, it&#x27;s fresh and a little ocean like. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments since I got it about a month ago the scent fades pretty quickly so resprays throughout the day are necessary but after it dries it smells so good!</li>
    <li> the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Came on time I never use this before but I love the smell tho I just wish I pick sum else tho I love Cologne</li>
    <li> Ordered the wrong stuff but it all worked out because my other son loved it.  Stuff smells great!  Amazon makes shopping so easy!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the Curve Wave spray on my face very good product.</li>
    <li> By far one of my favorites!!</li>
    <li> My niece told me ha has a refreshing feeling every time he uses this curve wave. He has lots of compliments of this.</li>
    <li> after 10 minutes the smell is gone ... no more curve for me .. don&#x27;t waste your money it&#x27;s not worth it!!</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance and would recommend it to others who are thinking of purchasing t for themselves or gift.</li>
    <li> this is a great fragrence. my fiance likes the original curve but this one smells amazing!! I would deff buy again!</li>
    <li> I bought some for my girl. She loved it. You really cant go wrong with any curve products. Would recommend. All my girlfriends love it.  Stay up player. ......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a Curve man now that I know where to get it for a fair price I can stay away from the crowded mall.</li>
    <li> Curve Wave is really hard to find in stores. All of the other curve products are available.  So it was super nice to find Wave and at such a great price.</li>
    <li> The cologne is not the best that curve has created, but with that said this cologne has a very strong scent at first but within 3 to 4 hours into the day it is gone.</li>
    <li> This smells so good, its not over powering but strong enough to last a few hours. I wish it lasted a little longer into the day but if you are carrying this with you in a backpack or something then twice a day if you want to smell great all day. Its such a wonderful smell and probably one of the best Curves out right now.</li>
    <li> I took a chance and ordered this product having never before seen/smelled/heard of it. This cologne is a little to light, airy and fruity for my liking. BUT I have received some compliments after wearing it so I will continue to do so instead of returning or throwing it away.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moHBGG1WS3BKG5]]I guess the video says it all. So far seems to be well worth the price. I guess time will tell. I am happy with the product and with the price i paid for it. It was delivered 3 days before the expected time. Packaging was excellent. The container it comes is very nice looking to put on your vanity in the bathroom. There is nothing about the container or the bottle that is cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Spelt so amazing! I would so recommend buying this for a present for dad, hunsband, or boyfriend. Was worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend buying this product.  It you enjoy clean, soapy smelling fragrances, it is perfect.  My fiance loves it and I cannot stop sniffing him.  He also surfs so the name/bottle design was also a good fit.  I am usually quite picky when it comes to all fragrances.  Will definitely reorder this one when he runs out.</li>
    <li> my nephrew love this too.</li>
    <li> Great smell , fresh n clean</li>
    <li> This product was delivered on time and seems to be the original. I bought a curve where i live and the scent just burns my nostrils. This curve does not and it smells great. I would only like for the scent to last the entire day when i use it. Very timely delivered. All hail.</li>
    <li> The smell is strong, lasting and exceptional. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to guys.</li>
    <li> Favorite cologne...brings me back to my yoot.  Couldn&#x27;t find it for years. Boy did I miss it! Glad to have it back in my life.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay smell.  It doesn&#x27;t last long either.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my cousin because he needed to smell good in the office but he&#x27;s used it all up so second time I&#x27;m buying.</li>
    <li> Getting lots of compliments on this unique cologne and the price was very reasonable! I will definitely get this again.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and at the price it cant be beat! Curve wave has always been my go to scent during the regular week so my more expensive scents last way longer</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a teenager he loved it, is not to strong or light is just right.</li>
    <li> Smells good for a while but the sprayer on bottle came cracked so it squirts doesn&#x27;t spray.....</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my man and I was hoping I chose right based on looking at the reviews and let me tell you; my man smells so yummy, manly and fresh. I love it and he loves it too. It lasts very long, price is cheap and the shipping came right on time. Another plus is he&#x27;s been using it everyday since received it in Feb and the bottle is still very full, a little goes a long way. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t beleive I missed this when it first came out.  I really like colognes with a fresh citrus-like scent and this is fits right in that category.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen it too many places and it must be that not too many others have either because I&#x27;ve been getting asked what I&#x27;m wearing a lot when I have this on.  It gives you that fresh from the shower smell when you first put it on and relaxes into a light cirtus-like scent that lasts.  If you like the majority of the Curve line you&#x27;ll love this one. It is different without being a totally off the wall new scent.</li>
    <li> This is the only place I can find my husbands cologne. He loves it and I love the price. I will keep buying them from here.</li>
    <li> Almost all Curves fragrances are tops in my book, In my mind you cant go wrong with any of the Curves fragrances.  So I ecided to go with the Wave formula, Im anxious to smell it asap.</li>
    <li> The Curve Wave by Liz Claiborne smells very nice. However, The Fragrance is not very strong; this is the only thing that i don&#x27;t like about it. It is a good purchase overall for the price.</li>
    <li> Smells good. I got some compliments from the ladies. But its so so for me. I am going to try another version of this soon.</li>
    <li> great cologne i love it smells great</li>
    <li> This is an awesome buy, and chicks love it. :) ;)i went out to the club last night and did not go home alone that night :P</li>
    <li> I bought this as an alternative to my other more expensive cologne, and have worn it every day since I received it.  I love the scent.  It lasts all day and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I have yet to get any compliments with this cologne.  Thats probably because the scent is gone after 20 minutes of spraying it on, or so they tell me.  It does smell good though.  It comes with a little clip that goes in the gap where the top is pressed down, my guess is to keep it from spraying itself?</li>
    <li> This curve colony smells good , but it only lasts about an hour , I bought curve chill and curve wave and  It is a waste of money,&lt;br /&gt;curve is useless</li>
    <li> Smells great! Huge bottle for way less than the big box stores. Lasted me over a year and plenty of compliments about smelling great.</li>
</ol>
