      <li>but I&#x27;ve kind of got this method where you put your finger on the push up part in the tube and then push the stick against your skin</li>

      <li>The pack of 4 is awesome too because you can keep them in different places, they&#x27;re always handy.</li>

      <li>The product itself is okay.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t received this item yet, but I am VERY familiar w it.</li>
      <li>I bought these because I really liked Cococare&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Super Rich Cream, and I wanted a lip balm to match.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use in the tube.</li>
      <li>so it is easy to move inside the tube</li>
      <li>it is really easy.</li>
      <li>Does have a strong coco smell.</li>
      <li>The products are fine no problems</li>
      <li>and it works fine.</li>
      <li>Description was accurate.  </li>
      <li>chemical and additive free, just the way I like it.</li>
      <li>Fantastic price.</li>
      <li>But in function, they are fantastic.</li>
      <li>You need to wait a bit for your body heat to warm it to apply, but so far it seems like an okay lip balm.</li>
      <li>Warms quickly on skin contact and thereafter applies easily.  </li>
      <li>This product is good for scars and on dark spots, but you must use consistently for good results.  </li>
      <li>But it does smell like rich chocolate.</li>
      <li>Great product and delivered as expected.  </li>
      <li>Good enough.    </li>
      <li>Simple product, good quality, arrived on time.</li>
      <li>product worked great once I managed to get it from vendor other than Pharma______  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly well packed .</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly into skin so doesn&#x27;t stain clothes etc.  </li>
      <li>Quick stick moisturizer.</li>
      <li>but it makes them SUPER portable.</li>
      <li>Works on a pregnant belly.</li>
      <li>Would be better if access to it was via twist tube (like chapstick), but it&#x27;s more like a push pop and harder to keep in the tube.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I was looking for and it came right on time</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and moisturizes my dry cracked heels.</li>
      <li>thank you for fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>removes surgical glue well;-)</li>
      <li>Love the 100% cocoa butter sticks from Cococare, will definitely order from them again.</li>
      <li>So, I like this smaller diameter better.  </li>
      <li>Makes skin soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Pure cocoa butter with no additives</li>
      <li>Vendor says that they aren&#x27;t responsible for my environment.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>And Shipping was fast, too.</li>
      <li>Over time it has really cleared up scaly patches I&#x27;ve had forEVER</li>
      <li>Just hold or circulate/rub it on any part of ur body 4 a few seconds,&amp; it&#x27;ll melt on its own.  </li>
      <li>I am currently pregnant with my second baby, and the first prenatal product I had my husband order was these cocoa butter sticks.</li>
      <li>This is a good product, not available anymore in my local drugstore.  </li>
      <li>these fancy little sticks are way better.</li>
      <li>: Actually, this is pretty inadequate as a lip balm.</li>
      <li>Apparently they aren&#x27;t responsible for how they ship it</li>
      <li>The plastic tube makes it possible to apply exactly where you want it and not get it all over your hands.  </li>
      <li>I used this stick with my first pregnancy back in 2011.</li>
      <li>You manually push up a dry stick from the bottom with your thumb, take the plug off the top, and (while keeping your thumb at the bottom to keep the stick raised) apply while the dry crumbly stick shakes around in the tube.</li>
      <li>Works on new dings and old scars.</li>
      <li>And old time remedy that still holds up against time.</li>
      <li>I believe this is a result of using this natural cocoa butter product.</li>
      <li>I use it to with coconut oil for really soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>apply 2 areas since ur natural body heat will melt it as u apply.</li>
      <li>The cocoa butter stick does solve that problem -- I was hoping it&#x27;d taste like white chocolate, but it actually doesn&#x27;t have much of a taste at all.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and moisturizes my dry cracked heels. Item came as described and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I use it multiple times a day and just can&#x27;t get enough. Over time it has really cleared up scaly patches I&#x27;ve had forEVER that store bought stuff could not fix. NOTHING to QUEEN HELENE- these fancy little sticks are way better. Different style of application but it makes them SUPER portable. The pack of 4 is awesome too because you can keep them in different places, they&#x27;re always handy. They are solid yes but the heat from your skin will melt it on contact so spreading it is really easy. It smells like heaven in a tube too holy cow. I&#x27;m very impressed and will continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;You do have to be careful not to let the stick fall out of the tube but I&#x27;ve kind of got this method where you put your finger on the push up part in the tube and then push the stick against your skin and it works fine. If it falls out it is not a big deal to put back either.</li>
    <li> Had a dark line on my head from a durag. After a week of using this the  line became very faint. Going to continue using. Another week &amp; a half &amp; it should be all gone</li>
    <li> Great product. Fantastic price. Ordered twice more</li>
    <li> Nice cocoa butter, but it is cheaply assembled...the &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; is not solidly attached to the base of the plastic that holds it...thus, one must be careful not to invert the dispenser (otherwise it will fall out)!</li>
    <li> My skin used to be dry and flaky.  Now it is moist and I smell like a cookie.</li>
    <li> Works wonders for your skin.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product and will purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> The products are fine no problems</li>
    <li> Quick stick moisturizer. I love it. I wish the end would twist up instead of just being a pushup but I still love it and would order it again.</li>
    <li> The hair coloring I use for my mustache and goatee irritates my skin, so I need something to reduce the irritation. I have no irritation when I remember to apply this cocoa butter. In fact, It also protects against sun burn!</li>
    <li> Granddaughter is allergic to mosquitoes &amp; this works extremely well on any little scars she may develop. Product arrived melted but i knew that would happen. Put it in the fridge &amp; all was well. Love the 100% cocoa butter sticks from Cococare, will definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> Works on a pregnant belly. Would be better if access to it was via twist tube (like chapstick), but it&#x27;s more like a push pop and harder to keep in the tube.</li>
    <li> Love it ! Works on new dings and old scars. And old time remedy that still holds up against time.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! I used this stick with my first pregnancy back in 2011. I was hooked! I am currently pregnant with my second baby, and the first prenatal product I had my husband order was these cocoa butter sticks. With a growing belly your skin stretches and putting on lotion 3 times a day can seem daunting. This stick is a great alternative to doing that. Anytime my growing belly itches ,I use the stick instead of scratching . It provides instant relief and prevents dreaded stretchmarks! It works amazing! This 4 pack of product is a wonderful value.</li>
    <li> Pure cocoa butter with no additives, it&#x27;s great for moisturizng skin.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, always use this for hypoallergenic skin!</li>
    <li> They work and that is all I care about. You can also melt them to make your own deodorant! The reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star is because they smell like baking cocoa(which makes sense since its 100% cocoa!) And I am not a big fan of that smell. But in function, they are fantastic. I use them on my winter-dry hands (it gets very cold where I live) and its almost like a miracle balm.</li>
    <li> love this product. I use it to with coconut oil for really soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;This product is hard, so I melt/mix in the coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;for a creamy mix.</li>
    <li> Arrived melted as others have commented.  Vendor says that they aren&#x27;t responsible for my environment.  I picked ut up as soon as it was delivered.  Apparently they aren&#x27;t responsible for how they ship it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product worked great once I managed to get it from vendor other than Pharma______  removes surgical glue well;-)</li>
    <li> Great! Simple product, good quality, arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Have not been able to find in in stores in my area.  Great for cracked hands</li>
    <li> Nice, Orderless and pleasant. Used on my scar from hip surgery.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was looking for and it came right on time 😆</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, like chap-stick for your hands.....great price too!</li>
    <li> It was melted outside of the tubes and I had to send it back. I was very disappointed because this is the genuine article and you can&#x27;t find this just anywhere especially at this price.</li>
    <li> Great product and delivered as expected.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Just  like when I was growing up. The priduct is great. Nothing has changed. Started using as soon as it arrived and see changes already.</li>
    <li> Good for preventing scars from being as bad when healing wounds. Also helps when treating burns or sunburn.</li>
    <li> Love this product. chemical and additive free, just the way I like it.</li>
    <li> Use to prevent stretch marks during pregnancy. It&#x27;s easy to use in the tube. Does have a strong coco smell. But works well</li>
    <li> A great product. Use it in morning to freshen up and moisturize. Arrived quickly well packed .</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t received this item yet, but I am VERY familiar w it. U won&#x27;t regret purchasing it. &amp; u don&#x27;t need 2 heat this up 2 apply 2 areas since ur natural body heat will melt it as u apply.Just hold or circulate/rub it on any part of ur body 4 a few seconds,&amp; it&#x27;ll melt on its own.  Awesome right?! I had 2 get this 4 pack!</li>
    <li> The product is wonderful!  Using it for 20-year-old son who burned arm and wrist and hates greasy feeling on his hands.  The plastic tube makes it possible to apply exactly where you want it and not get it all over your hands.  He IS USING THIS multiple times during the day as Dr. prescribed.  THAT is why I ordered this version in the tube.  Perfect!  Warms quickly on skin contact and thereafter applies easily.  Product is smaller in diameter than tube so it is easy to move inside the tube (actually sometimes slides all he way out.)  But you don&#x27;t have to warm it before you can get it up to apply it.  So, I like this smaller diameter better.  The coco butter is excellent.  Absorbs quickly into skin so doesn&#x27;t stain clothes etc.  Makes skin soft and smooth.  Description was accurate.  And Shipping was fast, too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  I don&#x27;t wear make-up, and not to brag, but I am 50+ years old and not a single facial wrinkle.  I believe this is a result of using this natural cocoa butter product.</li>
    <li> always good in the winter months</li>
    <li> Excellent product. timely arrival.  Excellent follow up.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, not available anymore in my local drugstore.  This price on Amazon is a good price.  This product is good for scars and on dark spots, but you must use consistently for good results.  Non sticky, not greasy, blends well.  Will purchase again.  Thank you,</li>
    <li> I bought these because I really liked Cococare&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Super Rich Cream, and I wanted a lip balm to match. Just be aware that the dispenser has the worst design I&#x27;ve ever laid hands on. You manually push up a dry stick from the bottom with your thumb, take the plug off the top, and (while keeping your thumb at the bottom to keep the stick raised) apply while the dry crumbly stick shakes around in the tube. I don&#x27;t know why they can&#x27;t do a twist-to-raise dispenser like most brands of chapstick, but what they have is pretty annoying.    The product itself is okay. You need to wait a bit for your body heat to warm it to apply, but so far it seems like an okay lip balm. I got this because I was tired of getting an awful taste in my mouth whenever I happened to get some ChapStick in my mouth. The cocoa butter stick does solve that problem -- I was hoping it&#x27;d taste like white chocolate, but it actually doesn&#x27;t have much of a taste at all. But it does smell like rich chocolate. Good enough.    EDIT (a month later): Actually, this is pretty inadequate as a lip balm. It doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of keeping your lips from chapping. Don&#x27;t buy this as a lip balm.</li>
    <li> Excellent price and quantity for product!</li>
    <li> Just as I remeber!  Very nice moisturizing sticks that are easily portable!  I keep one in my purse all the time now.  Great for a touch up of lotion as needed.  And did I mention that you get four at an amazingly low cost?  You can have one on hand everywhere, or share, if you can part with one!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for it. Crumbly and messy. Ended up pitching it.</li>
    <li> I love coca butter and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, well amazon had it!! Thank you.</li>
    <li> As describe, great buy!</li>
    <li> thank you for fast shipping! Mom was happy with her order!</li>
    <li> Just as expected and in timely manner. Thanks. Will definitely order again</li>
