      <li>Great polish, great color.</li>
      <li>The color in the picture matches pretty perfectly to what you get in the mail.</li>
      <li>It covers nicely and evenly</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t use any top coat over it, unless I wipe the brush between each nail.</li>
      <li>I love this color.</li>
      <li>All in all, Sally Hansen is my favorite line of nail</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this nail polish.  </li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I love the Insta-Dri line.</li>
      <li>I used this on my toenails, and the color is fabulous!</li>
      <li>This brand is pretty good too.</li>
      <li>This is a very bright red.</li>
      <li>great color, drys super fast</li>
      <li>I use this for my last-minute-running-out-the-door manicure, always good with a classic color.</li>
      <li>On the plus side: Great color, a very rich red.</li>
      <li>Beautiful red</li>
      <li>Going on it was fine, lasted a couple days without chipping, but the nightmare happenned when I tried to take it off.</li>
      <li>Nice color, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>This line is great for giving a younger child a manicure because it drys before they lose patients.</li>
      <li>This requires a special lamp.  </li>
      <li>The colors are bold, fun, and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>If you want a poppin&#x27; red, this is a good choice</li>
      <li>This is the polish I grab when I need to quickly fix my nails and get out the door.</li>
      <li>Also the colors are very pretty</li>
      <li>I not only love this color but it came super quick.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a true red and this is more of a brick color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not orange-y, not too bright, not too dark.</li>
      <li>It absolutely takes more than one coat to look decent, and if you&#x27;ve wiped too much off of the brush in an attempt to prevent drips and over application, then it starts clumping and gumming up while you&#x27;re trying to apply it.</li>
      <li>I use this right before bed (20 minutes or so) and apply a quick dry top coat.</li>
      <li>It does as advertised, dries very fast.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite brand of quick dry.</li>
      <li>Love the true-red color and the fact that it does dry quickly.</li>
      <li>I love the colors that this line of nail polish comes in, however, that only aids to my frustations with trying to use it.</li>
      <li>I love the shade of red but it formed some bubbles when I applied it.  </li>
      <li>This color red is very reminiscent of the skin of the Red Delicious apple.</li>
      <li>This nail polish certainly dries fast.</li>
      <li>Fast Dry,&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
      <li>and yes it dries fast.</li>
      <li>this polish works very well with the nail stamping kits.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Good when you need to polish-and-run, but not a great option for a flawless, lasting manicure.</li>
      <li>Also, the red color seeps onto and dyed my clear top coat polish brush.</li>
      <li>My daughter was looking for just the right color of red and found it in this one.</li>
      <li>The color is very bright, but like all other polishes, it takes about three hours before it is completely dry and not still messy.  </li>
      <li>The color isn&#x27;t transparent like many other brands seem to be, so one or two coats is usually enough.</li>
      <li>(I hope someone fixed that!)  </li>
      <li>My final and equally irritating issue with this line of polish is, if you were able to get it all on there and looking half decent, dont expect to enjoy your nail color for very long as the polish very quickly (within a day to my experience) begins to severly chip off.</li>
      <li>review was written by my 15 year old daughter)</li>
      <li>The Insta-dri collection does dry very fast, but this color is extra fast because you can get away with just one coat.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it as I&#x27;m always buying it in different colors!</li>
      <li>The red is a classic red.</li>
      <li>and I was surprised to see how fast it actually does dry!</li>
      <li>It is way too big, or shaped differently, but it gets completely overloaded with polish even though I wipe off the excess every time.</li>
      <li>I barely get my nail half-done before I see a huge wave of color flowing down and making a mess.</li>

<li> I barely get my nail half-done before I see a huge wave of color flowing down and making a mess.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t last long, though.</li>
<li> The red bled all over my fingernails and fingertips staining them all pink.</li>
<li> But when I began taking it off, I noticed that it takes a very long time for all of the nail color to come off.</li>
<li> With three young kids I get very little time to let my polish dry.  </li>
<li> I usually prefer a red with a blue undertone vs. an orange undertone.</li>
<li> I like to buy it in black and white for nail stamping.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s impossible to be precise, particularly if you have small nail beds.</li>
<li> Almost an apple red, but a little lighter shade I think.</li>
<li> : I have it in red and a few pinks.  </li>
<li> All I got was a friggin empty box.</li>
<li> One coat is all it takes if you are careful with the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Well, the product is as expected.</li>
<li> Its very watery, which makes it incredibly messy and difficult to apply as constant care needs to be taken that a big drip doesn&#x27;t sneak down the opposite side of the brush stemming all the way down from the stick.</li>
<li> Careful!  </li>
<li> It will stain your nails and cuticles (a top coat used as a base coat will prevent staining just as well.)&lt;br</li>
<li> another reviewer mentioned, the brush is fairly big, and the consistency of the paint is thick.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty unhappy with the way Amazon handled this one.</li>
<li> In a few minutes it dries to the touch.  </li>
<li> I do not recommend this nail polish, I have several bottles of it now because I was a fool and kept thinking that a different color might not be so annoying, however, every single bottle of insta dri</li>
<li> And as another reviewer noted, you cannot use typical clear topcoats with this polish---it smears the finish and transfers color horribly into your clear polish bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> (That wasn&#x27;t in the small print,</li>
<li> So if you are going to use this nail color, I would suggest using a base coat first, then applying this</li>
<li> Reds are hard to pick out online.</li>
<li> the negative side: This shade bleeds like a stuck pig!</li>
<li> Whoops - another unhappy surprise.  </li>
<li> /&gt;However: I hate the size of the brush in this bottle.</li>
<li> VERY disappointed .  :-(</li>
<li> Worst nail polish ever.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Worst nail polish ever. Going on it was fine, lasted a couple days without chipping, but the nightmare happenned when I tried to take it off. The red bled all over my fingernails and fingertips staining them all pink. After several attempts to take it off with acetone they are still stained!</li>
    <li> Love the true-red color and the fact that it does dry quickly. This is the polish I grab when I need to quickly fix my nails and get out the door. One coat is all it takes if you are careful with the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However: I hate the size of the brush in this bottle. It is way too big, or shaped differently, but it gets completely overloaded with polish even though I wipe off the excess every time. I barely get my nail half-done before I see a huge wave of color flowing down and making a mess. It&#x27;s impossible to be precise, particularly if you have small nail beds. And as another reviewer noted, you cannot use typical clear topcoats with this polish---it smears the finish and transfers color horribly into your clear polish bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good when you need to polish-and-run, but not a great option for a flawless, lasting manicure.</li>
    <li> This nail polish certainly dries fast. It doesn&#x27;t last long, though. I used it for a pedicure, and with two coats, it was chipping off within two days.</li>
    <li> All I got was a friggin empty box. VERY disappointed .  :-(</li>
    <li> My daughter was looking for just the right color of red and found it in this one.She is very pleased!</li>
    <li> I love the shade of red but it formed some bubbles when I applied it.  Then it leaves some traces when my nails rub against some papers.</li>
    <li> This is a very red nail color, that is why I bought it. It does as advertised, dries very fast. But when I began taking it off, I noticed that it takes a very long time for all of the nail color to come off. In addition to that, I noticed that this nail polish does stain the nails. I have never had a nail polish stain my nails. So if you are going to use this nail color, I would suggest using a base coat first, then applying this so your nails will not stain like mine did. But if they do, just file and buff them. Next time I will using a bse coat to avoid the extra filing and buffing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars.</li>
    <li> The color isn&#x27;t transparent like many other brands seem to be, so one or two coats is usually enough. The color is very bright, but like all other polishes, it takes about three hours before it is completely dry and not still messy.  All in all, Sally Hansen is my favorite line of nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This review was written by my 15 year old daughter)</li>
    <li> I used this on my toenails, and the color is fabulous! This color red is very reminiscent of the skin of the Red Delicious apple. It&#x27;s not orange-y, not too bright, not too dark. The red is a classic red. It looks great against my olive-yellow-tan complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer mentioned, the brush is fairly big, and the consistency of the paint is thick. It may be because I haven&#x27;t done my nails in awhile, but it felt like I was putting globs of paint on my nails (even after letting some off the brush). Also, the red color seeps onto and dyed my clear top coat polish brush.</li>
    <li> I love the Insta-Dri line. The colors are bold, fun, and easy to apply. I was looking for a true red and this is more of a brick color. It will be great for winter.</li>
    <li> This is a very bright red. Reds are hard to pick out online. I usually prefer a red with a blue undertone vs. an orange undertone. This one is sorta both. If you want a poppin&#x27; red, this is a good choice and yes it dries fast.</li>
    <li> Love this. One coat opaque. Lasts well</li>
    <li> Loved the color!!  Beautiful red</li>
    <li> Fast Dry,&lt;br /&gt;Most beatiful red color,  stayed for 8 days intact in my nails!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recomend to everyone who likes red.</li>
    <li> Nice color, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Great polish, great color. The color in the picture matches pretty perfectly to what you get in the mail. Almost an apple red, but a little lighter shade I think. I love it.</li>
    <li> I not only love this color but it came super quick. It covers nicely and evenly and I was surprised to see how fast it actually does dry! I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Careful!  This requires a special lamp.  At the time I ordered, that wasn&#x27;t specified.  (I hope someone fixed that!)  When I discovered that requirement, I tried to return it.  Whoops - another unhappy surprise.  It&#x27;s not returnable.  (That wasn&#x27;t in the small print, either).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty unhappy with the way Amazon handled this one.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish.  With three young kids I get very little time to let my polish dry.  I use this right before bed (20 minutes or so) and apply a quick dry top coat. In a few minutes it dries to the touch.  I go to sleep and it doesn&#x27;t smudge.  It will last about 5 days to start looking like it needs to be replaced (I do lots of dishes and housework).  Also the colors are very pretty: I have it in red and a few pinks.  I do some nail stamping and this polish works very well with the nail stamping kits.  I like to buy it in black and white for nail stamping.  I highly recommend it as I&#x27;m always buying it in different colors!</li>
    <li> I love this color. This brand is pretty good too.</li>
    <li> On the plus side: Great color, a very rich red. The Insta-dri collection does dry very fast, but this color is extra fast because you can get away with just one coat. I use this for my last-minute-running-out-the-door manicure, always good with a classic color. This line is great for giving a younger child a manicure because it drys before they lose patients. The brush is perfect and makes application a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side: This shade bleeds like a stuck pig! I can&#x27;t use any top coat over it, unless I wipe the brush between each nail. Also, best results are achieved with a base coat! It will stain your nails and cuticles (a top coat used as a base coat will prevent staining just as well.)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it a 3.5 if I could.</li>
    <li> great color, drys super fast</li>
    <li> Well, the product is as expected.</li>
    <li> I love the colors that this line of nail polish comes in, however, that only aids to my frustations with trying to use it.

    <li> This is my favorite brand of quick dry.</li>
    <li> Bought for my mother, she loves it</li>
