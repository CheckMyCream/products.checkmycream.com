<li> with the gelish, the colors are not true to what they show it to be!</li>
<li> The color is not what it shows it to be, it came out a very light pinkish beige, very disappointed, but I also find this problem in the nail&lt;br /&gt;saloons</li>
<li> Oily looking once my nails dried will never buy again!!</li>
<li> Horrible worst gel I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>

    <li> Love the color! Shipped VERY quickly</li>
    <li> Great color! You can wear it alone or top it off with Izzy Wizzy Let&#x27;s Get Busy if you want to add some sparkle.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous color.  I have been looking for a neutral pink for a while and this is perfect.  It you are looking for a color that is understated for work, this is it.</li>
    <li> Nice color when you need to be on the neutral side</li>
    <li> Beautiful nude tone, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this color.&lt;br /&gt;YOU NEED THIS:D</li>
    <li> Good quality nail polish that lasts longer than my OPI colors.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as deep of a color as the image shows. Long lasting gel nail polish. Stays one for two weeks with even a super active lifestyle.</li>
    <li> Gelish is the best gel polish that I have tried so far.  Other&#x27;s include Sephora&#x27;s brand and some brand I was able to buy in the drug store.  Gelish goes on the best and seems to last longest for me.</li>
    <li> Love this brand! Better than the more expensive ones. It is also cheaper to buy the larger bottle than the minis at Sallys.</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR OFFICE WORK, BANK WORK, CUZ IS DISCRETE  AND ELEGANCE. MAKE FEELS BEAUTIFUL BUT ABOVE ALL MY NAILS PROTECTS GELISH</li>
    <li> Loved it so much my sister wanted it</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is a problem with all gelish colors, but My Nightly craving changed color from the cute mauvy pink that it is in the bottle to a dark grayish taupe in two days. I like both colors, especially the final taupe so I still should have given it five stars. But my opi gel polishes do not change color, and I&#x27;m scared to buy more gelish because I would hate to have this happen again and not like the finished product.</li>
    <li> Horrible worst gel I&#x27;ve ever used!!! Oily looking once my nails dried will never buy again!!</li>
    <li> The polish is great although the color is not as pictured.  It is more of a nude color when applied but I still like it.</li>
    <li> The most hideous color in reality....looks so cheap....almost clown like. Just gross. Nothing like what the bottle looks like. .</li>
    <li> color is a great fall color</li>
    <li> The color is not what it shows it to be, it came out a very light pinkish beige, very disappointed, but I also find this problem in the nail&lt;br /&gt;saloons with the gelish, the colors are not true to what they show it to be!</li>
    <li> love this color. I&#x27;ve only worn it once but its wonderful and lasts, awesome buy.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color! I absolutely loved it!</li>
    <li> Great color for me. I know I&#x27;ll wear it alot.</li>
    <li> I thought this color would have more purple in it, but to me it looks nude. It&#x27;s ok, just nothing fantastic.</li>
