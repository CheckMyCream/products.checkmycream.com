### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>came in time and I was very happy with my order</li>
      <li>but it still works perfectly.</li>
      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>the results weren&#x27;t great</li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>and it still works great.  </li>
      <li>Im a happy lady! :)</li>
      <li>I ordered a $60 one off amazon that had mostly good reviews so hopefully that will end my straightener shopping.</li>
      <li>I love this iron!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Other than that it is amazing.</li>
      <li>Nice.</li>
      <li>This is so smooth and leave my hair looking nice and sleek.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery and worked great.</li>
      <li>Chi flat irons used to be the best.</li>
      <li>Best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
      <li>I loved it since the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>I had heard great things about them and had to finally get one of my own.</li>
      <li>Bought it for my wife, she said it was everything that she expected was one of the best product she&#x27;s ever owned.</li>
      <li>It warms up very quickly and does not burn her hair whatsoever like some others do.</li>
      <li>but you have to have your reciept and the original box.</li>
      <li>My first straightener I bought last me 6 years and still worked great until my kids broke it... will never buy another straightener if it&#x27;s not a chi</li>
      <li>Still heats up quickly.  </li>
      <li>I tested a few sections of my hair and it was just as good as my original CHI!</li>
      <li>Apparently the cheap straighteners have gotten a lot better over the years.</li>
      <li>but I was able to take it back to the store and they exchanged it for free.</li>
      <li>Well worth the cost</li>
      <li>You also run the risk of melting the cord if you put it away too hot.</li>
      <li>Also, the on/off signal bottom popped off after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;Had to contact Chi about the item.</li>
      <li>but I like to take care of things that take care of me back :)</li>
      <li>The first one I had literally changed my hair to hair</li>
      <li>Other than the one time I had to take my chi in and exchange it, mine has worked perfectly over the past 6+ years.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t justify trying/spending the money on a new brand without trying it first.</li>
      <li>I could deal with and gave me so much needed confidence in high school.</li>
      <li>I was lucky a friend of mine told me because I definitely would have thrown away the box.</li>
      <li>So pissed, my new chi is like the crappy $30 straightens that don&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I only gave it 3 stars because  the first one was 5 stars but the new one is 2 stars.</li>
      <li>This is the second one she&#x27;s had the first one lasted over eight years</li>
      <li>but even if I had paid full price, I would have thought it was money well spent.</li>
      <li>It made my hair smooth, shiny, and less frizzy over time.</li>
      <li>and it was just like my old chi,  </li>
      <li>A little pricey but worth it!</li>
      <li>Overall, if you&#x27;re in the market for a new flat iron I would definitely recommend investing in a chi!</li>

<li> I was a little skeptical when reading all these reviews, however, when I received my CHI</li>
<li> I had cheaper products before and it would leave my hair frizzy and broken.  </li>
<li> or you will make a very sad, curly cord that gets in your way.</li>
<li> Disappointed.</li>
<li> Also all the chis have an annoying cord that always tangles and twists.</li>

    <li> Nice. Well worth the cost</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter in law.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a chi flat iron since 2008. I had heard great things about them and had to finally get one of my own. I loved it since the first time I used it. I did have a problem a few months after I bought it. It stopped working but I was able to take it back to the store and they exchanged it for free. Chi&#x27;s have a lifetime warrenty but you have to have your reciept and the original box. At least that was the policy when I bought mine, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s changed since then. I was lucky a friend of mine told me because I definitely would have thrown away the box. Other than the one time I had to take my chi in and exchange it, mine has worked perfectly over the past 6+ years. I didn&#x27;t even expect it to last this long. I don&#x27;t use it everyday but I&#x27;m not gentle with it by any means, I&#x27;ve dropped it countless times over the years. The last time I dropped it one of the plates came a little loose but it still works perfectly. I&#x27;ve recently thought about getting a new flat iron but can&#x27;t justify it as long as my other one still works. But when I do end up replacing it, I will probably get another chi. I&#x27;ve thought about getting other brands but I can&#x27;t justify trying/spending the money on a new brand without trying it first. I&#x27;m almost positive I would be disappointed and end up with a chi in the end. The one issue I had with my chi was that my hair sometimes got caught in one of the seams. Usually just flipping it over solved the problem. I do wish it had an automatic shutoff feature. I have accidentally left it on once or twice. Overall, if you&#x27;re in the market for a new flat iron I would definitely recommend investing in a chi!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and worked great.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. It warms up very quickly and does not burn her hair whatsoever like some others do.</li>
    <li> My only issue with the Chi is that my friends and family keep stealing it!!! This is my third purchase in under 2 years because friends borrowed it and &amp;#34;lost it&amp;#34; yeah right...or sister begs me to keep it and I take pity. I think Chi should add an optional tracker so I can just locate it if someone decides to &amp;#34;lose&amp;#34; it again. Kinda like that app for finding your Iphone Ya know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it is amazing. Be careful wrapping the cord around the body of the iron when you are done though or you will make a very sad, curly cord that gets in your way. You also run the risk of melting the cord if you put it away too hot. I avoid this by keeping a small plastic  cord winder with my chi. Anal, yes but I like to take care of things that take care of me back :)</li>
    <li> My first straightener I bought last me 6 years and still worked great until my kids broke it... will never buy another straightener if it&#x27;s not a chi</li>
    <li> My Chi stopped working after 6 weeks.  Amazon is NOT an authorized retailer for Chi so the warranty doesn&#x27;t apply.  I&#x27;m out $135 for a crappy counterfeit product.  I&#x27;ll be VERY careful about buying on Amazon again....</li>
    <li> Chi flat irons used to be the best. The last two I have purchased have stopped working completely within a few months, this one less than 2 months from purchase and after only being used a few times.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when reading all these reviews, however, when I received my CHI I tested a few sections of my hair and it was just as good as my original CHI! A little pricey but worth it! It also came with warranty paper work. Im a happy lady! :)</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this flat iron from here but I wanted to write a review so this is just on the product, not the seller or customer service.  I love this iron!  I am going on 5 years now and it still works great.  Still heats up quickly.  It has a little squeak now when it opens and closes but who the heck cares about that.  I had cheaper products before and it would leave my hair frizzy and broken.  This is so smooth and leave my hair looking nice and sleek.  It was on sale and I had some credit at the place I bought it but even if I had paid full price, I would have thought it was money well spent.</li>
    <li> Does not heat up as much as my last chi. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> came in time and I was very happy with my order</li>
    <li> One of the blades seems scratched and it pulls the hair. Also, the on/off signal bottom popped off after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;Had to contact Chi about the item. They requested I send it back at my cost for the postage.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I received the chi ceramic flat iron straightner on time.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have been using CHI for over 6 years. Only complaint I have is that when the straightner drops slightly (for example, if it is standing upright and it leans over and falls) it can break easily.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife, she said it was everything that she expected was one of the best product she&#x27;s ever owned. This is the second one she&#x27;s had the first one lasted over eight years and she would never buy anything else.</li>
    <li> I use to swear by these straighteners, I would tell anyone and everyone about them. The first one I had literally changed my hair to hair I could deal with and gave me so much needed confidence in high school. I have unbelievably curly frizzy messy hair.  It made my hair smooth, shiny, and less frizzy over time. Then I joined the military and you would not believe how damaging this is for your hair. My chi broke so I bought another one and the results weren&#x27;t great but I thought my hair was just damaged. Then I went home and used my sisters $30 straightener and it was just like my old chi,  Apparently the cheap straighteners have gotten a lot better over the years. So pissed, my new chi is like the crappy $30 straightens that don&#x27;t work. I only gave it 3 stars because  the first one was 5 stars but the new one is 2 stars. Also all the chis have an annoying cord that always tangles and twists. I ordered a $60 one off amazon that had mostly good reviews so hopefully that will end my straightener shopping.</li>
