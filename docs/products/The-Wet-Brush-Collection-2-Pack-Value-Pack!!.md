<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> 5 stars, we love them</li>
    <li> Best brush we have ever used! No tears when brushing my child&#x27;s really long hair wet or dry!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. No more tears</li>
    <li> These brushes work great! My daughter has very, very thick hair. Brushes break all the time with her hair, but these have worked well getting all the tangles out and are durable.</li>
    <li> Gets the tangles out of wet hair.</li>
    <li> Wet brushes are a MUST to have in a female competitive swimmer&#x27;s swim bag. It&#x27;s amazing how with a little leave in conditioner, the wet brush slides right through wet hair.</li>
    <li> A must have for long hair! I was ready to cut my hair short because it was so tiring trying to brush my hair. I rarely get tangles now. Such a delight!!!</li>
    <li> My 5 year old love it so much</li>
    <li> Amazing how these brushes make my daughter&#x27;s hair shine!</li>
    <li> They are uniquely effective at brushing tangles and smoothing the ends.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome! The get knots out of wet hair with ease.</li>
    <li> This works awesome! No more knots and tangles.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love these! The only brushes we use for my 2 daughters. Brush goes through easily to get out knots wihout causing pain.</li>
    <li> Best brush de-tangler.... no more tears!</li>
    <li> Great for long wet hair ... That&#x27;s the point, right?!!?</li>
    <li> Love them, the brush went right through my hair and I usually spend time with getting the tangles out love it...</li>
    <li> My youngest as super thick hair &amp; thus brush doesn&#x27;t hurt her &amp; is great to blow dry your. Hair straight.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I understand at all why these brushes work different than other brushes. But to say that TANGLES are the bane of my existence wouldn&#x27;t be a stretch. My little girl has LONG thick CURLY hair! It has reached the point where its down past her shoulder blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo &amp; conditioner all help but no matter what use a comb / brush / whatever to get tangles out was always filled with tears and pleading and was a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found out about wet brush from a hair  dresser and ordered immediately because well, got nothing to loose can&#x27;t possibly be any worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again no idea why this brush works do dang well but it most certainly does. It gets the tangles out and with minimal pulling and snagging. Only on the roughest of tangles does my daughter complain now. Thats usually after several days without proper hair care. And even on the worst of days its 10 times better than using a comb or any other brush we have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If tangles are a pain in your life, I suggest you buy this brush you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it had a bigger handle option, thats why it gets 4 stars. The handle is just not very big and gets uncomfortable to hold and work for any length of time. They need another brush with a nice rounded handle to easily and firmly grip.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be, some of the other reviews said they had super thick curly hair and this brush was awesome.  My hair is long and medium thick, and I definitely had to pay special attention to make sure I was getting all the way through my hair.  I quit using this after a couple of weeks and went back to my old brush.</li>
    <li> AMAZING brush!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed...</li>
    <li> This brush has completely changed my life.  And I&#x27;m not exaggerating. When my sister bragged about how wonderful her new yellow brush was, I was skeptical. She would use it straight out of the shower, and although this seemed strange, and she perpetually had straight, untangled hair thereafter, I chalked it up to the fact that she had better beauty patterns and habits than I did. I didn&#x27;t know that it truly was attributed to this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After yanking SO much of my hair out, dreading using a comb through my straight but very prone to matts hair, and letting my hair go to unreclaimable lengths, I FINALLY broke down and bought one at Target (sorry Amazon).  Using it the first time, I was astonished. Straight out of the shower, no conditioner, only slight pulling was felt through my tangled hair, and with only a few passes, my hair went straight through the brush like it had been buttered!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  It truly does detangle as it brushes, even through difficult hair. My hair is so much healthier now that I am not breaking and ripping through it upon detangling after the shower!  AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been so wonderful that I use it every day on my very sensitive 2 year old&#x27;s head!  There&#x27;s no screaming or fits involved in post-bath detangling, no detangling product (a money savings for us young moms with littles!), and a happy kiddo afterwards with nice, detangled hair! She loves it so much that I have gotten the Squirt for her very own for Christmas!  It&#x27;s halfway selfish though since I always have to chase after my own pink brush and would love for her to have her own in her own space to get mine back in an accessible place :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended countless people to this brush, especially moms, and they have gotten back to me about how much they love it. I just want The Wet Brush to know how thankful I am for the product that they have produced. It really has helped me out as a busy mom of young&#x27;ins to not let my hair go to matts!</li>
    <li> They REALLY work! They detangle wet hair without hurting or pulling out chunks of hair!! I bought 8 more for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> As a family we all love wet brushes as they are the best for tangles</li>
    <li> Worked great! I have two kids one with really thick hair and the other with thin easily tangled hair and they work great on both kids, a lot less hassle.</li>
    <li> These are not legitimate Wet Brushes.  They are knock-offs called The &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; Brush and they smell like the tire section of an automotive store.  I contacted the actual Wet Brush site and was told that their product has no odor and they do not sell their product through Amazon or Amazon&#x27;s third-party sellers.</li>
    <li> We love these brushes!!! I bought them for all my daughters and their daughters too. They are the best!</li>
    <li> Super gentle, great for long hair and tender toddler heads!</li>
    <li> I own an authentic real &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; - THIS IS NOT THE REAL WET BRUSH.  I ordered this set of two for my daughter - and they are NOT GENUINE Wet Brushes.  Packaging was different, markings on brush were slightly different and once I opened the package the brushes had an awful chemical/plastic smell.  I decided to try the brush anyway, but it did not feel the same on my hair as a real &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34;.  I compared my real Wet Brush with these two I received and this set is definitely not the same - just a cheap knock off.  In addition to these being portrayed as something they are not, I ordered a pink and blue brush and received two blue brushes.</li>
    <li> Great for Tangles! Love it.</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes for people of all ages. But especially for girls with long hair. My husband can finally brush my daughters very long hair without any tears. They are one of the best products I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> As a dad with a 5 yr old little girl, I am here to tell you these brushes changed my life! I hate tangled hair and this brush glides through the most tangled heads with ease. I wish I could give it 10 stars.</li>
    <li> My husband and I LOVE these brushes...great wet hair detanglers!</li>
    <li> Great brushes for long hair.  Minimizes hair loss from tangles.  Keep one at home and one in my swim bag.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush for my own hair when it&#x27;s wet and LOVE it for my Coton de Tulears&#x27; hair to detangle just after bathing them and when blow-drying-- my only complaint would be that the flat handle is awkward to use.. not ergonomic.. I&#x27;d much rather have a rounded handle for an easier grip! That&#x27;s the reason I only give it 4 stars instead of 5..</li>
    <li> This brush is magic! It really does go right through wet hair without ripping and pulling. Two pack was great so that my step daughter and I could each have our own brush and our own color, each was in its own original package which was nice, but you might find a better deal at tjmaxx or Ross, just FYI.</li>
    <li> My stylist used this. Now I have very thick hair so it was t the best for me but my sister and mom love it. I don&#x27;t hear the hair breaking so much as my sister brushes her hair now!</li>
    <li> I do not think these brushes were worth the money.  They do not assist in tangles at all and takes double the time to brush without much ease at all.</li>
    <li> BEST BRUSHES EVER!!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife heard about these from her sister. She wanted to try it so I purchased the set. It was a good price bargain. She loves them and now they travel everywhere she goes. She now reccommends this brush to anyone who will listen. That says it all !</li>
    <li> These have been amazing brushes!!!  I&amp;#34;m planning on ordering more!!!</li>
    <li> If you have long thin hard to comb out hair or just want to be easy on your hair, this is the brush for you. It&#x27;s so gentle and feels like a scalp massage .  I LOVE them and will never use anything else. I have one from a salon that was more $ and I have this one.  This brush does the same thing (feels the same) for less money.  There is a rubbery smell at first but it easily washes out. All the bristles are the same length.  Can be used on wet or dry hair. Great price too!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> Great brush! Great for wet hair of course!</li>
    <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t as strong as the previous single black wet brush that I bought.</li>
    <li> These brushes are fabulous at brushing through wet hair! Love them and will always own one. I keep one for the gym too!</li>
    <li> These are great!  My kids love these.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Works great on my daughter&#x27;s curly and tangle prone hair.</li>
    <li> Best solution for curly hair. My daughter has curly hair and would hate to have her hair combed. We always do it wet and this is certainly helpful.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite hairbrushes of all time</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who is mixed race and who has very curly unruly hair. If i use this dry it doesn&#x27;t work as well as when i use it wet. I usually go and condition my daughters hair and then use the wet brush to go through all of her snarls. She still cries (she&#x27;s two) when i comb her hair, but i think that&#x27;s due to not finding the right conditioner for my daughters hair. When i use it on my hair i really like it. I&#x27;m going to purchase another brush just for myself. The bristles are softer and thinner than regular brushes and it&#x27;s soft on my scalp. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair either like other brushes do and i lose less hair with this brush as well. I did lose a few bristles from this brush (that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not giving it five stars) while i was brushing my daughters hair dry. Other than that i am happy i purchased this brush</li>
    <li> Best brushes for young girls! Long hair? No problem!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my 6 yo daughter and my girlfriend who has long hair below her waist.  The product does what it says and is made of sturdy materials</li>
    <li> Seriously a life saver! Now brushing hair isn&#x27;t a fight everyday! These brushes have changed my life!</li>
    <li> Not as amazing as the reviews claim, but less tears is a good things.  It straightens out my daughter&#x27;s curls.</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely useless if your hair is thick like mine and my daughters. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Warning - these are not true wet brushes. After 3 weeks, the bristles started sinking in on both of them (blue and pink in photo). It&#x27;s hard to photograph the bristles pushed in but I did my best so you won&#x27;t fall for it.  I went to a local beauty supply store and purchased one (the purple one in the picture). The difference is that it has an engraved Wet Brush logo on the handle in addition to the black printed Wet brush-pro. Super disappointing especially when the seller uses a name like Wet Brush as the seller name. Don&#x27;t get tricked like I did! :( Too bad I ordered some as gifts before I realized they were knock-offs!</li>
    <li> This brush works very well on wet and dry hair. We liked it so much, we bought another one!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m throwing out all my other brushes! I have a very tender head and hate combing. This rakes through my hair with a lot more ease without ripping through it. Everyone should try these.</li>
    <li> great value we love these brushs wont use any other</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s have fine, easily tangled straight hair and hair brushing has become an issue. A friend brought this with her daughter for the weekend and we were hooked. My 2yo and 4yo can use the brush themselves, I use it on my fine, thick hair, and the last time I had my hair cut the hairdresser also use this brand. The tangles get out without a lot of pain and pulling.</li>
    <li> best brush ever does not pull out hair at all</li>
    <li> Love using this brush in the shower on my intense,  thick,  curly hair!  The brush Detangles my hair with no pain applied to my sculp at all! Definitely worth buying.</li>
    <li> These brushes are cute and work well for the most part. However if you have a tough tangle to comb out the bristle pad pops out! That annoyance is why I gave it 3 stars. I do not feel I would rebuy this product when it is time to get new brushes.</li>
    <li> PAID $13.59  Still impressing after 9 months... These are our &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; brushes to use on my 2 1/2 old and 4 1/2 old. Won&#x27;t say its pull proof - but limits the pulls and screams considerably. Excellent both on wet hair or dry hair.  I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Wet brushes are amazing! Once you start using them you will not be able to use a regular brush again!</li>
    <li> These are amazing! Don&#x27;t pull at all on wet hair.</li>
    <li> best brushes ever!!!!  I am now realizing at 34 that a brush is key to healthy hair, and this one is so helpful!  I am replacing the brush often, like every 2 months, because all the gunk build up in it that I can&#x27;t wash out of the brush.  Each new brush is amazing.</li>
    <li> These are great, and this is the best price I&#x27;ve seen. My daughter has two and I ordered 4 for a friend...</li>
    <li> Bought this on a recommendation from my sister; my wife and daughter love these with or without wet hair. It is soft on the scalp. Even for me, I use it for my beard from time to time, but any brush could do that :). However it is soft on my face and for the price, its a great buy.</li>
    <li> Takes the struggle out of hair brushing with my daughter.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my nieces after I started using one myself. The best brush I have found for using on wet, long hair.</li>
    <li> comb through my daughter&#x27;s hair without her screaming at me. Second pair I have bought. My daughter is 5 but I have been using these since she was 3. Life savor.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know how i ever had another brush before this one. it detangels my hair in a breeze without wrapping or pulling out any of my hair. i don&#x27;t know how i ever had anything else before this! i recommend this brush to anyone! especially if you have long hair</li>
    <li> Get them as a go-to stocking stuffer for my wife. She loves them.</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes. So many products are hyped up, then I try them and they are terrible. I bought my daughter one of these a year or so ago for her long hair. She loved it and how much easier it was to brush her hair every day. The few times I used hers I was also impressed.&lt;br /&gt;She lost her original brush so I picked up this 2 pack so we would have a spare. My former brush is no longer used and this is my go to for my wavy hair now and I have never been happier. This is the best brush I have ever owned and at this point it cannot be beat. We brought it to a water park last week and another girl used it on wet chlorine filled hair and immediately asked where I got the brush because it was so good! I hope we do not lose these new brushes, but if we do, I will be ordering a replacement the same day.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE these brushes.  A must have for anyone with a young daughter.  They allow hair brushing without the &amp;#34;you&#x27;re hurting me!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> So happy someone turned us on to these brushes, it&#x27;s the only one my daughter will use and it does such an amazing job getting out tangles.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work any different than a regular brush but does make my hair full of static. not happy at all, not sure who is writing all these great reviews!!!!!</li>
    <li> Nearly painless brushing for very tangled hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used these on dry hair and they are so good at detangling!</li>
    <li> My daughter has super curly hair with tons of knots.  I wet her hair and brush with this brush, pain is a lot less</li>
    <li> You will never go back to another brush. I bought this, one for me one for my boyfriend (who has longer hair than me) and he was skeptical at first. It&#x27;s just another brush you know? No it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as it should. Especially for my thick knotty hair.&lt;br /&gt;Get it if you have really thick hair. Actually, get it if you have any kind of hair.</li>
    <li> The perfect hair brush.  It is amazing what it can do for wet hair pain free!</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair, save your money!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this brush on my long tangled highlighted hair and I immediately asked her about it because it was so gentle yet so effective. This &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34; effortlessly glides through the toughest tangles with ease and most importantly without any discomfort. I was very surprised at how amazing these brushes are because it looks like a regular brush that ive used for years but it works completely different on tangles. I have no idea how it works but it does and it leaves me wishing I would have had one a very long time ago. I think this would be great for kids hair because it gets out the tangles with ease and without any pain.</li>
    <li> One of the best hairbrushes I have every bought.  I spend a lot of time in the pool and these brushes have made it so much easier to brush my hair after!</li>
    <li> These are the only brushes my girls will use.  It seems to do a good job of getting the tangles out of their hair.</li>
    <li> Theses brushes are life changing! I have a lot of hair and its very thick. Best way to get the knots of your hair when its wet without any breakage! I use this on wet and dry hair but don&#x27;t dry your hair with this brush! The heat from the blow dryer with warp the bristles! Also great for kids! I gave one to my niece because she has long hair and is always in and out of the pool and her hair gets so knotty and instead of loading her hair up with conditioner she uses the brush to get rid of the knots! Great brush great buy!!</li>
    <li> Our children have curly hair and thick wavy hair. These brushes are perfect, no tangle fights, it brushes through the hair almost like butter! Was recommended to me by a hairstylist and she was absolutely correct.</li>
    <li> Love it, no more hair brushing battles.</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes for my grand-daughters who often-time have trouble with tangles. I am very pleased with the product and the delivery. The girls are tickled with the ease they can run through their hair with these brushes. Finally if it makes them happy, I&#x27;m very happy.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Why did I not buy this brush 5 years ago when my daughter was born?  We&#x27;ve been thru every brush/ comb/ pick out there in vain.  She would cry every time we would wash here very curly hair, knowing that the pick was coming.  Now, she can&#x27;t wait to use her &amp;#34;magic brush&amp;#34; and smiles the whole time.  If I could give it 100 stars, I would!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are not the real Wet Brush. They lost a ton of bristles in less than a month. I contacted the wet brush company for a refund and they sent me 2 new brushes within a few days of me contacting them. It was not until I received the replacement and felt the quality difference that I noticed that the names were different. These say The &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; brush and the originals clearing say Wet Brush without the quotation marks. These are cheap quality and I feel they are being deceitful by selling them with this name.</li>
    <li> I bought this specific brush because a friend of mine with super long hair recommended it. My daughter has really thick, long hair and despite using conditioner and leave in conditioner, it was always hard to brush through her hair. Now, she can brush through her own hair with ease and it isn&#x27;t a painful experience. Getting the pack with two brushes worked out perfect since my kids spend the night at grandma and grandpa&#x27;s house once a week. We just keep the extra brush there, so there&#x27;s less items to bring on a sleepover night!</li>
    <li> Yes I really like these brushes. Although I think they could be a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick Knotty hair and when she gets out of the shower this brush goes right through her tangles  like nothing.  Amazing</li>
    <li> I love these brushes so much I bought them for other people.  Awesome product that actually works...good for summer.</li>
    <li> My girls love these brushes!</li>
    <li> A miracle brush if ever there was one! I have 4 girls and brushing hair used to lead to crying, and yelling.  No more. They each have their own wet brush and no more tears! I don&#x27;t understand why it works but it does.  It&#x27;s the only brush my daughters will use.  Use it with wet or dry hair, it ges tangles out without tears.</li>
    <li> Best brush I have ever used!  Thank you so much</li>
    <li> Everyone in the family loves these brushes.  We all use them and have ordered more than 1.  They definitely make it so much easier to brush your hair!</li>
    <li> My kindergartner has beautiful hair down to her waist. Before this brush, her beautiful hair often was full of rats nests and huge tangles because brushing her hair was always such a struggle. Now, she will sit still (without tears!) when I brush her hair! This brush looks and feels like a normal brush to me so I don&#x27;t understand why it makes such a big difference -- but it really does! It&#x27;s almost like magic :)</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing.  My daughter hated having her hair brushed because of all of the knots - but this brush solved all that. Plus I got one for myself and I have long think hair and it is just the thing</li>
    <li> I love them as does my daughter. No more painfull hair brushing experiences!!!</li>
    <li> This brush is now my 6 yr old daughter&#x27;s, and my own, favorite.</li>
    <li> These have been a godsend for our two girls have very long and curly hair! One even has very thick hair that the brush does well on. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Husband and I have long hair. We were amazed how they just detangle your hair.</li>
    <li> IF YOU ARE READING THE REVIEWS ON THIS, JUST STOP WASTING YOUR TIME &amp; BUY IT!!! I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT. NEVER USING A REGULAR BRUSH AGAIN. IT MAY LOOK LIKE THE OTHERS IN THE STORE BUT TRUST ME IT ISN&#x27;T. IT DOESNT PULL YOUR HAIR AND RUNS THROUGH EASILY ON WET OR DRY HAIR. I CANT EXPLAIN WHY THIS BRUSH WORKS, IT JUST DOES. ID PAY TRIPLE PRICE FOR THIS BRUSH. WORTH EVERY PENNY.</li>
    <li> Best price and such a great brush.  We could not live without it! My girls have curly hair (as do I) and slow and steady brushing with the wet brush gets out the worst tangles.</li>
    <li> Best hairbrush out there...on wet or dry hair!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as she has thick hair that tangles easily.  This brush runs through the tangles quite well.  I&#x27;m not a fan of brushing wet hair but it does work well.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter has really long hair. It used to be a hassle to brush her hair but now with this brush she can do it herself without any whining. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Very good product. My grand-daughter loves it. It&#x27;s is always great when you buy a product that does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> These are WET hair brushes, take note! The bristles are much thinner and softer than the bristles on normal hair brushes. However, they work wonders on wet hair.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter has very long, thick curly hair, this brush has worked very well for her, wet or dry hair</li>
    <li> I have had this brush about 4 months and really did like how it worked in my hair: wet or dry. It is now worthless as the entire portion of the bristles is stuck in so only the outer ring of bristles actually work. Good in theory - but I am not willing to have to replace the brush every 4 months as well as contribute the landfill.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! I have long curly hair and have always struggled with brushing due to frizz and breakage. This hair brush is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought. I love it so much that I have ordered it for my sister, and two friends! I think everyone no matter what type of hair you have should have this brush. It doesn&#x27;t pull or snag hair at all and still does a great job of getting the tangles out. I will be ordering again this Christmas for my mother and sister-in-law! Definitely purchase!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect brushes.  Perfect.  Wet, dry, perfect.</li>
    <li> The only brush that will get tangles out of my daughter&#x27;s thick hair. Great brush for the whole family. We love it.</li>
    <li> Thank you wet brush for making my children whine and cry less about brushing their hair!  I&#x27;m one of those weird parents that expect their children to groom themselves, and this brush has lessened the drama in our lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least the drama related to hair combing and tangles.</li>
    <li> Works great for my girls</li>
    <li> A girlfriend told me about how this helped her daughter. I have a very squirmy three year old with curly hair. I got these to help tame her locks - and it works! I can brush through without pulling her hair out. Totally worth it!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Thanks</li>
    <li> If you have a little girl with long hair and loves it, but hates to brush it...this brush is a MUST have!</li>
    <li> Best brush ever for baby fine, tangly hair.  Where was this brush when my kids were little!! I use it for myself, since I never grew out of the baby fine stage.  Just ordered 2 more to have in every location.</li>
    <li> received and was not clean</li>
    <li> Brushes received were counterfeit.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I&#x27;ve found for my daughter&#x27;s very fine hair which gets very tangled. I also use one on my wet hair and find it works better than any brush I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s hair stylist recommended the Wet Brush to her for our kids.  The Wet Brush makes brushing their hair much easier.</li>
    <li> These brushed really do work!!! And make brushing my hair fast and easy!  They are even great after working out and can get tangles out quickly and without ripping out my hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without these brushes.  We have 6 now  so we always have one wherever we are!</li>
    <li> These brushes are THE BEST! My stylist reccomeded this brush to me for my daughter with fine, straight, constantly tangled hair. She hated getting her hair brushed and would bawl every time we did, since getting the Wet Brush, there have been NO tears! I tell everyone I know about them, they have been a life saver in my house. Great price and the colors are fun too!</li>
    <li> I love this hair brush, now I have one for me and both my daughters, who both have long hair.  Works wonders and virtually painless to get the tangles out, even in wet hair.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use a regular brush again. My MIL had bought my daughter one as a stocking stuffer. She left it behind on vacation and I had to buy a replacement asap! I use it now too because it&#x27;s so much better getting tangles out.</li>
    <li> Bought these after some online recommendations.  I am pleased.  My daughter has long thick hair that tangles easily.  She never wanted it brushed but would cry at the idea of cutting it.  We tried some of the as seen on tv brushes and they wouldn&#x27;t think of getting through her thick hair.  The Wet Brush will actually get through her hair with very minimal pulling.  It does take more strokes than a traditional brush but doesn&#x27;t pull out and break her hair like a traditional brush.  I do sometimes use a traditional brush for styling after combing with the Wet Brush especially if I&#x27;m putting all of her hair in a ponytail.  I&#x27;m just so happy to find a brush she doesn&#x27;t run from!!</li>
    <li> I initially bought one of these from my hair stylist.  It works like magic!  The ease with which it brushes through wet hair is amazing!  I wish they had these when I was a kid!  Even on dry hair, they are great.  I sit in front on tv &amp; brush my hair for hours...</li>
    <li> ...no really!! My daughter and I both have long hair and trying to get the knots out after bathing/swimming/exercising has always been a nightmare. No more! We now have four of these brushes in all different colors...and little ones for travel. I recommend them to all our friends. Truly revolutionary.</li>
    <li> These brushes really do make brushing tangled hair easy and pain free.  They are great on wet or dry hair</li>
    <li> Great brush for kids. Works well and a nice size.</li>
    <li> My granddaughters (7 and 4) have long hair and their mother bought this brush a couple of years ago.  The dreaded shampoo time is now a pleasant experience.  Thus, I bought these for me and my 92 year old mother.  Mom has a lot of hair for a nonagenarian, with a curly perm.  When I do her hair, just a couple of passes with the wet brush and she is snarl free and I can easily set her hair with rollers.  When dry, it also works as a great styling brush.  I have short, straight hair and am equally pleased with the brush for my specific use.</li>
    <li> my daughter&#x27;s hair looks unbrushed just minutes after I brush it and it gets tangled after one gust of wind. this brush is ouchless and fantastic. she will search the house until she finds this brush to use on her hair.</li>
    <li> 10 years of trouble brushing my daughters hair!  NEVER AGAIN!  I don&#x27;t know how this works, I just know that it does!&lt;br /&gt;She loves to brush her hair now, and it looks so shiny and tangle free!&lt;br /&gt;I will be a customer for life!</li>
    <li> These brushes are simply WONDERFUL! I was skeptical at first but after using them on my self and multiple children, the results are magical. I don&#x27;t have to hear screaming or crying anymore because the knots are no match for this brush! A must buy and I only wish I would&#x27;ve discovered them sooner!!!</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t anyone invent this yrs ago?  Everyone I give this to with long hair love it. No more &amp;#34;ouch Mommy, that hurts!&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Someone recommend that I try these brushes for my kids hair. I have one child with crazy thick hair and another with thin curly hair. These brushes are amazing and I never hear complaints now when I&#x27;m brushing their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also noticed less hair on the brush so it&#x27;s also helping to prevent hair pull outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the two pack to save money and keep one upstairs and another downstairs.</li>
    <li> This combined with Original sprout leave in conditioner has made my life so much easier and my time doing my daughters hair faster and less painful. I highly recommend this! It works better than the other &amp;#34;tangle brushes&amp;#34; I have tried.</li>
    <li> Do not believe this product is authentic. Our original Wet Brush was great - but the ones sold here did not meet any of my expectations. The genuine Wet Brushes have 2 logos on the handle . One black one down low and another embossed on near the top of the handle. The ones ordered/received only had the black logo at the bottom. The bristles were bent over within weeks. Theses brushes also feel different in your hand  and hair nor did they remove tangles as easily as the original ones did.</li>
    <li> Kids like these brushes.  Especially good for wet hair as the name indicates!</li>
    <li> i think these are different than some of the products I purchased a while ago. they do not detangle as well.</li>
    <li> My hair is always so matted and tangled when I get out the shower no matter how much conditioner i use. I ordered these brushes because my hair stylist recommended them to me and they are definetly worth the money.  The work GREAT!!! I can finally brush my hair without  ripping it all out when I get out the shower.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try a wet brush after hearing so much about them.  I bought the two pack so I could give one to my sister.  Unfortunately, we both had the same opinion.  These brushes smelled awful out of the package.  The smell did not dissipate once the brushes were used. I tried to get past the smell, but I couldn&#x27;t, and the brush itself didn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything special.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It works very well on my and both of my daughters&#x27; hair, whether it&#x27;s wet or dry. Thanks to their daddy, my girls both have a ridiculous amount of hair. ;) In addition, one of my girls has coarse, wavy, long hair. The other has fine, curly hair. I have average/slightly thin, straight hair. I have never been more impressed with a brush. My youngest still complains a little when I brush her hair, but it&#x27;s not every time and it&#x27;s not even close to as bad as she has complained with every other brush out there. The secret is that the bristles are pretty thin and the ends are well-coated so if the brush does hit a tangle, it slides out instead of pulling through it until it becomes a nasty knot. So then you just go through it some more and it comes out relatively painlessly. I recommend this brush for all hair types. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Wife and daughter love it.  perfect for when you just get out of the shower or pool.  Price is a little high but quality is good</li>
    <li> Unbelievable how well these work!!  My husband was especially impressed when brushing our daughters wet hair -- the Wet Brush is the thing to have!  We have boys and girls and they think it&#x27;s fun to have the blue brush for the guys and the pink one for the girls.  :)</li>
    <li> These are fantastic. I have waist long wavy frizzy Italian hair and it went through like butter. It usually took me 30 minutes just to brush!! So glad I found these!</li>
    <li> Not sure what all the fuss is about these brushes, they are overpriced IMHO. They also didn&#x27;t really make my daughters hair brushing experience any less painful. Would not buy again, unless the price was lowered...wonder how high the markup is on these bad boys</li>
    <li> What is this sorcery?&lt;br /&gt;This is brush has made me all trippy.&lt;br /&gt;I have natural really thick curly hair like African American hair and this brush flows through it like a waterfall. It is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Just got of the shower for washing off your victim&#x27;s blood? Run this magical artifact through your hair and BAM! Its ready for date night.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! Although I found myself skeptical at first I absolutely love this brush, it took away my tangles and makes brushing wet hair simple and pain free! You will not be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice it changes the texture of my hair the first day, but after one nights sleep my hair is back to the same softness and tangle free!</li>
    <li> You see many products out there saying they are good with tangles and many of them actually suck.  This one actually works awesome with my girls&#x27; tangled hair after their baths. Finally a brush that actually gets the tangles out without yanking my girls&#x27; heads back and pulling their hair. It doesn&#x27;t reach all the way through the hair, so it takes multiple strokes to clear and area, but it does work.</li>
    <li> I have had these for the last week for my girls and myself and so far I am really liking them. One daughter has thick curly/wavy hair and it is preferred by her. The other has straight thin hair and loves it too.</li>
    <li> Gave them as gifts.  Love them</li>
    <li> Best brushes ever!!! It is a new design that allows you to brush your hair when wet and it goes straight through the wet knots! It has been a huge time saver for me  and I love them.  ( I bought these because I broke my first one from brushing a huge knot out of my hair after I washed it)</li>
    <li> Great brush to get nasty tangles out of my girls love thick hair.  No tears.</li>
    <li> Bought two--one for daughter.  She and her children love it.  Great for fine hair.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the wet brush. Matter of fact, I will brag about it&#x27;s successfulness to anyone that will listen. However this particular brush set came with a horrible stench. I have read about the smell in plastic/rubber before but never experienced it for myself. This pink and blue brush smells disgusting like burning trash. Not exactly what you want to use on your clean wet hair. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> This hair brush is amazing. I don&#x27;t know how I managed without them before. They work so well on both wet and dry hair to glide through the hair without tangles. I love the way my hair feels with the brush gliding through it, without breaking my hair. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have agreed to let my daughter grow her hair out because of this brush. It really does work. I&#x27;ve started using it because it&#x27;s so painless brushing through curly hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter love it and myself too it comfortable !!</li>
    <li> Simply amazing.  My daughter has been using this for some time now to brush her hair, and it actually works in untangling her hair. Now if only she&#x27;d do it every day and we had to stop nagging her about it, then I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> great brush for a kid who hates to brush her (long &amp; tangly) hair</li>
    <li> I just received these a few days ago and I absolutely LOVE these brushes.  I have long hair that tangles terribly while I sleep which means brushing is time consuming and painful sometimes.  This brush was amazing. It not only got the tangles out while dry without the pulling, and leaving a bunch of hair in my brush but even after I washed my hair I was able to brush it WET with great results and this never happens.  It even managed to get those nape of the neck knots/rats nest tangles out without bringing tears to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These were replacing the Michael Mercier brushes I had. Those were great for just a couple months and then the plastic brush pins continually broke off and it was awful.</li>
    <li> Cannot say enough good things about this brush.  I use it on my 2 year old who has very thin, very tangly hair.  We went from 5 minutes with a comb and lots of tears, to about 10 seconds and an &amp;#34;I want to brush it myself.&amp;#34;  It works wet or dry, and we have the smaller one that works great for kids.</li>
    <li> works great for my 3 year old, she likes brushing her hair now</li>
    <li> I have VERY fine long hair and was looking for a brush that wouldn&#x27;t rip my hair out everytime i brushed it and this brush is excellent. I was spending SO much time getting the tangles out and breaking my hair, and this brush has solved the problem. I have NO trouble detangling it now, wet or dry.</li>
    <li> These are the BEST brushes EVER!!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Love these brushes! My daughter doesn&#x27;t scream every time I brush her hair now!</li>
    <li> My favorite brush! Great at getting out knots and tangles.</li>
    <li> Worked well for me and my mum. We both have curly hair and there was no tugging whatsoever so we are very happy with our purchase!</li>
    <li> Brushes worked  great, and my grandchild really enjoyed hers.</li>
    <li> Best brush for kid&#x27;s hair!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! I have two girls who both would cry when I brushed their hair. One has  really thick hair and the other has average. These brushes glide through their hair and there are no more tears!</li>
    <li> Not as good as previous purchase of one brush. This pair had a very strong smell and didn&#x27;t seem work as well as previous purchase.</li>
    <li> Only brushes my 3 daughters will use...we have them everywhere.</li>
    <li> These are GREAT brushes!! My girls and I have long hair and are always looking for products that help brush through without minimal knotting, and pulling of the hair. This brush is awesome!</li>
    <li> Very too product--I really like it.</li>
    <li> Love these!! They really work.my daughter has a sensitive head and I brushed her hair without one complaint.it brushed smooth</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is amazingly thick and hard to brush through.  A little water, and the wet brush, and presto! works like magic.  No more hair pulled out and no more screaming from my daughter.</li>
    <li> My kids like it because it doesn&#x27;t hurt, but it also doesn&#x27;t brush through the knots.  So we still need to use a second brush for that.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used these brushes you have to try one!  My hairdresser used one on my hair at my last appt and I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it worked.  No tangles tugging or anything!  Needless to say I got one for myself and one for each of my daughters!</li>
    <li> LUV it!  I am losing less hair when brushing.  It goes through smoothly even when wet.  I wonder if it would work on my dog?</li>
    <li> Reasonable price, brand new and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Love love love this brush!! First time in 5 years my child did not cry combing their hair out!! Amazing</li>
    <li> I have bought every brush imaginable and this is the only one that works on my very curly and think headed little girls. They love it and i love it because now there are no more tears when i brush their hair. You can brush it while it&#x27;s wet or while it is dry doesn&#x27;t mater it is just wonderful. you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> The favorite brush of my two girls with long hair. One with fine, straight and the other with curls.</li>
    <li> My hair is so much healthier!</li>
    <li> Excellent at detangling hair without breaking or pulling.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Amazing Brush, where has it been all these years.  If you have long hair you won&#x27;t believe it. You must order this, absolutely no tangles, like a knife through butter!!!!</li>
    <li> I have had tangly hair since childhood. I have tried many many things to tame the tangles including another so-called brush especially for tangled hair but my Wet Brush has finally done it! I just run this through my hair a couple times and it&#x27;s tamed a majority of the tangles. Be sure to pay attention to the packaging and not use it too close to your hair dryer. I use mine before drying my hair and then switch to a comb then back to the brush when I am done!</li>
    <li> Arrived in new condition.  It glides through wet hair with ease.  I like these brushes very much.</li>
    <li> I realize that this is meant to be a good brush to detangle wet hair and it does that ok (although we never really had problems with wet hair to begin with). It is no better for tangled dry hair than the regular brush - it still pulls and my 4 year old yells at me.</li>
    <li> It helps, but something much better is needed</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, had one previously and ordered 2 more so i always had one wherever i needed it. Love the fun colors!!</li>
    <li> Game changer for gals with tangley hair! It doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt when brushing thru wet OR dry hair. Truly amazing!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend these brushes and bought one for all my friends.  They are great for extensions too - still need to be careful, but better than any other for tangles!</li>
    <li> Had to try them out. Love them. They give when going through tangles so they don&#x27;t rip and break hair - only way I would be able to brush my 2 year olds long hair.</li>
    <li> Works well on my daughter&#x27;s long fine hair.  I only wish we&#x27;d known about this brush earlier - it would&#x27;ve saved us countless grumpy hairbrushing mornings!  These brushes are also now sold at my own hair salon, right alongside the high-end hair products.</li>
    <li> My daughter-in -law says it&#x27;s the best thing she has found so far for my granddaughter&#x27;s thick, long hair that get tangled easily. Works well on dry hair also.</li>
    <li> Yup, much easier to get tangles out with these brushes, wet or dry.</li>
    <li> These are fakes. They do not have the pressed Wet Brush logo molded into the plastic like the real one I purchased locally. Very dissppointed. Do not buy these.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and the wet brush didn&#x27;t go through the tangles. I was told by lots of people that it&#x27;s the best brush for wet thick hair, I think they are terrible for thick hair.</li>
    <li> It worked great on detangling my daughter&#x27;s hair with minimal pain for a few months, and then it started catching and hurting.  I am not willing to pay for a new brush every few months, and will be looking for alternatives.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  I have one in each of my bathrooms at home, in my travel case and in  my office.  I also use it for my Maltese dogs - keeps them from getting snarls and doesn&#x27;t pull their hair.</li>
    <li> I think I got real brushes unlike some people because brushing my hair makes me feel so good!it&#x27;s kind therapeutic to use these brushes. I highly recommend these brushes, they detangle hair easier and faster without a lot of hassle and pain compared your average hair brush.  I plan to buy these as gifts for all of my long haired pals! If you get a fake try buying from another seller or from the actual maker (My seller was Oasis Mall)&lt;br /&gt;I will later purchase another brush directly from the company to compare and will later edit this review...</li>
    <li> Wow! I wish I had found this sooner!!! I have a 2 yr old with long hair &amp; she doesn&#x27;t enjoy having it brushed. This brush makes quick work of it. It works great for my hair, too. It also works wet or dry.</li>
    <li> works great on my kids&#x27; wet hair!  less tears for them equals less tears for me!</li>
    <li> My family say this brush is a miracle. Supposedly the best brush they&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these hairbrushes.  My daughter never complains about pulling with these hairbrushes.</li>
    <li> Got these cause I read the reviews and thought yes finally something amazing. No I was wrong this does not work either.</li>
    <li> My daughter tells me best brush around.  Fast delivery and great price.</li>
    <li> Got 2 - 1 for me &amp; 1 as a gift.  Works great for wet or dry hair.  Very little pulling.  Wonderful.</li>
    <li> Perfect for curly hair</li>
    <li> No pulling and crying, perfect!!</li>
    <li> Amazing! These brushes have changed my life. I have to wash my hair daily because it gets oily etc and these brushes make it 100 times easier to get the tangles out after I get out of the shower. I have fine, curly, frizzy hair so anytime I brush with a regular brush it&#x27;s difficult... Not with these! Even my 2.5 year old daughter (with hair identical to mine), will let me brush her hair without a fight (which we used to have daily after bath time or anytime I&#x27;d need to brush her hair). Worth every penny. I am tossing my old brushes and buying more of these!</li>
    <li> Seems to be like other brands? What&#x27;s the catch?&lt;br /&gt;If there is something amazing about these brushes,I&#x27;d like to know before buying. Thanks</li>
    <li> Every one with kids should have one of these brushes. They are amazing.</li>
    <li> I have think curly hair that is hard to brush/comb after shampooing.  This brush is the best thing ever!  I am able to comb through my hair after washing without any tangles what so ever!  Don&#x27;t question it, just try it!  My daughter in law told me about it ad I thought there was no way it could be as good as she said.  I love this brush and have since given it to friends as a gift.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, product was exactly what I expected it to be</li>
    <li> perfect stocking stuffer!</li>
    <li> These saved our little girl from having to cut her hair short! So in love with these brushes!</li>
    <li> I LOVE my Wet Brushes!! I have thin long hair and there is no substitute.. The only downfall is they only last about six months to a year before the bristles will start to drop to the bottom and loose their grip but for the price, and for the care of my hair  ( And no more broken hairs when brushing ) that is ok compared to the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these brushes now for two years- Use both on my wet or dry hair- I buy in two packs now as I will go through a brush with twice daily use anyway from six months to a year- But well worth it!! My hair is worth it!!</li>
    <li> Great brush for all hair types!</li>
    <li> This is the only brush that works for both my daughter! One has very thick hair and the other is a little curly. We won&#x27;t use any other brush!</li>
    <li> Single father with tender headed daughter. These things work miracles, much less fighting to brush hair.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter always cried when her hair was brushed. Now it&#x27;s a easy and painless. No more struggles to brush her hair.</li>
    <li> Tried many many brushes on my grand daughter&#x27;s long knotty hair. This has been the best.</li>
    <li> Bought 4 to give as gifts to the people I love.  AWESOME product.  Wet or dry it detangles like magic.</li>
    <li> I love this product it has changed the way I brush my hair forever!! It pulls the tangles out without pulling my hair out, and has reduced my split ends</li>
    <li> Great item my daughter loves it...</li>
    <li> My daughter no longer battles me every morning. No more tears!</li>
    <li> Easily brushes through tangled hair. I used to use the Knot Genie which works well but this brush is even better. I have 5 girls! I love it and they love it. Thankfully even my 5 year old lets me brush her hair without complaint.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Goes right through wet or dry hair and doesn&#x27;t pull on it like other brushes. Good especially since I have chronic migraines.</li>
    <li> So my husband bought one of these brushes a few months ago and since then my kids fight over the brush. They take it and never put it back so I ordered one for each person in the family and viola!! No more fighting over brushes. Yes there is a rubber smell due to the rubber part, but this doesn&#x27;t bother any of us. It doesn&#x27;t hurt them and they prefer this brush over all the other brushes we had before.</li>
    <li> This was another item that I kept hearing wonderful things about but took way to long to try personally.&lt;br /&gt;I have curly hair that likes to wrap itself into ringlets and can get very tangled, especially at the base of my neck. Even with leave-in conditioner I have to be very gentle when trying to detangle my hair when I get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;This brush is very light and gentle, it runs straight through my hair with out pulling or catching, it brushes out tangles/knots very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I also like it when my hair is dry, it runs through so lightly that I&#x27;m able to brush out tangles without flattening my hair at the scalp, and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair too frizzy. When you brush out naturally curly hair you basically are producing frizzy hair anyway but this brush is much better than any other brush I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;ve tried lots.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Wet Brush!</li>
    <li> Love this BRUSH!  Doesn&#x27;t rip out my hair!</li>
    <li> Thank goodness for these brushes!  I have super thick, unruly, knotty, below shoulder length hair and these things brush out all of the knots without issue.  No clumps of hair, no pulling, no screaming or crying.  I would be bald without them.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush.  It is riduculous that something so simple has actually changed my hair but this brush has.  I have long, fine hair...but I have a lot of it.  Because it&#x27;s fine, it tends to tangle after I wash it...regardless of the type or amount of conditioner I use.  For years I used a comb with very wide teeth to detangle before blow drying.  That was okay but the comb did not remove the hair that I normally shed.  Those ended up on the bathroom floor or on my shirt/jacket.  This brush changed all of that.  It gently detangles and removes those stray hairs before I blowdry.  The bristles are flexible and protected on the ends and it feels AMAZING on my scalp.  With long, fine and highlighted hair, I was always hesitant to use a brush on it while wet until now.  This is the one hair tool I will NEVER give up.  I have bought them for everyone in my family.</li>
    <li> These are not wet brushes.  My girls noticed immediately!!!  They must be counterfeit.  Such a disappointment.  Do not waste your money.  We have 2 other ones from a salon that work wonderful was hoping these were the same and about the same price as the original ones.</li>
    <li> These brushes have made hair brushing (both wet and dry) much easier.  My 6 year old uses the pink one and I use the blue one.  It takes a few more passes, I&#x27;ve found, to get through my hair, but these brushes are much less likely to snag than traditional brushes.</li>
    <li> This brush is great to use while my hair is wet and dry. My hair doesn&#x27;t knot anymore.</li>
    <li> I had read rave reviews in Good Housekeeping so decided to try it. Wonderful! Easy to use, lightweight, feels like it does not damage my hair. Bought one for my daughter, and she loves it, too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if these are so much better than other brushes for untangling wet hair painlessly, but they work well for that purpose, and the price is right. Good for taking to the gym.</li>
    <li> These are awesome.  Don&#x27;t know why or how they work, I&#x27;m just glad they do!! Great value!</li>
    <li> Awesome. Haven&#x27;t found a brush that goes through hair so well - until now.  Makes my daughter very happy!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE BRUSHES!!! This is my 2nd purchase! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Actually purchased these for my granddaughters who both have very long thick curly hair.  Work very nicely in their hair and saves alot of tears for the 6 yr. old</li>
    <li> bristles kind of flimsy but I guess that&#x27;s the point?</li>
    <li> Works great on my Grandson&#x27;s long, wet hair!</li>
    <li> I love this idea. Came highly recommended by a friend whose daughter has similar hair to my oldest daughter. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
    <li> love these for me and my curly hair little girl!</li>
    <li> Best brushes ever!! No tangles!! My daughter and I have fine silky hair that tangles so bad, but these brushes go right through the tangles with no pulling or pain!! I will never be without a wet brush again.</li>
    <li> These brushes work just as advertised.  My Niece hates to brush her curly hair.  Using this brush right after a shower has helped her managed the tangles and her hair looks so much better and healthier.  I was so impressed, I started using one on my fine straight hair and so far I&#x27;ve had less problems with static flyaway hair.</li>
    <li> I love the wet brush! It is a great product! Prices on Amazon are wonderful, too!</li>
    <li> I bought the 2 Pack for my daughter who also has thick, wavy hair that goes to the middle of her back.  She seemed to be happy with them, so I tried one myself (my hair is also thick and wavy, but shoulder length).  I absolutely love this brush!  It makes detangling my hair after the shower a snap!  So much faster and less painful than my other brushes!  I&#x27;m actually quite fascinated and intrigued by this brush - it looks just like so many other brushes I own,  I can&#x27;t figure out why it works so well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I&#x27;d found these earlier.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great...especially on long, wet hair!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. I found this totally on accident. I saw it had nice reviews so I figured I would give it a try.  I have long, thick, naturally curly hair and brushing my hair is quite a chore. &amp;#34;Experts&amp;#34; say you are not supposed to brush your hair wet but that is not an option for me. Maybe for people with thin, straight hair. But for curly, thick hair brushing wet is the only way I am going to get through it. Technically curly hair isn&#x27;t supposed to be brushed at all. We are supposed to use a comb but that is ridiculous and take days to get through my hair. Bottom line I love LOVE this brush. I got the two pack because I wanted one for my vanity and the shower. This brush is fantastic. I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am to have found it. I only wish I had found out about it like 20 years ago. I totally recommend this brush to anyone that has trouble getting a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; brush through their hair.</li>
    <li> My mom and I love these brushes. Perfect for long hair, and the ends of the brush do not come off. Plus, we&#x27;ve finally found a fix for brushing out our tangled, wet hair. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This brush is very very good!!! we highly recommend it! it works really good for both our daughters - 2 years old and 10 years old.</li>
    <li> Good but not impressed!  Have a cheaper version of it and it does the same job. So you&#x27;re basically paying for the brand.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have long hair that tangles very easily. My daughter is ten years old and hated to have her hair brushed because of the pain. This brush works GREAT! It doeasn&#x27;t pull your hair and it works through nicely. Even on my wet hair. I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews but that is how much we love this brush.</li>
    <li> Loved them!  Work very well just as described.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist told me about these. Life saver! I have very long thick hair and brushing out my hair was almost painful. But with this brush it is so easy and painless.</li>
    <li> I have 2 girls-One with long, thick hair and the other with long, curly hair.  They both love this brush and won&#x27;t use anything else.  It stopped the tears!</li>
    <li> I like that your hair doesn&#x27;t tangle when you use this &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; brush.  It&#x27;s nice quality and my kids love theirs.  I got mine in pink so that they don&#x27;t try to steal mine :-)</li>
    <li> I own 4 of these brushes and love them! I have very long layered straight thick hair that is bayalaged. There is some dryness and naturally a bit of damage from the bleaching process to create the bayalage. These brushes just glide though with no ripping of the hair at all. I keep one in my purse, use one daily for brushing and one for brushing out wet hair and have one tucked away! Can&#x27;t say enough about this fantastic brush and how it some how manages to not pull, tug, rip through the hair, but is gentle on wet and dry hair.</li>
    <li> These are amazing. I mean, really? A brush can make all that difference?  YES!!!  Trust me, having two daughters with sensitive heads, these have become a mainstay in our home.  Makes brushing easier, and MUCH less dramatic/emotional.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. They work great on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair. No more tears after her shower.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, I use these on my extensions and it gets the tangles out so well. My daughter&#x27;s hair also gets tangled quickly and this is the best brush for detangling.</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes. Use on the 3 year old curly hair, wet or dry...won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Work great. Doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out as much. Gentle</li>
    <li> Only brush that does not make my five year old scream.  Am buying more for my nieces for Christmas this year.</li>
    <li> I believe I recieved a counterfeit product. I noticed immediately something was a bit off with the packaging. I compared it to an actual Wet Brush at an Ulta store and it was of a significantly different quality.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these brushes. Also a good gift for friends.</li>
    <li> My Maltese fur kids love them.</li>
    <li> If you have long, thick hair, this is the brush you should buy.  I can&#x27;t understand why it is so much better but it goes through wet or dry hair very easily.  I have given the wet brush to my friends and they are all amazed.  I don&#x27;t lose nearly as much hair after each washing.  Try it. You will Love It!</li>
    <li> Got this after hearing rave reviews from a friend.  My daughter has long, extremely thick hair.  It was torture to brush her hair every morning.  Once we got this she could do it herself with no whining or crying whatsoever.  She&#x27;s used it for two years now.  I&#x27;m getting another one because she lost it and I&#x27;m happy to get another it works so well.  I&#x27;m glad it comes in a pack of two so we&#x27;ll have a back up.</li>
    <li> Odd to say a brush has changed your life but in a small way these have. No more fighting with my girls to brush their hair! They love these brushes.</li>
    <li> The Remington flat iron took a long time to arrive&lt;br /&gt;Once it did it never worked&lt;br /&gt;Never even turned on&lt;br /&gt;I had already discarded the packaging so am left with a broken flat iron</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing.  I have fine hair and find it difficult to comb or brush my hair right after washing it.  This brush does the job perfectly!</li>
    <li> These are the only brushes we use on our daughters long, thick, wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Life is good with this brush!</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of these 2 packs; great Christmas gift for the girls who seem to love &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; mine.  Now they have their own and love it.  Different colors make it easy to figure out who&#x27;s got who&#x27;s!  Thanks</li>
    <li> She won&#x27;t use anything else! We have tried many brands yet this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t make her cry.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t understand all the race reviews.  For us it&#x27;s just another brush. Didn&#x27;t notice anything miraculous</li>
    <li> Great, my 7 and 2 year old love them!  Works great for both curly and straight hair.</li>
    <li> Love the brush, I have curly thin hair with lots of knots specially in the morning this brush is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complain about the seller is that one size it&#x27;s bigger than the other one, I believe they should stipulate it in the product description.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist recommended this for curly-haired kids. It&#x27;s AMAZING. A friend came home from a week in the hospital and NOTHING else but this brush would sort out her tangly hair. Thank you, thank you, whoever invented this!</li>
    <li> My hair after showering is usually a crazy mess, causing me to fight with a hairbrush to actually get through my hair. I stopped counting the amount of hairbrushes I have BROKEN while brushing my hair- it&#x27;s bad. Thank goodness I found the Wet Brush. It&#x27;s glides through my hair. I have turned my entire family on to these brushes. Will never use another.</li>
    <li> wish i could give 6 stars! no more tears in the morning!!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! My daughter won&#x27;t let us brush her hair with any other brush!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dad. This was such a magically successful product that I ended up buying 20 for my friends&#x27; kids. They&#x27;re all hooked as well. I will never buy a different brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually works well w dry hair on people w thick hair (like my wife). But for my daughters, they use it primarily for wet hair.</li>
    <li> at first I couldn&#x27;t believe that a brush should cost so much but I gave it a try and from then on i cannot use any other brush only this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; it is very very soft and very very comfortable</li>
    <li> Best brush ever for long hair.</li>
    <li> These easily brush out my hair after washing.  There is very little hair left in the brush.  Great new product.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical that this could brush the tangles out of my long thick hair, but it did, and without snarling and pulling. It works on wet or dry hair beautifully. I ordered more for my grandchildren.</li>
    <li> They are not quite as nice as the original wet brush that I bought from the actual company, but they still work!</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  I actually ordered a Wet Brush awhile back for my daughter (who has curly, very easily tangled hair), and I loved it so much that I ordered one for myself.  It really does get out the tangles, no problem.  It detangles easier when the hair is wet, but it still works better than a regular brush when the hair is dry.  I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This brush is a tear saver for sure after bath time in this house! highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both have medium length to long, fine but full, straight hair that tangles VERY easily!  This brush works wonders on our hair - cuts through the tangles with no pain and no damage!  We have 3 of these - one for each of us and one for the gym bag! These were for a gift for a mom and her daughter who envied ours on a camping trip!</li>
    <li> Written by my wife:  I have lots of hair, it&#x27;s on the finer side, but I definitely have the volume. I used to use tons of detangler spray and would still get frustrated when I blow dried my hair. I use a ceramic hair dryer and everything to help with the ease of drying, but was introduced to this brush by my hair stylist. When he combed through my wet tangled hair and it didn&#x27;t hurt a bit, I was sold. I bought a brush and have been SO happy with it! I can brush through lots of tangles and it doesn&#x27;t hurt a bit. I think the key is the flexible bristles which allow it to brush through tangles with ease and not pull at your scalp. I recommend this to anyone with a decent amount of hair and definitely for young girls. When my daughter gets older I will be purchasing one for her for sure!</li>
    <li> Not impress with this brush. Does not really go all the way through your hair.</li>
    <li> I bought a wet brush because everyone was saying it was the greatest thing ever for long hair.  I have very long, thick hair, so I was excited to try this &amp;#34;amazing brush&amp;#34;.  It works well for brushing wet hair; however, I used it while I was blow drying my hair and all of the bristles bent to the point where I cannot use it anymore.  So, I guess if you are just going to brush your hair and not blow dry it would be okay, but don&#x27;t buy this brush if you think you will be able to use it while blow drying!</li>
    <li> Goes through all the hair in this family like butter. I have Lupus and losing hair with every stroke of the brush and I was hoping this brush would help and it does!!! Not only does it not hurt, but very little hair is left in the brush when I am done. Had this not worked, my next  step was a short cut. I really didn&#x27;t want to go there.&lt;br /&gt;I also gave one to my daughter who has long thick curly hair and it went through easy peasy which really surprised her.... She was very sceptical. My fine, blonde, tender headed, pool induced rats nest haired granddaughters were also impressed.&lt;br /&gt;So this brush got a four family member thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough how much I love these brushes. Every morning was a teary battle before them. Thank you! And by the way, they work great on dry hair as well.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter and her long hair.  It worked great.  She doesn&#x27;t complain of it hurting her when i brush her hair anymore.  She wont let you near her with any other brush.  Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> I heard about this brush &amp; had high expectations, but it takes out as much hair as my regular brushes do.  This brush is no different than any other brush</li>
    <li> I gave the wet brush 5 stars because it is simply AMAZING! Im a hairstylist, and at the salon I work at we get customers from all over with all kinds of hair types. This brush is gentle yet aggressive enough to get through those knots quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> The best brush I have found for tangles.  Both of my girls let me brush their with this brush - with no tears!  I liked it so much, I use it to</li>
    <li> These work wonders in my daughters LONG hair-wet or dry.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of these brushes, but unfortunately they are not holding up well.</li>
    <li> purchased 2 months ago, so far so good.  I will order a couple more!</li>
    <li> I love the way this massages my scalp when I use it to brush my hair when it is wet!</li>
    <li> Best hair brush I ever bought.</li>
    <li> I have one girl with completely straight hair and another with really curly hair. This brush is used every night on both of their heads and they don&#x27;t complain. I use a morroccan Argan oil as well with the wet brush. Perfect combo to get their knots out and not have them screaming and crying at me</li>
    <li> My 8 year old wanted long hair but it was a battle for her or me to brush it.  After using the WetBrush the struggles have ended!  No more morning arguing ... Over hair at least!  So happy to have discovered this product!!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter hates to have her thick hair brushed, but these brushes have changed this!</li>
    <li> Perfect to brush wet hair</li>
    <li> My six year old has waist length, straight hair - every day is a struggle to get the tangles out &amp; get her ready for school.  We have tried brush after brush.  Last week, my neighbor with a curly headed, short haired child recommended this brush &amp; described it as a miracle.  Oh my gosh - the brush is unbelievable!  I was able to brush my daughter&#x27;s hair without tears, and it felt like the brush was just gliding through. Definitely a miracle.</li>
    <li> Really works. I have a very tender scalp so this makes brushing my hair after I wash it. Like it so much gave the first 1 to My Niece who is a Swimmer with long hair She fell in Love with it</li>
    <li> work exactly as claims state</li>
    <li> My daughter and granddaughter have long,curly hair. The wetbrush glides through it with no pulling.Also, there is no hair breakage.</li>
    <li> My child has hair that seems to be constantly tangled. I have tried many types of brushes and combs, but this one seems to be easiest to use.  However, while brushing tangled hair is easier with this brush, I don&#x27;t want to create unrealistic expectations.  I still have to take each strand of hair and carefully work through it with this brush, slowing working on one strand at a time to get rid of tangles.  This brush is less painful when untangling hair, but it is not as if one swipe and voila, tangles are gone.  This brush works better when hair is wet than when used on dry hair.</li>
    <li> I have such a sensitive scalp and I hate those brushes with the hard bristles. I feel like they&#x27;re ripping my scalp apart! The Wet Brush is so gently and works through all knots with ease. I love this brush so much that I&#x27;ve bought it for my children, nieces, and family friends.. You do have to replace them every year or so, but for the price you pay and the gentleness they provide, they are completely worth it.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes.  I have extensions, and this is the only brush I can use that doesn&#x27;t catch on them.  Plus, my natural hair is pretty fine and a little damaged from highlighting, and my hair seems to be healthier and have less breakage since I started using them.</li>
    <li> I have a 3 year old with super thick hair that comes down just below her shoulders, brushing her hair is a task! No matter what I tried it was always a struggle! But I got these brushes and its a breeze to brush her hair now! She calls it her &amp;#34;special brush&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t want me to use anything else for her!</li>
    <li> Holy cow, it&#x27;s true!  This brush is an absolute miracle.  Seriously.  I have very long hair, and ever since moving to a place with hard water it has been physically impossible for me to brush my hair when it is wet.  That has really put a damper on my styling options.  But not anymore.  I can now brush my wet/damp hair with this fabulous brush.  Woo hoo!!!!</li>
    <li> Terrible... The bristles are too thin and flexible, they don&#x27;t even make it all the way through my hair. Fine I guess if you have thin hair, but otherwise it barely even brushes the top layer.</li>
    <li> Exactly like the brush I purchased from the salon. This was a great value!  Now I have one in our pool bag, for my daughter and myself.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter love these for brushing out thick wet hair. Anything that will help my kid brush her hair more is worth it, and this is the only brush she will use.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. My oldest daughter has thin fine straight hair. My youngest has a curly dry bird&#x27;s nest. I&#x27;ve got coarse fine hair. This brush works WONDERFULLY for all 3 of us. Between the 3 of us, we could make a wig a week with all of the hair we&#x27;d break off by brushing. That&#x27;s no longer the case. It brushes through my daughter&#x27;s curls so easily without breaking or damaging her hair. I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> Very good! It works. Soft bristles &amp; do the job of brushing!!</li>
    <li> The bristles are ultra flexible which is what makes it great for tangled hair. However, bigger tangles will take more brushing and will pull and hurt.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my neices. One of them has trouble with tangles and I knew these brushes were great for that. My daughter uses these brushes too and she says that it doesnt hurt to brush through a tangle with these brushes. I recommend these highly for all girls.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  My daughter and I both have thin, straight hair that tangles both when wet and dry.  This brush combed thru our hair easily even when it was wet.  I recommend trying this brush if you have hair that tangles.</li>
    <li> One of the only brushes that will comb through my daughters hair!</li>
    <li> NOT MAGICAL, BUT DOES HELP.</li>
    <li> This brush changed my life. My somewhat curly haired daughters used to refuse to have there hair combed and thrash about crying when I made them. Then my sister in law told me about the wet brush. I don&#x27;t know why this works so well, it just looks like a regular brush, but it easily tames their hair. No more tears here.</li>
    <li> My girls have always been dramatic about having their hair brushed.  Now? They have nothing to complain about anymore! This brush is magic.</li>
    <li> These are amazing!!!!  I bought one for myself and one for my niece.  My sister is very grateful for this brush!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard so much about how amazing these are and honestly they are just ok. I have fine hair though, so maybe that&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
    <li> I was quite skeptical of this brush, but a friend&#x27;s daughter used it and loved it.  I got the two-pack, one for me and one for my friend (her daughter wouldn&#x27;t even let her borrow it, she loves it so much) &#x3D;- and we are both surprised and pleased at how well it works.  I&#x27;ve even used it on knots in my dry hair and it works wonderfully.  Just for the record, I have very thick, long hair - so if it works for me, it will work for you.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have ever used. My daughter has long, thick, curly hair &amp; she&#x27;s very tender-headed. She never complains with this brush and she said it&#x27;s the only brush she ever wants to use again. We don&#x27;t even have to use detangler anymore. I definitely recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> The brushes the I received are very different from my original wet brush. I believe these brushes are knock offs. They hurt and pull the hair as opposed to the original, which is very comfortable to use.  So disappointed.</li>
    <li> My girls have long hair and this works terrific right out of the shower!!!!</li>
    <li> Works awesome in my daughters hair!</li>
    <li> My daughter was wearing her hair short (because it was too painful to brush her thick long hair), but now that I bought her this brush, she is wearing it longer. I took the brush to my last hair appointment, but stylist already had one!  Lol!  I guess she learned from the previous appointment when 3 people were trying to detangle my wet hair at once. I bought the 2 pack as a gift. My only complaint is that there is a strong plastic smell, perhaps from the packaging. It goes away in time.  I wish I had this brush as a kid, with my 70s (Marcia Brady) long hair and all those tangles. No more tears for sure.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and only received one brush. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> My 5 year old has really curly hair and this works great...no screaming!</li>
    <li> Best brushes out there!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m questioning whether these are real wet brushes or not, the packaging was different than the one I bought from sallys,  but hey whatever. But after 1 use, a bristle popped out. I&#x27;ve been using my other one for 3 months and that never happened.  It doesn&#x27;t feel the same either. I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes, they even got out the tangles in our daughters&#x27; hair after they swam in chlorinated water.  Our 4 year old uses it by name when she brushes her dolls or my little ponies. The level of whining has gone down in our house with this brush. Surprisingly good product, worth the money.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush. Love it!</li>
    <li> And recommending to others!</li>
    <li> These are great for my tender headed 10 year old and for my 13 year old who has very thick hair.  I won&#x27;t buy any other brushes, these are just so great!</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughter and they did not disappoint! She has long , thick hair and really needed a brushes like these :-)</li>
    <li> They work great for wet hair &amp; dry hair!!!</li>
    <li> Finally - a brush that doesn&#x27;t cause tears when brushing my daughters&#x27; long hair.  Works great on wet and dry hair.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review on a product but I have also never had a product that exceeded my expectations. Before the &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; I was using more conditioner in the shower and hair product after the shower just so I could brush my hair making it hard and greasy when it dried.  I have unusually knotty hair after the shower and I was worried about how much hair I was ripping out with my old brush. Now with the &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; I can comb through my hair in seconds and it is completely untangled! Thank you Wet Brush you are a life saver!!!</li>
    <li> great purchase for girls with long hair!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love our WET BRUSH now we know who brush is who&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Only brush I will buy. No more tears.</li>
    <li> Not particularly soft.  Smells strongly of nasty petroleum rubber which doe not go away after 1 month.  Would not get again.</li>
    <li> It definitely works; didn&#x27;t tug on my hair just a tiny bit but it detangled it nonetheless. The tear part, I&#x27;m not so sure on. My hair is very damaged so when I brushed it when it while dry &amp; wet, I still had a lot of hair breakage.</li>
    <li> Love these. The only brush I use.</li>
    <li> I just got these and they work great.</li>
    <li> Great for all hair types</li>
    <li> love these. kids love these. painless wet hair brushing. every mom needs these</li>
    <li> Works well with wet hair</li>
    <li> THE BEST BRUSH EVER!!!&lt;br /&gt;Ahh...&lt;br /&gt;Great brush. Not durable. The bristles soon start sinking into the pad. and the bristle tips start coming off, leaving harsh plastic ends to scrape your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Others have speculated that these are not true Wet Brush. There is certainly a variation on the label. I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;d tell for sure.</li>
    <li> Rated the best brush by kids with ling curly hair, they asked for this one specifically to replace the same one.</li>
    <li> Best way to brush through long hair! amazing</li>
    <li> This product does not work on type three curly hair. My hair is very curly and it gets very tangled and knotted because of that. I have tried every detangling product I&#x27;ve come across with no results. When I heard about the Wet Brush I rushed to Sally&#x27;s to purchase one. It was of no help at all! It took me over an HOUR to get the knots out of my hair. At one point I covered my hair with conditioner and detangling cream in hopes that it would help. I ended up grabbing my old brush and wide toothed comb to finish the job.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing.  My mom thought I was doing some Jedi mind trick and that it wasn&#x27;t really brushing her hair.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter had a crisis after going swimming with her tangle-prone hair in a pony tail.  The Wet Brush solved the problem with no further tears.  I bought two -- one for our backpack when we go to the Y and one for everyday use.  Her mom has one too, so we should be covered.  I remember crying as a child when my mother tried to comb my hair.  This seems to do the trick and avoid unnecessary pain.</li>
    <li> These brushes are a MUST for kids with sensitive heads and a little curl.  The girls are much happier on those tangled filled mornings of dry hair.  After a bath, it is a smooth brush.</li>
