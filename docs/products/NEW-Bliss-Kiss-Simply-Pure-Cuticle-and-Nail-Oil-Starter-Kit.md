      <li>Love this stuff..</li>
      <li>I did the 3 day hydration treatment as soon as I got it, and then followed her instructions for nail painting (since I do love painting my nails).</li>
      <li>but I make sure to put it on when I go to bed at night</li>
      <li>and that seems to be enough to make my cuticles look perfect.  </li>
      <li>I love to use it along with my Avojuice lotion.</li>
      <li>If you can find a pen that is made for multiple uses that would make this duo perfect.  </li>
      <li>Love love love bliss kiss</li>
      <li>I realize you can force the pen to be refilled but it is a hassle and not meant to be used more than once.  </li>
      <li>AND it smells lovely :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m just in love with this productüòéüòçüòç</li>

      <li>NOTHING works better to improve my daughter&#x27;s eczema.</li>
      <li>It has helped my nails a lot and they are now in better condition than what they were ever before.</li>

      <li>Perfect refill for the BlissKiss pens (once you figure out how to open the pen).</li>
      <li>I absolutely love how it feels, works, and smells.  </li>
      <li>Great stuff, I would highly recommend trying it.</li>
      <li>short, this oil is perfect for keeping your nails flexible and strong and preventing splitting, since the oil &amp;#34;glues&amp;#34; your nail layers together.</li>
      <li>very good, you need to be very keen on putting a lot for the first days :)</li>
      <li>My cuticles used to be embarrassing, but since I found this oil they look super healthy.</li>
      <li>Great product, but only 3 stars because of the price.  </li>
      <li>This oil is so worth it!</li>
      <li>I love this nail oil so much!</li>
      <li>Give it a try, you&#x27;ll only be rewarded with healthy, beautiful, natural nails.</li>
      <li>I love this product so much.</li>
      <li>I love using this so much that I&#x27;m going to purchase the three-pack of oil pens</li>
      <li>The non brush end of the wand must be turned many times until you see a drop of oil on the bristles, then it&#x27;s ready.</li>
      <li>Simply Pure Nail Oil for yourself and watch your nails transform!!</li>
      <li>First, the applicator pen is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I have tried 6 or more cuticle oils and this far passed them all!  </li>
      <li>This oil keeps my cuticles soft and healthy looking and grows my nails.</li>
      <li>and now I have long strong healthy nails</li>
      <li>Keep in mind everyone&#x27;s skin is different and may not work for EVERYONE but these reviews are not fake, they&#x27;re honest opinions.</li>
      <li>Simply Pure oil has been the savor to my nails and cuticles!</li>
      <li>My cuticles also are in way better shape, and I never pick at them anymore because there are no dry bits left.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Super easy to use, not messy at all, spill proof, and you can tell how much product you&#x27;re getting.</li>
      <li>It keeps my cuticles nice &amp; soft, but may have made my Jamberry Nail Wraps come off early.</li>
      <li>You can go from application back to daily activities within minutes, which is amazing for work!</li>
      <li>It was really funny.</li>
      <li>At first we used it with Elidel; now, as a maintenance, we apply Bliss Kiss only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>how much healthier they look!</li>
      <li>Third, it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and will definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>As I said before, if you&#x27;re doubting all of the accolades about Simply Pure, please don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>happened upon the link to Ana&#x27;s facebook page and read all the testimonials, saw the before and after pics and thought, is that for real?</li>
      <li>For real.</li>
      <li>After receiving my starter kit (I personally purchased the fragrance free kit)</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>My nail have grown long and strong.</li>
      <li>I tried a bunch of both conventional OTC and Rx drugs and natural products (about a $1000 worth, I kid you not); and this one helped the most.</li>
      <li>My nails just soaked up the oil, and there is no type of greasy feel left once the oil is absorbed!</li>
      <li>However, most of the time oil works without any added harsh (and very expensive!)drugs.</li>
      <li>When doing the three day get naked challenge, my nails actually FELT smoother and more moisturized.</li>
      <li>I highly encourage you to try Bliss Kiss</li>
      <li>Price too high for what it is.</li>
      <li>Ana&#x27;s page takes a scientific look at the nail, what it&#x27;s made of, its structure, etc., and explains jojoba is the only oil that will be absorbed as opposed to laying on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything out there to remedy my dry, peeling cuticles and while there was some relief, it was temporary.  </li>
      <li>By using this oil and also the manicure techniques on the Bliss Kiss website, I&#x27;ve been able to grow them &amp;#62;0.5 cm past my tips.  </li>
      <li>most likely it was a combination of different factors - but I saw an instant improvement with Bliss Kiss.</li>
      <li>I literally saw a marked improvement!</li>
      <li>For me, this is the first cuticle oil that actually delivers what it claims.</li>
      <li>I wake up and my cuticles are so hydrated and soft.</li>
      <li>When I left that job, I was still using Bliss Kiss religiously, and my nails got LOOOONNNNGGGG fast!</li>
      <li>I did the 3 day hydration test initially and by the 3rd day, I was ready to paint my nails.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This nail oil is amazing.  My nails are ridged and thin.  By using this oil and also the manicure techniques on the Bliss Kiss website, I&#x27;ve been able to grow them &amp;#62;0.5 cm past my tips.  I&#x27;ve been using this about 3 months with no nail breaking, peeling or tearing.  I love this stuff and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Great oil. Works terrifically! I use it all of the time</li>
    <li> For me, this is the first cuticle oil that actually delivers what it claims. I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything out there to remedy my dry, peeling cuticles and while there was some relief, it was temporary.  My nails would go right back to their sad, dehydrated state. So those other oils just masked the condition, like a Band-Aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened upon the link to Ana&#x27;s facebook page and read all the testimonials, saw the before and after pics and thought, is that for real? Ana&#x27;s page takes a scientific look at the nail, what it&#x27;s made of, its structure, etc., and explains jojoba is the only oil that will be absorbed as opposed to laying on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once received, my nails went naked. I followed the directions, slathered on the oil and was amazed! This is no exaggeration...I literally saw a marked improvement! My nails were drinking in the oil and even after washing my hands, the cuticles remained moisturized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it&#x27;s been over three months and it is incredible how much healthier they look! Nails are longer and stronger! I am convinced this is THE cure for nail health and HIGHLY recommend this wonderful product. You&#x27;ll see results, you won&#x27;t be disappointed, definitely worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the scent is scrumptious! :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is liquid gold!  Just after 3 days my nails and cuticles are so much more moisturized!  So much nicer than other oils I&#x27;ve used, and no fragrance to irritate me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year. My nails are in much better shape and look great. I also use the oil on my toenails. I&#x27;m on chemo and get white spots on my toenails but this oil makes them vanish. The fragrances are heavenly. I currently have a winter scent that&#x27;s pine and citrus. It&#x27;s soooo yummy smelling. This oil is so worth it!</li>
    <li> It keeps my cuticles nice &amp; soft, but may have made my Jamberry Nail Wraps come off early. I don&#x27;t use it when I wear the wraps, anymore.</li>
    <li> Works Great!  My cuticles look great and this does a great job at moisturizing my nails as well.  I don&#x27;t put it on 20 times a day but I make sure to put it on when I go to bed at night and that seems to be enough to make my cuticles look perfect.  They are almost invisible now.&lt;br /&gt;One thing though is that when I ordered I thought the bottle was to refill the pen but the pen is only a single use which is disappointing.  If you can find a pen that is made for multiple uses that would make this duo perfect.  I realize you can force the pen to be refilled but it is a hassle and not meant to be used more than once.  The oil itself is awesome and does a great job!</li>
    <li> I knew I liked this cuticle oil after a couple of uses, but I didn&#x27;t realize how much I liked it until I thought I lost the pen. Even though I had other cuticle products readily at hand, I spent 30 minutes looking for this one instead. When I finally found it, I gleefully shouted, &amp;#34;Yes! There you are!&amp;#34; So what&#x27;s so great about Simply Pure that I wouldn&#x27;t settle for apricot oil or Sally Hansen Vitamin E Oil or Cuticle Rehab or any number of cuticle creams? First, the applicator pen is fantastic. Super easy to use, not messy at all, spill proof, and you can tell how much product you&#x27;re getting. Second, the oil itself is luxurious and moisturizing without leaving your entire fingertips greasy. Third, it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve used. My nails are fine but my cuticles, like the rest of my hands, get incredibly dry, often cracking and getting painful hangnails. After a few days of applying Simply Pure after a shower and before bed, my cuticles look incredibly soft and moisturized. I love using this so much that I&#x27;m going to purchase the three-pack of oil pens so I can keep one at my desk, one by the bed, and one in my purse.</li>
    <li> I got this product due to its list of ingredients, hoping it will help my kid&#x27;s eczema. My pre-tween was suffering from eczema on her eye lids. It was painful, itchy, and hurt her self-esteem a lot. I tried a bunch of both conventional OTC and Rx drugs and natural products (about a $1000 worth, I kid you not); and this one helped the most. I cannot say it was a miracle - most likely it was a combination of different factors - but I saw an instant improvement with Bliss Kiss. At first we used it with Elidel; now, as a maintenance, we apply Bliss Kiss only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you are curious, I used this oil for my cuticles; and did get good results. However, both my nails and cuticles were in a good shape to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will made do with cheaper oils and balms for my cuticles; but will continue to buy Bliss Kiss to keep my daughter&#x27;s eczema at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Ana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPD 07/08/14: I just placed and received my third order. NOTHING works better to improve my daughter&#x27;s eczema. She still gets flare ups as we were not able to find a trigger, unfortunately. If it&#x27;s really bad, I have to supplement Bliss Kiss with a tiny dab of Elidel. However, most of the time oil works without any added harsh (and very expensive!)drugs.</li>
    <li> very good, you need to be very keen on putting a lot for the first days :)</li>
    <li> I had never used any type of oil for my nails before trying Bliss Kiss, I always just used an OPI Nail Envy or some drug store brand nail strengthener. My nails never seemed to grow or when they did they usually ended up snapping off. That eventually made me seek out other options for nail care and I came across Bliss Kiss on Instagram and figured why not? BEST CHOICE I&#x27;VE EVER MADE! My nails have never been more flexible or looked better after using this nail oil! After receiving my starter kit (I personally purchased the fragrance free kit) I started seeing results almost instantly. My nails just soaked up the oil, and there is no type of greasy feel left once the oil is absorbed! You can go from application back to daily activities within minutes, which is amazing for work! I use the handy application pen almost any time I think about it and always after washing my hands for the best results. I highly encourage you to try Bliss Kiss Simply Pure Nail Oil for yourself and watch your nails transform!!</li>
    <li> My nails have been terrible for several years. They&#x27;re weird and wavy, and they tend to split in layers wayyy back into the nail (sometimes like halfway back into my nail!) It looked awful, they looked kind of shredded. I could never grow them out. I also tend to pick at my dry cuticles (which of course only makes them worse). I tried several different nail products that supposedly would stop splitting, but none of them did anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then finally I found Ana&#x27;s website, and the miracle of her nail oil, which is based on SCIENCE! I did the 3 day hydration treatment as soon as I got it, and then followed her instructions for nail painting (since I do love painting my nails). I&#x27;ve been using the oil for just about 2 months now, and it is amazing. My nails stopped splitting, just like that. The split areas are now 95% grown out (growing takes time, and they were broken way back across the nail bed). But no new splits happened! It&#x27;s fantastic! I&#x27;m actually starting to grow my nails out now. They are also growing out smoother (not so wavy). My cuticles also are in way better shape, and I never pick at them anymore because there are no dry bits left.&lt;br /&gt;In short, this oil is perfect for keeping your nails flexible and strong and preventing splitting, since the oil &amp;#34;glues&amp;#34; your nail layers together. AND it smells lovely :)&lt;br /&gt;Now go read the rest of the articles on her website, they are wonderful resources for nail care!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product so much. I sware by it. My nail have grown long and strong. I will&lt;br /&gt;Forever be a customer. Love love love bliss kiss</li>
    <li> Just average cuticle oil. It did a good job but I felt it was over priced and will not reorder.</li>
    <li> Love the product! It works so good!!! My nails have never looked like this. Can I just say nail savior!</li>
    <li> Woulld definitely recommend.  Also liked the travel pen to use on the go in addition to the bottle that I keep at home.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely WONDERFUL! Thank You!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff..Buy it and tell your friends.  I absolutely love how it feels, works, and smells.  I would buy again</li>
    <li> It really works. For real. It does. I worked a job where my hands were constantly dehydrated -- lots of handling paper and using hand sanitizer. My nails were a mess. Bliss Kiss didn&#x27;t turn my nails into like, hand model nails, but it SAVED them from peeling apart. I didn&#x27;t have to use superglue on my nails anymore because they broke so often. They got stronger, and didn&#x27;t peel hardly at all anymore. If your nails are in trouble, this will HELP. When I left that job, I was still using Bliss Kiss religiously, and my nails got LOOOONNNNGGGG fast! I was astounded. They got so long they annoyed me. It was really funny.</li>
    <li> Perfect refill for the BlissKiss pens (once you figure out how to open the pen).</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something to improve the look and feel of your cuticles, nails and surrounding skin look no further! This oil is a life saver for me and the best part it&#x27;s nut free!! So those with allergies can use this.</li>
    <li> In follow up to my earlier review in July, I still stand behind this product. I&#x27;m entering my 6th week of usage of this cuticle oil and my nails are stronger and longer. The oil is non-greasy. I did the 3 day hydration test initially and by the 3rd day, I was ready to paint my nails. Now, even without nail polish, my nails stay hydrated. I use the oil about 3 times during the day and before bedtime. As I said before, if you&#x27;re doubting all of the accolades about Simply Pure, please don&#x27;t. Give it a try, you&#x27;ll only be rewarded with healthy, beautiful, natural nails.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! My cuticles used to be embarrassing, but since I found this oil they look super healthy. When doing the three day get naked challenge, my nails actually FELT smoother and more moisturized. I&#x27;m a customer for life!</li>
    <li> Great product, but only 3 stars because of the price.  Price too high for what it is.</li>
    <li> Love this nail &amp; cuticle oil.  Using a little 3 times a day appears to be the secret to long, strong nails.  The non brush end of the wand must be turned many times until you see a drop of oil on the bristles, then it&#x27;s ready.</li>
    <li> This product is just purely amazing! I love this nail oil so much! It has helped my nails a lot and they are now in better condition than what they were ever before. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I started using Bliss Kiss over a year ago and have had great results. My nails are stronger and my cuticles look great. And the weird cut I had on my thumb for so long that I no longer noticed it disappeared...just moisturizing with this helped let it finally heal because the skin was not so dry around it!</li>
    <li> I have tried 6 or more cuticle oils and this far passed them all!  Great stuff, I would highly recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> My daughter and myself love this product! It does everything promised!  Five stars from the both of us.</li>
    <li> used this all up although I am trying a different cuticle oil at the moment, I will go back and repurchase this one...really good product.</li>
    <li> This oil is the bomb.com I had no nails before this my nails were nubs and peeling and now I have long strong healthy nails so I&#x27;m just in love with this productüòéüòçüòç</li>
    <li> By far the best nourishment for your nails. I&#x27;ve purchased this 5 times; once directly from Bliss Kiss and the other 4 times from amazon. I just can&#x27;t stop using it. This oil keeps my cuticles soft and healthy looking and grows my nails. My nails don&#x27;t break, peel or chip when I&#x27;m using this oil regularly, so they grow faster. Its a must have if you like to grow and groom your nails and if you want nice cuticles. BUY IT!</li>
    <li> Simply Pure oil has been the savor to my nails and cuticles! I apply it religiously through out the day and at night. I wake up and my cuticles are so hydrated and soft. I love to use it along with my Avojuice lotion. Keep in mind everyone&#x27;s skin is different and may not work for EVERYONE but these reviews are not fake, they&#x27;re honest opinions. I love this product and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> The Bliss Kiss Simply Pure Nail Oil works great; I love it. Can&#x27;t wait to try Simply Smooth base coat on vertical nail ridges. I&#x27;ll be using this forever!</li>
