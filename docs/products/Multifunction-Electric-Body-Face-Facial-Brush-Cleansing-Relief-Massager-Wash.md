      <li>Other than that, it arrived on time, and the cost is awesome.</li>
      <li>good product - helps clean face really well</li>
      <li>It smells of cheap plastic and looks like the type of device that could easily catch fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have had it for about a month now and its still running fine,.</li>
      <li>Even fresh batteries doesn&#x27;t make it any better.</li>

      <li>Overall, so far I&#x27;m very impressed with this!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe that for such a good price I got such good product and with attachments.</li>
      <li>But other then that I love love love it</li>
      <li>Overall its pretty good and a fantastic price.</li>
      <li>so you better learn Chinese first!!!</li>
      <li>That being said not very powerful but it does do a good job.  </li>
      <li>I would spend a little bit more and get a better product.</li>
      <li>but they are powerful good for a travel size but not for everyday use</li>
      <li>works pretty well.</li>
      <li>It was also cheap, my 3 year old daughter has a pretend blow dryer</li>
      <li>I love this thing I just wish the packaging was in English</li>
      <li>Does exactly what I wanted...</li>
      <li>I can imagine that only if thoroughly moisturised, it may be ok, but I was looking for a vibrating massager.  </li>
      <li>I really love the brush my onllllly complain is that it doesn&#x27;t explain what some of the heads of the brush do in English .</li>
      <li>And I love the various heads it comes with!</li>
      <li>SO MUCH USE HAVE DAY BY JOHN WILSON</li>
      <li>This facial brush barely rotates on HIGH and stops as soon as I attempt to clean my face. !!</li>
      <li>as I unwrapped my package I had my hopes too high.</li>
      <li>Anyways, with such a low price, on top of the some of the nagative reviews this product had, I was rather tempted to overlook this - however, I took a chance, and found myself pleasantly surprised!</li>
      <li>Ended up throwing it away, dont waste your money on this, buy something with better quality.</li>
      <li>Starts out nice for the first couple of uses, then it breaks down and goes super slow or stops spinning when you touch your face with it.</li>
      <li>I popped some new AA batteries in there, then.....</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a daily use face brush, I recommend spending the extra 10 dollars and getting a better quality and bigger one.  </li>
      <li>However, if you have sensitive skin like mine, and looking for something that is gentle on your skin, but at the same time exfoliates/cleans your face/body, then this is the product for you!</li>
      <li>After every wash my face feels soft n revived</li>
      <li>It came early and it did</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very small and portable, which I personally love.</li>
      <li>but it gets the job done, its small and light.  </li>
      <li>Switched out the batteries and tried different brand new ones.</li>
      <li>Not super powerful</li>
      <li>being said, it does tend to wash around stuff on your face, at least better than my hand did prior.</li>
      <li>It was working fine for the first few day and now it already broken</li>

<li> Only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t have alot of power in the speed.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not powerful at all.</li>
<li> no more than 3x/week) and apply my toner&lt;br /&gt;- Might be waterproof since it always gets wet when I use it and still works&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like a little toy.</li>
<li> I would like to point out the rotation is very slow and only goes in one direction.</li>
<li> Cheap crap.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> Small heads</li>
<li> From what I understand it isn&#x27;t water proof, which is a con, but not too bad of one especially considering the price of this product.</li>
<li> Oh boy was I wrong....</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also battery operated, which isn&#x27;t that bad neither.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It totally works. I looked at the reviews and saw mixed thoughts, but I bought it anyway. It came early and it did it&#x27;s job. Many people said there&#x27;s didn&#x27;t work, but it worked fine. I would like to point out the rotation is very slow and only goes in one direction.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Starts out nice for the first couple of uses, then it breaks down and goes super slow or stops spinning when you touch your face with it. Ended up throwing it away, dont waste your money on this, buy something with better quality.</li>
    <li> Does not work as well as i hoped. But for 8 bucks what could i expect. Very generic</li>
    <li> Reading some of the reviews on this left me with low expectations for this device. Whenever I read reviews, I Immediately check the lower ratings first, just because I know a lot of products can have false 5* reviews on them. Anyways, with such a low price, on top of the some of the nagative reviews this product had, I was rather tempted to overlook this - however, I took a chance, and found myself pleasantly surprised! If you&#x27;re looking for something with the power of a Clarisonic, this is not the product for you. However, if you have sensitive skin like mine, and looking for something that is gentle on your skin, but at the same time exfoliates/cleans your face/body, then this is the product for you! It&#x27;s very small and portable, which I personally love. From what I understand it isn&#x27;t water proof, which is a con, but not too bad of one especially considering the price of this product. It&#x27;s also battery operated, which isn&#x27;t that bad neither. Overall, so far I&#x27;m very impressed with this! And I love the various heads it comes with!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I wanted...</li>
    <li> Great for the price for sure!</li>
    <li> It was everything I expected it to be. After every wash my face feels soft n revived</li>
    <li> my MORGEN LOVE IT SO MUCH USE HAVE DAY BY JOHN WILSON</li>
    <li> GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
    <li> I would send this back, but I don&#x27;t want to be bothered. It&#x27;s not powerful at all. It&#x27;s like a little toy. I used to have one by Conair and that was great. But I guess they don&#x27;t make them like that any more. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It is a good product.  That being said not very powerful but it does do a good job.  I like how each of the different heads work.  I have noticed a difference in my skin tone since using it.  I would recomend it though</li>
    <li> Great product, low cost!</li>
    <li> Love to use nightly on my face.</li>
    <li> I really love the brush my onllllly complain is that it doesn&#x27;t explain what some of the heads of the brush do in English . But other then that I love love love it</li>
    <li> I love this thing I just wish the packaging was in English it&#x27;s ok though the product works great</li>
    <li> I put a drop of my facial scrub on the brush and it goes deep in my pores. Face feels refreshed after use</li>
    <li> Works very well and very handy. My face is looking much much better. I have had it for about a month now and its still running fine,.</li>
    <li> Not super powerful but it does the job</li>
    <li> Received this facial brush in hopes of a brighter day. Oh boy was I wrong.... as I unwrapped my package I had my hopes too high. I knew this price was too good to be true. I popped some new AA batteries in there, then.....nothing. Nothing happened. Switched out the batteries and tried different brand new ones. Nothing again. I am so upset, the reviews all seemed to be so great.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m bummed and dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> works pretty well. Only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t have alot of power in the speed. Which I guess isn&#x27;t terrible since I definitely don&#x27;t want to take my skin off or anything, but I would just like for it to be a tad more powerful. Other than that, it arrived on time, and the cost is awesome.</li>
    <li> It was working fine for the first few day and now it already broken</li>
    <li> Works well but price practically doubled!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Small heads but they are powerful good for a travel size but not for everyday use</li>
    <li> good product - helps clean face really well</li>
    <li> My mistake.  Though this was a vibrating massager not an oscillating massager.  My daughter says it pulls her skin.  I can imagine that only if thoroughly moisturised, it may be ok, but I was looking for a vibrating massager.  Any suggestions where I can find this equivalent to vibrating Phillips massager which I purchased 30 years ago and looking for the equivalent</li>
    <li> This is a good addition to my skin care toolbox! I&#x27;d definitely suggest this if you have combo/oily skin like me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;- Works great with my Olay Fresh Effects cleanser&lt;br /&gt;- Takes 2 AA batteries&lt;br /&gt;- My face feels great after I use it (no more than 3x/week) and apply my toner&lt;br /&gt;- Might be waterproof since it always gets wet when I use it and still works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve only used the brush attachment. I don&#x27;t know what the others are for since the instructions are not written in English&lt;br /&gt;- Both speed settings are a lot slower than I anticipated, but this might be a good thing since it&#x27;s for your FACE</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and is loved by the person who received this gift!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that for such a good price I got such good product and with attachments. I bought some as gifts and my mother and mother in law loved them.</li>
    <li> Cheap crap. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> This is nothing but a piece of junk!! The slightest pressure on your skin stops the spinner altogether. Even fresh batteries doesn&#x27;t make it any better. Also all the instructions are in Chinese so you better learn Chinese first!!!</li>
    <li> For this to be so inexpensive it works great....my face is smooth as a babies bottom once I&#x27;m done cleaning it!!</li>
    <li> Works as well as I expected</li>
    <li> I tacked this purchase up to &amp;#34;you get what you paid for&amp;#34;. Mine didn&#x27;t work at all. I used 2 sets of batteries and still didn&#x27;t work. It was also cheap, my 3 year old daughter has a pretend blow dryer and this product reminded me of that. I would spend a little bit more and get a better product.</li>
    <li> Great price and it works...which is honestly more than I was expecting.  Its not the most powerful cleaner... but it gets the job done, its small and light.  Overall its pretty good and a fantastic price.</li>
    <li> ****DON&#x27;T WAIST YOUR MONEY****!!! This facial brush barely rotates on HIGH and stops as soon as I attempt to clean my face. !!TOTAL PIECE OF JUNK!!</li>
    <li> Product as described in great shape. Arrived promptly. Service is great. Would buy again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Works good so far... not a lot of power, but good enough to start off with one.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a daily use face brush, I recommend spending the extra 10 dollars and getting a better quality and bigger one.  But this is perfect for travel size which is what I bought it for.</li>
    <li> wish it would&#x27;ve came with English directions</li>
    <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t quite reach the level of intensity that one anticipates in buying a face brush. It smells of cheap plastic and looks like the type of device that could easily catch fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it does tend to wash around stuff on your face, at least better than my hand did prior. If you are looking for a basic set, this will do the deed that is requested. If you are looking for lobster face red brush, I&#x27;d purchase another item.</li>
