    <li> I was disappointed when I received the product.  Nothing special and could have paid a lot less than that.  I will use it since I don&#x27;t want the hustle of going to the post office.  However, I won&#x27;t be reordering this product.</li>

    <li> I got these to use as a wick for a nano coil in my Kayfun Lite.
