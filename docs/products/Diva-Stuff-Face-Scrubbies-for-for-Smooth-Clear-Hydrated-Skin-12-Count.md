      <li>my face feels so clean and free of all the toxins .I</li>
      <li>I was excited to get this product</li>
      <li>So amazing that I could cry, because there is nothing pretty about a 40+ year old woman with cystic acne.  </li>
      <li>My boyfriend even complimented my skin after the first use!</li>
      <li>Will definitely be buying more!</li>
      <li>oily skin might love those patches more ( i have dry skin).</li>

      <li>I ordered these due to a sample I received w/a different product and these are wonderful.  </li>
      <li>This makes the cost REALLY become worth it!</li>
      <li>These scrubbies really give your face a clean feeling after each use.</li>
      <li>i loved how clean and soft ( a bit dry)</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on high-end skin care products, and none of them came close to how amazing Diva Stuff products are.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It makes her skin smooth and Clear.</li>
      <li>My face felt soft, and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and will definitely repurchase once I run out.</li>
      <li>They leave my face feeling very soft and clean.</li>
      <li>I was excited to use these since there were so many other positive reviews for all of the scrubbies Diva Stuff</li>
      <li>Along with the bomb product, this has really had a positive impact on my skin!</li>
      <li>It is easy enough to use--warm water on the pad and scrub your face.</li>
      <li>She really like it a lot.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I really like these scrubbies.</li>
      <li>these scrubbies (I think they&#x27;re gentle to use every day).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This product is not harsh and leaves my skin feeling fresh, moisturized and glowing.</li>
      <li>SO MUCH, DIVA STUFF!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>even cancelled my facial for next week, because my skin looks so great that I don&#x27;t need a facial anymore!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found a couple of gentle products to use on my skin and that helped -</li>
      <li>The smell is a little medicinal, unlike some of her other sweeter smelling scrubbies, but it&#x27;s a good clean smell, and they work so well, even if they smelled like feet</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it truly prevents break-outs, but so far so good.</li>
      <li>i wont do without it again, and im extremely excited to try future products!</li>
      <li>Feels like cheap bar soap as its itchy on skin and takes a long time to wash off all the residue.</li>
      <li>Anyway the first use of this scrubbie made me realize the spot on my chin which I had thought to have completely popped looked refreshed and swollen</li>
      <li>I bought a full pack the next day!</li>
      <li>I was hoping it would do more with the unsightly black spots on my face, the clogged pores.</li>
      <li>Her face is MUCH more clear than it has ever been...to an extremely noticible point.</li>
      <li>got two lovely little samples as well of an exfoliant and coconut face</li>
      <li>Makes my face so soft!!</li>
      <li>I have tried two other scrubbing products; the India&#x27;s Secret and the Carnival and this is by far the BEST one for me.</li>
      <li>It made my skin soft and smooth and I haven&#x27;t had a single breakout since I started using this stuff.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway my routine used to include a face brush which I will include once i buy a new one</li>
      <li>This helps clear it though.!</li>
      <li>It is gentle but cleans deep, m skin does not feel dry or over cleaned, it feels hydrated and clean.</li>
      <li>Just as most of the previous reviews state - each pad can be used multiple times.</li>
      <li>While her face isn&#x27;t completely clear, these pads upped the results she has.</li>
      <li>and it makes my face seem soft.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say my skin is perfectly clear but there is a marked improvement.  </li>
      <li>Will stick to my natural face wash.</li>
      <li>If you have time to surf the web there are several websites that are reasonable priced.  </li>
      <li>I was nervous that it might irritate my sensitive skin</li>
      <li>My sensitive skin does not react.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Not only are these products eliminating my acne, I&#x27;m also noticing an even tone in my face, and ALL of my whiteheads are gone (which I have been struggling with my whole life-</li>
      <li>I cut my first one in half, used it, and following another reviewer&#x27;s tip did pore strips right after.&lt;br /&gt;Holy</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin at all and feels pretty rough on skin.</li>
      <li>Like the other scrubbies, I was able to cut these in half to yield 24 pieces.</li>
      <li>This is one of the only things that can actually help clear up my acne.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Too harsh on my skin but still a great product.</li>
    <li> I love Diva Stuff.  There prices are reasonable for the product and the quality is good and works.  I have about three or four websites that I am partial too and this is one.  I say &amp;#34;NO&amp;#34; to these websites that are charging these ridiculous prices which are outrageous!!!!  If you have time to surf the web there are several websites that are reasonable priced.  It does take time.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product and so far I love the smell and it makes my face seem soft.  I was hoping it would do more with the unsightly black spots on my face, the clogged pores. I might have to try the other one next time but I still enjoy this one and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> My Skin has  definitely IMPROVED ! Love them  !!!!!</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this product! i have had horrible black and whiteheads around my nose and under my lips, ive used countless facial scrubs and exfoliators that were so harsh they burned and darkened my skin. This product is not harsh and leaves my skin feeling fresh, moisturized and glowing. i wont do without it again, and im extremely excited to try future products!</li>
    <li> Used it for awhile and then stopped. Feels like cheap bar soap as its itchy on skin and takes a long time to wash off all the residue. Didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin at all and feels pretty rough on skin. I like the concept of it but sadly it just wasn&#x27;t what the reviews said. Will stick to my natural face wash.</li>
    <li> Along with the bomb product, this has really had a positive impact on my skin! Leaves this great clean feeling when used!</li>
    <li> Ordered these but only used it once it was a bit to abrasive for my face it does have great ingredients though&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer if the product came in a bar soap</li>
    <li> A great product to use to fight acne.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel great when I use it, just the pads are a little difficult to use and a little messy.</li>
    <li> Looking for a face scrub that fights acne and leaves your skin feeling smooth and oil free? Well look no further, this is it! I would recommend this to anyone who has acne problems! My boyfriend even complimented my skin after the first use! And another great thing about them is each scrubby can be used 2-3 times! Buy these scrubbies and you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Makes my face so soft!! Will be buying it again when I&#x27;m out</li>
    <li> Honestly I&#x27;ve tried so many products for my face. This is one of the only things that can actually help clear up my acne. My acne isn&#x27;t awful but I get cystic acne bumps and white heads and black heads. This helps clear it though.! I love this product and will definitely repurchase once I run out. -Abbey</li>
    <li> I gave this to my sister so she can see for herself how amazing DIVA STUFF products are. She really like it a lot. It makes her skin smooth and Clear.</li>
    <li> I ordered these due to a sample I received w/a different product and these are wonderful.  My face felt soft, and smooth.  I cant wait to get them!  THANK YOU FOR THE SAMPLE!  EXCELLENT!</li>
    <li> UNBELIEVABLE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the only product that works for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on high-end skin care products, and none of them came close to how amazing Diva Stuff products are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I was skeptical at first, but when I read the reviews, I just had to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally, within three days, my skin went from acne-filled to almost non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so pleased with my purchase, I bought their Even Steven Face Cream, 3 Acne Spot Treatments, and their Premium Acne Control Face Wash. Just like their scrubbie, it&#x27;s doing wonders to my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only are these products eliminating my acne, I&#x27;m also noticing an even tone in my face, and ALL of my whiteheads are gone (which I have been struggling with my whole life- no more lancing for me!)&lt;br /&gt;I even cancelled my facial for next week, because my skin looks so great that I don&#x27;t need a facial anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU SO MUCH, DIVA STUFF!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Love the free samples!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of all of Diva Stuff&#x27;s scrubbies, and this one is no exception. I was nervous that it might irritate my sensitive skin but it didn&#x27;t at all. It made my skin soft and smooth and I haven&#x27;t had a single breakout since I started using this stuff. The smell is a little medicinal, unlike some of her other sweeter smelling scrubbies, but it&#x27;s a good clean smell, and they work so well, even if they smelled like feet I&#x27;d still rave about them....</li>
    <li> i loved how clean and soft ( a bit dry) my face become after using it. oily skin might love those patches more ( i have dry skin). I used it twice only to remove heavy makeup.</li>
    <li> I was excited to use these since there were so many other positive reviews for all of the scrubbies Diva Stuff offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sort of bad. I have had acne since I was a teen due to hormonal issues, and added adult acne. I found a couple of gentle products to use on my skin and that helped - but I needed something to treat my skin that wasn&#x27;t harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of using the scrubbies in the morning and evening, all of the blemishes have disappeared leaving just the scars. The scars are fading, but I was really just trying to get those last few white/black heads plagueing the surface of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really delighted with the smoothness/softness of my skin. These are winners. You can cut the squares and get quite a few uses out of each. I&#x27;d give them a try if you&#x27;re curious. They honestly do work very well.</li>
    <li> My daughter has moderate hormonal acne and blackheads. I got her these to use twice weekly. She also uses the charcoal face wash from Diva Stuff morning and night on the 5 days per week she doesn&#x27;t use these pads. After, she uses with hazel as a toner and moisturizes with Cetaphil face lotion-both with these or the wash. While her face isn&#x27;t completely clear, these pads upped the results she has. Her face is MUCH more clear than it has ever been...to an extremely noticible point. She has been receiving compliments constantly. The price seems high, but when they arrived I immediately cut each pad in half. She gets 2-3 uses per pad. Btw, I want to thank other reviewers for that tip! This makes the cost REALLY become worth it!</li>
    <li> Love these Scrubbies after each use my face feels so clean and free of all the toxins .I use these twice a week and get great results would recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love these no suprise at all that they work I love the way they leave my skin will purchase soon( I reseved a sample)</li>
    <li> I really like these scrubbies. They leave my face feeling very soft and clean. They actually last longer than I thought they would. All diva stuff is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 41 and have suffered with hormonal, cystic acne due to PCOS since puberty.  I have tried prescription after prescription with very little results.  I have tried harsh stuff and natural stuff and nothing has worked like this product, the acne reducing scar cream, and the charcoal and sulfur wash.  I&#x27;ve been using all these products since July of 2014 and my skin looks AMAZING!  So amazing that I could cry, because there is nothing pretty about a 40+ year old woman with cystic acne.  Here&#x27;s the deal, you have to be diligent and put use these products at least twice a day.  I&#x27;ve seen poor reviews on some of these products and I&#x27;m convinced that these people put it on once or twice and declared they don&#x27;t work.  I use these products in the morning and at night, every single day.  I also use Alpha Hydroxy serum once a day.  If you use this correctly and have cystic acne, I can&#x27;t see how it won&#x27;t work.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> This product smells good, but I don&#x27;t think it really helps with acne. It is easy enough to use--warm water on the pad and scrub your face. However, after a few weeks I did not notice any clearer skin, so I will not be re-ordering the product</li>
    <li> I cut my first one in half, used it, and following another reviewer&#x27;s tip did pore strips right after.&lt;br /&gt;Holy cow, it looks like my blackeads (at least on my nose) are almost all gone.&lt;br /&gt;I did another scrub with it and a face mask and just....oh my gosh.&lt;br /&gt;I got two lovely little samples as well of an exfoliant and coconut face cream.&lt;br /&gt;The scrubs smell sweet, feel great and make my skin feel great.&lt;br /&gt;I can already see myself falling for Diva Stuff products.</li>
    <li> I got one of these as a sample and it cleared up the acne I did have immediately! I bought a full pack the next day! Will definitely be buying more! Love them :)</li>
    <li> Tried another brand and am going back.  Was a mistake to change.</li>
    <li> Smells (and tastes -- accidentally!) wonderful.  My sensitive skin does not react.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it truly prevents break-outs, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! I have tried two other scrubbing products; the India&#x27;s Secret and the Carnival and this is by far the BEST one for me. It is gentle but cleans deep, m skin does not feel dry or over cleaned, it feels hydrated and clean. The smell is strong. Like the other scrubbies, I was able to cut these in half to yield 24 pieces. Great product. Thanks</li>
    <li> Okay, I would give this a four because my skin isn&#x27;t that bad anymore due to other products prior but...it&#x27;s more amazing with this! Smooth feeling face, tinier pores(not invisible) but mine used to be HUGE and 2 uses of this and they are a bit tinier&lt;br /&gt;RESULT!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway my routine used to include a face brush which I will include once i buy a new one but my system is;&lt;br /&gt;Philosophy Clear Days Ahead (smells like grapefruit YUMM,but cetaphil worked really really really good).&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Then these scrubbies (I think they&#x27;re gentle to use every day).&lt;br /&gt;I think i can get at least 3-4 uses out of each.&lt;br /&gt;I finish with Diva Stuff Hibiscus cream which smells like hibiscus and feels so silky and luscious and i never need more than a dime sized amount! Anyway the first use of this scrubbie made me realize the spot on my chin which I had thought to have completely popped looked refreshed and swollen so i went and popped it again and got it all out so maybe it did draw some impurities.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say my skin is perfectly clear but there is a marked improvement.  Just as most of the previous reviews state - each pad can be used multiple times. I cut mine in half and each half gets multiple uses before tossing and moving on to the second half.  I will be reordering when it is time and think that is probably the thing I want to know the most from any reviewer.</li>
    <li> I am 25 and still have acne. These scrubbies really give your face a clean feeling after each use. I use one scrubbie 2 times, it lathers up each time nicely.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! My skin has never felt so good. I do the same as another reviewer and cut the squares in 4. This is the best cleanser.. Will continue to purchase.</li>
