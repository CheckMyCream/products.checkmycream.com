      <li>Product was delivered quickly, was a good price.  </li>

<li> This going to flat your hair.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry or frizzy.</li>
<li> However, if you have dry hair and are used to used thick conditioner like Pantene, this may not seem like enough</li>
<li> I do not notice a smell as some of the other reviewers have posted.</li>
<li> It actually feels like it&#x27;s adding something gritty to my hair that makes it feel unhealthy</li>
<li> The conditioner bottle came half empty.</li>
<li> and I feel like my hair is not as thick as when I was younger.  </li>
<li> I bought this because I read that it didn&#x27;t weigh down your hair.  </li>
<li> What a mess</li>
<li> It is even less limp and untamed.</li>
<li> is a little too watery for me as well</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if the product is fake or if it is an old formula, but the ingredients listed on the packaging don&#x27;t agree with the ones listed by the brand.</li>
<li> i thought I was buying the soy milk with cocoa which I have trouble finding in the store.</li>
<li> Not healthy.</li>
<li> I have very thick hair and the conditioner</li>
<li> (I have no idea how to say that in an understandable manner, sorry).</li>
<li> Call me crazy if you want, but when I find something that truly works and improves my quality of life, I stick with it.</li>
<li> The shampoo on this product made my hair feel strawlike and brittle after washing it, though the conditioner wasn&#x27;t to bad.</li>
<li> and when I did try my hair would frizz up like crazy!</li>

    <li> Not healthy. Has parabens and sulfates that all decent products are avoiding these days because it strips color and damages.</li>
    <li> As others have said, the conditioner is a little watery, but all in all, I liked it.  Product was delivered quickly, was a good price.  Would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo + conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry or frizzy. I do not notice a smell as some of the other reviewers have posted. I have very thick hair and the conditioner is a little too watery for me as well but it does the job.</li>
    <li> My hair seems healthier and smoother</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner for my hair. I am an African American female with naturally course hair. This makes my hair soft and more manageable after using.</li>
    <li> great for people with curly hair, adds moisture</li>
    <li> I should have stuck with the original. The shampoo on this product made my hair feel strawlike and brittle after washing it, though the conditioner wasn&#x27;t to bad. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell though my partner seemed to really enjoy it!</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner.  Makes my hear feel soft.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing!  I am 30-something and I feel like my hair is not as thick as when I was younger.  I bought this because I read that it didn&#x27;t weigh down your hair.  I am happy with it.  My hair is silky and feels good and clean.  However, if you have dry hair and are used to used thick conditioner like Pantene, this may not seem like enough conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is more similar to the conditioners that they use in the salon.  (Better for your hair anyway!)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the product is fake or if it is an old formula, but the ingredients listed on the packaging don&#x27;t agree with the ones listed by the brand. The conditioner bottle came half empty.</li>
    <li> i thought I was buying the soy milk with cocoa which I have trouble finding in the store. I received the soymilk shampoo with the argan oil which I don&#x27;t like at all. It makes my hair way too soft. That is not the product they show in this picture. I&#x27;m bummed I bought two sets.</li>
    <li> This product good for those with a lot of hair. This going to flat your hair. My hair needs more volume that doesn&#x27;t come from this one.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible hair shampoo &amp; conditioner set! Pantene, Fructis, and all those others have nothing on this. I wasn&#x27;t a believer at first because I thought no matter what shampoo &amp; conditioner product I used, it was never going to make my hair look &amp; feel better. But oh how Healthysexyhair changed that view. Ever since I have been using it, I&#x27;ve notice how healthy and natural my hair is looking. It is even less limp and untamed. And after every wash, my scalp and hair feel great. No heaviness or grease-feeling left afterwards. Call me crazy if you want, but when I find something that truly works and improves my quality of life, I stick with it.</li>
    <li> WE absolutely love this shampoo/cond ..My hair  is nice and fizz free ....great prices on amazon .i will be buying it again from here</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product. I will continue to purchase it. My only issue was... The bottle leaked during shipping. What a mess</li>
    <li> I love these but im positive I could get them cheaper in a store as a combo when they came they said 16 $ on the package I bpught them for 18 thinking I wad getting a deal</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and very damaged by over styling ect. This is nice shampoo/conditioner. Lathers up nice and leaves it nice and clean. But the downside (which might not be a downside to others) is that it made my hair so soft that I really couldn&#x27;t do anything with it. Styling it was a headache. It was so soft it wouldn&#x27;t hold a style and when I did try my hair would frizz up like crazy! No body to my hair at all. Didn&#x27;t really see a difference in the damage though. For people with fine thin hair I would say that this shampoo/conditioner isn&#x27;t really all that great :-/</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I have been using it for about 6 weeks and it consistently makes my thick mass of hair clean, sleek, and REALLY shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for the conditioner as it does not make my hair soft or easy to brush. It actually feels like it&#x27;s adding something gritty to my hair that makes it feel unhealthy (I have no idea how to say that in an understandable manner, sorry). So I&#x27;ve just been using the shampoo with a L&#x27;Oreal conditioner.</li>
    <li> It is okay for my hair.  I love Sexy Hair Treatment-in Spray better than shampoo/conditioner</li>
