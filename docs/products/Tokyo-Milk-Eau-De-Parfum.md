      <li>This stuff smells so freaking good it will blow your mind!  </li>

      <li>Tainted love is also a very good scent by Tokyo Milk.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend always says I smell really good when I wear this.     </li>
      <li>Good unisex scent that lasts all day.</li>
      <li>The price and service was exceptional I will be reordering this soon.</li>
      <li>delightful, non-floral fragrance that could be good for men or women - kind of a fresh and outdoorsy.&lt;br /&gt;An aroma that makes me feel attractive and sexy</li>
      <li>The skin smells warm.</li>
      <li>I love it, it smells so good and status on Me.</li>
      <li>Ended up loving it.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling my wrist - honestly</li>
      <li>well now I have them both and can&#x27;t LOVE them more!  </li>
      <li>Cool bottle, lovely design and very nice scent.  </li>
      <li>It smells more like bubblegum and scent lasts for about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>sure what happened..</li>
      <li>though I like this much more.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I love this -</li>
      <li>most perfumes don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>I actually love the smell of Tokyo Milk&#x27;s Arsenic too</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m in love with this fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love the scent.</li>
      <li>I have ordered this stuff three times now, I love it</li>
      <li>The bottle is shiny vs. matte which makes me wonder if I got an authentic product.  </li>
      <li>but I do not get an overwhelming orange scent nor smell like a hippy.</li>
      <li>I am enjoying getting to know Tokyo Milk.   </li>
      <li>Just good - it is nice and rich at first, but after a while it goes off.</li>
      <li>The REAL Excess Parfum is amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very much an amber scent to me, which I love.  </li>
      <li>not overwhelming, just a lovely scent !!!!</li>
      <li>I like unusual bottles and most of all the scent is to die for.</li>
      <li>as an overall view, it smells good.</li>
      <li>I went on an impulse and bought it anyway since the bottle is too cool.</li>
      <li>I love it so much that I bought a bottle for my partner so that I can smell it on her.</li>
      <li>If you like the dark scent of patuchuli this is a great perfume.</li>
      <li>Wish this lasted longer like a good movie, Excess lasts about that long.  </li>
      <li>A lingering scent that is confident, but not brash.  </li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;m allergic to most perfimes (get hives), I thought that this blend of natural ingreients (amber resin, oak bark, blood oranges and patchouli) might not give me an allergic reaction.</li>
      <li>The scent was a little too earthy for my taste but it will be a good scent for summer nights</li>
      <li>would definitely give this fragrance five stars except for the fact that it starts out strong but fades too quickly.</li>
      <li>Reminds me a bit of Ralph Lauren Hot...</li>
      <li>Ships fast!</li>
      <li>Like I said, I love the fragrance, but from now on will only purchase from a store I trust.</li>
      <li>This was my first \\&quot;for</li>
      <li>First time I purchased the parfum....</li>
      <li>I guess, like most scents, it can smell different on everyone.</li>
      <li>The powdery Amber and earthy Oak Bark top notes consume the sharp citrus of the Blood Orange, turning it into a sweet pungent nectar floating on a Patchouli whisper.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t come in the original box, so there was major leakage of product in the wrapping.</li>
      <li>It takes a certain person to wear it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really describe it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years and still love the scent.</li>
      <li>at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I loved it or hated it.</li>
      <li>- this is a brand you definitely want to try out first.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely masculine.</li>
      <li>Not thrilled with that part, but love the perfume.</li>
      <li>At least you have more control over product quality.</li>
      <li>Also try on well moistened skin, smells better longer not good for clothing directly.</li>
      <li>Powerful but not overwhelming.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this - I guess, like most scents, it can smell different on everyone. I purchased this at a store in Portland, OR, after trying out the tester and walking around a bit. I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling my wrist - honestly at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I loved it or hated it. I went on an impulse and bought it anyway since the bottle is too cool. Ended up loving it. My boyfriend always says I smell really good when I wear this.     It takes a certain person to wear it. It&#x27;s definitely masculine. If you are into floral dresses, pink and polo shirts, it&#x27;s probably not your thing.  I can&#x27;t really describe it but I do not get an overwhelming orange scent nor smell like a hippy. It&#x27;s very much an amber scent to me, which I love.  I do not like floral or overly fruity scents and prefer to wear scents including amber, etc (I like Your Place or Mine Gina by Benefit, Burberry Red and Prada for example)  I actually love the smell of Tokyo Milk&#x27;s Arsenic too but they were sold out and only tried out the lotion. Will probably purchase that online soon.</li>
    <li> Love it.  It smells like riding a horse bareback at midnight.  It smells like you&#x27;d expect the Faerie Queen to smell.  It&#x27;s dirty and earthy and smoky and sweet all at the same time.  That being said, go get it at Sephora.  I don&#x27;t think it is for everyone and there will be some mixing with body chemistry - this is a brand you definitely want to try out first.  Also, as others described, mine came without the box and I think it had already been sprayed....  Not thrilled with that part, but love the perfume.</li>
    <li> Just good - it is nice and rich at first, but after a while it goes off. I&#x27;m not sure what exactly it is but it makes me a little queasy after a while.</li>
    <li> it only needs to be packed well, to avoid leaking&lt;br /&gt;but as an overall view, it smells good.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come in the original box, so there was major leakage of product in the wrapping. The scent was a little too earthy for my taste but it will be a good scent for summer nights</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so freaking good it will blow your mind!  Tainted love is also a very good scent by Tokyo Milk.</li>
    <li> Excellent!   Everything in tact in shipping and I&#x27;m in love with this fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love the scent. Honestly I&#x27;m not sure the bottle was full, as has been mentioned by other reviewers. I have another bottle (of Arsenic) purchased from an actual beauty store, and whereas that feels &amp;#34;full,&amp;#34; this one does not. The bottle is shiny vs. matte which makes me wonder if I got an authentic product.  Like I said, I love the fragrance, but from now on will only purchase from a store I trust.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m allergic to most perfimes (get hives), I thought that this blend of natural ingreients (amber resin, oak bark, blood oranges and patchouli) might not give me an allergic reaction. It arrived yesterday and I&#x27;ve used it for two days. Here&#x27;s my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No hives - hoorah!&lt;br /&gt;A delightful, non-floral fragrance that could be good for men or women - kind of a fresh and outdoorsy.&lt;br /&gt;An aroma that makes me feel attractive and sexy - people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing and where they can get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely give this fragrance five stars except for the fact that it starts out strong but fades too quickly.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying getting to know Tokyo Milk.   This was my first \\&quot;for keeps\\&quot; bottle a gift from my Darling.  Not for the weak of heart, seems very bohemian circa 1890s not 1960s.  Slides onto the skin hovering close will not announce your arrival.  Smells different person to person. {my daughter my DH and,son}  Go sniff for yourself not sure I would buy via internet.  Wish this lasted longer like a good movie, Excess lasts about that long.  Smells and lingers well with others in the line I tried with Crushed and Destiny.  Vetiver also favors the bouf.  Also try on well moistened skin, smells better longer not good for clothing directly.</li>
    <li> A lingering scent that is confident, but not brash.  Powerful but not overwhelming.  The powdery Amber and earthy Oak Bark top notes consume the sharp citrus of the Blood Orange, turning it into a sweet pungent nectar floating on a Patchouli whisper.  The skin smells warm. Reminds me a bit of Ralph Lauren Hot...though I like this much more.</li>
    <li> What can I say... This fragrance is deliciously androgynous. It makes me want to crawl inside of myself just to breathe. I love it so much that I bought a bottle for my partner so that I can smell it on her. Yumminess! I only wish the bottle were larger. Yes! Yes! YES!</li>
    <li> First time I purchased the parfum.... always used the hand crème... well now I have them both and can&#x27;t LOVE them more!  smell great!!! not overwhelming, just a lovely scent !!!!</li>
    <li> I love it, it smells so good and status on Me. most perfumes don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> most delicious scent!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this stuff three times now, I love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted. I dont use anything else. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years and still love the scent.</li>
    <li> The REAL Excess Parfum is amazing. Good unisex scent that lasts all day. Not sure what I got. It smells more like bubblegum and scent lasts for about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what happened.. but I&#x27;d suggest you buy your cologne from a store. At least you have more control over product quality.</li>
    <li> If you like the dark scent of patuchuli this is a great perfume.</li>
    <li> Cool bottle, lovely design and very nice scent.  I like unusual bottles and most of all the scent is to die for.</li>
    <li> I bought Tokyo milk  excess I love it it&#x27;s smells great! The price and service was exceptional I will be reordering this soon. Thank you! Kelly Pucheu,</li>
    <li> Ships fast! Saved $12.</li>
