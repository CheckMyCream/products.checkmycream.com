      <li>LOVE LOVE this moisturizing cream.</li>

      <li>love vivo.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Nothings better than a fabulous product at a great price and fast delivery!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks .I love it</li>
      <li>I got my first sample of Vivo Per Lei from a shop at our Hotel while in Las Vegas, I loved the way it made my skin feel.</li>
      <li>Super cream for the price!  </li>
      <li>i love the way they leave my skin, has a very soft flowery kind of aroma.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of this product.</li>
      <li>but I decided to take a chance because it was so cheap.</li>
      <li>Get this fantastic moisturizer from Amazon rather than at the overpriced mall kiosk with the obnoxious sales rep.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered it from Amazon before from a different seller and gotten the real thing, but the 2 pack bought from BEST BET BEAUTY</li>
      <li>It really works!!!</li>
      <li>so I am familiar with it and would not buy it again.  </li>
      <li>I got sample from mall and it seemed so luxurious, but once started using liked other creams better</li>
      <li>It smooths my skin and moisturizes just right.</li>
      <li>First, I didn&#x27;t receive the correct item.</li>
      <li>This was my first purchase through amazon.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fun to try new things</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very particular, but this product met my expectation.</li>
      <li>but they were selling a large &amp;#34;2 year&amp;#34; supply for well over $200, so</li>
      <li>My wife and I first found this product at a kiosk in a high end mall.  </li>
      <li>really started using it this year</li>
      <li>does it make you skin soft and fresh. .</li>
      <li>I like  this  as much as Vivo Per Lei&#x27;s night cream.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this cream to anyone who wants to take care of the skin on their face.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this cream considering the affordable price.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I never expected to find these creams for less I had purchased them before and for way much more, when I saw them here</li>
      <li>I have used this cream now for several years, first finding it on vacation in Hawaii.  </li>
      <li>You will find the real deal one sold a few dollars more on amazon where the writing on the box &amp;  on the jar is the same.</li>
      <li>As far as I can tell it is the exact same product that I got in the mall!</li>
      <li>/&gt;so far it has done what I wanted it to do at my age...</li>
      <li>But I wanted to try it out and found this smaller quantity for a much lower price on Amazon</li>
      <li>No allergies and keeps my skin soft all day</li>
      <li>The time before last when I got the real one that one did not dry out my skin or give me acne like this one.</li>
      <li>but no way is that much dead skin going to come off that quickly.  </li>
      <li>Very nice cream to hydrate your face if you have bad skin.</li>
      <li>Using the Day Cream makes my face feel soft and I no longer have a problem with dry patches - also no hives or breakouts.</li>
      <li>I love these products however this cream has a heavy perfume smell to it making it hard for me to use.</li>

<li> I often wonder if all companies such as per lei, 24K, donna bella aren&#x27;t all owned by the same parent corp &amp; the websites are just set up as ruses to make people believe their items actually sell to some poor fools for the quoted prices.</li>
<li> I use it every day ad my dark spots are not fading at all yet.</li>

<li> Supposedly it&#x27;s supposed to be dead skin</li>
<li> and I was very skeptical at first,</li>
<li> and I got just one and a small mirror</li>
<li> This is NOT authentic Vivo Per Lei moisturizer.</li>
<li> After waiting, I rec&#x27;d 2 of the &amp;#34;facial peeling&amp;#34; products which is a gel like cleaner with these nasty granules in it that turn into little balls of crud on your face.</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
<li> Hate The knockoff version.</li>
<li> Not an awful product.</li>

    <li> The writing on the box isn&#x27;t even the same as the writing on the jar. You will find the real deal one sold a few dollars more on amazon where the writing on the box &amp;  on the jar is the same. The time before last when I got the real one that one did not dry out my skin or give me acne like this one. I am a huge fan of this product. Hate The knockoff version.</li>
    <li> Great day cream. Not greasy and my face stayed moist all day long. I like  this  as much as Vivo Per Lei&#x27;s night cream.  I have very sensitive skin and I have no problem with Vivo Per Lei brands.  Price is great. I can&#x27;t find anything this good for this price.</li>
    <li> First, I didn&#x27;t receive the correct item. After waiting, I rec&#x27;d 2 of the &amp;#34;facial peeling&amp;#34; products which is a gel like cleaner with these nasty granules in it that turn into little balls of crud on your face. Supposedly it&#x27;s supposed to be dead skin but no way is that much dead skin going to come off that quickly.  If it did, one&#x27;s face would be left red from the level of exfoliation.  I already had the exfoliating cleaner so I am familiar with it and would not buy it again.  I requested a return so am awaiting how they handle this. I should rec a prepaid return label or a refund w/o having to return the items. reason i say that is because they typically can not resell this type of item as far as I know. I can comment on the day lotion however as I&#x27;ve also tried that before. It&#x27;s a nice light lotion, good for day wear.  And for this price - for 2 - it&#x27;s a very good deal. the product however is not nearly worth the hundreds of dollars their website lists them for. I often wonder if all companies such as per lei, 24K, donna bella aren&#x27;t all owned by the same parent corp &amp; the websites are just set up as ruses to make people believe their items actually sell to some poor fools for the quoted prices. ( I&#x27;ve seen face masks listed at $999 on the home site vs $11.99 on Amazon or HauteLook). The packaging is all very similar for each &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; - I don&#x27;t know it all seems a bit suspect to me.  That said however, if you can buy any of these products at under $20 go for it, after all it&#x27;s fun to try new things and they are reasonably good products.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  This was my first purchase through amazon.  Great experience</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product.  It&#x27;s smooth and smells good too!</li>
    <li> My wife and I first found this product at a kiosk in a high end mall.  A salesperson gave us a sample of the exfoliation jell and the lotion, it was very nice but they were selling a large &amp;#34;2 year&amp;#34; supply for well over $200, so we didn&#x27;t buy.  But I wanted to try it out and found this smaller quantity for a much lower price on Amazon so we went for it.  The exfoliating and moisturizing products are very good, better by far than the ones we were using.  We will purchase again as they have made a noticeable difference in how our skin (facial) look.</li>
    <li> love vivo. it balances my skin for no breakouts. has the made in japan logo so I know they&#x27;re not knockoffs</li>
    <li> I have been using this day cream for a couple of years and this is the best price I have found</li>
    <li> after using the facial peeling rinse your face off and then apply this moisturizing cream and boy does it make you skin soft and fresh. .</li>
    <li> I love these products however this cream has a heavy perfume smell to it making it hard for me to use.</li>
    <li> Used for a year already.  I like it.</li>
    <li> Not an awful product. But wouldn&#x27;t repurchase</li>
    <li> This item was received on time and as described.</li>
    <li> I first got this cream from a kiosk in the mall and it was ridiculously over priced. I then found it here on Amazon and I was very skeptical at first, but I decided to take a chance because it was so cheap. I figured that I didn&#x27;t have much to loose. I got the product in the mail and I was extremely happy! As far as I can tell it is the exact same product that I got in the mall! I will definitely  buy from Amazon again in the future.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with my order and the product. Excellent company to order from and excellent product. You MUST try this product!!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed. It really works!!! I love it!  I&#x27;m very particular, but this product met my expectation.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Moisturizes without leaving a greasy feeling. I love the fragrance of these products.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I swear by it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this cream!  It is so light but works so well!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> great product not greasy but does moisturize all day!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about 5 ears and absolutely love it. I would recommend this cream to anyone who wants to take care of the skin on their face.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good product but doesn&#x27;t work on brown aging spot like advertised. I use it every day ad my dark spots are not fading at all yet.</li>
    <li> Super cream for the price!  I have used many moisturizers over the years and this is now one of my favorites.  Elegant packaging and smells divine!</li>
    <li> Great price! Works great. It feels so good when you put it on.</li>
    <li> No allergies and keeps my skin soft all day</li>
    <li> Beautiful packaging, cream just works ok. I got sample from mall and it seemed so luxurious, but once started using liked other creams better</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is just great. I have been using these products for a year now and I think they are the best skin products available anywhere.</li>
    <li> Cause my skin to breakout.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE this moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> Very nice cream to hydrate your face if you have bad skin. The reason I gave just to stars it&#x27;s because I order a set of two creams and I got just one and a small mirror, I asked for the refund almost two weeks ago and I am still waiting. But like I wrote it&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest cream. I will not order again.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this cream considering the affordable price. Unfortunately this cream smelled like a perfume body lotion and left my face very oily &amp; caused breakouts.</li>
    <li> Sent timely as offered</li>
    <li> I got my first sample of Vivo Per Lei from a shop at our Hotel while in Las Vegas, I loved the way it made my skin feel. As soon as I got home I found the product for sale on Amazon and ordered the Day, Night, and Eye cream. I have very sensitive skin and do not (can not) wear any make up, so it is hard for me to hide the wrinkles and dry patches that are starting to appear as I get older. Using the Day Cream makes my face feel soft and I no longer have a problem with dry patches - also no hives or breakouts. I am a repeat buyer and have purchased several of the other skin care products. I am very happy with all of them. Definately recomend.</li>
    <li> Have tried a number of different moisturizers. This is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I love this product, Vivo Per Lei Day Cream. It smooths my skin and moisturizes just right. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream now for several years, first finding it on vacation in Hawaii.  Even my husband says he can see a big difference!!</li>
    <li> I never expected to find these creams for less I had purchased them before and for way much more, when I saw them here I wanted to take advantage of&lt;br /&gt;the deal...i love the way they leave my skin, has a very soft flowery kind of aroma.</li>
    <li> Its a good product. don&#x27;t have to use much&lt;br /&gt;Just really started using it this year&lt;br /&gt;so far it has done what I wanted it to do at my age...(67)</li>
    <li> Nothings better than a fabulous product at a great price and fast delivery!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks .I love it and it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;Getting younger every day!</li>
    <li> This is NOT authentic Vivo Per Lei moisturizer. I&#x27;ve ordered it from Amazon before from a different seller and gotten the real thing, but the 2 pack bought from BEST BET BEAUTY is a KNOCK OFF!</li>
    <li> Get this fantastic moisturizer from Amazon rather than at the overpriced mall kiosk with the obnoxious sales rep.  All the benefits with none of the parking woes or hassles!</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly.  Cream is wonderful .</li>
