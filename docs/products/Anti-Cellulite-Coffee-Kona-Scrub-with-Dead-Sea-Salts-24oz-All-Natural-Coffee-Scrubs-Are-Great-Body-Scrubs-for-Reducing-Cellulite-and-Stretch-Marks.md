      <li>Wow what an amazing body scrub!</li>
      <li>That IS HUGE FOR ME.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling smooth and nourished.</li>

      <li>As you can see I have given someONE&#x27;s coffee body scrub a rating of three out of five, so feel free to read my full review in order to find out why!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As soon as I cut open the package it had the most amazing chocolately, coconut coffee aroma that was heavenly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a really good product that has done something for me other scrubs have not been able to do.</li>
      <li>I wish the directions were more detailed, such as how many times per week is recommended use.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is by far the single greatest scrub I have EVER used, and I have used A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great high quality product,  after the first use I  noticed how soft my skin is.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s pretty great because you can leave it in the shower and not worry about it getting wet or ruined.</li>

      <li>I will definitely be buying more!</li>
      <li>and this really made them feel smooth after I was out of the shower.</li>
      <li>Not only does it smell amazing</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would be happy to answer ANY questions you have, I have already gone through my first package (it lasted about 3.5 weeks of every day application and use on the heavy side because I was trying to test it</li>
      <li>, I would expect about a month or more) and have purchased my second at full price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>left my skin soft and it smells good.</li>
      <li>Impressed is not nearly a strong enough descriptive!!!</li>
      <li>I am so glad i got a discount on this product by doing the daily reviewers deals.</li>
      <li>I ten to be on the oily side and am glad to say it did not clog any pores and the results lasted for days.</li>
      <li>Very well formulated ... not too abrasive and just the right amount of moisture.  </li>
      <li>When you rinse off your skin is so silky and shiny (the oil is like a really rich moisturizer that makes my skin have a natural shine and</li>
      <li>First let me be clear, I did not pay full price for this, I got a discount in order to test and review the product.  </li>
      <li>maybe my sense of smell is odd), but it was still amazing.</li>
      <li>There also isn&#x27;t a large supply in the bag.  </li>
      <li>But you don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>
      <li>The exfoliating feature ensures that the caffeine really soaks into the skin and reduces the appearance of cellulite.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like the smell of this scrub. I have used scrubs with caffeine in the past for cellulite and noticed a difference after a couple weeks use. This one has high quality ingredients, so I anticipate the same results. The exfoliating feature ensures that the caffeine really soaks into the skin and reduces the appearance of cellulite. Best results come if used along with a skin firming gel or serum.</li>
    <li> Fantastic scrub!  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and exfoliation, but I found the zipper bag difficult to close because the salt and coffee grounds get in the channel of the zipper component.</li>
    <li> WOW! this stuff is amazing. made my skin so smooth and beautiful! I have fairly recent sun poisoning marks on my legs and it really helped to diminish those blemishes</li>
    <li> Absolutely love how soft this makes my skin feel!</li>
    <li> I love the exfoliation of this scrub.  It leaves my skin feeling smooth and nourished.</li>
    <li> left my skin soft and it smells good. not greasy. u can use it on ur face too</li>
    <li> Smells like Starbucks in my shower. Excellent product for smooth skin. Used on my face and a bit too oily for that but would work great elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I chose the Cacao Coconut body scrub because it sounded like a great combination and it didn&#x27;t disappoint.  As soon as I cut open the package it had the most amazing chocolately, coconut coffee aroma that was heavenly.  I decided to put it in a plastic container so I wouldn&#x27;t get the contents inside the bag wet when I was trying to use it in the shower.  This worked well for me as the bag is also hard to seal if you get even one grain of the scrub in the &amp;#34;zipper&amp;#34; area.  I scooped a small spoonful (about a tablespoon) in my hand and hopped in the shower.  I wet my body and then applied the scrub all over my legs, arms, and torso.  I scrubbed it all over and the aroma made it like a spa in my bathroom.  The salt dissolved, the coffee was rinsed away along with my dead skin cells, and I was left with soft, smooth skin.  I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my cellulite but possibly with repeat use it will help.  I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars because the packaging is hard to close, it doesn&#x27;t protect the product well from getting wet in the shower, and it wasn&#x27;t filled with as much product as I thought it would.  Once I scooped it all and put it in a container I was surprised how little was in there. But you don&#x27;t need to use much.  A little goes a long way!  Tip- Make sure to rinse it all down the drain to prevent making the shower slippery for the next person.  I received this item at a promotional discount to give my honest and unbiased review.  If you find my review helpful please vote for it as such.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and leaves skin feeling silky smooth</li>
    <li> I purchased the Cacao Coconut version of this scrub which has a nice smell to it. It makes me want to go out and get a chocolate coconut bar to eat though. My husband on the other hand, didn&#x27;t like the smell much but he doesn&#x27;t like coffee either. I used this in the shower on my legs and waist/abdomen area. I am really not overweight but I do have some dimpling around the waist/abdomen area. After one use, I did notice that some of it was better. It was not totally gone but it was an improvement. I did use the circling motion to massage the scrub in and then I rinsed it off later. I also have really dry skin on my legs and this really made them feel smooth after I was out of the shower. I can&#x27;t wait to see with more uses how my waist area will look.  One thing I didn&#x27;t like was getting it out of the package to use. I went and got a glass jar and transferred it to that. It is now much easier to use. I think they should change the packaging to some kind of jar. I have got other sugar scrubs in the past that were always in a jar and so much easier to use that way but the product itself is very nice. I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Midwest Sea Salt Company is one of my most trusted sources for body products. They have a great variety, excellent quality, and awesome ingredients that I can trust to put on my skin. This Coffee Body Scrub is incredible - it is not too greasy like many body scrubs are, it smells fantastic, and it has smoothed out some rough skin issues I had on my right arm, within just a couple uses. I highly recommend it and can&#x27;t wait to try their other scents in this new product line!</li>
    <li> Great product. I would definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Midwest Salts for almost a year and have loved them, even given them as gifts. I decided to try this scrub and man oh man, I&#x27;m sure glad I did. It left my skin so soft and moisturized, I didn&#x27;t need to put on lotion after my shower. I definitely recommend this product. The company itself is great and provides quick and fast service.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have used it on my entire body including my face. It is very refreshing &amp; the aroma is very nice. If you like to pamper yourself I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff!  Love the smell and feeling!</li>
    <li> Ag good coffee in the morning will make everyone have A birther day</li>
    <li> I received the scrub the day before I went on vacation and decide to use it. Impressed is not nearly a strong enough descriptive!!! The delicious aroma of freshly brewed coffee sweetened with coconut escaped the sealed bag and permeated the whole room! The texture is gritty enough for exfoliation without being overly abrasive and the coconut oil gave it a silky feel that felt marvelous rubbing all over my body. Sometimes I rush myself through scrubs but not this time. The combo of the intoxicating aroma and the warm feeling on my skin made for a truly luxurious experience. Afterwards my skin was so unbelievably soft. I ten to be on the oily side and am glad to say it did not clog any pores and the results lasted for days. My teenaged daughter got ahold of it and about lost her mind! Definitely will be repurchasing before this runs out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product at a reduced rate for my honest and unbiased review. Glad I did because this one is a keeper!</li>
    <li> Tried it this morning and I felt im heaven. Great scrub!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> Love this!!!Very impressed with how my skin looked and felt</li>
    <li> I used this product to help with cellulite.  It doesn&#x27;t get rid of it but minimizes it&#x27;s appearance some.  I wish the directions were more detailed, such as how many times per week is recommended use.  I could not get the bag to reseal after opening which was annoying.  There also isn&#x27;t a large supply in the bag.  This isn&#x27;t something I would plan to use every day for the rest of my life but would definitely purchase during summer pool season / before vacations.</li>
    <li> First let me be clear, I did not pay full price for this, I got a discount in order to test and review the product.  I am sure that makes you want to ignore everything I&#x27;m about to say, but please- don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the product comes in a resealable package. That&#x27;s pretty great because you can leave it in the shower and not worry about it getting wet or ruined. (You do have to make sure the track stays clear of grainy product or it takes a second to seal shut.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on to the good stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the single greatest scrub I have EVER used, and I have used A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is the most rich delicious smell I have encountered. Mine was coconut and I don&#x27;t know how to describe the small of coffee and coconut (I don&#x27;t even like coconut) but think of a morning on the beach with  your fresh coffee covered in coconut oil.  The grains consist of two types, the coffee grounds and the exfoliating ones.  They are mixed with an oil based product which makes sliding the product over your body less painful than some products I have had in the past which sort of felt like sandpaper.  When you rinse off your skin is so silky and shiny (the oil is like a really rich moisturizer that makes my skin have a natural shine and my legs look amazing...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had was the first time I took a bath I came back the next morning to what looked like a beach in my bathtub, so make sure you rinse out after you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be happy to answer ANY questions you have, I have already gone through my first package (it lasted about 3.5 weeks of every day application and use on the heavy side because I was trying to test it, I would expect about a month or more) and have purchased my second at full price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t account for all the scents, but after this next package I am going to experiment and will update my review.</li>
    <li> Wow what an amazing body scrub! Not only does it smell amazing but it makes my skin feel like silk!! I am in love!! I&#x27;ve suffered from dry skin for years and this product has changed my life. I will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> I give  this 5 stars. Smells so good. A little messy to use but that&#x27;s  why it&#x27;s  great to use in the shower or tub. Great exfoliation.  Left my skin soft and radiant.  So glad I jumped on this offer when I was given the  opportunity to review for an honest opinion.  My legs and buttocks also  looks plumper, meaning  less dimples</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!!  Keep you guys posted on results</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best scrub ever!  I love the scent, the texture, the way it leaves my skin so smooth!  This is the only scrub I will ever use again and completely recommend!</li>
    <li> Smells great j love the smell of chocolate and coconut all in one and leaves your skin smooth and feeling rich... Can&#x27;t wait to see the results I&#x27;ll get with this body scrub</li>
    <li> best stuff ever! works wonders</li>
    <li> I have decided to split my review into two categories - PROS and CONS, in order to hit some of my main points. As you can see I have given someONE&#x27;s coffee body scrub a rating of three out of five, so feel free to read my full review in order to find out why!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ As soon as I opened the bag I was greeted with a pleasant smell. The scrub smelled like fudge to me (weird....maybe my sense of smell is odd), but it was still amazing. While I applied the scrub to my whole body (along with the scrub&#x27;s bag open) in the shower, I felt like I was in heaven haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ I noticed and felt that my skin was smoother - it was so refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ After using this scrub I wanted to reseal it, but it was quite difficult to do so. This was because of the excess of coffee body scrub along the seals. You&#x27;d have to wipe the seal with a slightly wet paper towel in order to close the bag properly. It would be easier to have some sort of circular container (or anything easier) instead of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ When I applied the scrub and washed it off my body my skin was slightly itchy. I&#x27;m not sure if this is supposed to happen, but it did bother me quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ For 8oz of coffee body scrub, I do think this product should be cheaper. I was disappointed that the bag wasn&#x27;t full, but of course the picture of the bag on this page clearly states how many ounces. Although I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I believe the price should be $7-$8 instead of almost $15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have given someONE&#x27;s coffee scrub with dead salt a rating of 3/5 stars. This is due to the negatives I have listed. If the product could be improved in some ways (for example a larger oz for $15/cheaper price for an 8 oz, replace scrub&#x27;s bag with an easier container in order to grab the scrub or open + close it, etc) then I&#x27;d love to purchase this scrub again.c) then I&#x27;d love to purchase this scrub again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Scrub and all it&#x27;s benefits. So happy I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I love this body scrub. I love smell as well. Thanks to this product my skin is getting its natural color. I am so happy, I also like the fact that my skin feels a lot healthier. This product does not leave your skin greasy whatsoever. I recommend this product if you are trying to soften up your skin and get your natural skin color. You an smell the coconut, i love the smell. I am so glad i got a discount on this product by doing the daily reviewers deals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week. And while I can&#x27;t say much about the stretch marks or cellulite. BUT I can SAY I LOVE THE WAY MY SKIN FEELS. It&#x27;s not harsh or rough like other SCRUBS I&#x27;ve tried that actually scratched my skin. My skin feels amazing and I haven&#x27;t applied lotion in three days after showers. It also has smoothed my legs and sides of my arms where my skin was rough and bumpy. That IS HUGE FOR ME. I will recommend and continue use of this product. I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT for the PRICE listed. I DID NOT RECEIVE ANYTHING FOR MY REVIEW.  It&#x27;s just a really good product that has done something for me other scrubs have not been able to do.</li>
    <li> This product has a great scent and works very well.</li>
    <li> Very well formulated ... not too abrasive and just the right amount of moisture.  It is much less messy than many coffee scrubs.</li>
    <li> Great high quality product,  after the first use I  noticed how soft my skin is. Gives a little stinging sensation which I think is from the sea salt, but goes away immediately after rinsing.</li>
    <li> My skin feels amazing after using this product. It really exfoliates and moisturizes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure this product would have lasting benefits in reducing cellulite, but what I am sure of is this scrub smells wonderful and makes my skin feel just as wonderful after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this in hopes you will rid yourself of cellulite, but I would definitely recommend and a luxurious body treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Midwest Sea Salt Company provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
    <li> The smell hooked me before I used it. It is a perfect combination of the cacao, coconut and coffee. Wow! It feels good too. I just wanted to try it. I do not have any skin problems. But I am impressed with the reviews of those who do. I want my skin to stay healthy so I will be using this more. Thank you Midwest. I also soak in Himalayan salts, Milk baths, and Dead Sea Salt Baths. Your products are quality and ship fast.</li>
    <li> What a great scrub!  It smells great and leaves my skin looking and feeling wonderful!</li>
