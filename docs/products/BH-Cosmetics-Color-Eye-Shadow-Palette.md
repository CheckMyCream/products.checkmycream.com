<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> 2 colors were busted but after I cleaned that up they were very pigmented</li>
    <li> I love every color in this palette,,, very pigmented... They came even before expected date and well packed. I love it</li>
    <li> I was looking for an inexpensive palette for my halloween makeup and this is way better than I expected, the colors are super pigmented and they really last. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Great product... poor shipping. Some of the eyeshadows were broken, which was very disappointing. I would recommend using a better shipping supply.</li>
    <li> I tried this palette and it was amazing. I love the colors, very varied and they really stay for a long time. This is awesome and one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever done in my life. I highlyyy recommend this!!</li>
    <li> I orignal bought this for halloween but i find myself using it all the time, nice pigmentation and its cheap can&#x27;t beat that boo.</li>
    <li> very pigmented and easy to blend out! love the palette</li>
    <li> Colors are very pigmented and blendable.  Such a good value.  I used to only buy Mac eyeshadows but this has opened a door into a cheaper eyeshadow world!  I will buy BH Cosmetics again!!</li>
    <li> I like this a lot! My only complaint is that I wish there were a few more neutrals (and less shimmery ones), but other than that, it&#x27;s a good selection of colors for lots of options.</li>
    <li> first time using BH cosmetic product and I absolutly fell in love with these shadows. definetly ordering more of there products &lt;3 Great price &amp; totally worth trying!!</li>
    <li> Nice colors . Good customer support, fast receipt.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I saw this product got many great reviews and decided to give it a shot. So far so good! A little definitely goes a long way. My only complaint is the shadow definitely scatters or gets loose when being carried. However, I received it fine with no loose shadow. Anyway, definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I Love this Pallette I Use It Everyday !!!!!! Look EXACTLY like the picture I Will Be Back Soon Instagram : @OmbreTV</li>
    <li> Dont let the price fool you. Most people think cheap usually means not good but in this case that&#x27;s completely wrong! The pigment is great and very vibrant! The packaging was in good shape when received except that two were loose, but I can&#x27;t complain. It also arrived a day early what&#x27;s better than that?</li>
    <li> BUY IT FROM BH COSMETICS. not from anyone selling it for any cheaper. none of the colors got ruined during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;palette is legit perfect, they have shimmery colors and matte colors that all show up amazingly on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s pretty small so its good for traveling&lt;br /&gt;def save your money for it. fast shipping considering it went coast to coast in 2 days</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful and everything is in its place. The colors are beautiful and vibrant. Get this pallete, you will love it!</li>
    <li> Came pretty quick, and is a gift for a friends, but looks very nice. I will buy it for myself later.</li>
    <li> This is an Awesome product and a Great deal... having so much fun designing and creating new looks every day!!!</li>
    <li> YOU WILL NOT REGREAT BUYING THIS PALLET I RECOMMEND ALL OF THE BH COSMETIC PALLETS! ESPECIALLY THE BLUSHES AND EYESHADOWS</li>
    <li> This is a very good palette. High quality. I would like to recommend it. It&#x27;s a great product. Thanks so much</li>
    <li> Very disappointed I just got it today and a lot of the product is broken!!</li>
    <li> I really love this palette because there are so many colors and such a variety. My only complaint is that I wish it came with white. Many of the colors are petty dark for my fair skin, I use light coats. so even though they are small, it should last a while.</li>
    <li> Got this for my sister for Christmas after she complained about how all the other color eye shadow palettes she has used in the past are very light on her eyelids no matter how much she applies. I got her some primer and this palette, and she loves it! There were no broken colors either when it arrived. I&#x27;m probably going to get one for myself soon.</li>
    <li> Love the colors, definitely worth the price. Good for someone who is new to eye make up.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it has many colors but the quality of it was too cheap. But was a great deal.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend love this palette great service I will purchase again I recommend anyone to buy these palette all the colours are beautiful</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 BH pallets and both were so damaged they were unsalvageable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first timer to use makeup and this palette is good for starter like me&lt;br /&gt;So yes get one</li>
    <li> OH MY GOD the colors in this BH palette are just amazing!  they last the whole day and night with the perfect primer. It has all the colors I need. I can blend it perfectly. I&#x27;M SO IN LOVE WITH IT!</li>
    <li> The colors are amazing . The colors can be mixed and matched. Worth the price. I replaced all my eye shadows with this palete</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on a Thursday night with regular shipping and got it well before my ETA on a Saturday morning . the packaging was absolutely perfect .. it came in PERFECT condition and the colors are beautiful . i am in love with this product</li>
    <li> Great product on time will buy again soon ☺thank you</li>
    <li> I JUST LOVE THIS PALETTE IT HAS PERFECT PIGMENTATION AND THE COLORS ARE JUST PERFECT LIKE IT SAYS DAY AND NIGHT</li>
    <li> I just got the palette and the colors look just like the picture. I tried them out and work perfect and last all day.</li>
    <li> Great palette, colors are very pigmented and goes on smoothly and there is very little fallout. I am very happy with my purchase and will definitely recommend to my friends. I LOVE ALL MY BH PALETTES!!!!</li>
    <li> The colors are awesome&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it a lot but the neutrals are very pigmented and show up very pretty with a primer! :)</li>
    <li> I wanted to try the BH Cosmetics, because I saw a couple of reviews on Youtube with people using there products. Honestly, really don&#x27;t care for the product much, but I will continue to  use it for the times that I have enough time to play around with the product. When I have to be somewhere at a certain time, I use my old tried and true items, because it takes forever to get the shadow to get it the color you want after a thousand times. I recommend this products for teens or for a mom that lets her young daughter wear basic eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> Very pigmented.  I love the colors. I saw this pallete on YouTube and had to have it. Great makeup for the price.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant about buying makeup online, but I love this product!  I am in love with the colors in this palette.  Even though I have a light brown complexion, the colors blended very well with my skin color.  I can honestly say I have used all the colors, and I use this palette everyday since I bought it</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened this - I quickly realized I did not want powder all over my floors so I kept it in the box it came in - Every single eyeshadow pocket is EMPTY - ALL of the eye shadow is all over the inside of the box. If I wanted crushed chalk I should have just ordered that... Otherwise - NO I would absolutely NOT recommend this to ANYONE! Whether it was cheaply made or cheaply packaged it makes no difference when its all wrong...</li>
    <li> I really like the BH palettes - this one was a little smaller than I imagined, but still a decent size - the colors are very pigmented and last all day with primer.  I have only used it a few times, but I like it!</li>
    <li> Loved it the colors are very pigmented and with a primer they look even more vibrant! I will actually  be buying more stuff from bh cosmetics today!</li>
    <li> So many colors for such a great price! Long wearing and vibrant colors.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t have jenny&amp;#34;s name</li>
    <li> Love the pallette but when I finally received it, one of the eyeshadows had broken and got all over. That was a bummer, overall very nice colors.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister for Christmas,, she LOVED it. She&#x27;s very artsy and colorful, &amp; has a different look everyday so this kit really was a great gift for her :)</li>
    <li> Colors are great for daily use,  they are not photography friendly though because they are not so heavily pigmented.  Overall a great deal for everyday eye palette.</li>
    <li> I loveee this palette! It&#x27;s very pigmented and has enough colors to play with. I got it on time and in very good shape. I absolutely recommend this product! :)</li>
    <li> It was everything I needed it to be! Great palate with great colors to choose and mix and blend! Awesome</li>
    <li> I very much prefer this over the \\&quot;Party Girl\\&quot; one.  The color pigmentation is great and blends like a dream.  Lasts all day and the colors are great!  I don&#x27;t have to lug around so much makeup when i go on vacation since this palette pretty much as everything I need!  I just wish it had some more \\&quot;wash\\&quot; (skin tone)colors for blending.  But would repurchase :)</li>
    <li> Most of the colors are very pigmented and blendable.  I love how you can create subtle day looks or more dramatic night looks.  Shadows can be used wet or dry, or applied as liner. Check out the BH Cosmetics website for a video review and tutorial on how to use this versatile palette. I have a lot of palettes, but I do go to this one quite often.</li>
    <li> I think a lot of people are turned off by BH Cosmetics because their prices are so low, and we&#x27;ve all been burned before.&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, I was a MAC and Urban Decay girl through and through. Not anymore. This $18.00 Palette (which is actually only 8 bucks on their website, guys) is lovely. The pigment is great, although yes, like other reviewers I would suggest using a full coverage  primer or you won&#x27;t get the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this palette had a lot of brighter colors that I won&#x27;t end up using. I&#x27;m a dark, Smokey eye sort of girl. Let me tell you something if you&#x27;re like me, the black included in this Palette is the deepest, inkiest black I&#x27;ve used so far. I like putting a lighter black on first, and then this one for it to really pop.&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing this Palette on Amazon, I bought three more directly from their site. Give it a try, there&#x27;s no reason not too.&lt;br /&gt;Also - BH Cosmetics is a cruelty free company, so I don&#x27;t feel guilty about purchasing anything from them :)</li>
    <li> I am new to the make-up world and decided to start small when purchasing products. BH Cosmetics has great quality things for their price. There is some fall-out when placing the eye-shadows on, but I am sure this problem can be solved by purchasing a primer. I recommend NYX eye-shadow base, which amazon also sells. Overall, great product! Note: This is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Best eyeshadow palette hands down.....I love the the bright colors......will most definately buy again....I just love love it!!!!......Thank you Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> MY sister is a big fan of make up and i decided to get her this little diddy for her 40th birthday.  She loved it, she said that it was better then advertised.  She expected it to be a bit smaller but it wasn&#x27;t.  The Colors were everything she wanted and more.  I will be buying more BH Cosmetics in the future.</li>
    <li> I think the colors looked even better than in the picture online.  This palette is great quality for the money.  There is a whole wardrobe of colors, matte and shimmer, that can be used to create almost any eye makeup look.  The quality of the eyeshadows is also a pleasant surprise. There is good color payoff and a nice range of different colors that would suit anyone&#x27;s needs.  The eyeshadows are very small, about dime-sized.  But with so many colors and varieties of shade combinations, this should still last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this based on the recommendation of a youtube makeup person named Tanya Burr. She created some beautiful eye makeup looks with the palette and loves the product. She was right. I am very pleased. I also think these palettes could be good for people just starting out with makeup. This is a great way to get a quality product that will allow experimenting with any number of looks for an outstanding price.</li>
    <li> After reading through a few recent good reviews, I decided to give this a try. I played around with it a little as soon as I received the package today. It is more than what I expected it to be for such an affordable price.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! The colors are so pigmented that I can&#x27;t believe the price I paid. I get compliments and inquiries all the time about my eye shadow. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Hopefully its working fine. I gifted this and have not heard anything bad or wrong with it! I do know she loved it when I gave it to her.</li>
    <li> Had allergic reaction. But the colors are nice...</li>
    <li> Just received mine today and its everything I hoped it would be. All shadows were completely intact.&lt;br /&gt;Shadows are dime sized.</li>
    <li> I only reason i bought Bh bcuz my school bought them. I thought they be good makeup to start buying. I was wrong. The day look doesn&#x27;t show on my lid, and they look like its fading. I&#x27;m neutral skin tone. Day eyeshadow, all have like white basic no cool or warm basic. Few of the Day eyeshadow would not swatches. If i&#x27;m using a brush or my finger; I get no product coming out. I love the night look good for someone who is cool tone who love neutral and little bit of colors. How can a Night eyeshadow work the best better than the Day eyeshadow?</li>
    <li> A very nice palette with tons of super pigmented colors for lots of options! Given as gift and she loves it! Only thing is the shipping the dark green got crushed during shipping and was a shame cause the recipient would have loved that color but oh well that&#x27;s expected getting makeup shipped.</li>
    <li> Cute little compact packet. Great color/ product. Love the fact that i get all these color for this price, unlike other high end product. Thank BH</li>
    <li> This is a great palette. Amazing colors and actually very pigmented for the price. I love it. I would definitely repurchase it again.</li>
    <li> Nice palette with all the colors you need and great pigmentation. The colors are bright and stay on your eye well. Personally, for me, this doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as my higher end name brand eyeshadows so I don&#x27;t use this palette anymore, but my friends say they can&#x27;t tell the difference. I would recommend this to someone who uses a lot of different colors and doesn&#x27;t want to shell out for much more expensive palettes because, at the end of the day, it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Like it except some dont have color payoff I have to add eye drops to get the pigmentation I want.</li>
    <li> I received this package well packed and as soon as I open the cover.WOW!!! great colors&lt;br /&gt;I saw a You Tuber guru talking about this shadows and I decided to play with it, I am in love with the bright yellow, pink and blue. :-)</li>
    <li> Loved it. I took it with me on my vacation and it had every color I needed. Saved me from carrying excessive make up on my trip.</li>
    <li> This palette is amazing, i loved the shades of colors, work nice on my eyes  and the colors has long lasting.</li>
    <li> I really like this better than the 180 something color palette i bought.  but with any of them i would suggest also getting the NYX jumbo eyeshadow pencil.  I use it in Milk.</li>
    <li> Came new in packaging as requested. Great price for a good amount of make up! recommended from a youtube video :)</li>
    <li> This is a very simple palette but it has all the necessary colors for any day, any time and any event.</li>
    <li> My daughter is very happy with this palette. She says me : I love you dady</li>
    <li> So happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> This pallete is cool, sexy and fresh. I get so many compliments on my eyeshadow, easy to blend with the brush, colores are so rich and versitale :) a must buy!</li>
    <li> Great price for great product. I don&#x27;t do a lot of make-up but wanted to start having some eyeshadows for when needed. Normally but Mac but to start a collecting like that, it can get quite expensive. Decided to try BH Cosmetics and I really like the eyeshadow variety and product. You don&#x27;t have to get a lot of product to get the color you want.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging not so great. I had seen a lot of complains about how they arrive broken and no surprise there. The black shadow arrived in pieces. Recommendation, order the product by it self. Mine arrived on the bottom of other products that probably didn&#x27;t help with the movement of the box and the other products</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this product. You really get a lot for your money, just get a good paint stick or paint pot for your base and you&#x27;re all set. Nicely pigmented, you would not regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> Really good color payout and really nice colors for transitions.. I love to pair these colors from the palette with me neutral lid color in the crease (dark purple dark blue hot pink and the red just below the highlight color on my brow bone... I would def. recommend this palette!</li>
    <li> The colors are gorgeous, The palette is not too big, not too small. The colors aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;cheapy&amp;#34;, they are vibrant and strong. Perfect for us girls.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how affordable this is! I love it. Does have a little fallout but that can be prevented with a good primer before application. Colors are vibrant and soft. Very blendable and go where you put them. I am obsessed with this palette. I purchased a 24 pc brush set today... Can&#x27;t wait to try it out! HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS PRODUCT!</li>
