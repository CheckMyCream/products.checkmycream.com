      <li>The color is nice, but is this made for children???</li>
      <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s an okay wig for the price you pay.</li>
      <li>But with some styling you might be able to fix it.</li>
      <li>it is more curly then in the picture but its litterally stunning</li>
      <li>I am looking very good with red hair!</li>
      <li>This hair is amazing, brushable, and looks real!</li>
      <li>Absolutely fantastic.</li>
      <li>Just spray lightly and finger</li>
      <li>This wig is such great quality</li>
      <li>So fun to wear!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very cheap and made very well.</li>
      <li>It looks so good that she never wants to take it off! :-)</li>
      <li>More curly in real life.</li>
      <li>sexy... looks exactly like the picture right out of the box.</li>
      <li>It is Long and really curly , but you would have to wear a beanie or some sort of hat &amp;#34; DUE TO THINNER HAIR ON TOP TO WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE WIG NETTING.&amp;#34; But its perfect for a halloween costume , Not a cosplay event or Anything thats not just for one night .</li>
      <li>Really amazing wig - especially for the price.</li>
      <li>Its longer than i thought but still worth the buy.</li>
      <li>Actually comes all neatly coiled up and smooth - not shoved in a bag like so many wigs.</li>
      <li>bangs weren&#x27;t as long as I hoped but is very nice one of my favs so far.</li>
      <li>I am a little worried that when I wear it for several hours at a convention it might give me a headache, but for the  price its really an excellent buy</li>
      <li>The color is a more faded red than I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
      <li>I ordered the red and enjoyed it.</li>
      <li>The wig feels gross and tangles way to much, if you try to comb it you&#x27;ll end up with a bunch of shed....not pleased.</li>
      <li>I gave it 3 stars for fast shipping and overall looks ok at night.</li>
      <li>It was so pretty on her and much prettier in person than shown here.</li>
      <li>Surprising for such a long wig.  </li>
      <li>Tons of compliments on it, highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>The quality is fantastic and even though she&#x27;s brushed it a million times</li>
      <li>Once I braided it up and pinned it to my head strategically, the wig fit well enough.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t need much styling.</li>
      <li>This is a decent wig.</li>
      <li>Just like how it looks on here only a little brighter of red in real life, and very nice and curly.</li>
      <li>Super long.</li>
      <li>Red and really shiny~&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bought for my 11 year old daughter to wear in a film she&#x27;s making for school.</li>
      <li>Definitely a good purchase, but not an expensive quality wig.</li>
      <li>The hair seems very fine and thin on the scalp (and you must be careful how you pin your hair underneath to avoid lumps and unevenness) but further down the wig has excellent body, with enough volume to put curls over both shoulders and still have enough to drape down naturally in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is way too small to fit over anyones head</li>
      <li>There were no other places where the wefting showed or the hair</li>
      <li>(being that its harder to see the netting) but you cant pull this off as your real hair unless a barbie doll gave birth to you.</li>
      <li>Its easy to cover up, but it does mean that you must be careful how you part and style the wig.</li>

<li> I wear it casually, and it works for the most part.</li>
<li> Super thin and</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve purchased many inexpensive wigs so the price doesn&#x27;t really justify this crap.</li>
<li> Very cheap wig, sheds &amp; tangles like crazy.</li>
<li> However, I do have a normal sized head, and ALOT of thick hair.</li>
<li> The color is vibrant without being fake or unnatural, red with just enough ginger tones to keep it from being garish.</li>
<li> /&gt;like, very heavy red.</li>
<li> has hooks to adjust the wig tightness but can&#x27;t use them because they sewed down the loops.</li>
<li> Now lets talk about frizz Holy Cow little hair sticking up everywhere.and just putting it on made it nappy looking .theres</li>
<li> and the hairline is so odd</li>
<li> I was a bit disappointed though that right out of the package there were long strings of hair falling out.</li>
<li> the bangs are a little strange - almost like they are too thickly sewn.</li>
<li> but so shinny its not easy to fix with all the tricks to tone it down.</li>
<li> It would work well  for a Little Mermaid costume.</li>
<li> I could see using it a few times before the curls get too tangled.</li>
<li> I got the Red Wig and its Mega Thin an stringy almost or just like Barbie Hair.</li>
<li> wig cap is also a little small.</li>
<li> The wig shows poorly at the part - there are hairs sticking out sharply</li>
<li> Wig base is pretty horrid, but otherwise functions well.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s poorly made, the wig cap shows and it&#x27;s hellishly small.</li>
<li> and it takes a brush without shedding or frizzing too badly.</li>
<li> i also feel like the package was crap</li>
<li> Worst.</li>

    <li> Great wig! didn&#x27;t tangle...probably one of my favs</li>
    <li> This wig is beautiful. My daughter wore it to prom. It was so pretty on her and much prettier in person than shown here. Gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Purchased for one use but it has held up so well we&#x27;ve used it several times. Unlike cheaper wigs the hair stays on this one.</li>
    <li> Very nice i loved the style.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Use some wig conditioner SPRAY - not wash it. Just spray lightly and finger curl the ends. The wig shows poorly at the part - there are hairs sticking out sharply and you can see the tracks. But with some styling you might be able to fix it. I didn&#x27;t need to use heat, so I can&#x27;t attest to that. Bought for Ariel. Definitely a good purchase, but not an expensive quality wig. I could see using it a few times before the curls get too tangled. Brush after every wear.</li>
    <li> I got the Red Wig and its Mega Thin an stringy almost or just like Barbie Hair. It is Long and really curly , but you would have to wear a beanie or some sort of hat &amp;#34; DUE TO THINNER HAIR ON TOP TO WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE WIG NETTING.&amp;#34; But its perfect for a halloween costume , Not a cosplay event or Anything thats not just for one night . i also feel like the package was crap it literally comes in a ziploc baggy. Now lets talk about frizz Holy Cow little hair sticking up everywhere.and just putting it on made it nappy looking .theres just not enough hair on this wig. the color looks nothing like the picture. its a bit darker red then the picture but so shinny its not easy to fix with all the tricks to tone it down. I will not by again , and dont recommend you to either. I gave it 3 stars for fast shipping and overall looks ok at night. (being that its harder to see the netting) but you cant pull this off as your real hair unless a barbie doll gave birth to you.</li>
    <li> curls are great, length is wonderful, what is not so fun is the netting and the size.  it is way too small to fit over anyones head and the hairline is so odd, looks nothing like the bangs in the picture.</li>
    <li> Worst. Wig. Ever. The color is nice, but is this made for children??? It&#x27;s poorly made, the wig cap shows and it&#x27;s hellishly small.</li>
    <li> More curly in real life. Wig base is pretty horrid, but otherwise functions well. Great wig if you don&#x27;t need it to last.</li>
    <li> I used this wig for an Ariel Cosplay. It&#x27;s perfect. If you don&#x27;t know how to style wigs, this is also a pretty awesome wig. Doesn&#x27;t need much styling. The color is beautiful. Really amazing wig - especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This wig is such great quality it is more curly then in the picture but its litterally stunning I think everyone should get this wig she is an amazing unit!!!!!</li>
    <li> Wore it for a costume but people kept asking if it was real lol! Can&#x27;t believe how good of a wig this is for the price. So fun to wear! Comes wonderfully packaged and ready to wear with curls! Perfect.</li>
    <li> Super long. I am looking very good with red hair!</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very sexy... looks exactly like the picture right out of the box. Comes with the cap already inside, very good quality for the price!</li>
    <li> This is a decent wig. I was a bit disappointed though that right out of the package there were long strings of hair falling out. Otherwise it&#x27;s an okay wig for the price you pay. It&#x27;s a copper red.</li>
    <li> This wig is beautiful. The color is a more faded red than I&#x27;d hoped. It would work well  for a Little Mermaid costume.</li>
    <li> Very cheap wig, sheds &amp; tangles like crazy. But it served its purpose for the price, so I&#x27;m rating it accordingly.</li>
    <li> The wig came in on time and in great condition. Just like how it looks on here only a little brighter of red in real life, and very nice and curly. Perfect for what I needed and at a great price, I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I loved this wig. It was sterdy and playful. I ordered the red and enjoyed it. I wear it casually, and it works for the most part. Its longer than i thought but still worth the buy. I would recommend getting it if you know how to care for it only.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic. Actually comes all neatly coiled up and smooth - not shoved in a bag like so many wigs. Held it&#x27;s curl for the entire evening, as well as the next day! Tons of compliments on it, highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Red and really shiny~&lt;br /&gt;like, very heavy red. I love it!</li>
    <li> bangs weren&#x27;t as long as I hoped but is very nice one of my favs so far.</li>
    <li> Super thin and the color is totally different. I&#x27;ve purchased many inexpensive wigs so the price doesn&#x27;t really justify this crap. The wig feels gross and tangles way to much, if you try to comb it you&#x27;ll end up with a bunch of shed....not pleased.</li>
    <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;wig arrived well on time. The color is vibrant without being fake or unnatural, red with just enough ginger tones to keep it from being garish. I bought this wig for a Poison Ivy cosplay, but I could also seen the color working for a Mary Jane or maybe a Barbara Gordon cosplay as well. The texture of the wig is really excellent, smooth and silky and not too shiny. The length is good and the curls hold together quite well and it takes a brush without shedding or frizzing too badly. The hair seems very fine and thin on the scalp (and you must be careful how you pin your hair underneath to avoid lumps and unevenness) but further down the wig has excellent body, with enough volume to put curls over both shoulders and still have enough to drape down naturally in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Not as Good:&lt;br /&gt;The wefts one the bangs are a little strange - almost like they are too thickly sewn. Its easy to cover up, but it does mean that you must be careful how you part and style the wig. There were no other places where the wefting showed or the hair gaped.&lt;br /&gt;The wig cap is also a little small. However, I do have a normal sized head, and ALOT of thick hair. Once I braided it up and pinned it to my head strategically, the wig fit well enough. I am a little worried that when I wear it for several hours at a convention it might give me a headache, but for the  price its really an excellent buy</li>
    <li> It is so great. It&#x27;s very cheap and made very well. Perfect for my poison ivy cosplay</li>
    <li> Great wig! Bought for my 11 year old daughter to wear in a film she&#x27;s making for school. It looks so good that she never wants to take it off! :-) We buy a lot of dress up wigs and this is the best one yet. The quality is fantastic and even though she&#x27;s brushed it a million times it&#x27;s still silky with no frizz. Surprising for such a long wig.  So glad we ordered this!</li>
    <li> Worked great for my Ariel cosplay!</li>
    <li> has hooks to adjust the wig tightness but can&#x27;t use them because they sewed down the loops.</li>
    <li> This hair is amazing, brushable, and looks real!</li>
    <li> Came when stated. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Great quality i love it</li>
