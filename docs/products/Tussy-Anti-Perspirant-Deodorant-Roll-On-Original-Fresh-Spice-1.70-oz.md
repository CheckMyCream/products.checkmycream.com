<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great, the best out there.</li>
    <li> My mother used this deodorant all of her life and so have I. Since it has disappeared from the stores, I&#x27;m very thankful it can still be found on the internet. It has a subtle, clean smell and for me, the protection lasts all day. It will be a sad day when I can no longer find it online.</li>
    <li> For some reason Tussy is the only deodorant that works for me.  I have tried the more expensive &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; deodorants which have not worked for me.  Even in highly stressful situations, tussy never fails.  Why we can no longer purchase it at local stores, I will never understand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J. Lane</li>
    <li> I really like this deodorant, and that is why I was glad to find it at such a good price and don&#x27;t have to worry about it for a while.</li>
    <li> Not sure why this was discontinued in stores. I have tried every deodorant on the shelf and low and behold...this is the best ever for me.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter needed this she&#x27;s very young. Did want here to use adult formula.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant I have ever used. The price was always terrific, compared to the 3 and 4 dollar brands.  I was upset when Walgreens and then Wal-Mart stopped carrying it. Tried a few other brands, but nothing worked as well.  Recently my Wal-Mart has started selling it again...still at $1.00 each.  I buy some every time I go there and will continue in case they stop again.  Please check your local stores.</li>
    <li> This is the only antiperspirant my husband likes.  He says it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin and is far more effective than any others he&#x27;s tried.  He recommended it so highly, now it&#x27;s what we all prefer.</li>
    <li> This has been my favourite deodorant for many years and it is unavailable in stores so I am happy that it is available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product great price.</li>
    <li> The only arm deodorant that has ever worked for me. I will never switch. I have been using this for almost ten years. It helps!!! The smell is pleasant. Ordering was simple and received quickly!</li>
    <li> This item was purchased for a friend who has been using the product for years and couldn&#x27;t find the item in the store.</li>
    <li> I only wish they still sold this product in stores.  This is the only deodorant I can wear and I love it.  This is very old school products.  Thanks.  Will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> I still love the Tussy antiperspirant/deodorant roll-on.  However, the new label on the container slips off the bottle much too easily.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Is the only thing that I have found that will keep me dry on the hottest and most stressful days!  Fantastic smell!  Went way beyond what I had hoped for!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this deodorant.  Doesn&#x27;t give him a rash and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best deorants ever made!!&lt;br /&gt;Great that we can still buy it this way!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recomend for all people, specially those that likes protection!</li>
    <li> good grief for your requirements.  KISS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great value 9 big bang for the buck0 &amp; effective and great scent 9spice/cinnamon &amp; cloves. oh com on now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant for over thirty years and it has never let me down.  The price is also outstanding.</li>
    <li> Tussy has been my brand since high school...difficult to find in my area...appreciate you still having my favorite available......to order on line.</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant for few reasons: 1) there is no specific smell in it, it is very neutral; 2) it is clear and does not leave stains; 3) can be taken into carry on , does not have to be checked in!- very important; 4) it provides wonderful odor control  . I once bought this deodorant in Wal-Mart and did not see it since that one time.  Was happy to find it on line</li>
    <li> I was happy to find Tussy on-line because I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores. I&#x27;ve been using Tussy for over 50 years and have found it works better than any other anti-perspirant that I&#x27;ve tried.  I especially like the roll-on variety.</li>
    <li> This product is becoming hard to find,  my best friend was glad when I located it for her on Amazon.  She said it is great and helps prevents flare-ups and allergic reactions.  The price is not the best but when you can not find it anywhere it really is not too bad.</li>
    <li> I love Tussy!  It is the only deodorant that I can use.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years...many years..when I was having difficulty finding it on the shelves I was really upset.  I does the job, it is not heavy, it has no odor and lasts all day.  I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon..</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the original and they sent&lt;br /&gt;me spice. It smells more for a man.</li>
    <li> Dad&#x27;s favorite deodorant. This is the only place I can find it for him.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant since my 20&#x27;s and I&#x27;m a grandmother now.  It&#x27;s always been effective for me through the years. Enough said.  I just hope it never gets discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using Tussy Deodorant from the time I started using deodorant.  We are talking 60 years.  i hope I can still find it in the next few years</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant. I used to sweat like a man. Not with this deodorant. Will keep this company in business as long as I live.</li>
    <li> I have used this deodorant for many years.  It is effective but mild enough not to be irritating.  Glad it is still available.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for more than thirty years.  It is sometimes hard to find in stores.  It is easy to order from Amazon as it comes right to my front door.</li>
    <li> This deodorant (Tussy) is hard to find in my area. I found it here at a reasonable price.. will be making more purchases in the future.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is the best. I swear by it. I went to a wedding in the afternoon and it was outside and it was 90 degrees and usually I would smell but with this deodorant it completely covered any smell.</li>
    <li> My favorite for 40 years. Feels and smells exactly like the product I&#x27;m used to . Very happy to have found it again.</li>
    <li> Very effective, but this is not for sensitive skin. It is very strong.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find Tussy deodorant in stores for years and was thrilled to find it online at Amazon!  I have sensitive skin and this is the only deodorant that I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause itching. I recommend it for everyone!</li>
    <li> I have used this deodorant for many years. It became very hard to find in stores . Great protection without all the hoopla and fluffy scents of other products.</li>
    <li> I could not find this great smelling deodorant in any of my local stores.  I was very thankful that it was available on Amazon.  I had a substitute deodorant that I threw out immediately, upon arrival of my 6 pack!</li>
    <li> If you have never used this stuff, try it!!!!! You will never buy another kind of Deodorant again</li>
    <li> This is my favorite.  Used it in cream form when I was very young.  I much prefer this liquid and love the scent.  I&#x27;ve looked for it so many places with no luck.  Probably will use it always.</li>
    <li> As expected. I have used Tussy for years and was having trouble finding it in stores. I am glad I found it on line.</li>
    <li> Co-worker has me order this for her. Only kind that she can use.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have loved it all my life. I am 61 years old and my grandmother started me on Tussy.  She used to buy it by the cases. It has gotten hard to find in the stores. Family Dollar use to carry it, but it stopped a little over a year ago. This is what made me turn to the internet to  find it.  It is a shame that shipping and handling cost just as  much as the product. I bought 13 bottles for about 25.00 and shipping and handling was 24.95.  Ridiculous. I will be researching other options before I run out again.  Mainly to write the company that makes it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why retail stores no longer sell this great product.  Used it for years..it is effective with no allergies, caking or unpleasant residue.  Loved finding it on Amazon and buy several at a time.</li>
    <li> if you have sensitive skin--scent not over powering//using for years same results//can&#x27;t find in stores any more//cost effective</li>
    <li> Works the best for me.</li>
    <li> tHE DELIVERY CAME SOONER THAN EXPECTED.  i WOOULD TELL MY FRIENDS ABOUT THE EAASE IN ORDERING.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH</li>
    <li> Loved it.  My favorite.</li>
    <li> Both this &amp; the powder fresh have a nice scent, they work great for men or women &amp; their size is just right to also take on the road (i.e. TSA carry-on).</li>
    <li> I remember as a child having to dig my hand in the can of tussy and I hated it always getting under my nails. My grandmother swears up and down that this deorderant is discontinued. I just swoop in and save the day everytime she runs out by placing an order. She loves the roll on. She couldn&#x27;t believe they make roll on now haha. Love this stuff for the memories it brings back and the smile it gives my grandmother. I don&#x27;t wear it bit she swears by this stuff and the smell is classic.</li>
    <li> Came quickly.  Packaged well.  Delighted to find it, since it is no longer available on the shelf anywhere I shop.  Best deodorant ever!</li>
    <li> I have used tussy since I was just old enough to use deodorant...I am 80 yr. old now!!  i never had an alergy to it, and i liked the fresh scent!  MY OLDER SISTER EVEN WROTE A LITTLE DITTY ABOUT IT AS I HAD DYED MY HAIR THE YEAR I WAS A SR. IN HIGH SCHOOL.  &amp;#34; WHY OH WHY DID YOU DYE YOU HAIR, TO CHANGE WHAT GOD GAVE YOU...WASN&#x27;T FAIR.  GREN BOUGHT YOU GOOD CLOTHES, TOOTS MADE YOU USE TUSSY...AND ALL YOU TURNED OUT WAS A RED HEADED HUSSY!  I STIL HAVE IT IN MY MEMORY BANK!!  IT IS BEYOND ME WHY TUSSY EVER CAME OFF THE SHELVES IN STORES.. IT IS A ROYAL PAIN TO HAVE TO ORDER IT THRU AMAZON..NOTHING AGAINST AMAZON...  BUT JUST HAVING TO PLACE THE ORDER AT MY AGE BECOMES A TASK..  GERT LAHAY</li>
    <li> Loved it. Used it for years.</li>
    <li> Being allergic to many scents, this does not activate my allergies and provides a clean,safe protection without spending a mint!</li>
    <li> Ladies, I work out, travel and consider myself very into all the new products.  I also spend a fortune on my professional clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I know Tussy will not ruin any of my fabrics.&lt;br /&gt;It has been the most reliable product that I have used for years.  Too bad they are not considered a newer product today.&lt;br /&gt;But then again, a classic is a classic!!!  And we all know who we are!!!  Toochay!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works better than any other deodorant i have used. Smell reminds me of middle school...in a good way.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Received on time.</li>
    <li> THIS IS  THE ONLY BRAND MY WIFE WILL USE....HIGHLY RECOMENDED. SHIPPED QUICKLY. I BUY A BUNCH EVERY CHRISTMAS FOR HER.....</li>
    <li> Wonderful product....daughter has found relief from overproductice sweat glands!!</li>
    <li> It was just what I ordered.  Have used this product for many years.  Sandals  were what I needed and expected.</li>
    <li> Have used this deodorant most of my life.  My grandmother used it and introduced me to it.  I LOVE the way it smells but more importantly, the way it works.  You really can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, at least not the roll on.  It is a great value too.  Gotta love finding just what you need on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant. It is the only one I can use that doesn&#x27;t have the illuminum chemical/metal that gives me a rash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it all my life; no side effects; works perfectly.  The price is right.  HOpe it gets back in local stores.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if this was going to work for me, but after using it for a couple of weeks, I was sold.  It has a middle of the road scent that&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
    <li> Tussy seems to be the only deodorant my 91 year old dad can use that does not break him out. Impossible to find in the stores so I really appreciate finding it on line. Thanks much.</li>
    <li> This old-fashioned deodorant and anti-antiperspirant is still the best.  It is easy to apply, very effective at perspiration and odor control and has a delicate, lovely (slightly spicy?) scent.  It has become harder and harder to find in stores -- I really hope it continues to be available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this deodrant. Just wish it was still sold in the store. But at least I have Amazon!  :)</li>
    <li> Just like it was in the good ole days&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased&lt;br /&gt;Was always my favorite</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would order again</li>
    <li> After trying just about every deodorant out there, I finally found this product.  Tussy smells great even the next day.  I&#x27;m just wondering though how Amazon is able to sell it, when they stopped using aluminum in Deodorants due to a link in Breast Ca. some years back.  Aluminum is the first ingredient listed on the back of Tussy&#x27;s label.</li>
    <li> Since  this is only way to purchase, I was glad to find it.&lt;br /&gt;The expiration date of 2015 may explain why it is not easy&lt;br /&gt;to apply the liquid.  &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; purchased in past easier to use.</li>
    <li> My wife seems to be allergic to most anti-perspirant but this is works great for her. In fact it&#x27;s no longer sold locally and I have to order it from Amazon and we&#x27;ve been doing that for a couple of years now. Anyway, she won&#x27;t use anything else so let&#x27;s hope they don&#x27;t go out of business.</li>
    <li> i was so very pleased to find this product on your web site!  my mom and i both use this brand and have difficulty locating it in the stores in this part of the united states.  it&#x27;s so easy to use!  we will definitely be repeat customers!</li>
    <li> it works well amd lives beyond my expectations</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every deodorant out there. I tried all the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength....the super strength.. you name it and I&#x27;ve tried it. It always failed me at the end of the day. I saw great reviews for Tussy and decided to try it.  So far it is great! The big test is in the summer! I will write an updated review in the summer when I sit on the beach baking in the sun :-)</li>
    <li> Product is very hard to find in stores so was happy to find it on Amazon.  Came in the small compact size deodorant roll-on.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Actually my husband uses it and won&#x27;t use anything else.  It is never available in our local stores so I always order on line.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service.  Second order for this product.  Will order again when needed.  a.  b.  c..d.  eee.  ff.  g.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since my teens and it is getting increasingly harder and harder to find.  I was pleased with my last purchase and the ease with which I found the help I needed on Amazon.  However, since I bought it in December the postal time was lengthy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 40 years, and more consistently over the past 25 years.  The formula is very basic and doesn&#x27;t clash with fragrances, or cause rashes or clog pores.  I prefer the roll-on to creams and solids, regardless of the brand.  However, the \\&quot;original Tussy\\&quot; is an old favorite that performs faithfully, and does was it is meant to do, which is to stop odor and excessive perspiration.  It&#x27;s mild, yet very effective.  Other brands either loose their effectiveness over a short time, or you use more of them and get small results.  With Tussy you get pure protection.  It&#x27;s a must have....!</li>
    <li> Best deodorant in the world - lasts all day and then some...annd amazon is like the only place you can get it now!</li>
    <li> Been using for years.  It works and is less expensive than better know products.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the quick service.  This the only deodorant that I like.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for many years - a wonderful mild fragrance and never irritates the skin.</li>
    <li> I have used Tussy Anti-perspirant Dedorant for years.  Do know why the stores stopped selling this product.  I do not plan on changing products.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant can&#x27;t buy in stores. So glad I found it on Amazon. I will continue to purchase them.</li>
    <li> Tussy is a good deordorant.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for years and am totally satisfied with it..i wouldn&#x27;t change and use any other.</li>
    <li> Great, I no longer have yellow stains on my under shirt. The smell is not over powering and it last all day while I am at work.Great value</li>
    <li> My mom loves this product for her, she asked me to order it for her.</li>
    <li> good service and product.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL!  THhs shipper was so good, product came the very next day.&lt;br /&gt;Could not believe how prompt it was and it was terrific packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Very, very good, would so buy again from this marketplace server.&lt;br /&gt;I love this deodorant, and cannot buy it near where I live, so this is wonderful for me..</li>
    <li> Fantastic items! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have used this deodorant for years and it is the most effective one that I have found. I have always been able to get it anywhere, but have not found it in any of the drugstore chains. The main reason I like it besides it effectiveness, is that it one that I have no reaction, like rash and itching and is totally effective as a deodorant and antiperspirant. Go Tussy!!!</li>
    <li> Tussy Roll-On Deodorant is the best!  And now we&#x27;re having a hard time finding it...  :(  It keeps either men or women fresh all day long with no offensive fragrance.  My family (starting with my grandparents) has been using this product for five generations.  It also prevents underarm stains on clothes.  I&#x27;ve never seen any other product do that...  PLEASE continue making it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. The aroma is devine.  Not at all offensive as most antiperspirants are.</li>
    <li> love the smell of spice and it really works and hold all day</li>
    <li> I like how it keeps me feeling fresh through out my daily tasks. I really like it very much &amp; glad I found that I can order online.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best product around, it&#x27;s the best anti-perspirant/deodorant for me! I always buy this product since its the only one that keeps me dry and odorless all day long.</li>
