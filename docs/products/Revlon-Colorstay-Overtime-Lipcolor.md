    <li> I love this lipstick, but my shade is harder and harder to find.  It must be discontinued.  I found 2 on Amazon recently and will continue to seek it out.  Wonderful.  Doesn&#x27;t chap my lips like other long lasting brands.</li>
    <li> I like it so much that I will be in trouble if they ever discontinue it.</li>
    <li> I love this!  The color is dark but neutral enough to wear day or night.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips, and the color really does stay on all day!</li>
    <li> This is my perfect color and one application a day last all day. I recommend this product to my family and friends. They can choose whichever color they prefer.</li>

    <li> I love the color and the gloss. It lasts all day on me and does not dry out my lips.  I&#x27;ve bought it several times and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Perfect color but dries up too fast.  Especially the longer stay part of it.  But I find it the best suites as a base for reds and oranges.</li>

    <li> This revlon Colorstay Overtime lipcolor does not rub off!  It will stay on all night, you can eat and drink and it is still on!</li>
    <li> Revlon needs to bring back this color! It&#x27;s a huge crime to discontinue it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Apply once in the am and you are good for the day. Sometimes I reapply to deepen the color (or after having a meal) but not always. Nothing better than always having my lip on! I am on auto delivery!</li>
    <li> Lipstick I received was in correctly marked visible packaging but contents did not match label. Not worth returning due to high postage.</li>
