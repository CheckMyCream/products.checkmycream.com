<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is useless. I have no idea how anyone has rated it 4-5 stars before. I used the sponge twice, and it has already disintegrated into little black pieces. This is ridiculous. Absolute waste of money. I am so disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with konjac sponge.  It works as I expected but does take much longer to dry than expected.  Delivery was prompt and customer service was great.</li>
    <li> LOVE it....I&#x27;ve been using it for about 1.5 weeks now and my skin feels amazing! Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Great merchandise...great seller...will use again</li>
    <li> Love how clean my face feels!</li>
    <li> After just one weekend of use, I asked a friend whether she saw any difference in my skin. She admitted that my skin coloring was so much more even that she&#x27;d assumed I&#x27;d started wearing powdered foundation. I use the sponge every other day with a little bit of my regular cleanser, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results; along with fewer breakouts, my skin also feels softer than it used to and isn&#x27;t as oily at the end of the day as it was before I learned about the Konjac Sponge.</li>
    <li> Just used this sponge today and i love it .. its soft and gentle..so much better than my hands or facecloth .i felt like i was having a facial .The suction cup and string to hang are a great idea ! The customer service is amazing ..they have  emailed me to see if the product arrived .and to answer any questions i had ....</li>
    <li> Very cool product I love using it. And it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
    <li> soft and elastic. great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Works great as intended. Got the smooth skin after using it 3 days so far.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product..... I have spent a lot of money on different products and I thought too myself this is just another product that isn&#x27;t going too do whst it says but for the price I will try it..... I am VERY happy I did..... It does exactly what it says I use it EVERY DAY (I do not have sensitive skin though) I do have too say I read a review with pictures and almost again didn&#x27;t get it but for the price (and I have Prime it wasn&#x27;t much)  None of what that lady said happened with my sponge.... It hasn&#x27;t shrank it doesn&#x27;t leave particles...... I followed the instructions and wet and then wring it out and hang it outside my shower too dry..... I absolutely LOVE THIS PRODUCT....</li>
    <li> Love the sponge.  I will never be able to cleanse my face with anything else, after using this product. I love the way it fees, gentle, fresh, clean, and great for exfoliation.</li>
    <li> I recieved the sponges about 2 weeks ago. I have used them everyday and it leaves my face flushed and very smooth. (When my wrinkles totally disappear I will let you know. :)  I certainly recommend them to any one. Thank you for a great product, timely delivery and you have been great in your wanting feedback, good or bad. I have only good things say.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a great product!!  I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin feels!!  I will definitely continue to use the cleansing sponges and pass along my experience to anyone who will listen!!</li>
    <li> I only used the sponge a few times so I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge different I expected the sponge to be the rough exfoliating kind but once it&#x27;s wet it&#x27;s very soft.</li>
    <li> Received the correct amount I ordered. Was quick to arrive. Although I haven&#x27;t yer tried the product, it appears as expected.Overall Superb ! Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought set of Derma Roller, Activated Charcoal sponge, Retinol cream, Vitamin C Serum. So this reviews for all of them. I am going for 51 years. I always took care my skin, so I do not have big wrinkles. However, I have combination skin, easy breaks out, huge pores. And I noticed expensive cream do no shows effect anymore. I started looking, went to dermatologist, but not much new there. So, I did some research, realized my skin just got used to all those the same ingredients  much or less in every famous skin care product line. I decided to look and try something different, organic. Few tries were not impressive. I run into these products and decided to try. I waited 3 weeks before this review. I want to be honest. So, here it goes:&lt;br /&gt;1. None of skin care product will work, until you prepare skin by properly cleaning, exfoliating it. I am using simple Cetaphil cleanser for combination skin. And then Charcoal sponge. This sponge really helps to exfoliate and cleaning pores very well. I noticed the difference in less and less blackheads. Also, I noticed cream and serum absorbs much better.&lt;br /&gt;2, Three times a week I am using Derma roll. It does stings a little. But I noticed that my skin coming alive after this.&lt;br /&gt;3. Then I use C serum. My skin very easy gets those ugly brown spots, sun spots, liver spots, whatever it called. After 3 weeks I noticed those spots started lighting up, few small one barely seen. Without doubts I see the results not worse if not even better that very expensive procedures.&lt;br /&gt;4. Last step is Retinol. Only at night, I do not use it in the morning , since my skin is really react on sun. And retinol can increase this sensitivity. I do see the positive results: the line between the eyebrows got less noticeable, lines around the mouth not that deep anymore. And pores noticeably smaller.&lt;br /&gt;One very important thing for me - no break outs! At all!&lt;br /&gt;So I will continue to use these products and will look what else this seller has.Really like natural ingredients and good results.</li>
    <li> I just started using these sponges and I love them.They are much gentler than exfoliating cloths. My skin is so much smoother now.</li>
    <li> I work in a very dirty Job I am constantly being exposed to hazardous chems and dust. These things work well to keep the resultant skin irritation to a complete minimum. I recommend these.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I have finally found a product that cleans and softens and even lessens the pain of acne as it is being applied.&lt;br /&gt;You just have to try it. I think it is a family owned, small business that deserves to be praised for it&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;FANTASTIC! I have Allergy, gluten issues and IT WORKS like nothing else I have tried! I have tried everything. I just can&#x27;t explain how or why. I am going to tell a lot of people about this product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I never heard of Konjac Sponges before until I saw them in target several weeks ago.  I decided to look in amazon and ordered  the La Lune Naturals brand. It came in two days in a great package.  I have been using it for a week,  and I already see a different in my skin.  I have  sensitive and dry skin so I was a little sketical about this sponge.  It is great.  My face feels soft and very clean.  I will keep using this sponges forever.</li>
    <li> The sponge is a lot softer than imagined it left my face nice and soft</li>
    <li> A gentle and nice cleansing sponge.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! will order again when these 2 wear out</li>
    <li> Better than the best facial. Love love love it</li>
    <li> I purchased this and it&#x27;s okay if all you want is something like a regular sponge. If you ask me and doesn&#x27;t do much more than my washcloth. I had higher hopes for it and wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with the product. Service was great, packaging is good and the suction cup to hang it on is a nice perk, but it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate my face at all like it says. So I&#x27;ll have to look for another product that can accomplish that for me.</li>
    <li> Came on time.  2 sponges and like a usual small suction cup with a hook. Very nice and was pleased that they give you 2 sponges. Also included the instructions if your a 1st time user,  which is to soak your new sponge in like a bowel of water to get it softened.  Don&#x27;t ring out or twist the sponge either... I&#x27;d give them 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Yes I received my product on suggested time frame, also I do like the sponges I cannot compare to any other because these are the first sponges I&#x27;ve used for cleansing my face.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  It works great on your face and leaves it feeling clean.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product, but im not 100% sure it&#x27;s actually helping with anything that a washcloth couldn&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> The sponge is soft and my skin feels very clean afterwards. However, pores look to be the same size and texture doesn&#x27;t look much smoother after three weeks of use. No breakouts or pimples during use, so very gentle product!</li>
    <li> Nice facial massage in a sponge...love the activated charcoal which makes my face feel clean.  Just wish it was slightly larger.</li>
    <li> Really makes the skin feel smoother.  I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 weeks and am looking forward to seeing what else it can do.  So far, positive.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of this sponge. Would not buy again</li>
    <li> I have to tell you that I have tried many many products but this one is the best. My skin has a noticeable pore cleansed look in only 4 days of use.  It is gentle on your skin while it cleanses.and you can feel the difference of clean when you rince your face. I always had trouble on the sides of my nose....not anymore.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  I gave the extra sponge as a gift........just a bonus point:}}</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me...</li>
    <li> Very nice, face-sized pair of sponges. They are on strings and come with little suction cups for hanging where you use them. The strings don&#x27;t get in the way of the sponge. It&#x27;s nice to be able to cleanse a little if I&#x27;ve been bare-faced all day or in the morning to wash away the sleepy feelings. The sponge is rough enough to feel like it&#x27;s wiring without ripping up my skin. The charcoal gives an extra cleaning boost if I use the sponge with a cleanser. I cannot say for certain I&#x27;ve seen dramatic results, but I do feel it cleans my mid-40s, dryish skin without causing any weird effects. I also appreciate the biodegradability of the sponge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller is proactively concerned about customer satisfaction and was prompt with delivery. I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love how this sponge makes my face feel, it leaves it so soft and feels clean. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Yes...these work great and the seller is awesome! Will buy again😄</li>
    <li> I only got the sponges yesterday, but I&#x27;ve used it twice and my skin feels very soft. I have a tendency to over-scrub when I exfoliate, but this is so gentle- I couldn&#x27;t over-do it if I tried! It is just a really nice, pampering change from rough old washcloths.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
    <li> These sponges left my face really smooth. I used it to exfoliate before using my face wash and it worked really well. I&#x27;ve read reviews that says you can put your face wash on it and then rub on your face but I felt like it just soaked up my face wash, so I wet my face/ neck a little first, use the sponge, and then use my fingers to massage the face wash all over my face and neck. I have a combination skin type and I have definitely noticed a different in the level of oil on my face. It may be a combination of this and the Murad facial cleanser that I&#x27;m using but either way, before I had these sponges, there was not much difference in the amount of oil. Now that I have the sponges, I can&#x27;t wash my face without using this before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be buying these sponges again! Hopefully with a different activator just to see which works best for my face.</li>
    <li> This sponge is great for cleansing. The company is responsive and helpful as well. The two sponges last for a few months each so its worth the price .</li>
    <li> Great charcoal sponges. MUCH better price than the ones I was buying from sephora.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges and will get getting more! Awesome Product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit when I first purchased one of these I really didn&#x27;t see what all the fuss was about, but at the time I was only using it once in awhile, once I started using this after the gym everyday I really started to see a difference and my complexion looked better and better. I was previously using these alone but recently started adding a pump of Cerave cleanser and both of those together really leave you with soft clear skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the sponge for a little over a week I use it every day. However, it does say to use without a cleanser, but when I do my face does not feel clean. So I use the sponge with the charcoal soap that I bought for my face and get a great clean that way. The sponge is gently exfoliating and is very nice to clean your face with.</li>
    <li> I used my new Konjac Sponge last night.  I have combination skin with some flakiness on my cheeks.  This morning when I woke up, I was pleasantly surprised at the softness of my skin, no flakiness or dryness.  I also have some very stubborn whiteheads.  Guess what?  One of the whiteheads opened on the surface this morning after using my sponge.  I was using BuffPuffs in the past and they were too abrasive.  Customer service from La Lune Naturals is also outstanding.  I emailed a question asking about the care of the sponge to La Lune Naturals and received an immediate response.  My sponge didn&#x27;t dry overnight but the weather has been humid lately in Hawaii.  I&#x27;ll ensure I hang my sponge where there&#x27;s more ventilation.  I love the Konjac Charcoal Sponge and recommend it wholeheartedly!</li>
    <li> I love the feel of these on my face. They are so soft and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m pulling on the delicate skin on my face and neck. I will not use washcloths ever again. I like not needing to use cleanser unless I want to and my face still feels clean.  I Know one in the shower would be great.  Pretty sure they make bigger ones.   Try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Good product-easy &amp; convenient.</li>
    <li> One of the things that I like about this company is that you get two sponges in each box. I keep one of them in the shower &amp; the other one hanging near the bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve used a Konjac Sponge before, I already knew that they would look &amp; feel like a piece of styrofoam when I took them out of the plastic. But all you have to do is soak them in warm water for about 30 - 60 seconds &amp; they will plump up to feel really soft. Then just press it between your palms to squeeze the excess water out of the sponge &amp; you&#x27;re ready to use it.&lt;br /&gt;The sponge fits right into the palm of my hand. It feels really good when I massage my face &amp; does not cause any of the redness or irritation like those gritty exfoliating scrubs. I have somewhat sensitive skin but have not experienced any problems at all from using this product. It makes my face feel really soft &amp; smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes use my regular cleanser along with the sponge but I have found that I don&#x27;t need to use as much as I normally use. When I am finished, I just rinse the sponge, press it again between my palms to squeeze out the water &amp; then hang it up on the suction cup hook that is included in the box.&lt;br /&gt;And I love that this product is cruelty-free &amp; biodegradable!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I was not required to write a positive review &amp; the opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a konjac sponge, this is the one for you.  Not only is it a great product, which we use when we wash our face, it&#x27;s a great deal.  I specially like the size, it is bigger than the one sold by PureSol, plus you get 2 for a couple bucks more. The size matters because it&#x27;s easier to hold when scrubbing your face, I struggled holding on to the small one.  I have attached a picture and you will see the difference. I put a toothpaste cap for size reference.</li>
    <li> Konjac sponges are part of my daily skin routine. They gently exfoliate without being harsh or rough on the delicate skin areas, and they work for all skin types. Worse thing about emollient exfoliators is that they can seriously irritate the skin and actually cause the skin to produce more oils to heal the skin, in turn those extra oils clog pores and cause massive breakouts. Once the Konjac sponge is saturated with water, the vegetable fibers become soft as silk. So when you gently buff your skin, its very gentle. Since there are no chemicals or other irritants, it leaves the skin naturally clean and fresh. All I use is an oil free moisturizer with SPF for daytime afterwards, or coconut oil at night time to lock in moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is especially good because of the activated charcoal, which helps detoxify your skin from pollutants and debris, and it absorbs oils without drying out your skin. This one come with a little bitty hook that you can place on your vanity mirror so you can hang your sponges (this prevents residue and mildew from forming on the sponge). Great product.</li>
    <li> These sponges are great. I use them in the shower to wash my face and they have a string on them so you can hang them up to dry on your shower hook</li>
    <li> Great product! My skin is sensitive to soaps and many other products, so not needing anything but the sponge to clean and exfoliate is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I am seriously in love with these La Lune charcoal konjac sponges. I used a different brand for a plain konjac sponge around a year ago and it was okay, nothing to write home about, I even forgot about it and stopped using it. Not so with these; I look forward to washing my face in the morning with them. The texture is soothing, there arent any odd smells, and having a rounded and a flat side make it super easy to adjust to the contours of your face. I havent used them with soap, just warm water, but my facial skin looks good. I am pregnant, and not the pretty glowy skin kind either. My face has been dull and uneven no matter what I do. Within 2 or 3 days of using the La Lune charcoal sponge I noticed I was less dull and more even. To be fair, I am also approaching the third trimester, so hormones could be playing their role, but I credit the sponge. I buff my face in circular motions with it for about 2 or so minutes. (So long largely just because it feels so nice!) I do have pretty sensitive skin, but I have not reacted poorly at all and I have been using it for roughly 2 weeks. So see, it doesnt take long to fall in love with them! I am giving these to all the women on my holiday gift list this year, that is how strongly I endorse this product. I look forward to trying other La Lune products since this one is so wonderful.</li>
    <li> I had a pimple on my chin and I picked it..........I know,  shouldn&#x27;t do it, however, was going out with the girls and I had this dime size scab on my chin.  I bruised it terrible,  this sponge came in the mail.  I used this sponge for 3 days and honestly it worked and got rid of the pimple/scab and I used very little cover up.  I will always use these sponges,  THEY WORK ! ! !</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my face feel. Only takes a minute or two to soak and get soft, but it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. My skin is so sensitive I can&#x27;t use facial cleansers too much. This is the perfect alternative for me! It also gently exfoliates.</li>
    <li> I ordered these sponges, because I wanted something a little bit different than a Olay Brush system. They soften up very quick when soaked with warm water for 5 minutes and work really well on their own or paired with my Lush cleansers. I&#x27;ve not had these a week, and they both are already showing heavy signs of deterioration. When I hang they to dry they shrink considerably in size, but I believe that is the cause of them breaking down so fast. These sponges are excellent for sloughing off dry winter skin, but I had hoped they would last longer than what they are demonstrating. I&#x27;m not sure if purchasing a different brand or even a different color sponge would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the first picture, I show the sponge breaking apart (the little black bits) when it soaks in water. The second picture is after use: a huge hole is starting for form on the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: One of my sponge has now broken down into three pieces. It lasted no where near the &#x27;use for 2-3 months&#x27;. Even though the sponges are useful, I can&#x27;t recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/24/15: La Lune sent me a new set of sponges. The quality of the new sponges I received are dramatically better. I am extremely impressed with La Lune&#x27;s professionalism, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order from this company again. Thank you, La Lune!</li>
    <li> My first time using a charcoal sponge. Arrived quickly. I can use less cleanser and my face feels amazing after washing.</li>
    <li> Love it! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Nothing super special. I bought it thinking it would be a good way to exfoliate my skin but it didn&#x27;t do much. I perfer a wash cloth.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much for me to be honest.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
    <li> Sponge feels SO slimy after it gets wet!</li>
    <li> I bought these because I hadn&#x27;t been able to clear my face of random blackheads and one particularly stubborn blemish that was there so long I was thinking of charging rent, lol.  I have used the sponge for a little over a week and my face has cleared.  The blackheads are gone and the blemish has healed and there is just a scar.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It works! You will see results in just a few days!</li>
    <li> Does wonders for my wife&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> this is the firt time I cial spa at use these facial sponge and they are great is like doing a facial spa at your own home. with out spending a lot of money. THANK YOU PLEASE DONOT STOP SELLING THIS PRODUCT. A 100% I WOULD REMEND IT TO ANYBODY.</li>
    <li> They Work- that is what I purchased it for !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 1 week.  I have sensitive skin so I can&#x27;t use those facial brushes.  Historically, I have just used soap with a wash cloth to cleanse my face.  Even though wash cloths are handy to exfoliate the skin, I have still had issues with blackhead developing around my mouth no matter how hard I scrub.  With this, I noticed that the blackheads have magically disappeared.  I don&#x27;t know exactly how this happened since the Konjac sponge just feels like a regular sponge.  Despite the fact that I&#x27;m still not clear how it managed to get rid of my blackheads, the skin around my mouth has never been so clear.  I&#x27;ve had better results from this Konjac sponge that I did when I had a facial to professionally extract the dirt, etc. stuck in the blackheads around my mouth.  Now, I no longer have any blackheads without having dermatological treatment or facials.</li>
    <li> The sponge is great; At the beginning it was very hard but softened within minutes when soaked water. I used it only couple of times and so far it is working very well. The packaging is great and instructions helpful. So far I highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Great for oily skin!!</li>
    <li> I love these sponges!! I use my sponge 2 times a day and they defiantly last as long as they say they do. This is a great buy when you consider 2 sponges will last you 4-6 months. Within 2 weeks of using these sponges I saw a huge difference in my skin. My skin was clear and looked healthy. I will be buying more of these.</li>
    <li> This charcoal is unbelievable! After I use it my face remains soft for days until I use it again. I have never used anything like this before and came across it while looking up facial soaps. After reading all of the reviews, I decided to give it a try and I am so glad I did. I will continue to use this for years to come! Worth every penny and MORE.</li>
    <li> fell apart after 1st use</li>
    <li> After only 3 days of using this little sponge, my acne scars have noticeably faded! My complexion hasn&#x27;t been this flawless in a long time. Thank you La Lune Naturals!</li>
    <li> The packaging is great and instructions helpful. So far I highly recommend the product.Was amazing ,the beginning it was very hard but softened within minutes when soaked water.The sponge is great .I used it only couple of times and so far it is working very well.</li>
    <li> Feel very exfoliated, used it with a facial cleanser it was great. My sisters came to visit and took the spare ones I had purchased, they liked the sponge as well! I have to reorder soon I&#x27;m already out.</li>
    <li> I am a skincare junkie because I have acne and rosacea. I try EVERYTHING, once. My constants for 4 years have been my 2 Clarisonics, but I do try EVERYTHING and so I bought these. I will say that I do enjoy the curvature of these sponges - they fit right in the palm of my hand and make it easy to clean the sides of my nose and top of my nose where I have problems with blackheads. They really get into the curves and crevices. I love that they are so flexible. This is something that my Clarisonics cannot do. I feel my skin is really clean with these sponges - I get less residue after cleaning with these using my toner on a cotton pad than after using my Clarisonic around my nose. I am giving these sponges a month to compare them to my other cleansing method to see if I can really make an educated choice about which is the better cleaner, but for the price, convenience and the product&#x27;s flexibility and the fact that my skin is bright and squeaky clean, I am leaning towards these konjac sponges. I am using the charcoal infused sponges with Laszlo Sea Mud soap, the best soap, ever, and Laszlo Light Controlling toner.</li>
    <li> I like the round shape of these better than the Oleavine charcoal Konjac sponge I used to use, and the 2-pack for $14.99 can&#x27;t be beat! Nice exfoliation without any irritation, and seems to help my moisturizer absorb more thoroughly. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I have to say, I was really happy with this product, especially since there were two sponges included! I had no clue what to expect because I&#x27;ve never used a Konjac sponge before. Opening it up, it was really hard, and it was cool to see how soaking it in water made it soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how soft this sponge felt on my face, but at the same time it  did feel like it was being exfoliated. Afterwards, my face felt really clean and soft. Using this sponge made it feel more clean than if I were to just rub my facial cleanser in with my hands (which is what I normally would do). I will be using this sponge from now on.</li>
    <li> This is the best solution for gentle cleansing and exfoliation I&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s even more effective than my Clarisonic. If you have sensitive or acne prone skin or a combination of both, try the Konjac with a gentle (no sulfates, parabens, fragrance, etc) cleanser and be amazed. It makes any other products or topical medicines you use more effective, softens, evens out tone, and for around $3 every three months, is beyond worth it.</li>
    <li> Package came incomplete. One of the sponges came without the string to hang it and the instructions on how to use it was missing.</li>
    <li> Have not seen a difference in my skin clearing.</li>
    <li> I love the way the Konjac Sponge makes my skin look and feel!  After only two uses, the clogged pores on the sides of my nose were completely gone.  My order arrived on time and in perfect condition.  Thank you for the great service and wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Awesome. My wife, is happy to have a product that makes her skin feel so clean. Good especially when you have a breakout. Also uses it with a charcoal soap.</li>
    <li> These are my second experience with Konjac sponges, but my first with this brand. These are smaller than the one I previously used, and more rounded. It hasn&#x27;t fallen apart and it seems to do its job just fine. I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve noticed a difference with my skin - but I like that they are slightly exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;These are a little bit softer than the previous one I tried, which I like a little bit more - they&#x27;re more spongey feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would probably purchase these again, perhaps in a different sponge type.</li>
    <li> it feels good, makes skin look polished but I think it breaks me out for some reason</li>
    <li> One of my alltime favorites now.  You can&#x27;t imagine how great your skin can feel and look.  After a few days there was a noticeable change to the pores in my skin.  Met a friend for lunch today and she asked if I had just come from having a facial.  How more proof positive can you get?  The feel of the sponge does make you think that this is a soft and effective charcoal fiber that is really working.  Very easy to use with or without a cleanser and just rinse well and blot dry.  How about a little hook and tie to the spnoge to hang just above your wash basin. Great, great product!  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Nice but a little overpriced.</li>
    <li> Great seller, great product.</li>
    <li> Love these. I use them on my face. My face is smooth and glowing.</li>
    <li> Too hard--the softer red one is better.</li>
    <li> These seem to be working better than the other brands I&#x27;ve tried, and they&#x27;re cheaper too! Love them and will definitely buy again. Have noticed smaller pores and less acne :)</li>
    <li> Love these! So great that it&#x27;s a pack of two and the included hook is sooo helpful! Great product!</li>
    <li> Luv this sponge!!! It makes ur face look &amp; feel very smooth with or without cleanser. Will definitely purchase in the future! !!</li>
    <li> Received my sponges right away...my daughter and I love them ! They are unique ! The texture is very pleasant to the touch. I recommend! ( im the daughter) i love these!! i use mine everyday and its been a pretty long while, i dont let them soak i just wet and in my hand Nkinda squeeze them n they work great. i hang them to dry.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last as long as I thought it wouldn but is definitely worth the money! I love this sponge, and it&#x27;s a good price on here and makes my skin so soft! I got some other la line naturals products, and I love them all!</li>
    <li> These sponges feel wonderful on your skin.  Just started using it a week age.  Haven&#x27;t notice any change in my skin yet.</li>
    <li> Item was as described.  I will be ordering more of these.  They seem to do a decent job on my teenage son&#x27;s face.  I also like how they make my face feel soft and clean.  They arrived promptly and the packaging was good.</li>
    <li> I have seen these sponges advertised for a while now and finally purchased them. It isn&#x27;t too abrasive on my skin, and I like the extra &#x27;scrub&#x27; that it gives when I&#x27;m washing my face.</li>
    <li> I am amazed by these sponges. I have been using the Konjac sponge by La Lune Naturals for just under a week and I can already tell a huge difference in my skin quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously suffered from some pretty bad acne and acne scarring (and still do a bit), but this has helped immeansely! Even in under a week, my skin has cleared up loads. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker (yet), but it is one of the best natural sponges I have come across. It&#x27;s very soft and &amp;#34;spongey&amp;#34; once becoming wet and doesn&#x27;t need to be used with a cleanser, and I love the string run through it for easy hanging! It is a great addition to any skincare routine.</li>
    <li> Great product and it doesn&#x27;t fall apart like others do.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these and received it about one week ago.  I have been waiting to do a review to see how I liked it after using it for awhile.  I was pretty skeptical at first, as when I pulled it out of the package it was hard as a rock (activated charcoal, duh, don&#x27;t know what I was thinking).  I got it wet (get it soaked), and it turned into this soft sponge.  Okay, I can use this on my face.  So, I gently scrubbed away on my face, but you don&#x27;t have to be real gentle, it is really soft.  The contour is good for getting all the places on your face.  Got out and moisturized and went to bed.  The next day I was touching my face and thought, wow my skin is feeling really soft.  Didn&#x27;t attribute it to the sponge at the time.  The next day same thing. This is where I was like, hmm, what&#x27;s up?  Oh, the sponge.  I have what I call chicken bumps on my upper arms, I used it on those yesterday and I am anxious to see if it helps eradicate those.  Wish me luck.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever used this konjac sponge with activated charcoal. I was skeptical about it as I am with all new skin care products, but I am extremely impressed with how smooth my skin feels and looks after only using it for a week and a half. I use it with either a charcoal face wash or Cetaphil. It removes makeup and cleanses my skin without leaving my face dry. I will definitely be purchasing again and recommending this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> Nonabrasive but really feels that it is cleaning.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the reviews here for this product, and just hearing so much hype about Konjac sponges in general, I was disappointed.  I do have a clarisonic, which I love, and I feel that does a much better job (and if you are constantly buying these, it&#x27;s not really so expensive in the long run... ).  I have had this for about two months now.  I use it probably 2-3x a week in the morning, when I&#x27;d usually just splash my face with water.  So it IS nice and easy, to quickly do a once over with the sponge, rather than washing it or getting out the clarisonic for a whole minute, etc.  This should last 2-3 months, and I have only used it a few times a week (versus 10-14) and the sponge is starting to fall apart.  So that is my biggest disappointment.  The string is really handy and nice, but the holes where it goes through the sponge seem to be the starting point for sponge break down.  Overall, I would use these for traveling when I don&#x27;t want to bring my clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 1/26/16:  After my original 2 star review, the company reached out to me to refund me, then never followed up.  So I&#x27;m knocking it down another star due to bad customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did NOT receive this product for free, like many of the other reviewers.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the hard, cardboard-like chunk when I opened the box, but I fell in love the 1st time I washed with this sponge!  I use less than 1/2 the facial cleanser I used to because the sponge helps lather it up so much more. I gently cleanse with the sponge, rinse my face and the sponge, then hang it to dry.  A suction cup with a hook attached is included in the box, so I stuck it to my bathroom mirror over the sink.  My face was immediately smoother than it&#x27;s ever been, just after one use.</li>
    <li> Definitely leaves my skin soft and smooth. I tend to have thick skin (build up) so I like the amount of exfoliation this provides. My skin is not sensitive in the traditional sense but it is very oily and acne prone so it tends to rupture easily. So far my skin has looked and felt better since using these sponges with my normal facial cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be ordering these again.&lt;br /&gt;My only (minor) quibble is that it&#x27;s hard to get around all the contours of my nose so I make sure to spend enough time going over that area.</li>
    <li> Complete waste of money..the sponge broke within two use. Very bad quality</li>
    <li> It did not make any difference.</li>
    <li> The greatest thing about these sponges is not having to use a washcloth to cleanse the face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges arrived faster than I thought they would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as it is rinsed well, and allowed to fully dry, bacteria does not seem to like hiding out in it. They are gentle on the skin, and provide daily gentle sloughing. I have ordered these two black sponges. These sponges come in white for oily/combination skin; in red for dry/mature skin; and in black for acne prone skin. They are gentle on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the age of 59, I have developed a case of acne such as I never experienced even in my teen years. This sponge has helped me combat this condition. My suggestion would be to use a gentle cleanser while using these sponges and remember to moisturize. I think you will be quite pleased with the outcome.</li>
    <li> After using it a couple of times I could see a difference in the amount of blackheads</li>
    <li> Pretty good!but not great!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like these but they just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I followed the directions that were included, but the sponges stared to fall apart after only a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> Man! these feel great on the skin. it might have also been a good nights rest but my skin looked better the next day. you feel like you&#x27;re exfoliating but its much more gentle than a scrub. my only concern is that i&#x27;ve heard you have to replace them every few weeks. hopefully getting them in a two pack will mean ordering less often. i&#x27;ll update if it ends up lasting shorter or longer than expected.</li>
    <li> I got these sponges for my 15 year old son to help cleanse his acne skin. He had been using the sponge as directed for over a week and hasn&#x27;t seen any results and asked me to find another product. The other sponge was used by my 12 yo daughter and she hated the smell, it has a disgusting( poop) smell when wet:( All in all, this product didn&#x27;t deliver what it had promised to cleanse and get rid or draw out dirt from skin. No e-book was enclosed with product</li>
    <li> It is slippery. Can not dry your face.</li>
    <li> I love that this product comes in a pack of 2 and also includes something to hang the sponge on. In my house there are 3 of us (myself and 2 teenage daughters) using the sponge each day and we all love it! I also love that the company sends you an e-book about how to use the product. I will continue ordering LaLune!</li>
    <li> **I received this product in return for an honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt; I have tried several Konjac Cleansing Sponges and I really like this one. it arrived in a brown box which can be recycled with two large charcoal konjac sponges individually sealed in plastic. There was even a small hook inside the box so that I could hang my sponge up to dry when I was done using it. The sponge itself is rather large and was bigger than my palm however it wasn&#x27;t too large to make is awkward to use. I allowed the water to soak in the sponge to soften it up and then I used it clean my face in circular motions. Despite being hard and firm when it is dry in the package, it is quite soft on my face. You can use the sponge with or without cleanser. I have oily skin and I was having the worst problem with breakouts and this has helped tremendously. Not only have my breakouts have cleared up, but my skin is feels smooth and soft. I really love the results and the fact that I get two per package instead of just one.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge. Works very good!</li>
    <li> These sponges are a good alternative to facial rags or those caustic systems that are too harsh for women with sensitive skin. I have used these for about a month now and find that they soak up cleanser rather easily and foam up really well...meaning you do not have to use a lot to get results.  The sponge softens up upon wetting it and maintains its consistency for a good period.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges. They leave my face feeling clean and fresh but are still very easy on the face.  Well worth the money. Affordable enough to give them a try. They&#x27;re kind of magical!</li>
    <li> Love love love these.  Game changer for your skin!  Especially for oily/combination skin like mine- huge difference I saw during the day when I use in the morning.</li>
    <li> I like the exfoliate feeling this product provides on my skin. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Sent on time and good quality sponges.  The added suction hook was a very, nice extra.  Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> You get 2 sponges and 1 suction cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used one of the sponges for over a month now every day 2 times a day and it has held up wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first time using a konjac sponge and I am very pleased. My skin actually feels very smooth after each time using it and I have had fewer pimples since using this. I am extremely basic in my skin care routine- soap and water but this has become a must for me from now on. Glad I stumbled on this. :)</li>
    <li> Use them every other day and absolutely love them!</li>
    <li> I love these sponges. My pores are smaller, face is smoother and clear. I soak these in hot water, rub coconut oil on my face and rub with the sponges. I then rinse with warm water and moisturize.</li>
    <li> A little disappointed.  I like the way this cleans my face, except that it&#x27;s now &amp;#34;falling&amp;#34; apart. I got it on 5/15/15 and it&#x27;s suppose to last 1000 washes. I use one for the morning and the other one for evening.  Contemplating if it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love love love...........gentle cleaning and my skin has actually started to clear up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about three weeks now and I have noticed softer skin and my dark spots have been lightened, although I can&#x27;t solely attribute the evenness to this sponge as I also bought Aveeno positively radiant moisturizer. I do like this sponge; I don&#x27;t use it with a cleanser though since I don&#x27;t want to risk any cleanser being left behind and shortening the lifespan of this sponge. A good, gentle exfoliator. I&#x27;ve also noticed a reduction in breakouts.</li>
    <li> Hmmmm . . . I wasn&#x27;t sure about this sponge, but willing to try anything natural that will help with oily, acne-prone, enlarged pore skin. Well, now I&#x27;m sure I love it!!! It works great on my troubled skin. I says it works to pull impurities from pores and may help them appear smaller and it does just what it says. I also have an sonic face brush that I was using daily, but have switched to using this sponge twice a day and use my face brush twice a week. This sponge is very soft when wet and leaves my face very soft. Now I need to find a large sponge like this to use on my body!! I&#x27;ve seen a complaint about the sponge breaking apart too soon, but the key is using the sponge exactly as it suggests . . . do not ring/twist water out, but put sponge between both palms of hands to press water out.</li>
    <li> I love these little sponges.  They nicely exfoliate my skin, and the price is very reasonable.  I do intend to continue to use these as my morning skin cleansers.</li>
    <li> Searched for a company whose products were organic, and were reputable, found it with La Lune.  Love the sponge and the betonite clay.  My eight year old grandson tried it, and asked if he could have my extra sponge.</li>
    <li> I feel it&#x27;s overpriced for a dark grew sponge with a string through it, but I at least feel like I&#x27;m doing something for my skin by using an activated charcoal product over a typical sponge.  I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference, but will continue using it.  Not sure I&#x27;ll re-order at this price point, but worth a try.  I prefer an activated charcoal mask to the sponge, personally.  It&#x27;s fairly small and is hard when dry.  Soak it and it becomes very soft, great for gentle cleansing (unlike the harsh alternatives I used to use).  It does feel nice on my skin, it&#x27;s just not a miracle clearing product.  The &amp;#34;hanger&amp;#34; it comes with is a small, generic suction-cup hoop.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s handy for some, but it doesn&#x27;t stick to our stone and I don&#x27;t like the aesthetics of it hanging on the glass so it goes onto a drying rack in the shower.  Love the idea, but it&#x27;s just ok for me.</li>
    <li> What a great product!  Especially after a workout or being outside and getting that icky sticky feeling.  Just jump in the shower, use the Konjac sponge on your face, shower as usual and step out glowing.  I was skeptical at first, not thinking that a simple little sponge can do more for my skin than all the products I keep trying, but it did and I didn&#x27;t have to change my routine or remember to do anything additional or special.  It&#x27;s literally as easy it they tell you it is.  Just wet, use, rinse, and hang to dry.  Hell, I wish men were that easy ;D</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully. Skin feels clean without any harsh abrasive-ness.</li>
    <li> The sponges give you a nice gentle exfoliation which leaves skin feeling clean and soft. I use less cleanser with the sponge too so I am saving money. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love these charcoal face sponges! They give the best glow and last a while! They also help save face cleanser. A little bit goes a long way with one of these.  I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I just have to rave about this sponge. I didn&#x27;t think it would actually work when I first purchased it but to my amaze, the first time I used it, it made the appearance of my skin look a million times better instantly. I&#x27;m some one with extreme acne for 7 years and used to suffer from cystic acne as well so I see this as a head recommendation. It&#x27;s a lot better than the face brushes. It&#x27;s softer and less expensive. Plus if you have facial jewlery it won&#x27;t pull them out. This is something I will always buy from now on.</li>
    <li> Not understanding the hype on these. These have changed nothing about my skin...</li>
    <li> Best quality for a very reasonable price customer service is more than excellent.... makes a wonderful gift for college kids ...I&#x27;m on to my next order :)</li>
    <li> Um...its just a sponge. Nothing magical about this product. It cleans but this is JUST A SPONGE which provides the SAME results as if i used an ordinary sponge, facial brush and or washcloth---logically speaking!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t forget the lash line and your brows need a bit of exfoliation too! It keeps the hair follicles healthy, and this little sponge is just perfect for those contours. Very gentle yet does the job for the rest of your face as well.</li>
    <li> I liked the product for the first few weeks, then it totally disintegrated. The instructions made it clear that the sponge should only be squeezed gently and I was conscious of that, but it still didn&#x27;t last. Definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> As someone with dry skin I love these sponges. They&#x27;re so gentle but do a great job keeping my skin flake-free.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges. I&#x27;ve had a konjac sponge before from a different brand, but it was smaller and a little more expensive. These sponges help get rid of those tiny imperfections (texture, tiny pimples) while also leaving my skin smoother than its been in awhile. I&#x27;ve also noticed I&#x27;m having fewer break outs in general. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely my go to sponge now. I don&#x27;t know about any of their other products but after this experience I may consider shopping with them for other stuff too.</li>
    <li> Completely loving this company! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this Black Konjac Sponge! It&#x27;s so gentle and my face feels smoother and looks brighter! Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Perfect size and texture for washing your face!  Feels like a mini-facial each time I wash. And, works as well if not better than my expensive Clarisonic! Save your money and buy this sponge to get a deep cleanse and to help control acne. I use with my every day cleanser and notice a much deeper cleanse than when I did not use it. Very convenient that this one in particular is packaged with a hook to hang it in the shower.  Like ordering from a trusted brand</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a sponge - I worry about spreading bacteria around on my face since you&#x27;re only supposed to disinfect once a week.  Doing it more than that would break down the sponge, I would think.  I will say I really like it for removing eye makeup reside - the stuff that&#x27;s left over after removal with oil.  Probably won&#x27;t repurchase but I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting out of this sponge.</li>
    <li> I love these ! works for me and my boyfriend. I use mild facial soap and my bf uses no soap and it keeps our faces clear!</li>
    <li> The sponges are so soft and natural and leave my skin glowing!</li>
    <li> Best ever!!! I have adult cystic acne. This MIRACLE charcoal sponge has my skin looking like a young girl!!! Easy Peasey!!&lt;br /&gt;Great deal.too. I bought a pal of two. Each is good for 6 month&#x27;s. I got a year supply for about $15.00. No cleansers on the sponge. Leaves bacteria. Sponge, 1st, rinse, then cleanse your skin. Follow with moisturizer, eye creme, foundation glides over your face, nice &amp; smooth! Love, LOVE, LOVE this sponge!!</li>
    <li> These have changed my skin. I don&#x27;t usually rave about products, but the charcoal sponges keep my skin clear and with a natural glow. I have super sensitive skin, but I use these with my normal facewash and it&#x27;s made a dramatic difference. Also, great price!</li>
    <li> The use of this product gave me eczema.  So after paying copay plus prescription medicine to get me better, not to mention having to apply medicine for the next 6 weeks,  I&#x27;m not happy!  I&#x27;m sure other people like it but its not for me.</li>
    <li> add it along with bamboo charcoal soap and it makes your face smooth and clean. I first use makeup remover then I use the bamboo charcoal soap and sponge</li>
    <li> Great product!  Great Service!</li>
    <li> I tried my sponge for the first time with just plain water and love it! My face feels so smooth!</li>
    <li> I was expecting a deep clean, but my skin is so smooth.  My pores seems smaller and my makeup applies so easy without caking during the day in the summer heat.  I always check and rub or dab my eyes or lips aftering being in the heat, but even though my skin is still glowing, my makeup is smooth and even on my skin.  The only thing different is the sponge cleansing.</li>
    <li> I am still not sure if these are living up to all their hype but they are nice sponges for facial use. They start out like a pumice stone and then become very soft when you soak it. It felt like it was exfoliating nicely and the charcoal did seem to be effective the first few times I used it. I&#x27;m not sure if it still has an effect from the charcoal or not. I did notice some improvement in my pores and skin texture but still have minor breakouts like normal. I have found that if the sponge is too wet it isn&#x27;t as good for exfoliating so I&#x27;ve cut back to using it once a day so that it can harden up a bit more between uses. You don&#x27;t want it to get as hard as a rock, just a little firmer so it feels like you&#x27;re accomplishing something. All in all it&#x27;s a pretty good sponge, I like that it includes a suction cup to hang it and the price for two with the ebook of recipes isn&#x27;t bad. The ebook&#x27;s recipes use other products by the manufacturer and were pretty simple, but in a good way that makes them accessible to anyone even if you don&#x27;t have experience making your own beauty products.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I love how soft my face is after using this sponge. The shape of it makes it easy to hold too. I would definitely recommend purchasing the 2-pack. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love how smooth my skin feels after using this sponge.  Another great product from La Lune Naturals!</li>
    <li> I had heard a lot about these sponges and was anxious to try them.  They have not disappointed me.  I&#x27;ve used a slew of facial exfoliants but there is something so different about the way Konjac sponge makes my skin feel.  It is literally baby soft.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  My skin feels amazing and, in just a week, has fewer blemishes.  I may hand them out at Christmas.  Do your skin a favor and try these sponges.</li>
    <li> First time to try these sponges.  I also like using them without product.  Gentle exfoliation.  Would recommend to try if you don&#x27;t own a Clarisonic (I don&#x27;t).</li>
    <li> Love this product! The quality is great! It lathered very well and seems to be made very well. The price is a bargain since you&#x27;re getting 2 sponges for the price of one compared with other brands. I&#x27;m going to try the white konjac that they make also.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how but I used this sponge one time and my skin felt amazing the next day.  It is very gentle and really easy to use, and the string for hanging it up makes it very sanitary.  I would recommend this product.  The package also came on time</li>
    <li> Really good, soften as soon as they are wet and great it comes with two. Wish they lasted a little longer but that&#x27;s OK!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not new to Konjac sponges and have used many brands. This one is a bit firmer than others I have used which I actually like because it gives better exfoliation. It&#x27;s small enough to fit in the corner of the eyes to remove make up nicely and lathers well with foam cleanser. Overall a great product at a great price point.</li>
    <li> I received La Lune Activated Charcoal Cleansing sponge as a gift and I love it.  It feels gentle and yet exfoliates well at the same time.  There are 2 to a package, which is wonderful and the suction cup hook holds well.  This is a product I will continue to purchase because I have sensitive skin and it works well for me!</li>
    <li> These are great! They have already began to even out my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I love my new sponges!</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this on her acne prone skin and it seems to be helping!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of these.  I will never use anything else, my skin is acne free and feels much smoother.  I strongly recommend this for people of all ages.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I have used this sponge myself I&#x27;m so pleased that I&#x27;m getting Konjac Sponges for my daughter and granddaughter.</li>
    <li> I just got this product and after reading all the reviews I was a little nervous. But after trying it I absolutely love it !! My face after only a couple washes has gotten smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and some of my acne scars are fading! Definitely going to recommend this .</li>
    <li> I bought the wrong one, its makes my skin dry. I gave it 5 stars because of the cleanliness that I felt everytime I used it. I should bought the original white konjac instead of this black one since my skin runs dry mostly.  I dont need to use my cleanser to clean my face from makeup. But i just used light make up everyday and for me this sponge w/out cleanser already makes my skin facw feel clean.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great company</li>
    <li> Not sure what all the fuss is about. Didn&#x27;t seem to make much difference.</li>
    <li> Love these. They&#x27;re especially nice to take camping or on trips when you have to pack light. No need to take along cleanser.</li>
    <li> My skin has been so soft since I started using these. I tried another brand, a little cheaper, and I will not do that again these are so worth every cent!</li>
    <li> Once these are soaked and soft, they do such a great job of cleansing my skin. I used coconut oil, then gently scrub with this sponge. My face feels soft and super clean.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this! I gave the second one to my mom because I was so excited to share with someone how amazing it is. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This works great! Had some dryness and flaking. After using this, my face is a lot smoother and no more flakiness. It is soft, but effective in creating a good lather on my face with cleanser. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Very nice product especially for this price! My skin loves it. Only one thing that I&#x27;m strange about - it doesn&#x27;t get bigger after warm water, though still feels comfortable. I love it!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  My face looks and feels great.  I can&#x27;t believe how much better my skin looks in one week.  Try it.  I promise you won&#x27;t be sorry!!!!</li>
    <li> great sponge works just as described. it&#x27;s soft and gentle yet exfoliates really well without being harsh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sponge for two weeks. It&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s soft so Ithink it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t think it exfoliates much but it&#x27;s good for regular use. I use it with a facial cleanser because without my face doesn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
    <li> One sponge is around 3 weeks,I didn&#x27;t like it that much but I will try other brand..</li>
    <li> Love this little sponge, my skin feels amazing and my acne is clearing up!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both use these sponges. I have seen an improvement in fine lines, and over all texture of my skin. My daughter has seen a complete elimination of acne. We both love these sponges, and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> After the first time using this sponge you can see and feel the difference already! Great product for sure! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Too small to handle, lathers poorly. Way over priced for the quality of the product. I would not recommend wasting your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks now, with face wash and without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without a doubt it has helped clear my skin, hydrate it, and leave it softer to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company even sends emails to see how I am liking the product and send coupons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> Skins noticeably smoother compared to regular wash clothes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had hard white heads on my nose since I was a teenager and the only remedy was getting expensive facials. I&#x27;m 49 yrs old and continue to get these white heads... the first use of this product feels exactly like I&#x27;ve gotten a facial with extractions!! Without the pain!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked for life.</li>
    <li> Omg love it love it loveee it does not scratch skin feeels wonderful</li>
    <li> Love this sponge. It was gentile and soft, made my face feel very clean!</li>
    <li> Fell Apart after one week! I wanted to love. First I bought this for me and my boyfriend and we loved it till this started falling apart after 1 week of use but was told I would receive new ones. This happened at the end of April 2015. I waited 3 weeks and did not get anything so I emailed them back and they sent me one right away. Fine thats okay I just wanted my sponges because they were so good. I got the sponges in the mail this package had one sponge missing the string to hang my sponge(so no bacteria forms) so I took a picture and sent it to them again saying that I need the sponge to have a string so I can hang it and let it dry. They responded and said okay I will send you one since that should of came with a string so I am guessing it defective. It is now August of 2015 and I am to still receive this sponge they were suppose to send me.</li>
    <li> Not that great as a make up remover. Helped my acne a bit. Yay!</li>
    <li> These are crap. They offer no exfoliating or even cleansing. They&#x27;re useless, then they dissolve.</li>
    <li> Great product, has done wonders for my face. Use this in the mornings, and use olay pro x brush and night. My face has never looked better.</li>
    <li> I use the sponge for my face and also as a body sponge using with bamboo charcoal soap and an exfoliating scrub. It gets very foamy and does an excellent job. This was my second purchase of the sponge. I highly recommend the sponge.</li>
    <li> These are great sponges!  I really like the consistency of the sponge as it is different from many other face sponges I&#x27;ve used.  It has a slightly rubbery feeling/consistency to it that feels great and it really feels like it does a good job cleaning my skin.  Although it is made from activated charcoal it&#x27;s not rough or scratchy like some charcoal soaps I&#x27;ve used.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is I don&#x27;t find it as easy to use for washing my face outside of the shower because I find it&#x27;s more difficult to wash the soap/cleanser off my face with a sponge than it is with a wash cloth.  I found myself rinsing it out multiple times and to wipe off all my cleanser whereas this just seemed to go quicker with a washcloth.  But in the shower I love this and the consistency is like none other.  I really like this sponge and would definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review at a later date after I get a sense of how long this sponge lasts and how it wears with time.  But so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;____________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: LaLuneNaturals&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 5 days after order date</li>
    <li> Really cool feeling sponges.</li>
    <li> I wasnt sure about these at first, they come individually wrapped and they are hard like a stone. Once you soak them for a few minutes they become very soft. I squirt a little face cleaner on it and use the sponge to rub my face, its not abrasive at all so it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; like its cleaning but it is. I have noticed less clogged pores using this product.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful on my face, you get a great clean smooth face with this product....</li>
    <li> These sponges definitely work well with cleaning your pores, and preventing breakouts. This was a gift for someone else,  but after using it for two weeks she is in love with this product.  Well be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an interesting little sponge!  All in a good way  save on soap because it lathers up very nicely. Like it says you only need half of what you normally would use. I love the little suction cup hook that it comes with so you can hang it properly to dry. Perfect!  I was hoping for some more exfiation, but what I found is that if I do not soften it with water prior to washing it won&#x27;t get as soft, so I can make it as soft hard as I need.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, I think you will be happy with purchase!  A great alternative to washcloths and loofahs.</li>
    <li> I work in a dirty hot environment and this sponge works great. It really deep cleans and helps my skin look smooth.</li>
    <li> Have being using my sponge for just about two weeks and it is very nice.  I use it on its own with no product while I take a shower and the texture is just perfect not too rough not too soft.  I am happy with my sponge and the overall purchasing experience.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used my sponge twice, but I was happy with the results. The sponges came highly recommended by my adult daughter. She had been given three different sponges to try by her boss…she was giving them away to her clients and she asked the gals who worked for her to test each product and report back. Everyone agreed that the Activated Charcoal Konjac Cleansing Sponge was the best choice. Prior to ordering the sponges I purchased a well known name brand cleansing brush that cost me $100. I only used it once and only for a few minutes. You just turn it on and let the sonic brush head do it&#x27;s thing. It practically chewed off my skin. The Konjac sponge was so gentle. It just left me with skin that glowed and I could have saved all of the money that I spent on the sonic brush. My daughter&#x27;s skin looks amazing; she said that it really tightened her pores and made them less noticeable. The sonic brush said it might cause breakouts before your skin improved. It did do just that. The sponge just left me with skin that was soft and there was no sign of any sort of breakout or irritation. I am glad I took my daughter&#x27;s advice. I also like the fact that you can hang it to dry after each use. I am looking forward to seeing some improvement in my own skin; I have neglected it recently and the Konjac sponge is a relatively inexpensive way to pamper myself. I think this was a great investment for such a small price!</li>
    <li> great seller, items arrive quick. I have only had a few days to try this out but I agree with lots of the reviews I&#x27;ve read about this already. I love washing my face with this sponge! I have seen a little improvement in my skin and know that it is sloughing off piles of dry skin because I have noticed less flaking on my face after make up is put on.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this product so much.  I was lazy before about cleaning my make up off, after using this Konjac Sponge, I actually look forward to washing my face now.  It tingles, and give me a more radiant look.  Highly recommend it for anyone who is thinking about it, just BUY it!</li>
    <li> I love this sponge! My face feels amazing after using it.</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels when using the Konjac Cleansing Sponge! So soft and silky.</li>
    <li> I think it is a good product. Arrived on time and feel like it would work good for me</li>
    <li> Great product.  I was looking specifically for Konjac sponges.  This product was less expensive than others and you got TWO for less than the price of one.</li>
    <li> i love it! i wanted to get a Clarisonik or Foreo but since i started using Konjac, i decided not to.. it works pretty cool on my face!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this item, so much so that I bought another two. I have tried a few different Konjac sponges and this is the only one I re-ordered.</li>
    <li> As a natural health and environment-conscious person, I&#x27;m always seeking chemical-free skin care products.  The shape of the sponge makes it easy to use.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  It is very soft - which you wouldn&#x27;t think out of the package, but as soon as it soaks it completely changes.  Like that it exfoliates but very gently because too much scrubbing causes me to break out.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Great product! During my first pregnancy, I started having eczema on my face. I tried lanolin, lotions, scrubs, coconut oil, really rough facial buffer pads. Nothing helped! I still have it four years later unfortunately. Someone mentioned using a soft and gentle facial sponge to reduce the dryness, flakiness and redness. This charcoal sponge has done wonders! I highly recommend this product and company. They have been the first to send me an email expressing their concern for my satisfaction.</li>
    <li> By far the best facial sponge I have gotten.  Feels soft after soaking, and feels gentle on the face.  The sponge works well to exfoliate without leaving the face flaky. The string hangs well over any hook, so I have never used the suction cup.&lt;br /&gt;Two sponges and the suction were in the box, as advertised.  Arrived quickly and in good condition.  Would definitely buy again from La Lune Naturals.</li>
    <li> I really like it!  feel&#x27;s great on my face!</li>
    <li> I used to use a wash cloth+facial cleanser to wash my face every day and I would still break out! My boyfriend suggested these sponges and within about a week my skin was noticeably clearer. They are really wonderful. Once the sponges are wet they become very soft.</li>
    <li> Not a magic, works like a light scrub</li>
    <li> I love that this is a 2 pack of sponges! I have super oily skin and still prone to breakouts. At 35 years old, that is ridiculous. I must say this sponge is kinda amazing. It is soft enough to not irritate my skin yet rough enough to slough off the day at nighttime. I use a dab of Neutrogena acne wash on the sponge in the morning and at night. My skin&#x27;s texture has improved-it is more soft and I am breaking out less. So instead of using a micro-scrub daily, I now use this sponge. Try it out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered other Konjac sponges. This one works very well, and is about the same quality as ones where I would pay the same price for one. By using these sponges, I&#x27;ve been able to save my face cleansers because I only need to use half the amount I would if I put it in my hands. I&#x27;m also not worried about bacteria growing in this sponge like I would a washcloth left in my shower.</li>
    <li> I like this sponge, it&#x27;s soft yet still feels like it exfoliates</li>
    <li> hi very nice item and the co as well i will buy again thanks.</li>
    <li> I like a different brand of sponges much better.  I don&#x27;t feel like these sponges take off the makeup​, with or without using soap.  Even after washing my face with soap, I use a toner and continue getting makeup off.</li>
    <li> So glad I found it! The sponges feel great on your skin and leaves the skin feeling refreshed and exfoliated. I use in my daily routine and in the shower for my face, neck, and shoulders. I love that this is organic too!</li>
    <li> Perfect sponge to mix with my cleanser and wash my face. I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I use these sponges daily to wash my face with a gentle cleanser, and I like these much better than a wash cloth. They seem to work well with my sensitive skin. The size and shape of the sponge is nice. They come with a string, so they can hang neatly to dry when not in use.</li>
    <li> I am a young male and I Have struggles with acne for a long time and tried almost everything on the market and have finally found the perfect routine for my skin which includes using one of these sponges along with an oil free facial cleanser. The other thing I use is a traditional Double edge razor and Sapone Oeatmeal and Tea Tree oil shaving soap. Those used together on a regular basis along with cereve oil free facial lotion have made my skiing 100% pimple free.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time and loved it! It was very easy to use and I like that I could use it without a cleanser. The sponge is so gentle on your skin that you don&#x27;t even notice it exfoliating your face. I don&#x27;t use any products that contain toxins, so I really like that I could use this with just water. Afterward, I patted my face dry and applied the coconut oil I always use. My face looks bright and fresh and feels soft.</li>
    <li> Love love the way this sponge makes my face feel!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this sponge. My skin actually glows and is soft plus no more blemishes.</li>
    <li> Just get the capsules.</li>
    <li> When I first  opened these sponges, I thought it was a mistake. They looked and felt like charcoal that you put in a bbq grill. I decided to give them a try anyway. Once they get wet and soften (takes about 1-2 minutes) they are super soft and squishy! I use it to wash my face and my face is smooth without being irritated. If you want your own cleanser on this sponge it only takes a drop, it makes any cleanser foamy! I bought these for my daughter &amp; sister now because I really like them that much.</li>
    <li> I love how these sponges feel when cleansing with them.  It&#x27;s like a facial massage! Great price and packaged well!</li>
    <li> One of the sponges got moldy right away, despite caring for it as instructed (and in the same manner/location as the second sponge, which didn&#x27;t).</li>
    <li> Sponge seems to work as advertised. Was shipped promptly and arrived in good condition.</li>
    <li> I really really like these.  They do exfoliate well no need to press too hard either, its very gentle.  They don&#x27;t get musty and smelly, and come with a super cute little suction cup hook to hang it on (sponge has a simple white sting attached to it).  I like this better than my battery operated facial brush I had been using, these are much more convenient and never need batteries. I think my first one lasted two months of using it everyday and it finally tore open- when that happens it will just begin to crumble so you have to replace it.  I will keep using these, I am very curious to see how these work in the winter when my face gets really dry and I have to exfoliate a lot- I think these are up to the task!</li>
    <li> Great mild exfoliant. Abrasive enough to get the job done yet mild enough that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin peel.</li>
    <li> I have used these before from a different company. I liked it then and I still love it. This company has a very good product. I also like the fact that I get two. Have not used the free book yet but will check it our in the near future.</li>
    <li> Amazing sponges!!!! I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I really like the texture of this. It feels soft and gentle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a few days, but already I love this sponge. It&#x27;s super gentle on the skin; there&#x27;s no harsh feeling during or after use. I haven&#x27;t been using it with any cleanser, just water when I&#x27;m in the shower. Just in the couple days that I&#x27;ve been adding it to my routine, I can already see a difference in my skin. My blackheads, especially on my nose, are fewer/getting smaller. I can&#x27;t wait to see it the result continue. I&#x27;ll come and update after using it for a couple of week.    Edit: It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m still loving this. I&#x27;ve made it a part of my every day routine and love how my skin looks. My fist sponge is almost \\&quot;gone\\&quot;, but I probably have other week or so left before I&#x27;ll need to switch. I&#x27;m not sure if they normally dissolve that fast or if I helped the process along by leaving it in my cosmetic bag wet. (I was traveling and had no choice). Still a solid item though!    Note: I did receive this product for free for review. My opinion is 100% honest.</li>
    <li> This is very different from any other exfoliator I have ever used. It is very gentle but has made a huge difference in my skin. I use it with Thesis Beauty face wash and it has been a great combo!</li>
    <li> The sponges fell apart totally after 3 uses, a crumbly mess.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My face feels different when i used this. And when my monthly period comes i always have one or two pimples but i didnt have one since i used this sponge for my face. Going to buy oone more for my daughters.</li>
    <li> My face feels amazing.</li>
    <li> Great sponge!!!! Can&#x27;t believe how soft and clean my skin feels after using it!</li>
    <li> Love these! I have one of those sonic circular cleaners that are popular that I use daily with my facial cleanser.  While I love it there are times when I don&#x27;t really feel like I get the &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; feeling I like when I want to truly know I exfoliated.  Since I have sensitive skin it&#x27;s hard for me to find something that gives me the clean feeling I want without agitating my skin.  These sponges give me that extra clean feeling that I love.  I really felt like my skin was perfectly clean and refreshed.  The size and shape of the sponge was very nice.  It felt like I could get all the contours of my face.  Looking forward to having these in my skin care regime from now on.</li>
    <li> gentle on skin, haven&#x27;t had any problems so far.</li>
    <li> My wife uses these all the time and loves them!</li>
    <li> WOW!!! SUPER FAST SHIPPING and excellent customer service.  Very impressed with the product and the seller! Have purchased several items from LaLuneNaturals and will continue to do so! Thanks LaLuneNaturals!!!</li>
    <li> Love konjac sponges.  Have tried the clay version in the past and decided to try the charcoal.  These are even better.  Skin feels clean and exfoliated.  I use these without a cleanser in the morning during my shower.  My skin pH has improved greatly using the konjac sponge and only using a mild cleanser once a day in the evening.  Love the 2 pack for a great price.  Enjoy.  Namaste.</li>
    <li> awesome product, gentle yet exfoliating</li>
    <li> I will update this review as I see fit after a more prolonged usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this little sponge!  It&#x27;s indulgent. It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first two washes I believe I saw a difference in my skin quality. My makeup isn&#x27;t caking on dry patches as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges come sealed in individual packages. The little cotton cord to hang the sponge seems dainty but does the trick. The auction cup is simple and also does the trick.  The sponges are hard when dry, but soften up quickly in warm water. The texture is uniquely &amp;#34;spongy&amp;#34; and comfortable. The package says you can use this with or without cleanser, so I&#x27;ve tried both.  In the a.m., I use it without. Only warm water and the sponge. In the p.m. when I am removing makeup, I use a cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for it&#x27;s value.  Considering it says that each sponge should last about 2-3 months before you should change them out, I would consider this item FANTASTIC.  I&#x27;ve used the expensive electronic facial brush in the past and I feel that this sponge cleans as well if not better. It can get into smaller locations and nooks by your nose better. It is natural. The cost is second to none in comparison to the much more expensive electric options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really happy about this item and plan on telling many</li>
    <li> Great size for using on the face.  I like that it came with strings attached and a suction cup to put on the mirror.</li>
    <li> Work as described. Like it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these konjac sponges. I had never heard of them before but now I&#x27;m telling everybody about.</li>
    <li> No difference than using any other facial sponge.  Price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> To have been using for about 2 weeks now and am already on the second sponge. The first one basically broke in half after 3 uses. Even though it says you can use cleanser with it, I think this is what broke it down. For the second one, I wash my face, rinse and then massage with the sponge. It helps with dry flakes and does make my skin feel smoother. I have sensitive skin and this is one of the only exfoliants I have been able to use that doesn&#x27;t break me out. So far I haven&#x27;t notice a difference with blackheads though.</li>
    <li> My skin now feels super soft and thoroughly exfoliated after washing. I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of months and my pores are now much smaller. I&#x27;ve also noticed fewer fine lines around my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried the green tea sponge from another seller but it was too abrasive for my skin. The La Lune Naturals charcoal sponge is much gentler, but also very effective. I just ordered two more but l really didn&#x27;t need to. The first one I ordered is still in perfect condition with no signs of wear. I thought it would be ripping and smelling like mildew by now, but it&#x27;s exactly the same as when I first purchased it.  Shipping time was fast and the product was nicely packaged so five stars across the board!</li>
    <li> I noticed my face felt so much smoother, softer and clearer within a couple of days using this sponge. I think i am hooked!</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  Soft but effective.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth as silk LOVE it</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this charcoal sponge.  I soaked it in water prior to first use.  It was very soft and did not irritate my face--I wasn&#x27;t sure it would do the job to clean and remove dead skin cells. However, my face felt very soft and exfoliated after use.  I am very impressed with it.  I get some acne on my chin - so I am hoping to see results from this sponge drawing out the impurities in my skin after continued use.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I found it soft enough for daily use and/or for anyone with sensitive skin, including rosacea.  After use, I simply squeeze between my palms to eliminate any remaining water, then allow it to air dry by hanging it on the hook which is provided with the sponge.  Also, I received the product very quickly with intact packaging and a coupon for my next order.  I would definitely order again and plan to order for my friends in the future.</li>
    <li> Feels awesome on my skin. I like to use it with my dermalogica cleanser. Great texture and foams my facial cleansers nicely. I will continue  to use the product.</li>
    <li> I was initially skeptical of this, but I saw that similar products had wonderful reviews.  I have skin that breaks out if you look at it wrong, so I was willing to try it out.  I have to say that I really love this sponge and it has improved the quality of my skin.  I can even tell a difference in my skin almost immediately if I skip a usage.  I also like that its a one stop cleanser/exfoliater and travels well, which helps lots when I have to make trips for work.  I would recommend the Konjac Sponge with Activated Charcoal to most who have breakout issues.  I love the way my skin feels after I use it, and within a month it has helped even out my complexion in addition to my breakouts.  I say give it a try, it&#x27;s cheaper than many other acne/breakout remedies and if you like it Great!, but if you don&#x27;t you wouldn&#x27;t have broken the bank...</li>
    <li> I have been using my Konjac Sponge every day since April 2015.  I really do like it and it has improved the texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I had the white milky bumps on my forehead and they are all gone from using the Konjac sponge.  This is a good product with&lt;br /&gt;great customer service.  It works !!!</li>
    <li> Great product and a bonus to get two sponges!!</li>
    <li> Nice sponges,decent size, and very soft yet exfoliating when wet. So far really happy with them!</li>
    <li> Seems to help and never left my skin dry or tight. My skin is pretty clear right now, so I can&#x27;t complain too much. I used it the first couple weeks with no cleanser at all. After a few weeks, it starts to feel kinda slimy, like you can never fully rinse it out. I do have super oily skin though. It will NOT remove eye makeup, it just smudges it around and it helps with regular makeup, but works better if you wash your face first and then go over it with the clean sponge to remove anything that&#x27;s still lingering. It does dry pretty fast and is usually dry by the next morning. I&#x27;ve still got one sponge left.</li>
    <li> These sponges are really amazing!  Exfoliates nicely and cleans well.  Also love that each sponge has a little string running through it so you can hang it to dry.</li>
    <li> This sponge is just exfoliating enough. It does take forever to dry. I tested it in my tiny bathroom and it took about 24 hrs. But, I don&#x27;t mind. I can wash my face without scrubbing to hard-- and without soap, occasionally. It&#x27;s ideal. Just make sure it is fully saturated with water, it seems brittle otherwise.</li>
    <li> I like it. Has a nice gentle exfoliating quality to it without hurting my skin like buff puffs. Saves money by not having to use so much soap like a washcloth does.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I really like this product.</li>
    <li> amazing! I love these sponges, I tried the pink clay first and use it all the time, it&#x27;s soft enough to use on my eyes when washing!!!</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s what I like about the sponges; the ridiculously small amount of soap needed to wash your whole body. It means my expensive bar soaps last longer saving me $. They aren&#x27;t abrasive so perfect for sensitive areas like your face.  My only negative, which really isn&#x27;t negative, is that I wish the sponge was bigger. It shrinks a little after you start using it and it&#x27;s small to begin with. It&#x27;s a perfect size for your face, now if a larger one for the body is offered that comes with an attachment of some sort for back scrubbing, I&#x27;ll be all over it. Great sponge.</li>
    <li> Very nice size and convenient hangar for drying. Useful for facial cleansing.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the order, time will only tell, if the product does what they say it will do...</li>
