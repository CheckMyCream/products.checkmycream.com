<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The material seems to be different in the photo but its ok i like it, the size its just perfect!</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured and swift delivery!</li>
    <li> Great colors! Fits Macbook Pro 13 inch snuggly.</li>
    <li> This case fits my Macbook Pro 13&#x27; perfectly and it is so cute! the colors are a little more vibrant than the pictures but I really love it. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> My 13 year old daughter loves it.  She was a little surprised as she thought it was going to be more of a neoprene material, but it is a heavy cloth.  Not an issue for her.  Very cute and durable.</li>
    <li> This is a great case and it is a really great price compared to similar cases I&#x27;ve seen in stores. I&#x27;ve used it almost daily for the past 6 months and have had no issues. The zippers work smoothly and there is no signs of where except that the color is somewhat less vibrant than I think it used to be, but this is expected with the use of any fabric item. The soft lining of the inside is wonderful! and I think it the think material protests my laptop really well without making my computer feel super bulky, some times I also put papers inside so they will stay flat but the case still does not feel super thick. REALLY REALLY recommend!</li>
    <li> Really love everything about this case - great protection, sturdy, light and pretty !</li>
    <li> I have used this for my 13&amp;#34; MacBook Air for about 10 months. It is exactly what I hoped for, a pretty, zippered sleeve that protects my laptop when I carry it in bags with no built-in laptop sleeve.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. The teeth on the zipper feel a little cheap, but overall it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I did well.  Really well.  I actually ordered something my wife likes, without her explicit approval!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fits the 13.3&amp;#34; Macbook Air without any issues.  The inside is soft and smooth, offering good protection from scratches.  The entire case is just padded enough that you can throw the laptop into a bag with this case on.  No dedicated computer bag necessary.  My wife likes that.</li>
    <li> Not bad, serves its purpose. Cute colors, canvassy feel. At first I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the rough texture on the outside fabric, but then I dropped it in the snow and was glad it had such a sturdy material :) Soft inside, great price. I expected kind of a snugger fit, but no big deal.</li>
    <li> Great ! I love the material inside.</li>
    <li> When you buy this you are guaranteed to be happy about it. Choose these distributors too. I love the product it works perfectly, not cheaply made by any standards, and the company makes sure of your satisficatication. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> Great case! Fits my MacBook perfectly. Nicely padded on the inside.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality Laptop sleeve for the price.  The inside is super soft, fabric on the outside is high quality.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my MacBook Air and my Chrome Book. Yes, it&#x27;s a little big for the Chrome book, but that way I can also bring the power cord. Love the design. Durable and fun.</li>
    <li> I love it. The pattern is fun and the inside lining is a nice surprise. I only wish it had an internal pocket to toss my charger in it.</li>
    <li> I love the pattern! and it&#x27;s actually really nicely made. Almost a tough canvas feel to it which I wanted to protect my MacBook. Strong zipper. Nice protective fuzzy inside lining. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Love the pattern fits my Macbook air perfectly it does have just enough padding to protect you precious baby if it were to ever fall.  The colors are more vivid which was awesome I get tons of compliments on it!  It&#x27;s not cheap material at all.  Love it and can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> love it, love it, love it, love it.  It looks awesome and is exactly as advertized.  It is pretty.  I carry my laptop with pride.</li>
    <li> Love my Mac Air case! A little lighter than pictured, but the colors are still really nice. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Beautiful!  Functional, and wonderfully protective!  With a house full of children, this was just what I needed to protect my computer!</li>
    <li> Product arrived right away and is exactly as described. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my friend and she loves it. The colors are vibrant and it seemed well equipped to protect her laptop.</li>
    <li> i recommend it! i got it for my 11 inch notebook so i could also carry a school book. fits perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a great case. It is pretty and the inside is very soft. I am so glad I bought it for my Macbook Air 13.3 inch laptop.</li>
    <li> It is just what I wanted and is exactly as described</li>
    <li> Loved the colors. Very well made however would have been perfect with handle. Was a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loved it!</li>
    <li> Fits my 13&amp;#34; Macbook Pro (the older 2010 model) perfectly. The cover is gorgeous and the material is nice. It had kind of a &amp;#34;new car&amp;#34; smell when I got it and I&#x27;m trying to air it out a little. This case definitely doesn&#x27;t look cheap and I appreciate designers&#x27; attention to detail in making it. This was a great find. Thank you, amazon!</li>
    <li> good buy, i just wish there were a pocket for my laptop cord. It fits my mac air very well though.</li>
    <li> Such a cute cover. It is just like described and fits my Mac book Air very nicely. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love my new laptop bag. It is super vibrant and it is soft of the inside and I think it gives the macbook a good source of protection. I would definitely recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I bought it for my new MacBook Air and it looks exactly like the picture. It fits my laptop perfectly and I always get compliments on it. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> nice quality. I like the padding, it&#x27;s very soft. design is cute and as expected from the pictures</li>
    <li> it fits my mac book pro w/ retina display with room to spare, which i dont mind. i can fit a notebook or two inside. i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the bag smells real bad, but nothing that cant be fixed. just let it air out for a few days. The shipment came within 3 days! very happy about that. overall a great buy!</li>
    <li> This was a perfect pick for my mac!!! It fits perfectly, my mac doesn&#x27;t move in the case, but it isn&#x27;t a tight squeeze either! I think the colors looked even better when I got it. I am sooo satisfied with this order.</li>
    <li> This case is perfect for my 13&amp;#34; MacBook Air. There&#x27;s extra room in it that allows me to put some computer games or cords in. It also smells really good when you first open it :)</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Quality item.</li>
    <li> Overall, very satisfied with my case.  Good quality, vibrant colors, and I love the fuzz inside.  I&#x27;ve received several compliments on it; would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> It was the right size to fit my 13 inch Macbook Pro. It doesn&#x27;t have the most protective inside, but I figure it works just fine for what I need. It is a nice pattern. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am Native American, so I was attracted to this for the print.  It is a very nice, thick canvas-type cloth with a velvety inside lining.  Since it is such a good fit, I can easily slide it into my regular computer bag for added protection.</li>
    <li> I wanted something a little different for my new Mac book so decided on this case! The material is sturdy -canvas like, and keeps a nice shape! Happy with my purchase -thanks!</li>
    <li> Very pretty pattern and sturdy zipper! Fits my 13&amp;#34; MacBookPro perfectly, with a little extra room (if I ever put a hardcase on it, I think it would still fit). Very pleased.</li>
    <li> still totally cute and worth it though it is light and perfect size so there isnt a problem with getting it to zip or anything</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter it is good quality and a very unique cute pattern. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This was for my daughter. She is in collage and takes her apple pro to school everyday. She loves the design. It protects her computer in her bag. Her computer still looks like new. Thanks so much for a stylish bag my picky daughter will use.</li>
    <li> My mom sent me this laptop cover while I was at school! It was a perfect surprise, I love it!</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this for a birthday gift for her MacBook Air.  It fits very well and she uses it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I just both an Mac Air and of course wanted to protect it. I love the color and pattern on it. The inside is soft and protective.&lt;br /&gt;The only improvement would be to have a strap or handles.</li>
    <li> It does the same job of other brand, much more expensive, computer sleeves. It&#x27;s sturdy and well padded, and the patterns are very cool. I really like my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love love love my laptop case.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect fit, adorably different and nicely padded.&lt;br /&gt;Every person who has seen it wants it!!</li>
    <li> i bought this case for my 13&#x27; mac book and it fit perfectly! absolutely no complaints! there&#x27;s a really soft fur lining the inside and the outside is so bohemian and pretty. this case is really protective when i travel and for daily use as well!</li>
    <li> Nice quality, fits my Asus 2-in-1 13&amp;#34; laptop perfectly.</li>
    <li> It is very colorful and fits perfect with my MacBook. The padding is just right to keep it protected from damages.</li>
    <li> awesome pattern, perfect amount of cushioning, and the fuzzy material on the inside is wicked cool. The zipper is quality too</li>
    <li> Great stuff for my laptop furry inside is very fancy!</li>
    <li> Love this bag, the colors are absolutely beautiful.  It is everything I expected. The outside is made of durable canvas fabric and the inside is made of super soft chamois.  My 13 inch mac pro with retina screen fit nicely, with a little room to spare, couldn&#x27;t ask for a better match.  Am very happy with this purchase.  Is well worth the price!</li>
    <li> fits my Dell laptop like a glove.  loke the bright colors too.</li>
    <li> The colors were dull and I did not like the overall fabric either. Would not recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> Very nice, high quality case. The plush interior doesn&#x27;t scratch the laptop, and the fun pattern on the outside is very cute (colors are true to the picture). I bought it to carry my 13&amp;#34; MacBook Pro in. Since the case holds up to 13.3&amp;#34; laptops, it is a little roomy for the MacBook, but the extra room allows for me to toss in my external USB hard drive and bluetooth mouse as well. Fast delivery too. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> The fabric is really soft, and thickly padded. The zipper is flawless, and the colors are vibrant and what a great pattern. It only took 1 day to ship too!</li>
    <li> Being a hippy college girl, my kid was very happy with this Mac sleeve. This, plus every item I could find to protect our investment, was well worth the money. She&#x27;s hip, cool, and her friends are asking where she got the sleeve.</li>
    <li> Seems like a durable case. One minor complaint - the case is identical on both sides, so you can&#x27;t tell which side is up or down. I don&#x27;t like to put my laptop screen-side down, so I have to unzip the case to check.</li>
    <li> I love this laptop sleeve. You can&#x27;t tell how great it is just by looking at the picture. It is super thick and padded on the inside and outside for maximum protection, and the design is absolutely beautiful. My macbook air fits perfectly into it. I love this sleeve so much I definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> Bright colors nicely made and a value for the price to protect a laptop or tablet.  Very girly love it !!!</li>
    <li> My Kids loved it. It was for them and it was  their choice. They use it daily for school. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a well-padded solid-quality MacBook Pro computer cover and I&#x27;m very satisfied thus far with this purchase. The colors are muted, but still a nice pattern in person.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s so much easier to have it kept clean, finger print free. Design is awesome! Glad I got it! Never leave without it!</li>
    <li> It is very soft inside, perfect for protecting my Mac book air! I can include scoring the charger and mouse with the computer</li>
    <li> Beautiful laptop case.  I really like that it&#x27;s cover is a sturdy, cotton fabric.  Delivered quickly, no problems at all.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Wonderful quality, fast shipping!! I especially love the inside, it&#x27;s very soft and ensures no scratches on my macbook. Would definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> This computer cover is made of a fun print. It is of great quality. I Love the soft plush interior.</li>
    <li> The sleeve is exactly what it looks like in the picture! Love the design. Very satisfied with this product :)</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, exactly what I expected. Very happy with my purchase. Rubber baby buggie bumper. Still not long enough! FINALLY!!!!</li>
    <li> The color is much brighter in the photo than in real life. It still looks great and is much better looking than the normal plain case. It is wide enough to fit my Mac book air with a hard case on. The inside is fuzzy and orange while the outside is a lovely colorful pattern.</li>
    <li> Love this case. So cute. Fits my 13 inch MacBook Pro even with another case on the actual laptop. Highly recommended for anyone who wants a cute unique case</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Beautiful colors and I know my tablet is being protected. Lightweight and stylish, I&#x27;m already receiving compliments!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this case! I have enough room to put my mac plus a notebook. It&#x27;s great for when I have just one or two classes during the day because I just grab that instead of carrying my backpack! Definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a case!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!!! It&#x27;s very light weight and easy to use.  I &#x27;m so glad I bought it!!! I loved the style and it look exactly how it did online!!!</li>
    <li> Inside is very soft and fuzzy...I could stroke it all day. jk that&#x27;s weird but yeah it&#x27;s really really soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case itself is very thick -- so it gives me a feeling that it&#x27;s actually cushioned and protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colors are bright and lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zipper is very strong and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> The case is a nice fit for the laptop.  There is enough room for cords.  I can also get my iPad in the case for days I want them both.  I bought a case with a design so I could easily spot it in the piles on my desk.</li>
    <li> Product arrived timely and was great quality. My daughter was happy with this graduation gift to go with her mac.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and value. Very cute.</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful, the quality is nice. Great and so cute for the price! Fits my Macbook Air perfectly!</li>
    <li> My grandaughter picked this bag for her new laptop and absolutely loves it.  Would recommend to buy to provide class to your laptop.</li>
    <li> This product was perfect! I received it in a timely fashion and I am in love! It&#x27;s like a tweed fabric so it feels very durable. The inside is a nice soft flat fur type material and helps protect the surface of my laptop. I have a macbook air 13in and my laptop fits into this bag perfectly! The colors are super cute and earthy. Mine looks just like the picture. I read some other reviews that said something about the color being brighter than the pic, but mine is not. I love it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like the design in person and I love it! It has a stripped design instead of the blue pattern on the other side which I think looks perfect. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is sometimes when I pull the zipper fast it will get stuck on the inside fabric, besides that it is well worth your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy for the price!!</li>
    <li> Good fabric, soft and nice from inside. Looks awesome and stylish. However, the colors aren&#x27;t soo bright like they look online.</li>
    <li> This laptop sleeve fits my 13in Macbook pro perfectly. The design is cute, zippers and canvas are of good quality. Definitely worth the price. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this case, it is really cute. The colors are a little darker in person but I don&#x27;t mind!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter for college. She loves it.  It is perfect for the price especially compared to other cases she looked at.</li>
    <li> I love it inside it so soft highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Love this! It is perfect for putting it in my work bag and having that little extra protection, rather than just sticking it in the bag unprotected. Not too bulky so fits good in another bag.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s even better than I thought it would be. The inside lining is perfect for protecting a Mac. It&#x27;s so colorful and cute and goes perfectly with my tote I already use. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Like the design, love the colors, good quality, soft in the inside, cute case, Love it, 100% recommended, it is the perfect fit for my macbook air pro :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful and great quality. Smells a bit like moth balls but that is an easy fix.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cute thing to use. However when I first got it it had a smell. So I put it outside and wait for the smell to go away.</li>
    <li> Great bag! It&#x27;s so cute, and it fits my laptop perfectly. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it! Also the insid lining is a bit furry which was a great plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had with it was that it smelled a little (inside) when it first arrived. But you can easily fix this by airing it out.</li>
    <li> I love this case. The colors and the patterns are beautiful. Colors are even nicer in person. I do agree with others on here though, the case definitely had a strong odor. I let it air out and it was gone. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The inside of the case is amazingly soft and provides great protection for the laptop. Everything I wanted it to be!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> Only had it about a week but so far so good. Smelled horrid coming out of the wrapping but it faded quickly. Love the pattern!</li>
    <li> Reasonable price. Like it.&lt;br /&gt;The color is not as bright as the picture. But I like it,especially the material.Plus it is very light.</li>
    <li> It fits my 13&amp;#34; macbook perfectly. I love the beautiful design - it&#x27;s just like the pic. The colors are perfect and it fits my style.  Seems sturdy enough and has a soft inside. I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on it, already.</li>
    <li> I was a bit unsure of what the case was going to look like but its more beautiful than I imagined. Definitely worth buying!</li>
    <li> nice soft place to slide your laptop in to. Good fabric and color.</li>
    <li> I purchased this case for my 13-inch Macbook Air.  I specifically wanted something that I could place my laptop in to provide extra protection when traveling.  I popped my laptop in the case which I then carried in my back-pack or purse.  It provided extra padding, kept it from being damaged from any stray pens or other items and was stylish.  Not water proof or anything, but the fabric is think enough to provide adequate protection from most things.</li>
    <li> Very cute. Not a ton of protection, but always nice to have another layer around your computer.</li>
    <li> Great value for such a low price.</li>
    <li> Great case. The pattern is great, and it fits my 13.3 in MacBook Pro fabulously.</li>
    <li> Nice, well made and very functional for Macbook protection and travel.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I liked the Bohemian Style of the canvas fabric when I searched online for a cover for my new laptop. When I received it in the mail, it was everything I expected it to be. It slides right into my purse/bookbag/carryall easily to take to work, school and back home. I love it and its unique style! :) Thanks Plemo.</li>
    <li> Love it! My laptop fits perfectly and the print is adorable!</li>
    <li> This computer sleeve is so well made, has designer written all over it.  It is off to Finland and many other adventures.  It compares to high end products!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what the description said.  I&#x27;m so happy I decided to get it to protect my laptop. Love it!</li>
    <li> L❤️VE  this laptop cover!!!!! Use it EVERYDAY. Very durable and VERY well made. I love the colors</li>
    <li> Such a cute little bag for my laptop!</li>
    <li> Very unique laptop sleeve! I was very impressed with the quality and color. True to the picture. Easily fits my 13&amp;#34; mac.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  We have an Asus Ultrabook 13 inch and it works great for us.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this case for almost a year and I love it, the pattern is very cute and the colors are pretty much exactly what you see.</li>
    <li> This sleeve is just padded enough to put in a backpack or purse without damaging the laptop, but adds very little bulk to the laptop. Very soft fleecy material inside and nice design on the outside, exactly as pictured. Fits my Macbook Air 13&amp;#34; perfectly.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised and well worth price...... Durable, quality construction, fits like a glove.  Just can&#x27;t say anything bad about it..</li>
    <li> Obviously she liked the style/colors; and it seems to be well made and fits perfectly.  Zipper is well made, and sturdy.</li>
    <li> I got the 14&amp;#34; and it is a bit smaller.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Super stylish and perfect for my HP stream 13</li>
    <li> Perfect laptop cause, suits my needs perfectly.  I hardly take my laptop anywhere, but wanted protection when I do, so this fits the bill!  I feel it adequately protects my laptop.  The only downside is the smell that seems to never go away...I am extremely sensitive to those chemical sort of smells, and the foam of this product emits a scent that is strong, which fades after a while but is still noticeable.</li>
    <li> love it!!! super soft inside.</li>
    <li> Love it..it holds my Mac Book Pro and my mouse perfect! Very nicely made with extra padding inside! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my new computer and am not disappointed. I am usually not one to complain about chemical smells from new products since it is just part of the deal when buying items made with synthetic materials, but it does have a pretty potent smell on the interior of the case. I just got mine yesterday and am letting it air out a bit before I keep my laptop in there with the zipper closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, colors are just a degree more intense/bold than in the image, but I can live with that. It is still a very cute case and is a cheap way to show some personality besides just black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those interested, the Yoga 2 Pro is 13&amp;#34; x 8 5/8&amp;#34; x 9/16&amp;#34; and it fits in the case like a glove. You could go a bit larger in the depth, but not much more in the length and width before the zipper would have issues closing.</li>
    <li> After shopping for the more expensive sleeves, I realized that I really only needed something attractive and affordable. This sleeve is a perfect choice! The inside is very soft; it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m putting my MacBook Air to sleep on a bearskin rug! I am very happy with my purchase, and would definitely buy more of these as gifts in the future.</li>
    <li> The colors are great. The material is durable. It doesn&#x27;t provide much protection, though, but a good way to carry the laptop around. It keeps it clean. It&#x27;s easy to slip the laptop in and out of it. Nice sturdy zipper.  I do recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product, good finish. I got this for my wife, she loved it.</li>
    <li> Only get if you have a Mac. I have a Dell, I measured my computer and the dimensions lined up. Once I got the case, my computer wouldn&#x27;t fit and it still doesn&#x27;t zip shut.  Buy it bigger.</li>
    <li> Design varies a little from the photo but, it fits my 13.3 in HP Split x2 perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great product- my Mac air 13 inch fits beautifully. Feels sturdy and safe. Well made.</li>
    <li> I love this case and I&#x27;ve had several compliments on it. It has a very soft inside and overall this case seems to be very well made, especially for the price I paid. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, well made, &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> This colorful sleeve worked great for my Macbook. Not for protection if dropped but keeps dust away and looks nice sitting out!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted, and even nicer than expected.  Besides being beautiful (photographed colors are very accurate), it has a nice soft lining and is large enough to fit cords, files, etc. into if necessary.</li>
    <li> The case is both aesthetic and useful. It fits well, is stitched tightly, and gives my laptop proper insulation. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> This sleeve fit my 13 inch MacBook Pro perfectly.</li>
    <li> The colors are very beautiful and the case is well made. There&#x27;s a fur-like lining inside that&#x27;s brown to keep your computer scuff free. The outside is canvas and the zipper is good quality. The only thing about this case is it stinks. It has a strong, chemical odor similar to petroleum products. I&#x27;ve had this happen before with other cases for things like iPads, computers, backpacks, etc. Usually the product just needs to air out for a few days.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s adorable and very unique. I haven&#x27;t seen another case like it and the lining is very soft. Great case.</li>
    <li> This case is exactly what i needed! It fits my mac book pro perfectly! Thick enough to protect but not so thick its bulky and annoying!</li>
    <li> it is really cute, i gave it 3 stars because of the looks and how nicely it fits my macbook air but i got it and the very next day the zipper fell off.... needless to say i am extremely disappointed</li>
    <li> The case design isn&#x27;t as well printed as the one on the picture but its still very nice. i agree with others; theres a weird funky smell to it but i think its cause of packaging and such. I aired mine out for a while and its just a faint odor. Overall, i like the case.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really pretty &amp; stylish case!! It&#x27;s perfect for my MacBook!</li>
    <li> I love this cover for my mac laptop.  It is so well made and the inside has such a nice lush lining.  You will not be disappointed.  Great for taking your laptop on the go</li>
    <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t do this case justice. Nice colors and texture.</li>
    <li> Wonderful material and beautiful!</li>
    <li> This computer case is a bit big for my 13 inch Macbook Air, but I can also fit my cord inside when I&#x27;m traveling to and from the office. So I guess it all works out :)</li>
    <li> A little big for my 13&amp;#34; MBP Retina, but a cute pattern and well constructed case.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my dell laptop, have also got many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on my computer sleeve because it&#x27;s so vibrant and cheerful! The colors are a bit darker in person vs the picture but not dark enough to really gripe about.</li>
    <li> Very nice looking. Do not expect a soft material.  It is actually quite rough to the touch.</li>
    <li> So cute and it&#x27;s protective as well!</li>
    <li> Love my Bohemian cover which I use for my Macbook Air! Soft protective cover to protect.  I receive lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this case for about a 9 months now and although the fabric has held up, I cannot say the same for the zipper. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t review this months ago when the zipper began to give me trouble, but I might as well write it now to warn others. About 6 months ago (I know! It was only about 3 months old!) some of the zipper teeth fell off and were nowhere to be found. I have had to deal with the zipper coming off of one side of the jacket from the lack of grooves to keep it in place, but now I have (sadly) learned to live with it by only unzipping it 3/4 open and wiggling my laptop out because if I zip it anymore, the zipper will give. I tried to return it when it began to fall apart, but it said that the return window had closed and well here I am now stuck with my broken laptop case. It&#x27;s cute other than that.</li>
    <li> Such a cute laptop case. I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of complements. It protects my baby so well! Absolutely love it :) people have said it has a funny smell but mine didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Good quality product. Just wish it fit my 13.3&amp;#34; MacBook a little better. But it&#x27;s probably meant for a regular MacBook Pro not the retina display. colors are vibrant and the inside is soft furry material. Zipper is also good quality.</li>
    <li> Bright and nice colors. Fits the Mac perfectly. easy to carry anywhere.</li>
    <li> My 18 year old daughter loved it for college.</li>
    <li> Love it! Fits perfectly! I have a 10 inch Mac Pro. Thick but not too! Great price too! Shopped around before buying.</li>
    <li> Initially I was drawn in by the adorable and fun pattern, but once I received it I found it was a quality product. It&#x27;s the perfect amount of durability that I was looking for and the velvety lining is protective and fancy! Great carrying case, it&#x27;s just what I wanted and it fits my laptop beautifully.</li>
    <li> This case fit my new HP Pavilion x360 13.3 inch perfectly.  The case is super cute and soft.  It&#x27;s nice to put my laptop in for putting it in my oversized purse or just looks nice in the livingroom on the coffee table. It&#x27;s extremely well made!</li>
    <li> It works great it is nice quality but is almost too small for my 13.3 in laptop</li>
    <li> perfect.i would like to order againa good packing.</li>
    <li> Soft, works well. I love it.</li>
    <li> Nice design and quality</li>
    <li> Seller shipped very quickly.  Item is well made.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> super soft on the inside; has protected my laptop after a few drops. super cute</li>
    <li> LOVE this laptop sleeve! It provides great protection for my 13 inch MacBook Pro, and the colors and design are beautiful. The inner lining is a soft fuzzy fabric so I know my laptop will be protected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a perfect case for my Mac. Love the design.</li>
    <li> Beautiful design and very good quality</li>
    <li> I got this for my 13 inch macbook air and it looks fantastic, fits like a glove (the actual gloves I own don&#x27;t fit me well so I am confused about that similie choice) and the fabric design looks adorable. Also, there wouldn&#x27;t be a small brown badge shouting the brand name anywhere on the sleeve, which if you ask me is a plus. I could give it five stars but I am leaving one star out because I am uncertain of the durability (P.S. I just got this today). The inside looks well stitched and well insulated like suede.</li>
    <li> 2 weeks and zippers dont work. They got stuck and then out of zipper track.</li>
    <li> I get tons of compliments on it!!</li>
    <li> cover is pretty good for the price.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best purchases I have done for my computer. The case is very protective and it is a nice feel.</li>
    <li> This laptop case is perfect and durable. It goes to HS everyday in a backpack.  It protects the laptop as designed.  The quality of the workmanship is excellent.  The print design is very nice and receives complements from others.</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture.  I love my new case.  It has a nice plush inside and the zipper seems really high quality.  I bought this for my 13 inch MacBook Air.  It fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> The inside is so soft! And it&#x27;s super stylish. I have gotten many compliments on it! Protects my laptop very well.</li>
    <li> The fit of this MacBook case is perfect, the quality very good, and it&#x27;s boho-cool to look at. I love the vibrant pattern and colors.</li>
    <li> The colors are a lot more vibrant than in the picture, but it is not off-putting and still very pretty! I ordered the 13&amp;#34; for my 13&amp;#34; Macbook Air that has a hard case on it and was worried that it would be too small, but it fit perfectly! Not too tight at all.</li>
    <li> SO adorable, looks way more expensive than the $13.99 I paid for. I absolutely love my new mac case. HIGHLY recommended.</li>
    <li> Overall, I really like the sleeve, the only thing to look out for is sometimes it causes my computer t overheat because I put it in too early.</li>
    <li> The design is cute and the fabric is durable, but the zipper breaks quite easily. Within just a few months of use, the plastic zipper pieces began to break off, and shortly after, one of the zippers came off of the track. Now the case can only zip about 3/4 of the way, and more zipper pieces continue to fall off. It was a good deal, but don&#x27;t expect the case to last in the long run.</li>
    <li> Fits my mac book air perfectly, soft inner lining, and a little extra room to fit in paperwork. The only improvement would be to have a strap of handle for carrying.</li>
    <li> I get lots of compliments. Sweet colors and fun pattern. Insulates my laptop well and has lots of extra space for my 15 inch macbook pro.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 13&amp;#34; Macbook Pro and I really do love the case. It&#x27;s really pretty and padded. The ONLY Thing I don&#x27;t like is there&#x27;s not enough room to store my charger without making it somewhat bulky. I would like to have that added (maybe a front pocket?) but it&#x27;s really pretty and it serves its purpose well.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this product!!</li>
    <li> adorable!!! i love it! fits my mac like it was meant for it ;)</li>
    <li> really good sleeve at a good price.</li>
    <li> This case is wonderful.  Very pretty and functional.  I am very happy with this purchase and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, strong- many compliments!  It fits my MacBook Air but don&#x27;t expect to carry lots of extra gadgets. It  fits my charger but it&#x27;s designed for the laptop only. It is slim and tucks nicely into a larger backpack or handbag.</li>
    <li> Fits my 13 inch macbook pro perfectly.  Love the colors and the fabric!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> This case is awesome. It took me a while to actually find this case on amazon, but its worth it. It small, tight fitted,has cushion on the inside for protection, and seems durable. The only down side is that there isn&#x27;t space for my laptop charger.</li>
    <li> So cute! Fits my 13&amp;#34; MacBook perfectly, cute to carry, and padded for protection. Pattern is crisp and vibrant, and seems very well made. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I  bought this as a gift for my wife for her 13&amp;#34; macbook pro and she loved it. it has an excellent built with nice finish. The colors are a lot more vibrant than in the picture, but is still very pretty. The 13&amp;#34; Macbook Pro fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true to color but the colors fade</li>
    <li> The case fits perfectly and looks good. Well made and nice cushioning for my computer. This computer sleeve compares very favorably to higher priced items selling at the Apple store.</li>
    <li> I love the colors, the quality is great, and it got her faster than I&#x27;d imagined. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for, and way more affordable than buying it in-store!</li>
    <li> Like some of the other reviews said, this case is a lot more vibrant than the product images show.  I also have the iBenzer plastic hard case ( [[ASIN:B00GB8GUSQ B00GB8GUSQ]] my macbook and it still fits perfectly in this case!  Couldnt be happier with this purchase!</li>
    <li> The case fits my 14&amp;#34; laptop well though the colours weren&#x27;t quite as they were depicted online. Other than that, good case for the price.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with the way the case looks, but width, length, and height are all just a little too big for the 13in macbook air. It&#x27;s nice being able to easily slide the computer in and out of the case, but I would prefer it if the case were just a little smaller. The pattern is adorable though!!!</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as it was described, and the measurements were exact. I loved the inside lining and it was true to the product&#x27;s image color!</li>
    <li> I really like this case. It is gorgeous and my MacBook Air fits perfectly. The smooth lining is lovely. Overall a great product. I would definitely order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Lovely! I love it so much and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments. Had it for almost five months and no signs of wear and tear. So sturdy and strong fabric.</li>
    <li> The print is so cute and it arrived right on time. It is very soft on the inside and I am so happy I bought this product!! It keeps my laptop nice and snug.</li>
    <li> I received this today and although the colours were a little deeper and less &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; than illustrated or as I&#x27;d prefer; the case has a great quality and feel to it - definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;The inside is nicely plush with a super soft fur-like feel (I&#x27;m not too crazy on boring old neoprene).&lt;br /&gt;The overall design &amp; &amp;#34;Bohemian&amp;#34; pattern is gorgeous and really appealed to my artistic side. Zip closure is substantial and of quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said - I am returning it! Only to get it in a bigger size, because the zip does not close easily at all over the sharp corners of my laptop, and will destroy the metal edges of the computer after a few attempts. I just need to decide if want to re-order this design again, or the Mystic Forest?</li>
    <li> Excellent service and product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fits my Macbook Air nicely. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Everything about this little case is well made and the materials (fabrics and zip) are top quality.  Amazing deal for the price.</li>
    <li> I give this case a 3 star rating because it came in time, very well packaged, and in good condition. However after having this case for only three months the zipper broke. The degradation of the zipper disappointed me and the lack of a warranty disappointed me even more. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this case for my Mac book Air.  It has a very nice lining and is a sturdy case as well as beautiful!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my case, and it is exactly as expected. Soft interior, fits the computer even with a hard shell case, and the pattern is so cute.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described,fits my macbook air perfectly!</li>
    <li> I love my laptop sleeve.  It&#x27;s very pretty and has a soft lining inside.  It also fits my Macbook Pro perfectly.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I love this case. It looks exactly like it did online. My only issue is that i have a macbook pro with retina display so it is a bit smaller. And i didn&#x27;t realize that when i bought it. But otherwise, I love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sleeve for my 13&amp;#34; MacBook Air. The colors are great and it&#x27;s nicely lined with a soft padding. The size of the sleeve is a couple inches larger than my computer so it can slip around but it also makes it easier to get on and off. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I really it.  I appreciate the interior it is a suede like material which will protect my Lenovo. Good choice</li>
    <li> Cute case for a good price. Quick shipping!</li>
    <li> This is a great laptop case. The interior is plush and soft and prevents scratches on my brand new computer. Perfect to slip into a tote bag or backpack. I love the pattern on it. Canvas makes it feel authentic and rustic. I am really glad I made this purchase. Quite a good price for such an amazing product.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and the textures of the insides. The inside of the case feels nice and smooth. Very soft. The colors do seem a bit more vibrant than the preview, but the case overall is very good for its price.</li>
    <li> It has a beautiful pattern and is holding up without any rips, snags, or tears. The inside is nice and soft and it fits my laptop perfectly. It is exactly what i was looking for to help protect my laptop without going with a heavy duty hard case.</li>
    <li> Great product, super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a perfect fit for my Mac Air 13&amp;#34; laptop, and protects it through grueling travel. I just tested it out with a trip out-of-the-country, and it was so convenient to just pull out the sleeve as I went through security. Yes, it did have a very strong chemical smell, but I did two things: hung it outside for several days to air it out, and now I keep a fabric softener sheet inside to ensure the smell remains minimal.  I expect I&#x27;ll remove it shortly since the smell is already decreasing. An earlier reviewer recommended this, and what a great idea!&lt;br /&gt;I love the bright colors (true to the picture) and love that it&#x27;s unique. The Mac stores have basic and boring choices, and I&#x27;m so glad I found this - it&#x27;s more representative of my style!</li>
    <li> Not only is it super cute but it&#x27;s perfect for my mac. With the soft lining, my laptop slides right in and out without a hitch. The zipper glides open really easy and stays closed. I love it and can&#x27;t wait to show it off!</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s stylish and comfortable to carry. Plus the fur inside feels super nice so I&#x27;m sure my Mac loves it too :)</li>
    <li> A little larger than I wanted but it does what it is supposed to and is light weight.  Attractive design true to picture.</li>
    <li> This laptop case is everything I could want - bright, cheerful fabric, well padded, well constructed, and fits my Vaio perfectly!</li>
    <li> Love the colors combo!</li>
    <li> Love this sleeve! It&#x27;s perfect for my MacBook Air!</li>
    <li> Smells a little funny but it goes away. Much brighter than picture, fits perfectly. Very cute</li>
    <li> This sleeve/case fits my MacBook Air perfectly and serves my particular needs for my notebook.  It allows very little room for anything else, so no cords or accessories fit, but it is very mobil.  Also, I like the print and quality of the fabric and zipper.</li>
    <li> Material is even better than I expected to be</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, very good quality, great customer service (they emailed me to make sure I am happy with the product).&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it.  Should do the job.</li>
    <li> This laptop sleeve is very attractive and functional.  It arrived right on time. I am pleased with the product and the service.</li>
    <li> Item arrived promptly and was perfect. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Good quality, can protect Mac very well, a little bit smell, inside is perfect, I like the beautiful pattern.</li>
    <li> Practical &amp; easy to find when in other bag.</li>
    <li> I use this every day to protect my laptop as I&#x27;ve shattered a screen before. Its light and fits in even my smallest backpack. Great coloring and protective inside.</li>
    <li> It met my expectation, very well made and just love the print of the material. I hope it last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I LUV this case. Great fabric, light weight and solid zipper!</li>

    <li> It Fits my computer perfectly. And it&#x27;s great quality. I love it!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> Perfect case! Fit the MacBook Pro retina 13inch very well. Bright color and design with good protection.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughters new macbook. The sleeve fits well. She likes the design of the fabric. The lining on the inside is very soft. It appears that this will provide a nice layer of protection when transporting her computer.</li>
    <li> Well made and lovely to behold. Seems sturdy and all the protection one needs for carrying their laptop around. It would not protect against abuse or a drop into a hard surface, but perfect for day to day transport.</li>
    <li> It was more than expected. It was a gift and was great. Really well made and colors were beautiful.</li>
    <li> Used this on a Lenovo Yoga tablet and great for storage and carrying around.  I received many compliments on the style too,</li>
    <li> I got this product two mornings later.  It&#x27;s in great condition.  Beautiful colors, and it looks expensive!  I&#x27;ve already gotten many compliments.</li>
    <li> Very attractive  and protective ... comes in handy when I transport my Mac.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my MacBook Pro. Fits easily into my work bag or nice to carry separately. I have received many compliments on it and you really can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> Well-made, sturdy construction, fun print, easy to spot clean, zipper runs like buttah with nice molded pull tabs. The 13&amp;#34; fits my MacbookPro (w/o retina display) with plastic shell perfectly; snug but not too tight. Also fits well w/o molded shell. Great price, highly recommended! When the time comes to replace, I&#x27;ll stick with PLEMO.</li>
    <li> The colors aren&#x27;t as bright in person, but I still love this case. It&#x27;s nice and padded inside as well.</li>
    <li> Love the colors, makes me happy to see it. Arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Great sleeve for my MacBook Air!! Love the colors and design! Everywhere I go, I get so many compliments! Thanks PLEMO and Amazon!</li>
    <li> I loved this computer sleeve until the zipper broke less than 2 months after I received it.  My daughter and stepdaughter have not had a problem with theirs but I am very dissapointed as it must have been defective but I did not realize there was an option to return until my friend told me only for me to find I am unable to contact PLEMO after 90 days.  Poor customer service and I will not buy from this brand again which is a shame because their stuff is beautiful:(</li>
    <li> it broke! the  teeth started to break off then it was hard to access the computer inside it...</li>
    <li> Very well made-- pleasantly surprised for the price. Nice and stylish. I like that the zipper is a durable rubbery plastic, not metal. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Really loved the canvas sleeve.  Have a Dell XPS that fits perfectly.  The lining is very good quality and will protect my laptop well.  Quality is very good and colors mirrored the web site view perfectly.</li>
