### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I have a lot of job stress, so this sounded like the perfect deodorant to try.</li>
      <li>This will be the perfect product for me in the summer.</li>
      <li>It does a great job of blocking the sweat and covering odors.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product about two weeks now &amp; haven&#x27;t experienced any skin irritation.  </li>
      <li>I would be great with a flamethrower or a sledgehammer.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice deodorant.</li>
      <li>Without a question, this deodorant will be effective and do what it is intended to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s effective and lasts throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>This deodorant did not disappoint: it provided adequate protection and has a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>But maybe that&#x27;s a good thing because the scent is super</li>
      <li>What I really love it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave the &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; stains on your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is fragrant, but it&#x27;s not a fragrance I really love.  </li>
      <li>Although I can’t get into the habit of putting my deodorant on before bed and not applying more in the morning, I tend to like Clinical Protection Deodorants.</li>
      <li>Stick with your favorite deodorant ...</li>
      <li>Some people who do not sweat a lot might not realize that when stressed you do sweat more.</li>
      <li>After putting it on, and I do so at night, the smell mostly disappears.</li>
      <li>/&gt;But while I love how the product works, I don’t care for the scent.  </li>
      <li>Most folks do not need \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; at all.</li>
      <li>It has a nice light scent.</li>
      <li>couldn&#x27;t wear this deodorant for more than a couple days because the scent was overwhelming.</li>
      <li>The scent was more noticeable than on most deodorants.</li>
      <li>The smell is ok, but it&#x27;s just ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a clean soap smell that is nice and neutral.</li>
      <li>It’s not that it brought to mind any particular scent, but I just didn’t find it pleasant.</li>
      <li>It has a nice flowery scent, that seems too perfumy strong at first, but then fades appropriately.  </li>
      <li>This product is wonderful for women that perspire heavily...or are forgetful like me!</li>
      <li>This Degree Clinical Deodorant does that and more, it lasts a full 24 hours until I shower.</li>
      <li>In a pit by pit comparison with Mitchum Advanced Control Clean Control, one day this one was better, but on another day they were equivalent.  </li>
      <li>The deodorant itself is fine, I just don&#x27;t like the application.</li>
      <li>This is a fine antiperspirant / deodorant.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth to apply.  </li>
      <li>Smooth going on</li>
      <li>and this goes on smoothly without staining my clothes.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>If the price was more reasonable would definetly think about getting more often.</li>
      <li>But it quickly turns into a strong indescribable smell.</li>
      <li>This has a very strong &#x27;industrial&#x27; soap smell that I didn&#x27;t really like.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant, moderate scent.  </li>
      <li>It smelled something like Zest or Irish Spring or Dial--I didn&#x27;t find it pleasant at all.</li>
      <li>product has a strong, overpowering scent which dissipates in about 20 minutes leaving a very mild, nice &amp; clean scent which lasts all day &amp; keeps me odor free all day long too.</li>
      <li>I have not found that to be true.</li>
      <li>Overall I think this is a good clinical strength deodorant.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
      <li>So I consider it a good product, but wonder if one should stick with just a deodorant, since anti-perspirants are known for potentially causing breast cancer, and never seem to work anyway.</li>
      <li>It keeps me dry and smelling fresh even during very warm days.</li>
      <li>It has a clean and fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Secondly this one has a fragrance that reminds me more of mens aftershave than anything that would smell okay on a woman.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The temperature has been in the high 80&#x27;s this week and this deodorant is still working it&#x27;s magic.</li>
      <li>This does work better than normal deodorants</li>
      <li>The scent faded though and just left a nice clean smell.</li>
      <li>wife really doesn&#x27;t care for the scent because it is too strong.  </li>
      <li>The product itself seems good (scent a little too strong for five stars however), but because of the overkill on dispenser mechanism and reduced capacity, it gets three stars.</li>
      <li>However, I never realized how fresh a product like this would make me feel.</li>
      <li>Better than many other deodorants.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used a strong anti-perspirant before because I really don&#x27;t sweat much at my age, unless I&#x27;m gardening in the sun.</li>
      <li>Degree clinical strength antiperspirants keep me smelling nice all day long.  </li>
      <li>Lasts longer than my usual go to brand which is perfect as I am going on job interviews, the last thing I want to be concerned about is my Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant not working.</li>
      <li>At the end of the day, I am so wrung out that I both shower and hot tub to try to unwind.  </li>
      <li>Clinical strength deodorant costs more than a regular deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now if it could only make the stress disappear :)</li>
      <li>I believe means that it forms a seal to keep stress induced sweating from ruining your clothes, your day, and your pretty scent.</li>
      <li>This the third day I have been using this product - and I love</li>
      <li>While I liked the pull-strip to open the top of the container (instead of those difficult-to-remove plastic inserts), I was genuinely surprised at how many turns it required to just get a small amount of product started:</li>
      <li>These clinical products are certainly a step above the standard anti-perspirant deodorants available and come at a steeper cost but in situations where more protection is needed are worth every penny, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was fairly easy to apply, but as with other deodorants that &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; as you turn the dial to dispense more, it was very loud.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had a stressful enough event (good for me) to prove that specific claim made by this anti-perspirant.</li>
      <li>The scent reminds my  wife of powder that she describes as heavy (and doesn&#x27;t think it is light and refreshing).</li>
      <li>It has a smooth top and works fine, but I don&#x27;t know if this odd mechanism is really necessary</li>
      <li>uses up pretty fast</li>
      <li>Mostly during the summer and using a regular anti-perspirant during the winter to take a break from the high aluminum in the clinical strength.</li>
      <li>The scent is fine and seems to last, so if you want a high quality product it&#x27;s worth a look.</li>
      <li>Although a bit pricey, I really prefer to make sure I&#x27;m dry</li>
      <li>I tend to sweat more due to hot flashes</li>
      <li>Not that the scent really matters much; you can’t really tell which fragrance you are wearing after a moment.</li>
      <li>I try not to think about it too much</li>
      <li>It can be very stressful.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this deodorant!</li>
      <li>The anti-perspirant portion doesn&#x27;t really work, but none do from my experience.  </li>
      <li>I really like this deodorant.</li>
      <li>but it also goes twice as fast.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;hint of white flowers and a pinch of outdoorsy zest&amp;#34;  translates for my family as lightly scented and not obnoxious.</li>
      <li>only switch to clinical strength if you genuinely need it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I can’t really describe it, but it reminded me of cleaning my house.</li>
      <li>That said, it has a very overpowering scent that I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
      <li>This is no exception and really does what it is supposed to do.  </li>
      <li>I really appreciate that because I don&#x27;t care for strong-smelling products.  </li>
      <li>Not too much to say about this, except it lives up to the advertising.  </li>
      <li>and I loathe the potential for any kind of white yuckiness collecting underarms.</li>
      <li>It was easy to use, dispensed well and dried quickly.</li>
      <li>The white cream, the high price, the strong fragrance ... to me, these were all highly discouraging.</li>
      <li>The scent was decent, and did not linger or compete with my perfume.</li>
      <li>I didn’t care for this particular scent.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It has the same 20% aluminum compound that the other effective antiperspirants contain.  </li>
      <li>I was temted to make a joke about how poorly it controlled my stress but it is really good at controlling my sweat.</li>
      <li>While I can&#x27;t imagine going that long without showering, I did notice that my underarms felt very clean the next day.</li>
      <li>It lasts longer than ordinary glide-ons.&lt;br /&gt;Although my lovely mother used to say &amp;#34;Horses sweat.</li>
      <li>I like to use clinical strength when I know I&#x27;ll be exerting myself, ie: during periods of heavy exercise or even when I know I&#x27;ll be out for long periods on a warm day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This deodorant does what is says - keeps you dry all day.  That said, it has a very overpowering scent that I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
    <li> Although I can’t get into the habit of putting my deodorant on before bed and not applying more in the morning, I tend to like Clinical Protection Deodorants. They do seem to last a little longer than regular deodorants.  I didn’t care for this particular scent. I can’t really describe it, but it reminded me of cleaning my house. It’s not that it brought to mind any particular scent, but I just didn’t find it pleasant. Not that the scent really matters much; you can’t really tell which fragrance you are wearing after a moment.</li>
    <li> From my wife&#x27;s perspective:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using clinical strength anti-perspirant for a few years. Mostly during the summer and using a regular anti-perspirant during the winter to take a break from the high aluminum in the clinical strength. I&#x27;ve used degree, secret, and dove clinical strength depending on which was on sale or I had a coupon for. Clinical strength deodorant costs more than a regular deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This degree clinical strength anti-perspirant works as well as any other I have tried, if you use it as instructed. It has the same amount (20%) of aluminum as the Dove clinical strength I had last used. The key is to apply it at night as instructed or at least early in the morning hours before you might start sweating. It needs time to absorb into your skin and dry completely. This specific product is supposed to keep you dry even through stress. Some people who do not sweat a lot might not realize that when stressed you do sweat more. I have found that when stressed even clinical strength can lose its effectiveness for me. I haven&#x27;t had a stressful enough event (good for me) to prove that specific claim made by this anti-perspirant. It also claims the protection can last the next day after a shower. I have not found that to be true. I can say that it will last the next day if you don&#x27;t shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like was the scent of this deodorant. It smells to me like a pine forest or Irish spring body soap. To me the scent was too masculine. That is just my personal scent preference. I felt like the scent could definitely compete with a perfume.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of job stress, so this sounded like the perfect deodorant to try. It has a nice light scent. Instead of one solid bar of deodorant, there are lots of little holes on top. You then need to twist/click it several times to have the deodorant come up through the holes. It works well to keep me dry. Now if it could only make the stress disappear :)</li>
    <li> Lasts longer than my usual go to brand which is perfect as I am going on job interviews, the last thing I want to be concerned about is my Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant not working. Plus No itching or irritation.  I shower daily Monday to Friday - on the weekends I get lazy and unless I have plans for the evenings or do yard work I usually skip a shower. So my deodorant needs to work 24 to 72 hours and my antiperspirant at least 12 hours I switched from spray to roll-ons decades ago and this goes on smoothly without staining my clothes. &amp;#34;hint of white flowers and a pinch of outdoorsy zest&amp;#34;  translates for my family as lightly scented and not obnoxious.</li>
    <li> This Degree Clinical Protection &amp;#34;Stress Control&amp;#34; does the job, my wife likes it but it&#x27;s not something we&#x27;d purchase frequently when there are other similar options which won&#x27;t set your wallet back as much. The scent is fine and seems to last, so if you want a high quality product it&#x27;s worth a look.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for women that perspire heavily...or are forgetful like me! It lasts longer than ordinary glide-ons.&lt;br /&gt;Although my lovely mother used to say &amp;#34;Horses sweat. Men perspire. A Lady &#x27;feels the heat&#x27;&amp;#34;, this particular lady must have some horse in her DNA!&lt;br /&gt;Great protection and long lasting.</li>
    <li> This seems to work pretty well, keeping any small bad smells from coming out, while not smelling too bad or strong in itself.  The anti-perspirant portion doesn&#x27;t really work, but none do from my experience.  So I consider it a good product, but wonder if one should stick with just a deodorant, since anti-perspirants are known for potentially causing breast cancer, and never seem to work anyway.</li>
    <li> I really like this deodorant. These clinical products are certainly a step above the standard anti-perspirant deodorants available and come at a steeper cost but in situations where more protection is needed are worth every penny, in my opinion. I like to use clinical strength when I know I&#x27;ll be exerting myself, ie: during periods of heavy exercise or even when I know I&#x27;ll be out for long periods on a warm day. This deodorant did not disappoint: it provided adequate protection and has a pleasant scent. It goes on smooth and lasts all day. I really can&#x27;t ask for more. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife to use as she is always very active and clinical protection seems to work a little better than the regular stuff.  This is no exception and really does what it is supposed to do.  It does a great job of blocking the sweat and covering odors.  The only thing that is a drawback for this product is how much you get for the price.  I mean you pay a higher price and get a smaller amount that regular deodorant.  If the price was more reasonable would definetly think about getting more often.</li>
    <li> My chief complaint of most deodorants is that they just don&#x27;t get me through the day feeling dry and fresh. I don&#x27;t expect miracles but I do expect something that will last at least until I go to bed. This Degree Clinical Deodorant does that and more, it lasts a full 24 hours until I shower. It keeps me dry and smelling fresh even during very warm days. It has a clean soap smell that is nice and neutral. I highly recommend this deodorant!</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want to smell good?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to ignore the price and buy Degree Clinical Protection Anti-Perspirant Deodorant (Stress Control) because I encounter STRESS from every direction. This the third day I have been using this product - and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temperature has been in the high 80&#x27;s this week and this deodorant is still working it&#x27;s magic. What I really love it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave the &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; stains on your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you have to loosen the grip of your pocketbook....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a strong anti-perspirant before because I really don&#x27;t sweat much at my age, unless I&#x27;m gardening in the sun. However, I never realized how fresh a product like this would make me feel. The product claims to offer 48 hour protection. While I can&#x27;t imagine going that long without showering, I did notice that my underarms felt very clean the next day. The scent didn&#x27;t smell as artificial as many other scented deodorants and antiperspirants. It has a clean and fresh scent. I just felt cleaner after using this.  This will be the perfect product for me in the summer.</li>
    <li> I give a lot of technical presentation to large groups, and inevitably heated debates results (lot of people with differing opinions).  Situations like this make me sweat.  A lot.  In the past I would stuff paper towels under my arms to soak up the excess moisture, but these new Clinical Strength anti-perspirants have solved my embarrassing problem.  No more sweating, no more embarrassing wet stops under my arms.  I no longer have to keep my arms tightly pined to my side, but instead can wave my arms pointing and gesturing to my heart’s content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But while I love how the product works, I don’t care for the scent.  A little too zesty for me.  I prefer the Degree Sheer Powder scent.</li>
    <li> This keeps me extremely dry.  I have used it before gym workouts and when working in the garden.&lt;br /&gt;It feels just a bit icky going on - you have to click it a bunch to get this goey white cream up, then you put it on like a stick.&lt;br /&gt;It uses up pretty fast - I&#x27;ve got a stick of Secret Naturals that I&#x27;ve used for ages, but this is half gone after a couple of weeks, so for me, this is too expensive an option.  Of course I only sweat a lot when I am very, very active or get very nervous.  What happens to me is when I have to take certain medications, I stink, and I feel like it is not MY stink, and that drives me crazy. This definitely keeps the stink away, but it feels like I put lotion under my arms that just won&#x27;t soak in, and I hate that.  It is fragrant, but it&#x27;s not a fragrance I really love.  The smell is ok, but it&#x27;s just ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it works, but it isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Stress control in this case I believe means that it forms a seal to keep stress induced sweating from ruining your clothes, your day, and your pretty scent. I shower at night, then use this deodorant. This type of deodorant works to plug the pores to prevent odor and wetness. If you put it on at night, then it has time to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; overnight and will provide you with unmatched protection the following day. I found this brand to work as well as other clinical strength products. It was easy to use, dispensed well and dried quickly. The scent was decent, and did not linger or compete with my perfume. Overall I think this is a good clinical strength deodorant.</li>
    <li> All the clinical strength anti-antiperspirant/deodorants I&#x27;ve used have recommended nighttime application. Degree Clinical is no different &amp; recommends nighttime application for optimal results. You can also use this product in the morning and again before going to bed. Turn the wheel two clicks to deliver recommended amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product about two weeks now &amp; haven&#x27;t experienced any skin irritation.  However, I have had some underarm dampness. Nothing serious, just dampness that hasn&#x27;t affected my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a strong, overpowering scent which dissipates in about 20 minutes leaving a very mild, nice &amp; clean scent which lasts all day &amp; keeps me odor free all day long too.</li>
    <li> Foremost, this product should probably be reserved for those with actual excessive sweating. The container is smaller than an average deodorant, considerably more expensive, and is an odd cream. While I liked the pull-strip to open the top of the container (instead of those difficult-to-remove plastic inserts), I was genuinely surprised at how many turns it required to just get a small amount of product started: approximately twenty-five! And, yes, it requires two to three turns to create a single application for one arm. I held the container to the light and noticed how very little product there actual is ... hmph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application was easy; however, white, thick, cream deodorants are a little off-putting to me. I hate the marks they leave on clothing and I loathe the potential for any kind of white yuckiness collecting underarms. Bleck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell seems subtle, at first. But it quickly turns into a strong indescribable smell. While I prefer unscented deodorants (so that they do not clash with my perfumes), I do like some of the fruity scents by Secret. But this one? No thanks. Not a fan of smelling like a 1950s grandmother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say to use this on gym days only (if even then). Most folks do not need \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; at all. The white cream, the high price, the strong fragrance ... to me, these were all highly discouraging. Stick with your favorite deodorant ... only switch to clinical strength if you genuinely need it.</li>
    <li> Degree clinical strength antiperspirants keep me smelling nice all day long.  Sometimes, I think it would be a lot easier to work at manual labor.  I would be great with a flamethrower or a sledgehammer.  But I work from home and make decisions every hour that affect other people’s lives; decisions that will continue to have an effect, long after they have left my desk.  It can be very stressful.  I try not to think about it too much but it’s hard not to.  At the end of the day, I am so wrung out that I both shower and hot tub to try to unwind.  I can always tell if I haven’t used an antiperspirant that is clinical strength.  I don’t know how they can say that stress triggers them.  It does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several of the clinical strength antiperspirants.  Degree is the one I keep coming back to, because even though I think I use Secret,  I must not.  All of the bottles I see in my drawer are Degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not have a name to the scent but it is definitely not floral or obtrusive.  In some way, it smells medicinal from the bottle but not when it is on.  After putting it on, and I do so at night, the smell mostly disappears.</li>
    <li> Not too much to say about this, except it lives up to the advertising.  It&#x27;s smooth to apply.  It has a pleasant, moderate scent.  It&#x27;s effective and lasts throughout the day.  Better than many other deodorants.  Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> The deodorant itself is fine, I just don&#x27;t like the application. There&#x27;s little hole that the deodorant comes out of when you twist the bottom and for some reason, it makes it feel wet when you apply it. I just really don&#x27;t like the feeling of wet armpits. The scent isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s just a little overwhelming and strong for my tastes. I will be sticking to the regular solids from now on.</li>
    <li> This does work better than normal deodorants but it also goes twice as fast. Although a bit pricey, I really prefer to make sure I&#x27;m dry so I use clinical protection strength.  I didn&#x27;t notice any &#x27;stress&#x27; extra benefits but I don&#x27;t get a lot of stress at work.  This has a very strong &#x27;industrial&#x27; soap smell that I didn&#x27;t really like. I think I&#x27;ll stick with the odorless brands.</li>
    <li> Firstly I am not a fan of the creams or gels and so that&#x27;s one strike.  Secondly this one has a fragrance that reminds me more of mens aftershave than anything that would smell okay on a woman.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me since different things smell differently on each person.  It does work however I did need to apply it a second time during the day.  I tend to sweat more due to hot flashes so that could be the problem there but who knows.  Of all I&#x27;ve tried so far I would save this is my least favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> This deodorant has a very mild scent, which I was unable to detect after a few minutes.  I really appreciate that because I don&#x27;t care for strong-smelling products.  It didn&#x27;t completely stop me from sweating throughout the day (and I don&#x27;t expect it to), but it did prevent me from smelling sweaty as the day progressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was fairly easy to apply, but as with other deodorants that &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; as you turn the dial to dispense more, it was very loud.  Isn&#x27;t there a way to make a dispenser that doesn&#x27;t click so loudly that it can be heard in the next room?</li>
    <li> I always use clinical protection anti-perspirant deodorant, so I knew what to expect when this one arrived. Like all clinical deodorants, it takes severals turns of the dial before deodorant starts to come out through the applicator. With this Degree formula, it started just like my other deodorants, but I&#x27;ve found that hardly anything comes up with just the two clicks recommended. You need to turn a lot to get anything out. But maybe that&#x27;s a good thing because the scent is super strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t wear this deodorant for more than a couple days because the scent was overwhelming. It smelled something like Zest or Irish Spring or Dial--I didn&#x27;t find it pleasant at all. And, unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t just smell it when I was sweating, I smelled it all day. Driving to work in the morning was particularly strange because the scent of this deodorant permeated the car!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my husband asked if he was smelling me or my deodorant, I gave up on this product. He assured me that he wasn&#x27;t trying to be insulting, but if he has to question, that&#x27;s not a good thing, is it?</li>
    <li> This is a fine antiperspirant / deodorant.  It has a nice flowery scent, that seems too perfumy strong at first, but then fades appropriately.  It has the same 20% aluminum compound that the other effective antiperspirants contain.  In a pit by pit comparison with Mitchum Advanced Control Clean Control, one day this one was better, but on another day they were equivalent.  Perhaps I applied uneven amounts to each armpit?  They instruct you to apply \\&quot;two clicks\\&quot; of the dial to each arm, but sometimes three are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the applicator is sort of like a twist cheese grater (see [[ASIN:B004TS2Q9M Microplane 48007 Cheese Mill, White and Black]]), that applies softened shavings of antiperspirant stick to your skin, rather than having you just drag a stick of product directly to the skin.  It has a smooth top and works fine, but I don&#x27;t know if this odd mechanism is really necessary, why can&#x27;t I just apply the stick directly to my skin like with other antiperspirants which are like large sticks of chapstick?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the stick of product itself is only about an inch in diameter, and the dispenser holds much less product than most similarly sized items (1.7 ounces versus 2.7 ounces for others).  So the size of the container seems like overkill compared to the amount that it contains.  The product itself seems good (scent a little too strong for five stars however), but because of the overkill on dispenser mechanism and reduced capacity, it gets three stars.</li>
    <li> Overall, my wife really thinks this deodorant works.  Without a question, this deodorant will be effective and do what it is intended to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife really doesn&#x27;t care for the scent because it is too strong.  The scent reminds my  wife of powder that she describes as heavy (and doesn&#x27;t think it is light and refreshing).</li>
    <li> This is a nice deodorant. I was temted to make a joke about how poorly it controlled my stress but it is really good at controlling my sweat. The scent was more noticeable than on most deodorants. The scent faded though and just left a nice clean smell.</li>
    <li> This is an anti-perspirant and deodorant, which bills itself as offering &amp;#34;clinical protection&amp;#34;.  It definitely kept me dry during the normal course of my day (kids/dogs/work/walk)... but I can&#x27;t say that it kept me drier than my regular Dove anti-perspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;+ Smooth going on&lt;br /&gt;+ Inoffensive smell&lt;br /&gt;+ Works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD:&lt;br /&gt;- Will leave white marks on your shirts&lt;br /&gt;- I notice no difference in protection between this and cheaper (non clinical strength) products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE WEIRD:&lt;br /&gt;Packaging advises putting the product on at bedtime.  Huh?  From everything I&#x27;ve read, wearing these chemical-laden products is bad enough, at least let your skin breathe overnight!  It also says you can put it on at night &amp; take a shower the next day, and not need to reapply.  Which I find scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:  Works, but not notably better than other anti-perspirant/deodorants.</li>
    <li> Somewhere along the line my hormones must have changed because regular deodorant does not work for me anymore. I used to be a Secret girl, but their clinical brand failed me. I started using Degree clinical a few months ago, and every fragrance works. I highly recommend this product.</li>
