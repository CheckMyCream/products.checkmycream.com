      <li>I would not agree with some reviews that said it gets really hot but its still good.</li>
      <li>Pretty good item but</li>
      <li>This thing doesn&#x27;t get very hot and really doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s fine for the front.</li>
      <li>This is a great little travel iron - doesn&#x27;t take up much room, but still works great.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t perfectly smooth my hair, but I use it for after the gym to fix stray pieces and just get myself presentable.</li>
      <li>Great for short hair!!</li>
      <li>Power light didn&#x27;t come on.  </li>
      <li>This flat iron does a great job straightening hair</li>
      <li>Plates do not meet up and does burn your finger; however it does get very hot like you would want.  </li>
      <li>If your hair has just light waves or is straight</li>
      <li>The irons sometimes get a bit hot to hold when kept on for too long but the size is perfect for my needs for my smalll sides and back.  </li>
      <li>so I bought this one and so far it works like the $60 one :)</li>
      <li>It gets hot really quick.</li>
      <li>gets super hot, too hot, it has no temperature control.  </li>
      <li>I recently went from all one length hair to getting bangs and this little guy is perfect!</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S A GREAT MINI FLAT IRON FOR BANGS OR VERY SHORT HAIR!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Would not recommend for longer hair but perfect for bangs and small sections!!!</li>
      <li>Very quality product!</li>
      <li>Small and perfect,  fits for short hair</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s really really small, more them looks like in the picture, but it works great (just a strange smell during the process).</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a temperature selector, but it does get really hot.</li>
      <li>This mini irons heats up pretty fast, sadly no thermostat</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this for a little while now, and I love it!</li>
      <li>It also gets those tiny, fine hairs around your scalp that curl up sometimes.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Hots really well.</li>
      <li>My hair is straight</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it for my whole head</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very mini.  </li>
      <li>This is a cheap flat iron</li>
      <li>Much better than lugging your larger version around, especially when flying.</li>
      <li>I still use my normal size flat iron for bigger areas, but for those hard to straighten areas or shorter hair, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
      <li>but it does get hot enough to hold a curl.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised with the results.</li>
      <li>and I have curly natural hair.</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS LITTLE FLAT IRON!  </li>
      <li>My bigger flat iron was too big for my bangs, this size is just right!</li>
      <li>I also sew and have found that it is perfect for pressing small seams that I don&#x27;t want to get the big iron out for... just a random and unexpected added bonus!</li>
      <li>i just you got to be careful not to touch the hot part other</li>

<li> This is not listed in the description and that is not hot enough to style an adult&#x27;s hair.</li>
<li> When I was purchasing this item I thought it would be a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; size flat iron.</li>
<li> an bought a quality flat iron.</li>
<li> And it looked as if they cleaned off the flat iron and sent it.</li>
<li> This flat iron is a joke.</li>

<li> I got thick hair and this one doesn&#x27;t do the trick very well.&lt;br /</li>
<li> Not worth the time sending back</li>

<li> I have a short, slightly wavy, mohawk, so I don&#x27;t need an iron to do any heavy duty straightening.</li>
<li> so be careful with it!</li>
<li> It does exactly what you tell it - even if you tell it the wrong direction</li>
<li> I am a guy, and my hair is short and not that thick.</li>
<li> I even scraped a black spot off of the plate</li>
<li> &gt; The blades are narrow</li>
<li> the size is SMALL!</li>
<li> A little difficult to hold to avoid getting burnt</li>
<li> The one other thing is the paint job stinks.</li>
<li> Kinda disappointed with it.</li>

    <li> IT&#x27;S A GREAT MINI FLAT IRON FOR BANGS OR VERY SHORT HAIR!!&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD BUY THIS ITEM AGAIN &amp; VERY CUTE ZEBRA PRINT!!</li>
    <li> Yes i love these flatirons they are perfect for short hair i just you got to be careful not to touch the hot part other then that they are great !!!!!</li>
    <li> I didnt know they was mini. Until i got them lol.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS LITTLE FLAT IRON!  Perfect for travel and also, I bought it specifically for my bangs and it is amazing.  Works great!!  My bigger flat iron was too big for my bangs, this size is just right!</li>
    <li> Box was damaged. And it looked as if they cleaned off the flat iron and sent it. I even scraped a black spot off of the plate</li>
    <li> This flat iron is a joke. It only heats up to 220°. This is not listed in the description and that is not hot enough to style an adult&#x27;s hair. Also, the cord is stated to be 60 inches but it is only 48.</li>
    <li> It gets hot really quick. Works great. But have to be careful of how you hold it or it will burn you.</li>
    <li> I am a guy, and my hair is short and not that thick. This thing doesn&#x27;t get very hot and really doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job. Seems like it&#x27;s going to die soon and I haven&#x27;t even had it a week. Kinda disappointed with it.</li>
    <li> gets super hot, too hot, it has no temperature control.  Now i use it as it is heating up and after i shut it off, that way it is a bit cooler.</li>
    <li> Love this thing . it works great and love the print that&#x27;s on it thanks</li>
    <li> This mini irons heats up pretty fast, sadly no thermostat but it does get hot enough to hold a curl.  I would not agree with some reviews that said it gets really hot but its still good. The irons sometimes get a bit hot to hold when kept on for too long but the size is perfect for my needs for my smalll sides and back.  A must for short hair on the go.  I particularly love the animal print.</li>
    <li> If your hair has just light waves or is straight I recommend this product, otherwise don&#x27;t buy it. My hair is straight and I loved it, it&#x27;s really really small, more them looks like in the picture, but it works great (just a strange smell during the process).</li>
    <li> For the money it&#x27;s ok. But don&#x27;t expect the bells and whistles... The one thing that would make it a great product is if it had a temp control. The one other thing is the paint job stinks. I took it out of the box and the paint was already peeling off not to mention the numerous scratches already on it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my bangs and it works quite well. It doesn&#x27;t have a temperature selector, but it does get really hot. It only has an on/off setting and does not have an automatic shutoff so be careful with it! I also sew and have found that it is perfect for pressing small seams that I don&#x27;t want to get the big iron out for... just a random and unexpected added bonus!</li>
    <li> This is a great little travel iron - doesn&#x27;t take up much room, but still works great.  Much better than lugging your larger version around, especially when flying.</li>
    <li> This is a cheap flat iron so I didn&#x27;t expect perfection. I have a short, slightly wavy, mohawk, so I don&#x27;t need an iron to do any heavy duty straightening. This does the job.</li>
    <li> Cool idea but not a good straightener</li>
    <li> When I was purchasing this item I thought it would be a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; size flat iron. I was laughing when I received the item in the mail. It was the smallest flat iron I&#x27;ve ever seen in the world! I thought &amp;#34;how could this possibly work&amp;#34; but I still tried it just to see. I was surprised with the results. This flat iron does a great job straightening hair and I have curly natural hair. Pretty good item but the size is SMALL!</li>
    <li> Ordered this on a Wednesday got it the following Friday.  Very cute and gets HOT! Would not recommend for longer hair but perfect for bangs and small sections!!! :)  love it and great price!</li>
    <li> Works and heats up well, except the heat turns the white sides yellowish when left on for awhile.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t always turn on when I plug it in. Should of saved my money an bought a quality flat iron.</li>
    <li> Hots really well. A little difficult to hold to avoid getting burnt</li>
    <li> Small and perfect,  fits for short hair</li>
    <li> Works well, travels well.</li>
    <li> Works great! Perfect size!</li>
    <li> Very quality product! Recommended!</li>
    <li> Got this as Christmas gift for my friend Jony and he loved it alot.</li>
    <li> Great for short hair!!</li>
    <li> I keep this in my gym bag, and it does the job. Is it the best straightener? No. It doesn&#x27;t perfectly smooth my hair, but I use it for after the gym to fix stray pieces and just get myself presentable. I wouldn&#x27;t use it for my whole head but it&#x27;s fine for the front.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very mini.  I got thick hair and this one doesn&#x27;t do the trick very well.&lt;br /&gt; The blades are narrow so I don&#x27;t suggest curl your hair with it.</li>
    <li> Cord is short. Plates do not meet up and does burn your finger; however it does get very hot like you would want.  I also would purchase again because of the price and the fact that I have an outlet close to a portable mirror I have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a little while now, and I love it! I recently went from all one length hair to getting bangs and this little guy is perfect! It does exactly what you tell it - even if you tell it the wrong direction LOL. It also gets those tiny, fine hairs around your scalp that curl up sometimes. I still use my normal size flat iron for bigger areas, but for those hard to straighten areas or shorter hair, it&#x27;s wonderful! I even ordered one for my mom who has short hair and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend $60 so I bought this one and so far it works like the $60 one :)</li>
    <li> Gave to my daughter for xmas and whenever she opened it and plugged it in got nothing. Power light didn&#x27;t come on.  Not worth the time sending back so threw away and bought one at retail store.</li>
