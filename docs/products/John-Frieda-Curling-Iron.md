<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really liked this curling iron. I got it mainly because my daughter has pin straight hair while I have wild and curly hair. We don&#x27;t own rollers so when my daughter has&#x3D;d to have her hair rolled for dancing etc. We always had to borrow one.     It was so nice to have our own AND have one that works well. It&#x27;s easy to use and does the job. If you read the product description you can see the features but I will mention to of my favorites....the automatic turnoff is great...especially for our busy household. The swivel cord is also excellent because I hate having to deal with a twisted cord; they can easily cause you to burn yourself while trying to get ready but with the swivel cord I had no worries.     Like I said, we really liked this one and it did the job for us.</li>
    <li> John Frieda can do no wrong!  I simply loved this barrel curing iron.  I have really think and frizzy wavy hair that needs a lot of heat to make a curl stick.  I also live in south Texas so humidity is a huge issue.  I plugged it up and hit the high setting and grabbed large sections and started curling.  The only curling iron I have found to work in the past is the gold and hot but it can really damage your hair so I was surprised and happy to learn that a ceramic curling iron would work.  I also tried this on my sister who has pin straight hair and never holds a curl and it also worked on her hair.  Now I would say don&#x27;t try this at the highest setting because my hair did get stiff and a bit fried.  Warning start at a medium setting.  I will say it would have been nice if it had a carrying case.  I would say this is defiantly worth the price!</li>
    <li> My wife has very straight, fine hair and has gone through several irons over the years in pursuit of the product best able to help her manage it.  This new John frieda iron may not the best one out there, but she likes it well enough.  She is better able to maintain her waves and curls with it and found it wasn&#x27;t too hot, always an issue with past irons.</li>
    <li> This works well for the lady, and has lasted a long time. She enjoyed it and would recommend based on that.</li>
    <li> Works great love it I would almost use it in the salon ;)</li>
    <li> Curl, of course!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have longish slightly wavy hair... I am able to allow my hair to air dry...so delightful in the summer...spray in a product that will allow waves to stay...and use this iron to put gentle yet long-lasting waves in my tresses!!!&lt;br /&gt;This iron is easy and safe...much safer than the product I was using.  It heats up magically and quickly...info says thirty seconds but it feels even faster than that.  It has that protective case to sit it in and I gently sort of wind it around pieces of hair, hold it for a few seconds and then let loose!!!  The result is gentle waves that are a welcome change from my normally straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the right product, my waves last quite a while...still in the following morning just not as defined... giving me  yet another different look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a firm believer in the fact that not all curling irons are created equal...but this one is one of the keepers!!!</li>
    <li> The following review is done by asking my wife what she thought of this curling iron. Since my hair is nowhere near the length it requires to use one I thought it best she do the review. After-all it was for her. The vine offer came at the perfect time since her iron just stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: How do you find the overall quality of the John Frieda JFC9 Loose Curls 1 1/4-Inch Barrel Curling Iron?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A: Very good. Seems sturdy and well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Do you find the digital display to be helpful?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A: Yes. I was always guessing on my other irons but this display makes it much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: It claims to reach 400 degrees in 30 seconds. Is that true?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A: I didnt try to go that high, but seemed to get to 350 instantly - faster than any iron I used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: It has a swivel line cord that doesn&#x27;t bind. Is that helpful or does it noit really matter?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A: Very helpful. It must have a swivel connector or it gets too twisted, but my old model cheap had that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Does the handle and tip stay cool when in use?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A: Sure seemed to. I guess that&#x27;s a yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Does it work better, the same or worse then your last curling iron?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A: Much better, fasters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: How would you rate the overall proformance of the curling iron? And would you recommend it to a freind?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A: Very good, yes. Excellent. I&#x27;d recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my wife and she was very excited about using it. The quality of the build makes this curling iron look and feel fantastic. But, that is also it&#x27;s downfall. This iron became very heavy to her the longer that she held it. She has waist-length hair so she had to hold it in place for the whole 60 seconds per curl, and this became quite a chore. It also has a function temperature control that is easily changed by accident every time you are rolling the device. The digital temperature screen would be nicer if it was brighter and larger. The numbers are difficult to read in the mirror if you suspect you accidently changed temperature while rolling the device. Rolling was nice though because of the cool tip, which is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, it is a nicely made device that just needs to streamline it&#x27;s functionality.</li>
    <li> I really really really love this item.  I have really really long hair and it is wavy but when it is humid, it can be really frizzy and only a hat will do  This thing does not burn my hair and the curls stay even though they are larger.  It seems to keep my hair from frizzing also i AM SO SOLD</li>
    <li> This iron has met my expectation. However, it makes a noise while its heating up--I am assuming this is normal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been forever since I had a curling iron. I tried the John Frieda the other day to tame the friz of my bob and neaten the flip under. It truly did heat in under 30 seconds - most impressive to this woman who first used curling irons in the 80s. I set the temperature to 300* since I have to admit I had no clue what temp would be needed. I now see that the instruction booklet does give that information; I got lucky in that I chose the right setting for treated hair. The barrel of the curling iron is large enough to easily hold the end without fear of burning one&#x27;s finger tips while curling. I may have to buy an extra John Frieda curling iron as there are now three of us fighting to use it.</li>
    <li> If you have ever battled with the cord on your curling iron like I have, you NEED to try this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got it, I thought it would be nearly the same as any other curling iron.  But for me, this one is just wonderful.  I love the coating on the surface of the barrel, I love how fast it heats up, I love the size of the barrel (it&#x27;s a little bit bigger than my last curling iron), but the biggest plus is the length of the cord!  It is double the length of my old cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more getting the cord stuck on the drawer of our vanity every time I lift my arm!  This took care of a major annoyance for me.  Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> This curling iron got hot super fast, so there&#x27;s no waiting to curl your hair.  There are temperature settings, so I opted with a medium heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My long hair is stick straight and super fine, so sometimes it slips out of curling iron&#x27;s grip, which can make it hard to style your hair.  This gripped my hair tightly without tugging and there was enough heated iron to wrap my hair around several times and hot enough to heat all the way through the multiple wraps of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is hard to curl, so I was happy with the loose curls I got from this iron.  The width is nice at 1 1/4 inch and I didn&#x27;t feel like it made my bangs too poofy and 80&#x27;s looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warming pad was nice touch and fits nicely by the sink.  I like that it turns off on it&#x27;s own - but not so quickly that you have to turn it back on while doing your hair.  And the cord doesn&#x27;t get tangled - big bonus.</li>
    <li> From time to time I have occasion to add a little curl to my hair and, as so, I&#x27;ve used plenty of products; looking for one that we can give me great, lasting (and pretty near perfect) curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sad to say the [[ASIN:B004YZMKM8 John Frieda JFC9 Loose Curls 1 1/4-Inch Barrel Curling Iron]] wasn&#x27;t exactly what I&#x27;m searching for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not any worse than others, it&#x27;s not any better either.  It heats up quickly (mere seconds) to one of four temp settings of your choice. Hand portion of wand is comfortable temp and barrel tip, while warm, is a very tolerable temp.  Heated barrel is moves smoothly through hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of use, great.  Loose curls, great.  Curls with a little staying power, not really. So, like I said:  no better, no worse.  Just the same as others.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly.  Does it&#x27;s job well.  Everything as you would expect.  Highly recommended.  The buttons are located in the wrong spot, however, you can work around it.</li>
    <li> I love this curling Iron.  It heats up in 30 seconds and is easy on my hair.  My hair doesn&#x27;t get trapped in the back of it and break like it sometimes did in my old iron.  I&#x27;m really happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Makes a weird noise and the cone on the end is hard to grab onto when styling but it works great.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  I lost my curling iron on vacation.  I liked it so much I replaced it with the same one.  I notice the new one does not make that buzzing sound anymore.  The newer version still works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up in my supermarket at a whim.  I had not used a curling iron since, er....let&#x27;s say the 80&#x27;s ladies.  I&#x27;ve used the flat iron at the suggestion of my hairstylist but could not make curls without there being a crease on one side so I stopped using it.  I was surprised how much more advanced they have become.  I remember the old school ones that had one heat setting and you burned your forehead trying to curl your bangs.  No more with this one...you can adjust the setting.  I set it to the lowest setting (220 degrees), and this is more than enough to curl my hair.  I have fine straight color treated hair and am very careful not to further traumatize it.  You can use some product as well to protect the ends (I use the Sammy brand found at my local market).  I don&#x27;t find it necessary to use hairspray to hold the curl like I did in the 80&#x27;s which is an added plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is lightweight, heats up quickly, and has automatic shut off.  I especially like that the curls last!  This is huge as my experience having straight fine hair is that I can expect my curls to be non existent by the end of the day.  I notice that when I wake up the next morning the curl is still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Mine did not come with the heating pad, but I&#x27;m using a cork trivet instead and that seems to work fine.  I&#x27;m sure pot holders would work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buzzing sound also was a bit concerning, until I looked at other reviews and they said the same thing.  It is not your hair burning, just an odd sounds that it makes.  I don&#x27;t notice it as much now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is that the cool tip is the same color as the iron and handle so I could see myself not paying close attention and easily reaching for the wrong endand...ouch, I&#x27;ve just burned myself.  I think they could have made the cooling tip a different color.  So far this has not happened, but none the less a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging mentioned something about \\&quot;ionic\\&quot;.  It would be helpful to have a further explanation somewhere that tells you exactly what that is.  I am familiar with the ionic hair dryers, but I&#x27;m sure this is very different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I really like it.  It is a nice change of pace from my hot air curling brush, heats up fast, easy to use and works really well.</li>
    <li> I bought this in October of 2012. Love how it curled my hair and always received compliments after using it. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t last long and suddenly stopped working in July 2013. I would not recommend unless you don&#x27;t mind buying a new curling iron in a few months.</li>
    <li> Purchased this through another beauty provider and was sorely disappointed. Curls absolutely did not stay. No matter what product I put on my hair, it never stayed put. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look silky and shiny.As long as you keep your finger tips on the gray point at the end you wont get burnt,which isnt hard to do.Heats up in seconds.Four stars only because it is so heavy.If you have any issues with your hands or wrists it might be too heavy for you.Good purchase for the money I spent.</li>
    <li> Unlike any hair curler I have ever owned, this John Frieda model has multiple heat settings to handle styling needs without damaging your hair (by far the most important aspect of the iron for me). It has the ever-important auto-shutoff function and surface/luggage heat protection options.  I can&#x27;t speak to the temperature testing in an earlier review (wow, that&#x27;s dedication!), but overall I&#x27;m pretty impressed by the features in a relatively inexpensive product.</li>
    <li> This is the last curling iron I will ever use. I love this curling iron because of all of the different goodies. First there is the warming pad woohooo sometimes I have to leave quickly and now I can wrap my iron in this and not worry :) second is the temperature control. Looooveee it My hair is so fine I burn easy so this way I can control the temperature :) And the one most important feature is the auto off because I forget to turn it off :(</li>
    <li> I got this curling iron for my wife as she was complaining about the one cheap one she bought for $5.  I figured John Frieda is a respectable name and since she uses his shampoo and conditioner (Root Awakening) already, this had to be good.  I was surprised to see how hi-tech a curling iron could be.  She could set the temperature using the LCD temperature controls and it had an auto shutoff switch.  It was also convenient to use as it had a swivel cord so it never gets tangled like her old one and it only took 30 seconds to heat up.  It comes with a heat mat as well so it won&#x27;t ruin the counters or anything nearby.  My wife has board straight hair and after using this she had soft, bouncy curls.  Her hair looked like it was professionally done.  She did note that on the lower temperature preset it gave only a curl at the end of the hair.  She had to increase the temperature to 400 to get the desired curl, but this may be because her hair is naturally straight.  She loves the product and so far she has not complained about her hair feeling processed either.  This curling iron is a great price for all the included features.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my 30 year old daughter two months ago and didn&#x27;t hear anything about it until yesterday and when I asked her if she used it she said...yes.  I said could you be a little more helpfull as I have to review it for Amazon and she said just tell the Ladies it works great and is easy to use on any style she&#x27;s tried.  I said maybe I&#x27;d let Kayla (my granddaughter - her daughter) try it for a few weeks and she said No she&#x27;d thrown her old one away because this one worked better and she wouldn&#x27;t part with it.  So now Kayla wants one and I&#x27;m going to have to buy it (somehow this became my repsonsibility because I introduced it into their environment).  I can&#x27;t just say &#x27;use your Mom&#x27;s&#x27; because her parents are separated and she lives here half the year (Mom is in Nevada) so thanks a lot Amazon!!!  As a review it may be a bit hearsay but the fact that she won&#x27;t part with it now ought to speak to you women out there I&#x27;m guessing.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is very attractive--even the box it comes in is very modern-looking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, it heats up fast and stays hot.  It also is lightweight, has a swivel cord (which is a very handy feature), is easy to grip, is stable when set down, has a nice smooth finish, and has multiple heat settings with an LCD window so you can use the lowest setting that will achieve the desired results and cause the least damage to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron is so much better than the ones that I grew up.  It makes nice, even curls.  I have nothing bad to say about it except that it doesn&#x27;t match my towels!</li>
    <li> Not easy to use. On and off switch is on handle.</li>
    <li> My wife saw this in a story told me she liked it I scanned it and ordered she loves it.</li>
    <li> My hair doesnt hold curls but this works for those days I want waves or curls.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price.</li>
    <li> I like how quickly this curling iron heats up (30 seconds).  I also like the swivel cord and the digital adjustable temperatures.      It didn&#x27;t curl my hair well, but in all fairness I used the lowest heat setting (I didn&#x27;t want to burn my hair).  Because the barrel is so big, though, it actually did a decent straightening job on my bangs.</li>
    <li> Good:&lt;br /&gt;* Heats in 30 seconds, even at highest setting&lt;br /&gt;* Variable temperature settings from 220 to 400 degrees&lt;br /&gt;* Twist-free cord&lt;br /&gt;* Even heating&lt;br /&gt;* Consistent results&lt;br /&gt;* Hair slides smoothly through the barrel and doesn&#x27;t get tangled&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;* Cool tip is too short and doesn&#x27;t have an edge that keeps you from accidentally grabbing the hot iron&lt;br /&gt;* Feels large in my hand, lever is a bit of a reach and is relatively small&lt;br /&gt;* Too easy to accidentally change heat settings while you&#x27;re gripping it for use. On/Off switch requires a few seconds to activate, so it&#x27;s tough to actually shut it off accidentally, but it is very easy to touch the +/- settings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odd:&lt;br /&gt;* Curling iron makes a strange sound - sounds like the synthesizer at the beginning of The Cars - Moving in Stereo. Not really an irritating noise, but a bit unexpected coming from a curling iron&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve uploaded a few photos, one shows me (aka: \\&quot;Test Dummy\\&quot;) with one side of my hair curled and the other natural. With this iron, no matter how long or what heat setting you have, you will end up with exactly the same curl size as you see. I tried smaller sections of hair, leaving it on longer, higher and lower heat settings, each time the resulting curl is absolutely the same. This can be good if you&#x27;re looking for consistent results, but can be bad if you like a bit of variety in your curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old curling iron (also a &#x27;loose curls&#x27; type) would allow me some variety in curl size depending on how long I left the hair in the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really comment about the \\&quot;Ionizing\\&quot; function, as I think every curling iron I&#x27;ve ever owned gives my hair nice shine and seems to remove static electricity. I combed my hair to get some static in it, and curling it did make the static go away, but the same thing happened with my little travel straightener iron (which doesn&#x27;t have the &#x27;ionizing function&#x27;) so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the heat and contact with metal that&#x27;s doing the trick. Maybe someone with really fly-away hair will notice a greater difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a decent curling iron that is ready to go in seconds with only one really bad problem for me - the cool tip is just not long enough to safely grip without really having to think about it every time. This means I have to think about not burning myself instead of just zoning out like I usually do when I&#x27;m getting ready for the day.r will notice a greater difference.

    <li> I really like this curling iron.  I purchased mine in July 2012.  However, it is now October 2013 and the \\&quot;stand\\&quot; to keep the heat off the counter is about to bust off the curling iron.  I&#x27;m currently debating purchasing a second curling iron just because I do appreciate it&#x27;s heat settings, anti-friz curling.  However, I feel like I just bought this curling iron.  I&#x27;ve never had to replace a previous curling iron after just one year of use.</li>
    <li> Expensive for a curling iron, but works well. Wish it had come in 1&amp;#34; as well as 1 1/4&amp;#34; barrel.</li>
    <li> it heats quickly and really high. Easy to manage</li>
    <li> This curling Iron is terrific and if the on off switch were placed otherwise and if the last setting temperature would hold for future use this John Frieda curling Iron would be a perfect 5 stars. It heats in 30 seconds, the heat setting choices perfect for any type hair,and the preservation of that hair. The curls last longer than other brand curling irons. The cool tip is adequate for not burning fingers,although all curling irons including John Frieda could give us a little more to suit all finger sizes. Hair is shiny and bouncy, absolutely no frizz, and hair is easily captured and stays while rolling. No small feat with thin,slippery hair.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would definitely recommend this curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;[ASIN:B004YZMKM8 John Frieda JFC9 Loose Curls 1 1/4-Inch Barrel Curling Iron]]</li>
    <li> My wife was complaining about her curling iron so I bought this one for her. No complaints except she does seem to keep burning herself.</li>
    <li> I ordered this curling iron with the 1 1/4 inch barrel since it advertised &amp;#34;loose curls,&amp;#34; which is what I wanted after using a curling iron with a much smaller barrel (maybe 1/2-3/4 inch) that produced curls that, while they stayed all day, were a bit too cutesey. While I really do like this curling iron, I&#x27;m thinking perhaps I should have ordered the 1 inch barrel instead because I&#x27;m not getting what I consider to be loose curls. I get a bit of a bend or slight wave at the ends, and that&#x27;s about it in terms of curl, even using one of the higher heat setting recommended for thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are some definite benefits that are causing me to give this product a fairly high rating. I have very thick hair that&#x27;s a couple of inches past shoulder length, and it&#x27;s developed just a bit of a not-so-attractive wave/kink. What I get with this curling iron is a straightening effect on the waves/kinks, and very shiny, smooth hair that looks quite full. The slight bend or curl at the ends offers some movement and swing, so I do like the look I&#x27;m getting even if it wasn&#x27;t quite what I thought I&#x27;d get! I&#x27;d liken it to a blowout look, which I was never able to achieve myself since I&#x27;m no good with the hair dryer. So I think if you want more of a curl, I&#x27;d recommend the 1 inch barrel instead, but if you&#x27;re looking for a shiny, full volume look with lust a bit of wave at the ends, the 1 1/4 barrel will do that for you.</li>
    <li> I agree with everyone. I&#x27;ve burned my hands several times using this. The cool tip is too short.</li>
    <li> ...but I love it. It does a great job. Does not catch on my hair, and heats up fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> Eh not that great. Doesn&#x27;t seem to get that hot. Bought a different one and will likely just toss this one aside since it&#x27;s too late to return. Disappointed :(</li>
    <li> Works fast and results are wonderful</li>
    <li> Soft curls.love it but need to finish it off with some hair spray.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece - her first curling iron.  She&#x27;s enjoyed using and said it gives good results.  I used it on her hair and her sisters and was pleased with how hot it got and how fast.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron. Definitely gets hot fast. My hair catches from time to time at the clasp but I think I can fix this by tightening a screw at the base. If it wasn&#x27;t for that I would give it 5 stars. I have been using it 4-5 times a week for about a month now and love the results.</li>
    <li> This is a professional style curling iron. It really does heat in 30 seconds, and the neat thing is you can control the temperature. There is a little bar in the handle which is the off/on switch and controls the temperature. Just press the bar to turn the curling iron on and then use the plus or minus sign next to the bar to display your desired temperature. 400 is really hot and around 220 is recommended for thin or damaged hair. Once you select the temperature you want, it will show in the LCD screen. The temperature that the iron is set on will flash, and stop flashing when the desired temperature is reached.     The ceramic titanium barrel doesn&#x27;t stick to, or burn your hair and the 1 1/4 inch width creates a large loose curl. Kind of like what you would get with a body wave. With high heat on long hair it would be possible to get a curl that is a bit tighter, but it will still be pretty loose. This is a perfect curling iron for creating body and a wavy look.     The cord is extra long and has a nice swivel feature at the handle so you can avoid tangled cords. It comes with a mat to rest it on to protect your counter from burns. It also has a built in counter support, so using the mat is optional. If you are trying to get loose curls and body this is the perfect tool.</li>
    <li> Okay, so if you spend the time to find my picture with my reviews, you&#x27;ll see that this obviously wasn&#x27;t obtained for me.  My wife put it to use and was very pleased, with one minor exception.    The unit heats up quickly, which is a plus, and secondarily, it comes with a little resting pad.  The benefit of the pad, though, is that it can be used to wrap up the iron immediately if it is turned off, so it can be placed in a suitcase for travel without waiting for it to cool (and, thus, running the risk of forgetting it in the scramble out the door).      The large handle is a plus, particularly combined with the swivel cord.  The only drawback is the lack of a little light that indicates the unit is on.  That&#x27;s a minor drawback, though, because the unit heats up so quickly.    All in all, this is a very fine curling iron.</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman and at first I was a little leery about getting this curling because of my hair type. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would heat quickly or even get hot enough to curl my hair. I was planning on purchasing a curling iron  with a 1 1/4 in. barrel and was lucky enough to get offered this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The John Frieda FRIZZ-EASE has worked exceptionally well on my hair. The curling iron has a small LCD screen that displays the temperature digitally in which it can be increased or decreased in 10 degree increments. The default temperature is 350 degrees when it&#x27;s turned on. I have found the auto shutoff feature very beneficial because I am one of those people who frequently forgets to turn the curling iron off. This is also the first curling iron that I have owned in which it came with a heat mat. I am overall happy with the product. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s my favorite styling iron but it does the job for what I was looking for it to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really the right person for this review as my hair will be straight no matter what I do to it... straight as a board. But I have to say that this is a very nice curling iron... it still makes my hair a little frizzy on the ends, but it&#x27;s a step up from my old curling iron, it gets hot so fast, I don&#x27;t have to walk away or find something to do while I&#x27;m waiting for it to heat up and when I&#x27;m in a rush and can be flakey, the automatic off is a GOOD thing, so I don&#x27;t burn the house down.   So, I&#x27;ll never have long luscious curls, but I&#x27;d say that this curling iron is definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Cons&lt;br /&gt;-The clamp leaves crimp marks unlike any curling irons I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;-This actually takes relatively frizz free hair and adds frizz.  I know this makes no sense, but I swear it&#x27;s true for me.&lt;br /&gt;-It makes an odd buzzing sound that is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;-The buttons are badly placed, and it&#x27;s easy to inadvertently press them while curling your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-The swivel cord was nice, but ultimately I wish I had bought a cheap Conair or Revlon model.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron!!!  I have shoulder length hair, not super thick but I have a lot of hair....used to be very curly but the last year it has gone straight. This iron put a very nice curl in my hair, heats up fast and really easy to handle!!! Great price, also!!  I am extremely happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Its a nice curling iron however I do not like where the buttons are located. It&#x27;s very easy to push the buttons while styling and the smooth surface makes it hard to hold onto. I have had it probably 2 years now and recently dropped it because it&#x27;s hard to hold onto.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll confess that I have hair that may at times get to be 1/8\\&quot; long (if I forget to shave my head for a week or two). I picked this up for my wife and daughter who both have very long hair. Usually me picking up these types of products doesn&#x27;t go well, but in this case she had said she needed a new one so I figured the risk was low I would get a funny look. What I still thought might happen is she doesn&#x27;t like what I got and takes it back so she can get something else (or gets something else and this one would end up at the bottom of the closet). In this case she actually took it out of the box and made the comment that it was probably one of the nicest feeling and looking curling irons she has ever owned. So I guess fit, finish, and feel rate very high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has used it for two weeks now and has said it works very well and allows her to style her hair quickly and easily. She knows I needed some feedback to review the product but that is what she could come up with. More important I guess is what she didn&#x27;t say as in she didn&#x27;t like it and no other new curling iron has been purchased by her. This one seems to have earned her trust and is getting used. To me that is a 5 star curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After 8 months of use, my wife still says she likes it and is one of the better irons she has used. She says it appears to be holding up well and as long as it keeps ticking she will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron rests comfortably in the hand and is nice to look at. There is an easy to move metal rest that holds the hot iron off the counter.&lt;br /&gt;My hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in this iron at all--a huge plus. It doesn&#x27;t pull and drag the hair.&lt;br /&gt;The titanium is beautiful--it seems to heat up faster and leaves a smoother look on the curls.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this on 3 types of hair. On thicker hair the curl holds better. Heats up very fast.&lt;br /&gt;You only need to hold the hair in this for a few seconds and the curl is made.&lt;br /&gt;I love the control buttons--beautifully designed to look like one metal strip that is actually flexible.&lt;br /&gt;This product made my hair look great, and took out a lot of the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;This size barrel is pretty small, so go for the larger one if you want more noticeable curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;I asked two hair sylists to try it out on my hair. Only the end piece of the hair strands curled, and it fell out within about 5 minutes. The other stylist said that Hot Tools is far better because it gives a long lock curl from top to bottom which you can then shake out into separate curls. Both agreed that they would only give the iron a 5-5 1/2 out of 10 rating compared to other curling irons they have used that sell at similar prices. We all laughed a good bit over the design--the top end looks extremely phallic, but that is neither here nor there.</li>
    <li> Even curls with pre-sprayed hair product before handling with curling iron. Heat is hot enough to make it do on first try. Kudos for making the tip slightly pointy so hair falls out easily out of the curler when styled.</li>
    <li> I have pretty coarse, thick strands of hair that is generally pretty uncooperative when it comes to styling. This curls my hair without overdrying it. And because I always have a million things on my mind, I love that it is auto off so that I know when I leave for work, it won&#x27;t stay on the whole day even if I forget to unplug. I just bought the 1.5&amp;#34; curler today because I loved this one so much.</li>
    <li> The only dislike i have is the tip of the iron for holding it while setting the curl. It&#x27;s a bit slippery because it tapers to a point to make it look nice i guess. I wish it had a grippy texture to it. Other than that i like it. I have thick long hair with layers in the front, and when I use this curing iron, the curls come out great. Wavy loose curls. I previously had a 1 1/2 barrel (different brand) and the curls would be gone at the end of the day. This iron heats up quick and allows you to set the temperature. I was concerned with the placement of the on and off button due to a review here, but even if you accidentally push the on/off button while curling your hair, it will not shut the iron off. You have to hold down the on/off button for 3 seconds or so for it to turn off, and it&#x27;s a raised button, so you would know if you were pressing on it or not.</li>
    <li> Best curling iron I have ever used. I have very long hair and it gives me amazing waves that don&#x27;t go flat. Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> this is a great curling iron! gives my fine hair lovely curls that don&#x27;t fall out immediately.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. It is a great price and heats up in seconds. I use it all the time and its a great size for the loose wavy curls. I would recommend this product to everyone!~</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d usually say that I am a fan of John Frieda&#x27;s affordable yet quality hair care products, but I am not sold on this iron. The claim that it curls even hard to curl hair simply isn&#x27;t true. I have thick hair, and the most I&#x27;ve been able to produce is some very loose waves which I quickly fell out. The end result was just not worth the effort. The iron is also about a foot and a half, and yet the barrel is fairly stumpy so it was difficult to get much of my hair around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does heat up quickly, the LCD temperature display is a refreshing change from high versus low, and the ceramic barrel looks incapable of causing damage, but if you&#x27;re looking for noticeable curl, you might want to size down on the barrel.</li>
    <li> My usually long hair is pretty short currently, but I was pleased to find that this works to give some bounce even to my short &#x27;do.  I found it comfortable to use.  I lent it to a friend with longer hair, and although it seemed to take her a long time, the curling iron did a great job of creating long, loose ringlets.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair but sometimes I like to blow dry it straight. And sometimes when it is straight, I&#x27;d like a wave or a little curl and so I use a curling iron. Don&#x27;t ask! :)    This is the best curling iron I have ever used, it gets hot and curls the hair without steaming or frizzing it out. The curls look perfect and shiny. It is amazing. I would definitely recommend this as a must-have curling iron!</li>
    <li> I purchased this iron for salon I work at.  I liked that it had a temp control with degrees opposed to low, high, medium.  It makes the most beautiful cur l you can do any kind of style with it.  It had instant start up so you don&#x27;t need to leave it on to use it.  It has auto shut off.  It has shine plates that allows the hair to slide through. I have since purchased more one for home,  two for friends/clients.  This is a must for anyone who loves to do hair★</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this product because it had so many good reviews and it was a good price. It heated up quickly, but I noticed that the LCD screen was difficult to read. When I went to open the clamp I was taken aback by how hot the thumb pad was! I then touched the bumper and that was hot too. I tried to use it anyway, but the clamp seemed loose on my hair; my hair slipped right out. This iron is going back.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron but gave it 4 stars (not 5) because the power and heat switches don&#x27;t always activate when pushed.  Not happy with that design.</li>
    <li> This curler works great! It heats up fast but it does make a wierd noise and plastic smell but overall, I&#x27;ve had no problems with it. But Amazon did forget to include the heat pad for it:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So amazon contacted me and sent me out another curling iron, I guess I&#x27;m not supposed to have a plastic smell coming from the curlers. But Amazon has great customer service. WHoop, WHoop!</li>
    <li> The curling iron creates good curls quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt the hair.</li>
    <li> The heat setting are great and it heats up fast! That is the plus side. The negatives are that the spring broke on it about the second week I had it and it&#x27;s tip is not made for handling it with your opposite hand.</li>
    <li> I love this iron,..I actually use it to smooth out my kinky hair.  Helps take away the frizz,...hair feels soft and smooth after use.  My previous iron has not worn out after 2 years of use, but I bought this replacement just in case it does !  These are difficult to find in my local stores.  Thank you Amazon !</li>
    <li> Awesome straightener -- heats up quick and gets the job done in record timing!! The stand keeps it from tipping over or buring whatever surface you set it on while it&#x27;s heating up!</li>
    <li> I bought this product and after using it a few times, decided that it definitely does not do what it is supposed to do and returned it.&lt;br /&gt;Why?&lt;br /&gt;-I liked the idea of the adjustable heat settings but because the controls are right where you hold the curling iron, it is nearly impossible to not accidentally change the temperature as you&#x27;re using it&lt;br /&gt;-This is supposedly coated to reduce frizz but I noticed that it actually made my hair much frizzier than other curling irons that I use regularly&lt;br /&gt;-This curling iron left the absolute worst clamp marks on my curls (I am quite adept at curling and am certain that I am not &amp;#34;doing it wrong&amp;#34;); I am guessing that this is because of the tension of the spring between the clamp and the barrel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The cord swivels and the iron heats up very quickly</li>
    <li> It was perfect until it broke after my 4th use. The lever will not stay closed. I&#x27;m so upset because I finally found an iron that worked with my super straight thin hair, but I can&#x27;t afford to buy this thing every 4 usages. #ANGRY</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife, who decided to try curling her hair. She&#x27;s found it pretty effective so far. She naturally has pretty straight hair. However, with this curling iron she&#x27;s able to curl it without suffocating it in hairspray. I&#x27;ve even noticed that the curls remain curly throughout the day and even into the following day. For the price it seems like a good way to vary up her hairstyle.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this curling iron. I especially like the auto-off feature for those days I am half-way to work and wonder if I turned my curling iron off. No more turning around to make sure I don&#x27;t burn down the house. I purchased the 1 1/4 inch barrel, which is really large. I have really long hair, so this works for me, but those with shorter hair might find it too large.</li>
    <li> The on/off button keeps getting pressed when I use this.  They should place the button somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Best curling iron I ever owned.  It seems to be a cross between a flat iron and curling iron because I can straighten or curl my hair.</li>
    <li> One of the best curling irons I&#x27;ve ever used. I am in my early 40&#x27;s and have used many types..does what it says it will do. I have VERY HARD to curl hair. Even with gels and hairspray the curls fall right out, Not so with this gem. My hair stayed full of body and loose,pretty curls for hours. I have very long hair so the barrel size is perfect..to any woman who hates to have flat hair(and who doesn&#x27;t?!) This is a fine buy.</li>
    <li> Iron has a  sleek design, heats quickly and is light weight.  Curls nicely giving hair good texture and shine.  Ceramic curling iron is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Does the job, great product for the price.  Curls hair nicely but does not get extremely hot as other products.</li>
    <li> I have used this curling iron now for about 3wks and am very happy with it&#x27;s performance.  Heats up quickly, with a variety of temperatures - easy to use - like the auto off feature.</li>
    <li> If you have pretty thin hair this curling iron will probably work out well for you. My hair isn&#x27;t very thick but I have a lot of it, this curling iron gave me some nice waves but not much else. It&#x27;s a nice design and isn&#x27;t heavy. For travel purposes this will be convenient but at home I will stick with my hot rollers.</li>
    <li> A great value for the price.  I have been using this now for a few months and have no complaints.  I confess that I bought it mainly to color coordinate with a matching John Frieda Blow Dryer to go into a new StyleAway Curling Iron/Blow Dryer Holder, all bought on amazon for my bathroom when I remodeled!  It looks as good as it works. The iron heats up very quickly and I like that it has an automatic shut off.  Very happy with all my purchases!  My bathroom looks great - neat and tidy with all my products color coordinated and organized together in the StyleAway it all hangs conveniently from a towel bar next to my vanity.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this curling iron and I found it was cheaper on Amazon than at my local retailer!</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;-Ceramic&#x3D;less damaging&lt;br /&gt;-Curls my hair great. I had a 1.25 inch babyblss ceramic iron that cost me alsmot 40 dollars. It lasted about 2 years. I dropped it on carpet and the bottome snapped in half. I like this iron better because the smaller barrel makes tighter curls there for the last longer.&lt;br /&gt;-feels sturdy but not heavy&lt;br /&gt;-cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-the area where you press to open the clamp feels too big, they should have designed it to be smaller. It feels awkward but I got used to it&lt;br /&gt;-I wish the screen lit up so I know if it&#x27;s on or not at a quick glance</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a flat iron for my wild hair.  Decided to go back to a curling iron to get some curl and body.  The first 4 times I used this thing, I burned myself.  Once, on the face, like stove burn!  My clumsiness had to do with adjusting the direction of the wand against my hair - using one hand.  Curling irons are so hot a person really needs to use 2 hands to be safe.  After a few weeks, I&#x27;m much better and safer; but we all start out as klutzes and these things are unsafe.  Most of them are like this, so this is not a criticism of the John Frieda product.  Now that I am a better trained, former burn victim, I love this curling iron.</li>
    <li> Like it a lot.  Don&#x27;t have the problem of turning it off that some folks seem to be having.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron for big wavy curls but it ended up not being the wavy look I was going for so I thought of returning it, but its a really good curling iron non the less.i would like to say if you want loose curls, its perfect. It heats up fast and my curls held up for a full 24 hrs. Probably longer if I hadnt had to wash my hair. The only negative thing I have to say is that it pulled my hair a lot while curling BUT I have some what damaged hair and that may be the reason why.</li>
    <li> I have to get to my farmer&#x27;s market stand early this morning, and this is how bad I hate this curling iron.  So bad enough to stop my running around just to write a review at 5:45 am this morning.  This item was not thought out in it&#x27;s design.  The on and off switch is a bar that sits along the length of the handle, not away from the area from where you have to grasp the handle that I constantly have to turn it back on because while grasping it you will accidentally turn it off.  I have to constantly turn it on after every curl, and constantly have to check if I turned it off.  Really really really stupid design.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I&#x27;ve tolerated this for months, and finally decided that I have to trash it and get another wand that doesn&#x27;t have the on a off switch in the way of the grasp.  Tired of being frustrated everytime I use this.  So tired!</li>
    <li> Nice iron for the money. Very slick barrel so hair slides off easily. Would def recommend you buy this iron</li>
    <li> I really like the look of the John Frieda product line.  As far as the results, I would say they&#x27;re a little better than average, not the WOW I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I keep burning myself with it. I don&#x27;t like the shape of the tip. It is tapered and I ended up holding onto it too low and burning my fingers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a better quality curling iron for a while now.  I&#x27;ve had good experiences with the John Frieda ionic hairdryer, and was happy to find a curling iron so well designed by this company.  It heats up quickly and works beautifully.  Very smooth and not harsh on the hair which I appreciate.  My hair texture is thick and coarse to give you an idea of what I&#x27;m working with.  :)</li>
    <li> This hair curler heats up quickly, and curls my hair very well. I only set it to 360 degrees (it goes all the way up to 400!), but my curls last all day! Definitely recommend this to other users!</li>
    <li> This curling iron works great.  I do have to turn it on and choose the temp each time which is new to me but I like that.  It arrived on time and as described.</li>
    <li> I am surprised how many people say they had success with this product.  Maybe it&#x27;s my fine hair, but I found this curling iron to be sub-par compared to other brands on the market - by a lot!  As another reviewer noted, the temps on this are NOT accurate.  It doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as other curling irons which was evident by the lack of hold in the curls.  The buttons are in a terrible location where they&#x27;re continuously getting bumped to &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;. This was so bad i ended up throwing it out, which i hate to do!  I inadvertently purchased their flat iron too and quickly returned it after one use.  That didn&#x27;t get hot either, had the same issues with not giving a smooth finish.</li>
    <li> Works as promised, it does take a little bit longer than I like to heat up, but once its there its awesome</li>
    <li> The first time I used this curling iron was when I borrowed it from a friend. In my quest to purchase one for myself, I bought and returned 3 other curling irons because they would pull and break my hair and/or didn&#x27;t get quite hot enough to curl my very thick hair. I love this curling iron!</li>
    <li> Excellent I&#x27;m so happy</li>
    <li> Heats quickly but it lost points with me for there not being a place to grab at the end of the heating element without burning your hand</li>
</ol>
