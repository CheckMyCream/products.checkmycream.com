### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These are perfect for shades you&#x27;ve had to depot yourself.</li>
      <li>Excellent product!</li>
      <li>Your best bet is to go to a craft store in your area and get some there instead.</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re not that great.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a Z Palette, instead I have a Unii palette and these work great.</li>
      <li>But they work great in my Z palettes.</li>
      <li>They work great on the bottom of the products to magnetize to the Z pallets or any metal device.</li>
      <li>so I could keep that in my Z Palette, and it worked great.</li>
      <li>Great buy.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know what these were for until my sister told me, LOL..</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>Did great for putting together my own palette, thank you.</li>
      <li>Bought this product to depot my eyeshadows and it works really good with my Z palette.</li>
      <li>Perfect fit for my eye shadows.</li>
      <li>Very glad to find these for sale</li>
      <li>It was a great price, great quality and worked for my single eyeshadows perfectly.</li>
      <li>, I will know where I can get more!  </li>
      <li>Love!</li>
      <li>They fit great and get the job done</li>
      <li>Very magnetic and has an awesome hold</li>
      <li>I knew Z Palette had their own metal stickers</li>
      <li>They stick very easily and hold well.  </li>
      <li>Z palettes are great if you have a large makeup collection.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did</li>
      <li>but I will repurchase if I need more for my palette</li>
      <li>, they&#x27;re a million times better, I wish Unii Palette would start selling these too.</li>
      <li>I love these for my Zpalette</li>
      <li>I simply love these.</li>
      <li>so well you do need to make sure they&#x27;re stuck well to the bottom of your pan</li>
      <li>okay i&#x27;ma put this out there.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;re probably better off just going to Hobby Lobby or Walmart to buy a roll of magnetic tape.</li>
      <li>They hold so much better.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I had some mini pans and were able to put two per sticker.  </li>
      <li>I learned my lesson, for sure.</li>
      <li>These magnets fit most eyeshadow pans.</li>
      <li>Perfect for making non-magnetized pans stick to my empty palette.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to depot things with a hair straightener and the end of a nail file, YouTube has tons of videos to show you how.</li>
      <li>it is a really strong magnet.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even used them on larger pans like MAC blush and they still work great</li>
      <li>These are the perfect size for any round makeup product that you want to add to a z pallet or something like it.  </li>
      <li>Thank god these are available.  </li>
      <li>Worked perfectly well for my round eyeshadows that I  depotted.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t own a Z Palette, but I do own several Unii Palettes.</li>
      <li>These mag metal stickers sure came in handy for my palettes, especially when traveling.</li>
      <li>Perfect and exactly what I expected!!</li>
      <li>Thanks for having these available</li>
      <li>They definitely came in handy.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m going to keep them, as I think they could come in handy later when I run out of the included discs.</li>
      <li>so I figured they were worth trying.</li>
      <li>My order shipped quickly and the magnets stay very well inside the palette!</li>
      <li>My eyeshadow pans adhere well to the palette, so quick and easy to use, just peel off and stick to the bottom of the pans and place back in the palette, done!  </li>
      <li>Suggest the seller invest is higher grade plastic that will not tear apart during shipping.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly as the image shows.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re thin and have amazing hold, which is important to me because if I&#x27;m going to spend a bundle on my eyeshadow / blush, I don&#x27;t want them moving around and breaking in the palette!</li>
      <li>Thank you for your service, it was fast and exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simple and easy to use.</li>
      <li>magnets I did get were decently strong, but the adhesive on the back of it is not.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t have much faith they&#x27;d stay put if I knocked the palette around in my bag.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and just as described.</li>
      <li>These stickers are mainly for MAC Depots, MAC Propans (you would probably have to remove the magnet backing on the pro pans though),</li>
      <li>I had high hopes that I could use these to stick onto eye shadows I had de potted, but they DO NOT work.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I own 6 Z palettes and they usually come with a bag of magnets, but those don&#x27;t always go as far as you need them to.</li>
      <li>I found I needed some more magnets for my eyeshadows and blushes and decided to try and find a cheaper option rather than buying these Z palette round magnets.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the extra couple bucks you might have to spend.</li>
      <li>After about 6 months I may need to add a little super glue on the bottom, but I keep them in a hot, damp bathroom</li>
      <li>They are really thin though which is nice.</li>
      <li>Not very strong and sticker was pretty much non functional.</li>
      <li>I have plenty left over for my other palette full of blushes.  </li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars since I was using it for something other than intended, and needed it to be pretty magnetic.</li>
      <li>They dont stick at all, NOT for any MAC as stated in the description and last but not least it only come 25 magnets...</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re very thin and light and the adhesive is a very thin layer also, but they work great.</li>
      <li>Maybe these were magnetized at one point, but not a single one of my magnets were magnetized.</li>
      <li>Missing 4 in my first order but received all in my second order</li>

<li> Not only were they not powerful enough, but they were thick and clunky.</li>
<li> Get the black magnetic sticker instead.</li>
<li> I bought these to use with my Z Palette 4-U black palette.</li>
<li> cause they&#x27;re thin and flat</li>
<li> the only thing i dont like about this is that its not very strong or maybe im just using the wrong kinda of magnets</li>
<li> it&#x27;s hard to get them out of the palette.</li>
<li> The z palette I purchased from Sephora came with hardly any magnets and I have a lot of MAC depots and pressed pigments in pans.</li>
<li> was not happy</li>
<li> you need thin magnetics for a project, these are not the ones</li>
<li> They&#x27;re too thin to have any magnetic pull to any surface.  </li>
<li> otherwise they&#x27;ll stay behind when you go to lift it and</li>
<li> but ill keep working on it.</li>
<li> I have nothing bad to say about this product.</li>

    <li> These are the perfect size for any round makeup product that you want to add to a z pallet or something like it.  They stick very easily and hold well.  I have used for eye shadows and blushes.</li>
    <li> Maybe these were magnetized at one point, but not a single one of my magnets were magnetized. So, I have a baggy of 30 metal stickers that have no purpose whatsoever. You&#x27;re probably better off just going to Hobby Lobby or Walmart to buy a roll of magnetic tape.</li>
    <li> okay i&#x27;ma put this out there.  the people putting low ratings have no idea how magnets work.  these stickers will only work with Z-Palettes, Inglot Freedom Palettes, Anothersoul Palettes, or any palettes that are made with a magnetic sheet.  These will NOT work with MAC palettes, as MAC palettes are just metal palettes so they need magnet stickers to stick.. this is why MAC pro pans have magnetic bottoms.  These stickers are mainly for MAC Depots, MAC Propans (you would probably have to remove the magnet backing on the pro pans though), Wet n Wild depots, Illamasqua depots, and any other pans that are made with aluminum (as aluminum pans are not attracted to magnet).  If you only have tin pans, then you won&#x27;t need these because they will already be attracted to the magnet palette (examples of brands that use tins pans are MakeUP Geek, Fyrinnae, and Inglot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If used properly, these work extremely well and last a long time.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re too thin to have any magnetic pull to any surface.  Your best bet is to go to a craft store in your area and get some there instead.</li>
    <li> I bought these to depot my eyeshadows and put them in a zpalette! My order shipped quickly and the magnets stay very well inside the palette! Love!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what these were for until my sister told me, LOL..Thank you for your service, it was fast and exactly what I needed. Thank you again.</li>
    <li> These things are basically just pieces of metal. Mine were not magnetic at all. However, I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars since I was using it for something other than intended, and needed it to be pretty magnetic. It might work for its intended purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need thin magnetics for a project, these are not the ones</li>
    <li> Perfect for making non-magnetized pans stick to my empty palette.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use with my Z Palette 4-U black palette. One reviewer said the palette didn&#x27;t come with extra metal discs, so I ordered these. The palette did actually come with several round and square discs, so I didn&#x27;t really need these. However, I&#x27;m going to keep them, as I think they could come in handy later when I run out of the included discs. They&#x27;re very thin and light and the adhesive is a very thin layer also, but they work great. I put one on my depotted MAC Studio Fix so I could keep that in my Z Palette, and it worked great. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These are NOT magnetized at all. I tried using it on my mac palette and didn&#x27;t show any signs of magnet. Returned it.</li>
    <li> Missing 4 in my first order but received all in my second order</li>
    <li> These are a must with the z palette. Even if your eyeshadows are magnetic  I would still recommend these. They hold so much better. I dropped a palette that didn&#x27;t have them and the makeup fell out everywhere. But with these they aren&#x27;t coming off unless you remove them.</li>
    <li> They do not work. They are not magnetized. Just a piece of metal. So I would not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I was not happy</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly well for my round eyeshadows that I  depotted. They fit great and get the job done</li>
    <li> I have nothing bad to say about this product. It was a great price, great quality and worked for my single eyeshadows perfectly. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and just as described.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s harder to de-pot shadows and blushes then it is to pop one of these on, I like to write the shadow name on it.</li>
    <li> Z palettes are great if you have a large makeup collection. It&#x27;s easy to depot things with a hair straightener and the end of a nail file, YouTube has tons of videos to show you how.</li>
    <li> They work great on the bottom of the products to magnetize to the Z pallets or any metal device.</li>
    <li> Thank god these are available.  The z palette I purchased from Sephora came with hardly any magnets and I have a lot of MAC depots and pressed pigments in pans. I ran out of magnets immediately. Very glad to find these for sale</li>
    <li> It says there are 30 magnets and when I received my order the plastic package it comes in was ripped open and there were only 19 magnets inside!&lt;br /&gt;The magnets I did get were decently strong, but the adhesive on the back of it is not. To get the magnetic sticker to adhere at all I had to use duct tape. I wish I would have purchased magnetic tape instead.</li>
    <li> Did great for putting together my own palette, thank you.</li>
    <li> it is a really strong magnet.</li>
    <li> These mag metal stickers sure came in handy for my palettes, especially when traveling. No sliding around.  My eyeshadow pans adhere well to the palette, so quick and easy to use, just peel off and stick to the bottom of the pans and place back in the palette, done!  I had some mini pans and were able to put two per sticker.  I have plenty left over for my other palette full of blushes.  Thanks for having these available, I will know where I can get more!  Also, I would like to see them in assorted sizes and shapes in one bag too.</li>
    <li> The paperbacking on the metals that come with the Zpalette is white in color. These have a YELLOW paper backing. These do NOT seem to hold the same quality as the ones that come with the z palette. These yellow ones have rough/sharper edges, the adhesive under the yellow paper is sometimes folded over, and just seems like a lesser quality than the ones that come with the z palette.Having said that, it does the job.   I ordered two of these and the plastic bag it comes is not strong enough to hold metal. As a result, all 60 magnets were all over the box!!! Suggest the seller invest is higher grade plastic that will not tear apart during shipping.</li>
    <li> I ordered these because i didnt know that my z palette came with magnetic stickers but i dont regret the purchase. They definitely came in handy. Item is as described. Very magnetic and has an awesome hold</li>
    <li> Bought this product to depot my eyeshadows and it works really good with my Z palette. They are inexpensive and do the job.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my eye shadows.</li>
    <li> It doesnt hold my eyeshadow on the palette. Get the black magnetic sticker instead.</li>
    <li> Perfect and exactly what I expected!!</li>
    <li> I own 6 Z palettes and they usually come with a bag of magnets, but those don&#x27;t always go as far as you need them to. I found I needed some more magnets for my eyeshadows and blushes and decided to try and find a cheaper option rather than buying these Z palette round magnets. The stuff I bought at the craft store didn&#x27;t work AT ALL. Not only were they not powerful enough, but they were thick and clunky. I learned my lesson, for sure. I bought a bag of these round metal magnets and they should last me a while. They&#x27;re thin and have amazing hold, which is important to me because if I&#x27;m going to spend a bundle on my eyeshadow / blush, I don&#x27;t want them moving around and breaking in the palette! Definitely worth the extra couple bucks you might have to spend. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Not very strong and sticker was pretty much non functional. I cleaned it off and used double sided tape. They are really thin though which is nice.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for shades you&#x27;ve had to depot yourself. DISCLAIMER. This magnets will not stick in a MAC palette. But they work great in my Z palettes. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I bought them to go with the Z palette and they have worked well! After about 6 months I may need to add a little super glue on the bottom, but I keep them in a hot, damp bathroom lol. So if you store them properly you won&#x27;t have a problem!</li>
    <li> I love these for my Zpalette but 2 of them didn&#x27;t have a sticky backing but I will repurchase if I need more for my palette</li>
    <li> the only thing i dont like about this is that its not very strong or maybe im just using the wrong kinda of magnets but ill keep working on it.</li>
    <li> Double check the Z palette you buy doesn&#x27;t also come with these stickers!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes that I could use these to stick onto eye shadows I had de potted, but they DO NOT work. The magnet doesn&#x27;t cling to any palette (z palette or mac palette) don&#x27;t buy these save your money and headache</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simple and easy to use. I had square pans and accidentally bought these circle ones. They still did the job.</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s exactly as the image shows.</li>
    <li> These magnets fit most eyeshadow pans. I used mine for MAC &amp; MakeupGeek shadows. I&#x27;ve even used them on larger pans like MAC blush and they still work great</li>
    <li> I always de-pot my makeup pans and place them in my palette. I don&#x27;t have a Z Palette, instead I have a Unii palette and these work great. Simply pop the pan out, peel the self stick covering and whala - you&#x27;re done!  I simply love these. I also apply the sticky label removed from the pan case and affix to the back of the Z discs.</li>
    <li> They dont stick at all, NOT for any MAC as stated in the description and last but not least it only come 25 magnets...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t own a Z Palette, but I do own several Unii Palettes. The Unii Palette does come with those &amp;#34;not a magnet&amp;#34; sheets but they&#x27;re not that great. Even if I covered the entire back of my eyeshadows they still slid around and I didn&#x27;t have much faith they&#x27;d stay put if I knocked the palette around in my bag. I knew Z Palette had their own metal stickers so I figured they were worth trying. I&#x27;m so glad I did, they&#x27;re a million times better, I wish Unii Palette would start selling these too. The only thing is they stick so well you do need to make sure they&#x27;re stuck well to the bottom of your pan otherwise they&#x27;ll stay behind when you go to lift it and cause they&#x27;re thin and flat it&#x27;s hard to get them out of the palette.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for eyeshadow pans that i put in my palettes. You have to be carefull though cause these work for magnetized palettes only. If you have palette that has metal backing youll need magnets.</li>
