      <li>However, I love this product because I straightened my hair and it messed it up a bit</li>
      <li>I have used another art-quality henna for many years.</li>
      <li>I cannot express how much I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Once my hair was fully covered with henna, I covered it with saran wrap and then put my shower cap on top.  </li>
      <li>Perfect if you want red hair without looking tacky or cheap.</li>
      <li>Originally, I planned to sleep with the henna on my hair overnight, as has been suggested by many people I read online.</li>
      <li>It washes out easily.</li>
      <li>It was so easy to use with just water added to make a paste.&lt;br</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s even better is its a good soft as well.</li>
      <li>This henna is very fine, fresh, and rinses easily.</li>
      <li>I rinsed it first with just warm water, then used conditioner to get rid of the gunk and grits.  </li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t need to sift this powder because it is so fine.</li>
      <li>Washed out great and the color was as expected:)</li>
      <li>Great red color</li>
      <li>My hair came out nice and it rinsed away without too much problem at all.  </li>
      <li>so far, so good.</li>
      <li>I was impressed with the quick dye release, and I managed not to make a huge mess.</li>
      <li>I washed it very thoroughly, until the water ran clear, and then some more for good measure.</li>
      <li>I love the Henna Guys, their henna is high quality, very fine whch makes a very creamy paste with no granules.</li>
      <li>Luckily you can freeze leftover henna in the freezer</li>
      <li>I primarily needed both to cover my gray, but since this was my first time using Henna, I did an all-over application just to see how it came up.</li>
      <li>The henna seemed to be of very high quality and was finely sifted.</li>
      <li>Left my hair feeling and looking amazing</li>
      <li>I love being a redhead and want my hair color to appear natural.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny and time</li>
      <li>Worked ok on my hair, didn&#x27;t care for the fact that it&#x27;s almost 2 yrs old..</li>
      <li>Easy to wash out with a good LONG rinse with a slippery conditioner (unlike my old henna that used to leave me looking as a shedding tree for a week).</li>
      <li>Other than that, good quality product.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;ll depend on whether I get the mix right.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I anticipated such happening, that&#x27;s why I bought Indigo together with Henna, and boy am I glad I did, as I needed that Indigo to correct the orange color from henna.</li>
      <li>naturally have light brownish blonde hair, and with this process I have been able to keep my hair a rich, super-dark brown color.</li>
      <li>Color did no stay in as long as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been experimenting with how much indigo to add to make it a more natural medium brown.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft and strong from the treatment.</li>
      <li>,I used lemon and vinegar and hot tea  for the deepest color.</li>
      <li>It did exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
      <li>Your better of buying nupur henna from your local Indian supermarket.</li>
      <li>technique with henna is to mix it in a plastic bowl with hot (almost boiling) distilled water until it is the consistency of honey.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t decided if I like the henna indigo mix or henna first</li>
      <li>First time trying this</li>
      <li>This is my first experience using this henna, which I combined 1:1 with the cassia, also from The Henna Guys.</li>
      <li>I apply by starting at the crown, coating a strand and coiling it on top of my head.</li>
      <li>This was my first time trying henna.</li>
      <li>Then the moment of truth, standing in front of a mirror, I could see a hint of beautiful deep red burgundy highlights on my darker hair, but brash orange on my gray hair, right on top where the hair parted.</li>
      <li>Maybe I took too long the first time I used it because I think I got more gray hair.</li>
      <li>The good news is, since the leftover is already mixed, I don&#x27;t have to wait for the dye to release next time.  </li>
      <li>First dye your hair with pure henna</li>
      <li>After rinsing the indigo out, my hair was a blue-black color, and after the first wash a day or so later it has transformed to this lovely, glossy espresso color that shines red in the light.</li>
      <li>I let it sit on my hair pretty much all day, wrapped in plastic wrap.</li>
      <li>It rinsed out very easily compared to some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read about other henna brands.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to see this on Amazon and its prime too so no more waiting for 3 weeks to touch up my roots:)</li>
      <li>Sealed well shopped fast.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say if there are any red hints in the light yet.</li>
      <li>The henna was smooth and sifted but did not leave my hair red</li>
      <li>Highly  recommended!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Excellent quality with amazing results.</li>
    <li> I have naturally auburn hair that is starting to grey around the temples. I feel like I am constantly trying out new products to cover my greys naturally. This is my first experience using this henna, which I combined 1:1 with the cassia, also from The Henna Guys. I have been using henna to add shine to my hair for over 20 years. My goal is to get a natural color without any of the purple hue that people get when they attempt to dye their hair red. I love being a redhead and want my hair color to appear natural. That being said, I have a lot of yellow in my hair and like it that way. If/when I get highlighting done, it only looks natural with a yellow highlight vs a white highlight (if that makes any sense whatsoever). The cassia seemed to add the perfect amount of yellow for me. The henna seemed to be of very high quality and was finely sifted. It blended nicely with the cassia. I left it on for about 90 minutes and the result was rich, natural haircolor. I did find that I had to go back and touch up the temple area two weeks later and about 3 weeks out the greys are still in hiding. I used a 2:1 henna/cassia for the touch up. I will order this again and I find that it is the highest quality of henna I&#x27;ve found in a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My technique with henna is to mix it in a plastic bowl with hot (almost boiling) distilled water until it is the consistency of honey. I will sometimes add amla or coconut oil, cinnamon or nutmeg. I allow the mixture to cool for awhile, sometimes as long as overnight. I apply by starting at the crown, coating a strand and coiling it on top of my head. Each new strand gets wrapped around the first. I will coat my temples before anything else to give the greys a head start. I rinse with water and conditioner after 1-3 hours. Then I do not wash my hair for about 4-5 days to allow the color to develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that both the cassia and henna come in bags that are not resealable. I end up putting them in sealable sandwich bags.able sandwich bags.</li>
    <li> Great color. I kept it overnight.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a henna novice, and I did a lot of research before putting this on my head. my hair was bleached and faded from a purple and teal cruella. I filled it in with a red direct dye first, then put this over it for a flaming orange-red with the least-faded teal bits turning coppery green. I used half of this package with hot black tea. A week later, I used the other half with some honey and vinegar mixed in to see if I could get it a little less lumpy. I was impressed with the quick dye release, and I managed not to make a huge mess. I left each round on for 2 hours. My hair feels good and looks good.</li>
    <li> Product was packaged a year prior to my receiving it, so the powder was not even close to being fresh. Following the package directions it did absolutely nothing for my hair, not even a hint of color added. Following instructions from my previous supplier of henna it made more of a difference, but I had to use a lot more than I have in the past. Would not buy from again. The other supplier is a lot more expensive but a lot more reliable.</li>
    <li> The henna was smooth and sifted but did not leave my hair red but rather dark rich brown.  I pre mixed with lemon juice and let it sit all day and used coconut milk for liquid.  Slept with it on.  My hair is soft and strong from the treatment.</li>
    <li> Definitely worked as I expected. I would have like a bit of a brighter color, like I was getting from the last brand I was using, but I can&#x27;t really complain for the price.</li>
    <li> I love the Henna Guys, their henna is high quality, very fine whch makes a very creamy paste with no granules. FREE SHIPPING! That&#x27;s a biggie, I was always payong at least $6 in shipping from a different vendor. They ship fast, and like I said, it&#x27;s very good henna, and I know good henna seeing that I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 40 years.</li>
    <li> Very good quality on both the henna and indigo from Henna Guys</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying henna. I&#x27;m African-American with 4a curly hair type. I&#x27;ve been natural for years, but recently started researching the benefits of henna for strengthening and conditioning hair. After reading the reviews I bought this henna and I am very happy with my purchase. It smells fresh when you open the package and the color is green. It&#x27;s 100% henna. I mixed it with about 2 1/4 cups of green tea and let it sit overnight (about 12 hours). Before applying, I added 3 tablespoons of honey to the mixture. I let it sit on my hair pretty much all day, wrapped in plastic wrap. It rinsed out very easily compared to some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read about other henna brands. I had no issues getting this out of my hair. I made sure to follow with a deep conditioner, because I read that initially your hair can feel dry if you don&#x27;t. After one application, I can say that my hair, which is a very dark brown, is extra shiny, and feels stronger. My husband says he thinks it looks thicker as well. The few grays around my hairline are now a pretty coppery-red color. I haven&#x27;t seen my own hair in the sun, so I can&#x27;t say if there are any red hints in the light yet. I&#x27;ve read that henna has a cumulative affect so I will continue to use this henna. I just bought a second batch to do another application. I will probably do it once a month. This henna is very fine, fresh, and rinses easily. It did exactly what I wanted it to do. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Maybe I took too long the first time I used it because I think I got more gray hair. However, I love this product because I straightened my hair and it messed it up a bit but when I used the henna a second time it improved my texture. One of the main reason I love this product is it make my hair looks natural unlike other dyes.</li>
    <li> I had medium-brown hair and used this henna, which gave me a very pretty dark red shade. It&#x27;s subtle and professional, but in the sun it&#x27;s really cool-looking. Perfect if you want red hair without looking tacky or cheap.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. We are using it for tattoos. Works great. Haven&#x27;t tried it in my hair but will next.</li>
    <li> Love it! I was so excited to see this on Amazon and its prime too so no more waiting for 3 weeks to touch up my roots:) What&#x27;s even better is its a good soft as well. No big chunks of dried plant matter. Washed out great and the color was as expected:)</li>
    <li> I switch to henna to cover my gray hairs to stop using chemical treatments. It&#x27;s a bit experimental at first but the worst that will happen is your hair turns too red. The solution is to do a second treatment with just indigo. The henna has to be prepared properly - mixing it and letting the dye release. Using warm water and apple cider vinegar speeds it up. I left the henna on for about 3 hours. It takes a few days for the color to settle down. The lighter color gray roots can flame a bit red. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with how much indigo to add to make it a more natural medium brown. I haven&#x27;t decided if I like the henna indigo mix or henna first and then indigo after. The indigo stay on for under 30 minutes. Both products work well. The condition of my hair has never been better. I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner or hair product to style. It&#x27;s just thick and smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different brands of henna over the past few years and haven&#x27;t been overly happy with them for different reasons. Some, because the color was lighter than I wanted no matter how long I left it on (I prefer a red for my grey &amp;#34;highlights&amp;#34; over an orange) and any of the boxed henna that you could buy by color gave me skin reactions because of the chemicals or whatever else was in them. I tried this over their deep red color because of previous issues with other brands, added some apple cider vinegar as I usually do to help it cover the grey hair better, let it sit for a few hours because I mixed it in the afternoon and had to make dinner and then run to the store, and left it on for 3 hours to get a deeper color if possible. I was extremely happy with the result and no skin reactions at all!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this Henna mix. The directions were easy to follow, though I did mix with half Apple Cider Vinegar and half water instead of pure water. I let cure for a couple of hours in the sun, then applied the mixture. I also sat in the sun for a while to help speed along the process. When I rinsed out the Henna my hair felt amazing. I usually have very straight, flat dark brown hair and the mixture left my hair much more voluminous with red/orange highlights where my natural highlights are.&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing as directed a day or so later I am still very much in love with the added color, though it is subtle on my hair. The manageability of my hair is so much better though! I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Worked ok on my hair, didn&#x27;t care for the fact that it&#x27;s almost 2 yrs old..</li>
    <li> This is the best value for anyone who wants to dye their hair with henna! I have long, VERY thick hair, and just 100 grams is hardly enough to do the job, but from other sellers would cost &amp;#60;$30 to get more than that. 200 grams was MORE than enough to completely cover every inch of my hair, with an extra cup or so to do root touch ups later! I&#x27;m never going back to chemical dying after using this- Very vibrant, bright color that DOES NOT fade!</li>
    <li> The worst henna I&#x27;ve ever used...it&#x27;s over priced and washed out like a semi permanent dye ,it bled all over my clothes even when my hair was dry and the henna didn&#x27;t mix creamy it had a sand like consistency. Your better of buying nupur henna from your local Indian supermarket.</li>
    <li> This stuff is reliable and I will purchase it again.  My hair came out nice and it rinsed away without too much problem at all.  I like it alot.</li>
    <li> I prefer Henna Maiden as it does not take as long.  This product does make my hair feel soft and luxurious.</li>
    <li> Always use henna guys never had a negative thing to say. Sealed well shopped fast. Repeat customer for 2 years</li>
    <li> Worked at turning silver to red highlights.  Must redo Indigo portion</li>
    <li> I have used another art-quality henna for many years. First time trying this and it produced great results...so far, so good. Comparable to the other, in every way -- a bit less expensive.</li>
    <li> Great quality henna - it leaves a lovely shine on your hair and turns out to be a beautiful auburn</li>
    <li> Great red color,I used lemon and vinegar and hot tea  for the deepest color.</li>
    <li> I have been using the henna and indigo powder from mehandi.com for a while, but loved that this was a great price and had free shipping for Amazon Prime members, so I decided to give it a try. I absolutely love it!! Like other reviewers have stated, you must use the two-step process to get a rich dark color. First dye your hair with pure henna (instructions are available all over the internet), and then apply the indigo afterwards in the same fashion. You are likely going to need a friend to help if this is your first time using henna/indigo to color your hair. It takes a long time, but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I naturally have light brownish blonde hair, and with this process I have been able to keep my hair a rich, super-dark brown color. After rinsing the indigo out, my hair was a blue-black color, and after the first wash a day or so later it has transformed to this lovely, glossy espresso color that shines red in the light. I cannot express how much I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is pretty long and reaches my lower back, and I used 200g henna and 200g indigo. Next time I would use 300g of each because I was scraping the bowl to finish. This hair color is permanent, and fades very little if at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and instructions for application are perfect</li>
    <li> Natural 4C African American hair review: All my henna heads, I loved this! Left my dark brown hair with a reddish hue (burgundy really). Easy to wash out with a good LONG rinse with a slippery conditioner (unlike my old henna that used to leave me looking as a shedding tree for a week). I mix mine with ACV and chamomile tea. My hair looks healthy and shiny since I started using this henna. Just don&#x27;t forget to deep condition afterwards!</li>
    <li> I bought the henna together with Indigo, after reading around that I would need both to achieve the color of my dark brown hair. I primarily needed both to cover my gray, but since this was my first time using Henna, I did an all-over application just to see how it came up. I mixed all 200g gram of them, and with my chin length hair, I had a lot of leftover. Note to self: next time use 1/2 a packet instead. Luckily you can freeze leftover henna in the freezer so I ziplocked the leftover henna mix and stuffed it in the freezer. The good news is, since the leftover is already mixed, I don&#x27;t have to wait for the dye to release next time.  Anyway, so I mixed the henna with fresh squeezed lime juice and water. The lime juice provides the acidity that henna needs to release its dye (so I&#x27;ve read). You can probably use bottle lime juice, I happened to have some limes in the fridge so I used those instead. I made a mistake of making the mix too runny - like a thin yogurt consistency - and didn&#x27;t realize the mistake until later. After mixing the henna in a bowl, I covered it with saran wrap and left it on my bathroom counter for almost 24 hours to allow the dye to release. When I opened the bowl 24 hrs later, I could see the reddish dye floating around in the surface, which I quickly mixed in. Then I started applying the mix to my hair, starting from the back to the front. You will need gloves and 2 old towels, one to wipe and the other to cover your hair with later. Once my hair was fully covered with henna, I covered it with saran wrap and then put my shower cap on top.  Remember what I said about mixing it too runny? This is the part where things go tricky. Originally, I planned to sleep with the henna on my hair overnight, as has been suggested by many people I read online. But, because I mixed it too thinly, the henna dripped like crazy: at first it was dripping every 5 minutes or so, then as time progressed, I literally had to wipe the drips from my hair continuously every 2-3 seconds or so. I didn&#x27;t dare go near my bed as I didn&#x27;t want my bedroom to have henna drips all over. Finally, after wiping non-stop for maybe 70 minutes or so, I decided I had enough. I threw away the saran wrap and jumped into the shower to rinse my hair. I rinsed it first with just warm water, then used conditioner to get rid of the gunk and grits.  Then the moment of truth, standing in front of a mirror, I could see a hint of beautiful deep red burgundy highlights on my darker hair, but brash orange on my gray hair, right on top where the hair parted. Yikes!! I knew the chance of this happening was kinda big, given that white hair (my gray is definitely white, not gray) absorbs whatever color you put on them much easily than healthy hair. But it was still a shock to see such orange hair on me. Luckily, I anticipated such happening, that&#x27;s why I bought Indigo together with Henna, and boy am I glad I did, as I needed that Indigo to correct the orange color from henna. You can read my review on Indigo separately.  Bottom line, if you&#x27;re Asian with dark hair like me, or simply have a lot of white / gray hair to cover, definitely use Henna AND Indigo, either mix them together as a 1-step application, or separately as a 2-step application. I used mine as a 2-step application because I wanted to see how it came out individually. Next time I&#x27;ll try the 1-step application for experiment. Henna does not lighten my hair, instead, on my healthy hair with natural dark brown color, it gives a nice deep red burgundy coating that is only visible under sun shine. Very subtle and pretty.  Also, now that I know that leaving it on for only 70 minutes or so was enough to let the henna color my hair, I don&#x27;t know if I would leave it on overnight as many have suggested. I think it&#x27;ll depend on whether I get the mix right. Next time, I would mix it thicker, like mashed potato rather than yogurt consistency. I mixed my indigo on the thick side and it didn&#x27;t drip at all.  One last thing, I read on another review that her hair kept leaking orange days after rinsing. Mine didn&#x27;t. I washed it very thoroughly, until the water ran clear, and then some more for good measure. I used my old towel to dry my hair immediately after that, then waited for 48 hours before washing it again. On the first wash after that 48 hours, I used my regular towel and didn&#x27;t see any color leaking on the bathroom floor or the towel.  Henna and Indigo are the only two I&#x27;ll use to cover my gray from now on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all brands of henna and I must admit this is the best henna ever !!!! There was no grit or stems and it was very easy to wash out. OMG!! The color came out beautiful my grays were highlighted. No orangey look!! Highly  recommended! Looking forward to buying 10 packs waiting on my income tax check LOL!!</li>
    <li> This henna is perfect if you want henna tattoos! Its is very cheap to make the paste and you don&#x27;t need to sift this powder because it is so fine. It smells very pleasant and I felt no irritation to my ultra sensitive skin. The stain on the skin was a gorgeous chocolate brown, which is what one would expect from a great henna powder. I&#x27;m sure this stuff works great on hair too!</li>
    <li> Color did no stay in as long as I would have liked. Ended up fading to a brassy red but that could just have been attributed to application or my hair type. I do not think I will rebuy. Other than that, good quality product.</li>
    <li> This is my moms second or third time with this product, she loves it, even though it&#x27;s a hassle to put together it&#x27;s worth every penny and time she uses it on her hair for those pesky white hairs! She loves it and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> Henna has so many benefits but YOU CANNOT BLEACH OR USE REGULAR COLOR OVER IT. It will turn green/turquoise/purple, depending on what colors you are have used and are using. Chemical color over henna will literally disintegrate your hair. So think long and hard. Even if you highlight 6 - 12 months down the road it will still happen. You have to grow it all the way out. If you darken with henna bleach is the only way to lighten which you cannot do.</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling and looking amazing</li>
    <li> great product and much cheaper than where I was ordering it from before I discovered these guys!</li>
    <li> My beard and moustache are now a beautiful reddish brown. It was so easy to use with just water added to make a paste.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re careful it&#x27;s not too messy. Wear gloves though, so you don&#x27;t get henna hands.</li>
    <li> I like the Henna Guys, but I just wanted to add after reading another post that if you&#x27;re Henna is 100 percent you can try a little of regular&lt;br /&gt;hair color also. A man asked me about covering gray and white hair after trying the Henna I did notice that the Black Henna from The Henna Guys would not cover my White and gray hair, so I tried a little of Just for Men Black hair color and that did. I use Henna on the hair in the middle and back. That worked out perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Awesome coverage and color. It washes out easily.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for henna tattoos and it worked beautifully!  I mixed it with a recipe that called for steeping dark coffee, cinnamon sticks, and cloves together instead of water or tea.  There was also lemon juice and cajeput oil in the final mix which are said to dark the henna as well.  No additional sifting of the henna powder was needed.  The attached photo is 3 days after the initial application; it did darken over the first day.</li>
    <li> First time using henna and had a wonderful experience.  I&#x27;ll be buying from them again!</li>
