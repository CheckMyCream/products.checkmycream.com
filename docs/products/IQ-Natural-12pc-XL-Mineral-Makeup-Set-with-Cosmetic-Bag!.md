<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Powder is nice. Not as finely ground as bare minerals... But does an equally nice job. The containers are difficult to manage though. There are too many holes that allows too much powder out. Or some of the containers are fully open... So the powder goes everywhere. A lot gets wasted due to the container.</li>
    <li> The coverage wasn&#x27;t good and it was hard to blend. Spend the extra $ on Bare Minerals</li>
    <li> Disappointed that this was not bare minerals product. Next time I will be more careful it was bare mineral product.  This product came up when I typed bare minerals and this product came up.</li>
    <li> 3.5&lt;br /&gt;The color is too light. Definitely go a shade darker. I had to mix this shade with the included bronzer AND apply a topcoat of a darker bronzer (different brand) and I still kind of looked ghostly. That being said... the coverage is good if you use concealer (i haven&#x27;t tried this brand&#x27;s) before applying the powder. I use primer beforehand and I did notice that this powder made me break out a LOT after one week of use- everything else was normal routine. The brush is surprisingly softer than I expected, but it&#x27;s a cheap brush. This is a good starter kit or useful to have around to use as a finishing/touch up powder, although it is not as sheer as you might like. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, but I will still use the product I have occasionally.</li>
    <li> I give it 5 out of 5 stars. The only thing I wish I would of known is picking a lighter shade.  It is a little too dark for my ivory colored skin tone, but I can always use this once I tan a little bit and start laying out. Seller even contacted me to make sure I received everything okay, which people don&#x27;t usually do so that&#x27;s another reason for the high rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Seller contacted me and offered to send me a lighter shade-- definently will be buying from this vendor again.. Excellent customer service and a pleasure to work with.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant about trying new makeup. This makeup was such a good price that I thought I would try it. I&#x27;m glad that I did. It blends in well with my skin tone and it looks smooth. I like that it comes with the brushes and that it&#x27;s a complete set of makeup. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful products. I love them. They&#x27;re perfect for my skin. The reason for 4 stars is because my mom &amp; I bought the exact same kit &amp; her jars are bigger than mine.</li>
    <li> It works great, and is half the price of bare minerals.  I&#x27;ll definitely continue to buy their products.</li>
    <li> Great product and my skin loves it! The finishing powder helps keep my makeup loosing fresh all day. I have sensitive skin and am always fighting with the chemicals that most makeup companies use-- not anymore! IQ Natural has no chemicals and is safe to use for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;My kit came with the prettiest champagne color eye shadow that I absolutely love. I will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> great product and great gift idea too</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister. She loves it. Thank you.  😊</li>
    <li> I went a shade darker as other reviewers posted and it worked wonderfully. I love the soft silky feel of the make up. I just wish the inside cards were relevant to the product I received. It would have been nice to get a little card that had helpful suggestions for applying this make up . All in all a good product and if a larger variety kit was out that included blush and more eye shadows I would purchase it :)</li>
    <li> This makeup works great!!! Will def buy it again!! Covers well and colors blend well I live the brushes they provided and a lil goes a long way</li>
    <li> This has been the best makeup I have ever purchased. Flawless coverage and stays on ALL day. I have really sensitive and acne-prone skin. This not only covered up blemishes and scars but it actually improved my skin in the first week! My skin looks and feels so much healthier. My old makeup used to start coming off by the end of the day and my face would be oily and greasy. That was not the case with this one. I am totally in love!!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and goes on light. A little goes a long way, so this make-up lasts for months! Concealer works well on under-eye circles. Convenient carry-along bag to store all the products. Finishing powder good to help even-out the tones. Brushes all smooth and help to apply the make-up well.</li>
    <li> I always rate this stuff well because it does exactly what it suppose to covers those wrinkles! I use just a small amount and swirl it around my face in a circular motion. If you use to much it will cake and that is your fault, not the make-ups...I personally have had both good application days (when I am paying attention) and bad when I just grab it and use way to much product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Multiple colors&lt;br /&gt;Quantity&lt;br /&gt;Brushes&lt;br /&gt;No harsh fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Gets old before it is depleted...but there is so much and it is so cheap that its worth replacing every six months anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients could be questionable...I didn&#x27;t check, it seems on par with all the mineral make-ups I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> This is outstanding makeup, such a great deal compared to the other brands, I love that it&#x27;s natural and I live in Florida and it does not melt off my face like other makeup, Will tell others about this, and will order again, keep up the great product. Linda H</li>
    <li> This make up is not great.  It is alright to use if you want a light coverage but it is not at all equivalent to B.E.  Based on other reviews I thought it would be good but it is not what I thought.</li>
    <li> Left a little to be desired in the size of the pots, but everyone else who&#x27;s had it says it goes a long way so I&#x27;m really happy to give it a shot. I bought it for myself for Yule, so i won&#x27;t be trying it for a few weeks, but the makeup does look like very good quality!</li>
    <li> I really like this makeup...it&#x27;s just as good a bare minerals and much more affordable...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using bare minerals for a few years but was never really happy with it.  Decided to try this since it was so cheap, figured even if the make up sucks it was worth it for the cute bag but to my surprise I think the makeup covers better than bare minerals.  I also don&#x27;t think the brushes are as bad as some of the other reviews have said.</li>
    <li> This is the only makeup I wear now! It&#x27;s lasted me so long and works great! A lot of people say they didn&#x27;t even know I was wearing makeup until i told them.</li>
    <li> The sizes of the products are of good size and quality.  You receive every thing you need.  However the main full brush included is too small to really apply the make up properly.  The other brushes are useful for eye makeup only.</li>
    <li> This make up is supposed to be &#x27;Natural Looking&#x27;. After about 30 minutes, it looked caked on. It also made my face break out. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Very nice blendable coverage!</li>
    <li> excellent quality covers well with a very natural looking finish</li>
    <li> My name is Jenea. It shows as Victor for I made this account under my Husbands name. ANYWAY, IQ Natural is great. I was iffy on purchasing it based on some of the reviews. Also, I am one who has lived off of Bare Minerals and I have been struggling financially so I could not afford Bare Minerals at the time. I found IQ Natural and it comes with so much  and my experience has been that it is just like Bare Minerals..just WAY cheaper. I love it! Some reviews said something about the brushes not being good..mine are awesome...softer than the Bare Minerals brushes. I always wore Medium with  Bare Minerals so I chose that color...but I do feel it is a little lighter than my skin tone so I just top it off with a little bronzer. Next time I might go with Tan..I am just uncertain if it will be too dark or just right. Either way this product is great and worth the try!</li>
    <li> This is the best make-up I&#x27;ve ever used. It also has a great price. I also received it within 5 days. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It works as good as my bare minerals did and it is much easier on my wallet. I will say the brushes could be better. I had to use my bare minerals brushes, but for the price and quality of the makeup I didn&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using BM for about a year and I was going to order more but I came across this cheaper alternative. I was a bit skeptical from the reviews it has but for under $20 I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. I&#x27;m sooooo glad I did!! I&#x27;m 18 years old and have struggled with acne for about 6 years. I finally got rid of it with accutane but I have lots of scars including small pitted scars,discoloration and redness. It&#x27;s really hard to find makeup that won&#x27;t make me break out or make my skin feel oily. BM worked for me but it&#x27;s just too pricy. The first time I tried this on it was a bit difficult to get the color blend right because the medium looked too light on my skin. But the coverage was absolutely amazing!!!! I was so impressed it looks and feels better than my BM matte foundation. I also love the concealer!! This stuff looks so natural and feels super light and you really don&#x27;t need to use a lot. The brushes are fine not top quality but they do the trick for me. For people who don&#x27;t know how to use mineral make up I recommend watching tutorials on you tube because it can be really frustrating and results will come out bad if you have no prior experience. I know this is just make up, but to people like me this is an opportunity to feel a lot less self conscious when we&#x27;re out in the world. And being a woman just isn&#x27;t the deal sometimes when you feel forced to meet society&#x27;s expectations of beauty. It&#x27;s sad but true. I feel more confident and beautiful when I look in the mirror and you can&#x27;t put a price on that. This will definitely be my makeup from now on. Thank you iQ Natural!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> only thing is apply it over a towel ... the power gets every where lol I will consider reordering in the future</li>
    <li> AS not good at all,it made all my under eye wrinkles stand out even more,I really tried to like it but just couldn&#x27;t,I&#x27;ve used more costly ones in the past that really worked very well,this totally brightened where my wrinkles are and made them really stand out,I also have red areas that didn&#x27;t cover either,I would say it&#x27;s only good if you already have good skin! I really did like the eye shadow,the brushes are horrible they fall apart everywhere!</li>
    <li> SIMPLY LOVED ITTTTTTTTTT  *_*</li>
    <li> First make up I have used that does not cause me acne problems. Love this make! Looks and feels natural!!!</li>
    <li> I do not wear makeup normally. I have oily skin and acne scars so most makeup just ends up being a mess. I tried the Bare Minerals once because my mom had it and I liked it but was not impressed with it enough to buy at that price tag. I&#x27;m going to a family event and decided to look around since I had a dress made and got my hair done for the occasion. I bought this because it seemed like a good alternative and it is! I wear it off and on since I got it, just playing around mostly. I was a makeup artist a very long time ago for the theatre so I like to play. It looks good, feels good. It still feels a bit like wearing makeup if you have been 100% without makeup for over 20 years but it does not feel pasty, like I could scrape it off with a spatula!&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are just ok. If you buy this for them, you will be disappointed. The big brush sheds worse than a hairy cat! They will do if this is the only thing you have, but if you plan on wearing it daily, go get some nice brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The bag is just a bag, it does it&#x27;s job. Nothing much to note there.&lt;br /&gt;I like the colors available and they give me enough range I can wear it in summer and winter. The only thing I add is lipgloss. I should add a mascara because it powders the eyelashes, but I have low eyelids and naturally long eyelashes so mascara always rubs on my eyelids and that makes lovely tracks. I just wipe the powder off.</li>
    <li> The brushes are cheap, but (and a big but) I spent $20 on the set so I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for the brushes. Definitely (and I mean this) order a shade darker than necessary.  I&#x27;m fair skinned and the medium shade goes on quite light. On first applying the makeup, I fell in love. The mineral veil really did make my face look porcelain smooth. After about 3-4 hours my natural skin oils, mixed with the makeup made my skin look more oily than usual. A quick touch up ( I mean super quick, less than two mins) and I looked fresh. By the end of the day though, the powder had settled into the fine lines on my forehead, giving them a more pronounced look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not shocked by any of this. The amount of product you get for the price is a steal! I&#x27;d say, this is the PERFECT makeup for teens and young 20s ... but I&#x27;m close to mid 30s so, it wasn&#x27;t perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because the reviews are all over the place but this a great mineral makeup set! I have acne prone skin and bare minerals has been my go to makeup for a few years. But as we all, it&#x27;s ridiculously expensive! I was out of my regular and looking for an inexpensive alternative until I could reorder and happened upon this kit. Boy, was I surprised at how great this makeup is. As most of the reviews state, the brushes are terrible(that&#x27;s the only reason it&#x27;s getting four stars) But the makeup itself goes on smooth and beautifully IF YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS! I recommend using a great primer/moisturizer with it. Simple Skincare is a great, natural, affordable match for this. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be ordering any bare minerals for a long time! :)</li>
    <li> The only thing I was disappointed about was the smaller jars didn&#x27;t have the shaker top. I can&#x27;t control the amount of powder that I use.</li>
    <li> This is one of those times when I wish I could give an in between rating. I liked this product for several reasons: 1) the bag is adorable and very handy; 2) the amount of product you get is very generous for the price; 3) the brushes seemed to be of decent quality; 4) the texture and feel of the makeup is lovely. I&#x27;ve used other mineral makeup in the past and they&#x27;ve caused my skin to become irritated and feel burned. Not the case with this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My misgivings about the makeup have to do with the shades of the concealer and foundation. I ordered Medium (I am an olive-skinned woman in her 40s) and I found the concealer and foundation shades too light for my skin tone. At first I thought I was applying geisha girl makeup. I washed off what I applied and tried again, this time barely dipping the brush into the foundation. Worked better but I believer a shade darker for each would&#x27;ve been right for my skin tone. I do, however, love the bronzer, eye shadow (a tad light, but it did make my eyes appear brighter!) and setting veil. Overall, I like the product very much; I think I need to order the foundation separately in a darker shade.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t too heavy and my skin does not have any reaction to this make up.  I am so sensitive that anything new on my skin causes it to break out, except this make up. highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> When you first apply the product it looks great! It covers well and the concealer looks great. Sadly, after a couple of hours my face would get so oily and shiny and the concealer would turn white where you applied  it. Its very annoying considering how great it looks initially.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and value</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! I bought 4!!</li>
    <li> Love this makeup it is so easy to apply and lightweight. Leaves my skin looking healthy and smooth! I will definitely be reordering and would recommend it to anyone wanting quality makeup for a great price! It also comes with a cute makeup bag and a very pretty eye shadow.</li>
    <li> My first attempt with mineral powder and it is so simple and covers so well!! So glad I got it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used bare minerals for years now, but the price just kills me. So I decided to give IQ a try. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I only had a few minutes to do my makeup the first time I tried it, so I loaded my brush and went for it. When I get out into sun light is the real test and IQ passed. It gave me great coverage and like I said I only spent a few minutes putting it on. A single 8 gram of bare minerals foundation goes for $27, so for $18 for an entire kit was well worth the money. There was only 2 reasons why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, one was the colors are a lot lighter than bare minerals. So if you wear usually wear medium with IQ go with medium beige. The second reason was the bag it came in was cute but it had a few strings hanging from the handle, which really isn&#x27;t that big of a deal. But it just felt cheap. Overall I would recommend this product if you want a mineral makeup without the crazy expensive price. Just remember to go a shade darker.</li>
    <li> I like it, but I do not like the bronze colored blush.  I think it should of been included with a natural colored blush.  Thanks. Mary</li>
    <li> What the hell happened? I ordered this product before same color medium shade and loved it. Then i order this and the medium shade is completely orange color. It goes on uneven and blotchy and looks horrible. The color is all wrong. It looks unnatural. Im very disappointed. I had to go and buy makeup in a store and haven&#x27;t used this since.now im debating if i ever want to order this again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOOOOOVE this makeup! My skin is very sensitive and 90% of makeup leaves it looking dry and is terrible for my skin. Bare minerals was my best find, but as we all know its really not affordable. IQ is the best alternative I have found and it leaves my skin looking flawless! It does run really light though. I&#x27;m a fair skinned Latina and ordered medium but it was too light for me. I would have been upset and bummed but it also came with one shade darker (medium beige) which turned out to be the perfect match! Very cool IQ for the extra shade. Its also ALOT of product. This is gonna last me forever but I&#x27;ll sure be buying more when I run out! This time medium beige. Lol. I highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> I tried the Bare essential when they first came out years ago and wasn&#x27;t impressed it didn&#x27;t cover.. I thought I would try IQ SINCE it was way cheaper huge bonus and I absolutely love it. I got the medium and it covers just ad good as liquid which I like.. Diffently buying again.. package was in good condition and arrived on time..</li>
    <li> I have ordered tHis before and I love it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love it so far, just wish there was a liquid concealer as well</li>
    <li> I have never purchased mineral make-up before so I was trying to find a good deal to try some.  I was not disappointed and although I don&#x27;t have any comparisons, this make-up seems like it&#x27;s very good.  For the price you get a lot of stuff and I have recommended it to my friends.</li>
    <li> My daughter (16) and I both use this. We like the foundation and setting powder. She has sensitive skin and is prone to acne and this make up is great for her. It covers well but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. We have ordered about four times so far and will continue to order. I like it better than the higher priced mineral make ups. Love that we always get a new eye shadow too. I also use the concealer and it covers my dark circles well. It does last a while too.</li>
    <li> After reading the positive reviews for this makeup, I decided to order this kit. I absolutely love the concealer. I also like the make up. The only complaint I have is the brushes. The bristles come off as you&#x27;re applying the makeup. But for the price this is a great deal and even comes with a very cute makeup bag.</li>
    <li> it was very good the girl we got it for loved it and we gave him the address to get some more of these products</li>
