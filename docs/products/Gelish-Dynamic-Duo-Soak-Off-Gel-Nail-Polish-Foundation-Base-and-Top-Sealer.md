<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Gelish is a good product</li>
    <li> Works great, really makes my manicures last.  I had one last just over two weeks before starting to chip.</li>
    <li> I love the gel polish. I love that I can do it at home. This is amazing :) I am collecting all the colors.</li>
    <li> My nails are just as nice as when I paid $20.00 for a gel-manicure. I used a LED light it dried in 30 seconds. Lasted almost two weeks. It would of lasted longer but I keep my nails very short and I do not like the way they look when growing out. I definitely will puchase again. It was also easier to remove than it was at the salon.</li>
    <li> Had it a while and still love it.</li>
    <li> Best gel top and foundation coat three is out there!. Easy to apply shorter foundation brush, just like the salons.</li>
    <li> work ok. Like Opi better.</li>
    <li> Use to only use CND but Gelish is actually just as good!</li>
    <li> Using gelish products has enabled the successful re-growth of my natural nails. After 30 yrs. of constant salon-applied, false nails, no other product , including shellac, worked. Eliminating split, &amp; ragged edged nails with the protection provided, I now can enjoy the look and feel of my own nails for the first time...EVER.  Thin, splitting easily broken nails, with little time for maintenance, necessitated false nails for a professional appearance. This product even allows natural nails to &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34; without damage if properly applied and maintained.</li>
    <li> Definitely better to start with these than the smaller size bottles. They last a good long time but you will find yourself loving soak off gel and changing your nails every week or so, before they even start to look dull :-P Also, I can&#x27;t vouch for other soak off base and top coats, since this is all I&#x27;ve ever used/needed, but these have always worked just fine with all my OPI and Essie gel polishes in addition to my gazillions of Gelish brand colors, so they&#x27;re a good starting point if you&#x27;re just purchasing your first gel products. The base coat also has a nice short brush so you can really get the product where you want it easily. That&#x27;s the best part of gel, you can take as much time as you need getting them just right before curing them, and they&#x27;ll never dry until they go into the lamp. I think it&#x27;s so much easier than regular nail polish because of that. I&#x27;m never going back to the regular stuff, my entire nail polish collection has quickly been demoted to toenails only :-P</li>
    <li> Works fine, although the bottles aren&#x27;t very secure and my bottles are always leaking gel solution if they tip over.  They make a mess all around the bottles, otherwise good for the price.</li>
    <li> I like this product but once it is cured it still seems sticky so you have to be careful on the application to ensure no smudging!</li>
    <li> I love this gelish! It is my favorite in gels! stays on for at least 2 weeks. helps keep my nails growing and strong.</li>
    <li> thick &amp; looked like it was contaminated don&#x27;t use</li>
    <li> Great deal since these are full size bottles, and they seem to last forever.  I do my nails about every week and a half.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the chance to use this product, because the bottles were broken when I got it out of the mail box.</li>
    <li> It works great not hard to use at all make sure you get the pH bond because without it the bell was peeling off my nails</li>
    <li> Great deal for both polish</li>
    <li> Gr8 I will use this seller again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it last as long as it should. I usually only get 3-4 days before chipping.</li>
    <li> I have bought this more than once. I tried the CND base and top coat, because they are considered the &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34;. I found this product performed better and costs much less.</li>
    <li> It work great for my  nail and my uv lamp tried fast.love the top coat and the base coast.can say nothing more</li>
    <li> I  always do my own nails because  it&#x27;s so expensive  to go get them done, and I  love the Gelish products  because they work ready well I can usually go 4 weeks between redoing them  and my toes I can go twice as long</li>
    <li> I ordered the Gelish Base &amp; Top Coat, two Gelish Soak Off Polishes, and the pH Bond.  I purchased the Mini Gelish LED Lamp (pro 45) at Sallys Beauty Supply store along with pure acetone, and alcohol.  This has to be one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made in a long time!!! My nails look just as good as they do when I get them done at the shop!  If you&#x27;re someone who enjoys the Gel mainicure this is something you should invest in!!  I didn&#x27;t purchase any of the Gelish cleansing stuff or remover because thats what the pure acetone is for as well as the alcohol.  I almost bought a UV Lamp but decided to go with the LED Lamp made by Gelish becasue it cures within seconds and it was $54 and some change with my Sallys Beauty Supply card!  Im so excited and can&#x27;t wait to order more polishes.  Another thing, my job requires a lot of dish washing and the soaps and sanitizer we use tends to mess up my polish in about a week 1/2 (it doesn&#x27;t look bad it just begins to lift a little on the side) so this way I can do my nails whenever I want :)  P.S there will be a sticky residue after each application when you cure the top coat that is when you take a cotton ball and wet it with the alcohol and wipe off the sticky residue</li>
    <li> Works great, awesome product. worth every penny spent.  Arrived quickly. I am very happy with these products and recommend them to everyone.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, couldn&#x27;t be happier, Great item, She thanks you and so do I.</li>
    <li> Really? So many 5 stars?&lt;br /&gt;Well, I either got a defected one or I don&#x27;t know...&lt;br /&gt;First off, when I tried to open a top coat, the bottle neck literally went off together with the cap. Maybe the product was outdated, screw up too strong (but it should be closed tight) or just defected. I used it only once and ended up with throwing it away because, obviously, I could&#x27;t even close it. But I understand that it is something that may happen and doesn&#x27;t mean that the quality of a product is poor. The reason of my one star review is the base coat. It doesn&#x27;t spread evenly! I tried putting thin and then, after being unsuccessful, a bit thicker layer, and still I encountered the same problem. Having uneven first coat means that the next, color one, doesn&#x27;t go smoothly on your nail. It looked like volcanic craters. Very disappointed. Since I am beginner, I initially thought that maybe I do something wrong, but then I purchased base and top coat by Shellac and never experienced anything similar to what I got with Gelish.&lt;br /&gt;Any suggestions why that happened?</li>
    <li> This is a great base/top coat combo.  I have never used any other brands for base and top coat but i have heard Gelish is the best and I agree!  THey always cure perfectly and look great with any polish</li>
    <li> Bomb foundation and top coat! Will even hold jewels when placed on top of a layer of color gel and then painted and sealed with the top coat! I really like the short paint brush in the foundation I wish the top coat had the same size brush! It is just standard length. I am still learning on how to nail your at home shellac!</li>
    <li> I purchased this dual set because it was a much better cost than each individual bottle.  I believe I paid about 10 bucks each.  Now, I am a huge buyer of ibd gel brands but I do still fork out more cash for the gelish base and top coat as I just have not felt good about reviews on other brands (top and base coats).  These are full sized bottles and a great package deal. I know they will last me a very long time, as my first set was the mini starter bottles and they lasted me well over a year!  So pretty worth the investment for a great mani!</li>
    <li> This product was easy to use at home and did what it said it would. My manicure lasted a week (I used normal polish between the foundation and top coat), I&#x27;m a housewife so that means they survived a great deal of cleaning and washing, must buy :)</li>
    <li> Great product and would definitely purchase again. But definitely want to try out the gelish top coat that requires no cleaning.</li>
    <li> big bottles and so far I have not found a gel product as good as gelish.</li>
    <li> Low star rating from feeling ripped off. The polish itself works fine, but the box it came in had an extra gap for a nail color. I feel I was forced to buy a colored gel separately for more financial gain. I don&#x27;t like the fact that this box was opened and/or used prior to my purchase, and that the color gel was taken out to be sold separately</li>
    <li> I love the gelish line. These bottles are a great value! They are full size bottles for less than it would cost to get the mini size in the store.</li>
    <li> The gel and base coat are great they work fine and i love the results it gives me! If your looking for a base nd top for gel defenetly give this a try.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  This is the same polish they use at my nail salon.  Now I do my own gel nails for a fraction of the cost.  And if you need an inexpensive but excellent gel nail dryer, take a look at the USpicy driers (under $50).  I bought one two years ago, it still works great and I can put one whole hand in at once instead of having to do four fingers, and thumb separately.</li>
    <li> This is a very good deal for your base/finish coats.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Adheres well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a gelish user for over 4 years.  The items work well for their intended use.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Simply awesome !!! My  Mani is great. This product works great for a lasting manicure. My manicurist assured me I would like it. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love?  I have only been using gel polish for 5 months and am totally sold.  My nails are very soft and I was having so much trouble growing them long.  That is totally a thing of the past.  I am so happy to have nice looking nails.  The foundation and top coat are just the basics that I need to have nice looking nails.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I love this product and I use it daily at the salon. It was a few dollars cheaper and every penny counts.</li>
    <li> I used both the foundation and top it off in combination with Gelish Shellac Polish and a 36W UV light.&lt;br /&gt;The foundation is a little thick and has a short brush to help you spread it thinly on the nail.&lt;br /&gt;Both worked as advertised and are standard sized products.</li>
    <li> I used it once not impressed,my nails look sloppy I will be taking my nail polish off today.</li>
    <li> I am not a nail tech but I do my own nails and nail art.  I like Gelish and this was a great buy.  I use this a few different ways.  I usually use a coat or two of structure with all my gel manis for extra strength because I am very hard on my nails because of my job.  I might do an all clear mani and just use real nail polish on top of it along with a regular topcoat.  I have also used real nail polish on top of the base and a couple coats of structure and used the gel top coat once my regular nail polish was completely and totally dry.  And since I do like to chance my colors often I have started using a regular base coat first so that my removal in one week is easier.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. very easy to apply. looks great, and stays on as long as you don&#x27;t pick at it. its not super thick like some other brands, which makes the polish peel off easy. This is way better than the OPI gel polish. it cures quickly, and goes on smoothly and easily.</li>
    <li> So far this is my favorite no chip nail base and top coat. Good price. Has lasted quite a few mos now. Would definitely recommend to anyone using a no chip system. I&#x27;ve purchased a bunch of their colored polishes as well and have always been very pleased with the product. I particular, dark colors go on dark (not runny or weak).</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Have ordered this twice and both times completely satisfied with purchase. The price is great!  For what you pay at salon - you can get about a years worth of nails out of one set. I do my nails every 2 weeks.  Great product - great price!</li>
    <li> When using it for the first time, it suddenly became really hard and clumpy.  I thought it was just too hot in the room I was doing my nails in so I put it in the fridge then left it out for two weeks.  I cannot even use it now.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> My nails are very soft from the damage of fake nails. I applies some of the gel to my nail and it harden my nails perfectly. I love it</li>
    <li> I found that even after 2 minutes the top coat was not hard enough to avoid mating the surface.... maybe I put it&lt;br /&gt;on too thick .... I think I can make it work,  as I&#x27;m a guy and not used to this kink of stuff houston</li>
    <li> I liked most colors.  The light pink did not cover well but it is still worth the price because of all the chooses.</li>
    <li> these polishes are a good buy. I always shopped at sally&#x27;s for my polish and of course they have the mini&#x27;s. I didn&#x27;t know they made them this big!</li>
    <li> These were needed to do her nails with the gel polish... seems like painting a car to me. Cool stuff that definitely does a good job.</li>
    <li> Love the full size bottles! I&#x27;ve used both with china glazes gelous polish as well as regular polish. Top coat is super shiny!</li>
    <li> It is an awesome product that works wonder it&#x27;s amazing I wouldn&#x27;t do any other brand I love it!! :-)</li>
    <li> I use these in conjunction with the Gelish Nail Prep pH Bond.  These are great products and provide my weak, thin, peeling nails better protection that stays on longer than any other polish!</li>
    <li> GREAT THANK YOU! THESE PRODUCTS ARE INEXPENSIVE AND PERFECT FOR WHAT I WANTED! I AM GIVING THEM AS A GIFT... SHE WILL LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I use both the Gelish Base and top coat with my Gelish color manis. I believe the base coat helps the colored polish adhere to my nails better, and the top coat gives me the bright shiny finish that I love. A perfect combo!</li>
    <li> The actual polishes are great. Top quality as expected from the Gelish brand. My only complaint is that the brush for the base polish seemed to be damaged. The brissels are too short. It may be just a damaged one from the manufacture. I&#x27;ve been making it work by using the brush from another polish, but still... Would have been nice to have gotten one that wasn&#x27;t broken. The top coat however came fine and the brush seems to be normal.</li>
    <li> Best at home gel product I have found.</li>
    <li> Both items are very easy to use, no chipping and both have a smooth finish. This is one of my favorite brands.</li>
    <li> Gelish is the best brand. Home manicures could not be easier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own gel manicures for almost 2 years now at home.  I have tried several brands of gel trying to find a cheaper version of gelish and I&#x27;ve had no luck.  All of the cheaper gel base and top coats I have tried chip and lift on the edges after only a few days.  I&#x27;ve decided that gelish base and top coat are worth the extra money, they apply easily and resist chipping and lifting for at least a week.  Gelish polishes are expensive so I no longer purchase the gelish colors (just base and top coat).  I buy cheaper brands of gel colors like blue sky brand gel polish (it&#x27;s around $7) and as long as I apply those with gelish base and top coat my manicure turns out well.</li>
    <li> seemed to dry out rather quickly - probably wouldnt get it again</li>
    <li> The polish exploded inside the packaging and box</li>
    <li> Perfect prep and Top. quality products.</li>
    <li> Fabulous prices, great product, has really lasted and I actually love the the Foundation Gel and Top It Off Topcoat better than anything else I have tried including OPI. Cures like magic! Keeps my nails strong and sometimes I use them alone with no polish. Great Shine!</li>
    <li> Foundation is wonderful, the top coat is kind of runny. Be careful when apply top coat, and only a little it needed to cover the entire nail. If you use too much and it runs everywhere it will end up making your nails not last as long because the top coat that is down in the corners of your nail bed &amp; cuticle will eventually start to come up and that will make the polish start to chip.</li>
    <li> Gelish is  awesome. Way cheaper on line.  The only gel product i buy now. Be careful not to apply thick layers.</li>
    <li> A great brand to use if you are doing the shellac and a better price!</li>
    <li> You get exactly what you think you are with this. Same stuff used in salons!! Great price too. Love it.</li>
    <li> The top coat for this brand really burns when you go to set it under the LED light.  I have another brand of top coat that works just as well,  but doesn&#x27;t feel like your fingers are on fire.  Very odd.</li>
    <li> I recommend this set for sure. My only issue is the top coat is a little gloppy and I have to wipe the sticky goop that has set on the brush on a newspaper or something before i can use it. I suppose that&#x27;s what u get with shellac tho, right? I&#x27;ll buy again... Ps* I agree with the other reviews about going very light &amp; easy on the top coat...if u get it too thick it runs and, trust me, u&#x27;ll talk urself into starting all over! The perk is that it&#x27;ll last a long time</li>
    <li> This is the only Gelish product I currently own and I love it! It works great and keeps my polish on for 2 weeks. I like this base and top coat because it works with different gel polish (not just gelish brands). I will definitely be repurchasing this item soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey compared to some brands (but the quality is good)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;Works great keeps my nails good for 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;Works with different brands&lt;br /&gt;Good quality product&lt;br /&gt;You get base and top coat</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used finger paints and some other brand (forget the name) and they don&#x27;t compare to the gelish.. So glad I made the switch. Being a server and working every busy shift, this polish holds up and hasn&#x27;t chipped yet!</li>
    <li> Gelish base and top coat go on easily.  Apply in thin layers so not to have overpaint on your cuticles.  Overpaint will result in polish that does not last on the nail.  The Gelish brand is easy to apply and lasts and lasts when properly applied!</li>
    <li> The product is decent. Although, it seems like it was previously opened or used, it was a bit thick and grumpy.</li>
    <li> Great IF You Know the Final STEP!  I needed a polish that would withstand a lot of water and hand use without chipping and this polish absolutely does last, for me, about 10 days.  The first time I followed the directions of preparing my nails; cleaning them with alcohol before application of the base coat; drying them with the LED light for 90 seconds; and applying the top coat and dried with the LED light for 90 seconds.  I thought I would be DONE!  But, my nails were still very sticky.  I dried them 3 more times with the LED light for a total of 4.5 minutes - STILL sticky!  I had to leave the house so I started to take it off with nail polish remover and instead of removing the polish as I had expected, 2 swipes with acetone on a cotton ball \\&quot;cured\\&quot; the polish and firmed it up completely!  So, don&#x27;t get discouraged because the final surface is sticky after drying with the LED light.  Swipe your nails swiftly with acetone and they will be hard and durable!  I wish someone had told me about this trick... :)</li>
    <li> I love these gel polishes! They are perfect! You absolutely do need to use an alcohol wipe after curing the coats under the UV lamp. But I have used this base and top coat with all of my own regular nail polishes and they have held up great! I will definitely buy more when I run out :)</li>
    <li> I purchased the light, a pack of colors, base and top coat.  I stopped trying to get this right.  It didn&#x27;t matter how much or how little I put on it didn&#x27;t last more than a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Gelish base and top coat is the way to go! Love this product.</li>
    <li> I will never use anything else ever again. The Gelish line is absolutely the best. This was a great price.</li>
    <li> The base coat keeps gel polish on your nails like no other brand can! The shorter brush makes the base coat easy to apply without going to thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The topcoat is easy to apply and long lasting as well, BUT I see a lot of yellowing sometimes! If I have white polish underneath, within a week it looks dingy and yellowish. Very disappointing. Any other color underneath looks great, so the yellowing must be very subtle if I can only see it with white.</li>
    <li> Works much better than the brand I originally purchased (Sensationail) I picked these up because I spied on a salon and this is the brand they used. Removal is much easier too.</li>
    <li> I use these two with ibd gel polish and pro gel polish. I had a good out come. Polish lasts a long time!! I will order again!</li>
    <li> I was able to get perfectly nice professional looking Gel nails on first try!&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend them, I would buy again.</li>
    <li> If you wear Gel nails often, you will want these. Great price too! These are a great bargain.  Follow the instructions for applying.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!  My nails glisten with the top coat!  I don&#x27;t mean glittery - just very shiny.</li>
    <li> No peeling off. Works awesome.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Good deal for both full bottles of foundation and top coat. Would definitely buy again. It arrive quickly and was packaged great! Stays on with gelish colors for at least 2 weeks with no chips. I have to take it off before it wears off. LOVE</li>
    <li> I have tried several gel base coats and gel top coats and this is by far the best brand. This is truly a great product and I would highly recommend this company! I&#x27;ve already told my friends to order from here.</li>
    <li> My personal home spa :)</li>
    <li> These came together at a great price, and I&#x27;m so happy they are full sized bottles.  In beauty stores, the mini sized bottles are more than you can buy the full sized bottles for on Amazon.  My only complaint was the foundation was a little thick.  The top coat (and the colors I purchased at the same time) were all thin, like they are supposed to be to apply thin coats.  The foundation was very thick compared to the others and was more difficult to apply neatly.</li>
    <li> I recently decided to purchase the UV lamp for Gelish nails and bought a few polishes to try this method at home. LOVED it!  I have since then needed to purchase these foundation and top coats along with more gelish polishes. So much cheaper than going to the salon! And they last weeks without chipping!</li>
    <li> The base coat works perfectly but I keep having to soak the top coat brush because it gets clumps, I haven&#x27;t had this problem with top coats before.</li>
    <li> These are the full size bottles, which is great. I&#x27;ve seen way too many mini bottles going for way more than what they&#x27;re worth. They&#x27;re the real thing and they work great with other brands of led or uv gel polish. I have a pretty cheap UV lamp and it cures this set great.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE!!&lt;br /&gt;Works welll , i use a led light . Not sure how long i have to cure each layer for but im still just playing around with these items.</li>
    <li> I like the bigger size.  They should last a while longer than those small bottles.  I&#x27;ve been using the Gelish Base and Top Coat with no problems.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Got in within two days!!😍😍</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter for Christmas...she loves it.  We had a problem with a missing brush in the top coat,&lt;br /&gt;however the seller promptly sent another.  Super response...very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product! I use two coats before and two after color. I just make sure I rough up the nail before the base coat and the nails last for a very long time (3 weeks at the least). Good size bottles too, not the little tiny ones.</li>
    <li> Work well and good price also!!!</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time. Good quality, after all this brand is used everywhere in nail salons. Very pleased. Salon quality in your home. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the quality from the gelish nail line. This ser was a great find for a great price. I have had my two bottles for over 8 months now and use them every 2-3 weeks. I still have more than half of pooduxt left in each bottle. I would recommend keeping the botttle away from your heat lamp as it may start to clump together. Also, after a few weeks of the bottle not being opened, it can slightly clump around the brush area. I just remove the clump with a paper towel and the brushes are good as new. Overall highly satisfied with the quality of this gel nail line.</li>
    <li> I must have got a defective brush for the base coat. Top coat is perfect the base coat works but the bristles on the brush are a third of the length that they are for regular nail polish brushes. Top coat was average length but the base is so short it doesn&#x27;t hold enough polish to cover a nail so it&#x27;s kind of annoying. One positive about the brush head being so tiny, it makes it really easy to control the polish!</li>
    <li> Had to purchase these to replace thicken one from another kit  ~ but it still better to use at home.</li>
    <li> I have tried every type of gel polish and I find that gelish and I get along much better than other brands. I don&#x27;t know if I am too tough on my nails or if my nail beds are just naturally very oily (even after prepping them with the ph prepper) most like to start lifting on me. This brand and I get along and it even plays along nicely with the other brands as well. I have been putting some of my opi gel polish color over it and I get the best of both worlds.</li>
    <li> Works just like the ones in the salon. Shipping was good and not too long.&lt;br /&gt;Product works great and cures under my UV 36W  lamp.</li>
    <li> They make my nail polish lasts longer and do not crack like some other gel coats.  I believe that they are of good quality, hence you find them in most nail salons. There is absolutely nothing to say against these set. I would recommend them to other buyers and would obviously be buying them again.</li>
    <li> great quality great price twice as big of bottles  for less price.</li>
    <li> Gelish is a great gel  manicure line. The product came on time and it was good price.</li>
    <li> The Gelish line definitely has my vote for best base and top coats.  These are the best you can get, and I&#x27;ll be buying them again and again.</li>
    <li> I had some other gel foundation and top coat and it came off w/in a week....this stuff stays the full two weeks and would longer if I didn&#x27;t pick at it....I love it now I get to have fun nails that stay....I have three kids and am a single mom so when I say it stays you know it stays........</li>
    <li> Decided to do Gelish manicures at home after having my nails done at the salon a few times. I was so pleased with how long it lasted &amp; how it doesn&#x27;t chip. Love how my nails look!</li>
    <li> This product is great just like the nail salon.  I will not longer go and pick a color at the nail shop.  I am my own nail shop!</li>
    <li> Love it. I use the set at home with an LED lamp and my nails don&#x27;t even start peeling at the edges after two weeks. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> After looking at what the Basix kit contained, I decided I would get more bang for my buck by buying this set.  The Foundation (Base Coat) and Top it Off (Top Coat)are absolutely essential in applying Gelish polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency on the Foundation polish is a little thick and the brush is about half the length of a normal brush on a polish.  To me, this makes it difficult to apply the required thin coat evenly.  I&#x27;m sure there is a trick to it and I just need a little practice.  After applying the PH Bond to the nail bed this Foundation Coat will help the rest of the Gelish coats adhere properly to your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency on the Top it Off is more of the consistency of a regular polish, but it is a little thin and runny, so be careful.  The brush is also the normal length and it makes for an easy application of the polish.  The Top it Off as the final coat gives your polish a brilliant shine!  The very first time I used the Gelish system, all I did was the Foundation coat and two coats of the Top it Off and my nails looked awesome!  Again, this Top it Off gives a shine that doesn&#x27;t dull and it seals the Gelish to your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this set and the Gelish nail system as a whole.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and looks just like the salon, its been one week and my polish is just as shiny today as the first day. Make sure to do a THIN coat and try to avoid the sides of the nail and cuticle. Since it was my first time I got too mush polish around the edges of the sides of my nail so there is a ridge, next time I will paint much thinner coats.</li>
    <li> Warning: Top coat is black light reactive and will glow blue. I happen to love this feature and think it adds a fun touch. And hey, if you&#x27;re hanging around black lights, thats probably what you want anyways!</li>
    <li> Great product gives great gel mani. Easy and alot cheaper than a salon ! Easy to understand and you can You tube instructions so you can watch people applying !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting shellac french manicures for the past 2 years.  Tried several different brands and I have to say the Gelish (pronounced &amp;#34;jell ish&amp;#34;) seems to be the best for me.  No peeling or cracking.  Because I am VERY VERY picky with my french nail appearance (I don&#x27;t want the white part half-way down my nail bed so it looks like toenails or having to wait a week for my nails to grow out enough so it looks natural!, and I want an even smile line...not curving half way down the other side!, or uneven length of nails (It wasn&#x27;t crooked when I walked in the door). And please making me soak my fingertips in a bowl of acetone with a towel over it may make their job easier (NOT) but it totally ruins my skin!  I travel a lot and there are a lot of unseasoned manicurists out there, if I spend $20-$40 it should look like it! Disclaimer--Way before the invention of shellac I used to do my own french polish. I thought it was high time to put my complaining where my mouth is and DIY!  I invested in the LED light for about $43 (here on Amazon) yes you can reasonably only do 4 fingers at a time but I didn&#x27;t want to store some huge thing or put out a lot of $$ initially.  Curing time for an LED light is about 1/4 the time versus UV 10-30 sec versus 1-2 min with UV!!  I youtubed a few how too&#x27;s and tips on gelish and away I went.  I will say that it is best to avoid cotton wipes/balls because the fuz it awful!  I don&#x27;t have the best eyesight so I use my lighted magnifier lamp to aid in getting the smile line neat and tidy.  I haven&#x27;t found the perfect brush for french yet but I was quite impressed with my first go round.&lt;br /&gt;I did go ahead and purchase the Gelish brand polish remover and cleanser so I had a baseline.  Unless you have a friend with a beauty license do yourself a favor and avoid S---Y&#x27;s overpriced mdse.  By the time I have done 5 DIY shellacs I&#x27;ve paid for all my products including the lamp!  Recoup a bit of your investment &amp; save your friends some $ at the same time by charging them $10 or have them supply a replacement product and make an evening of it!the same time by charging them $10 or have them supply a replacement product and make an evening of it!</li>
    <li> Gelish is fantastic!  I wore acrylics for over 20 years and my real nails were very brittle and thin.  After switching to gel nail polish, my nails are very healthy</li>
    <li> I like the big bottles. But I do not think this base and top coat is reliable. It only lasts for less than a week and peels right off no matter what type of gel polish I use.</li>
    <li> Great product and will definitely buy this exactly brand/kind when our current bottles run out!  I am extremely pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> The base and top coat gel  are very good.  They make my nails look like they have been professionally done.  Doing my nails myself  will save me lots of money.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Works great got it to go with a gift I bought! Now she is ready to pamper herself!</li>
    <li> These are so easy to use.  I like clear polish, so I use just one coat of each.  Manicurist did it the same way.  I dry with a Melody Susie LED mini dryer.  Since color is clear, I redo every two or two and a half weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My nails are hard and shiny. My manicure lasts for 2 weeks easily. I will purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> Great price for the product.  By far my favorite base and top coat.  It never chips or bubbles...(I&#x27;ve had a bubbling issue with OPIgel base and top coat in the past.)  And a little goes a long way, since I&#x27;ve been regularly doing my nails for the past 4 years, this is only the 2nd bottle I&#x27;ve had to purchase.</li>
    <li> I received these two full sized bottles and they are authentic and work wonderfully. I was on a mission to learn how to do my own gel nails and this is what you need.</li>
    <li> Both work great! Although if the top coat bottle and brush while applying onto finger is too close to the drying machine while on, it starts to dry the brush quickly and if it&#x27;s there for awhile it could be a mess! Love it though!</li>
    <li> This is a very good stuff! Works perfect and I would recommend it to my friend - very successful purchase.</li>
    <li> As a nail tech I have to use this with all brands of gel polish and it works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned my own Gelish set for going on 4 years for my own in home personal use. I orginally bought it at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, same great quality just much smaller size. I was so excited to see this set. LARGE bottles for half of what I had been paying. The brushes are larger which does take a bit to get use to but I am really happy with this product.</li>
    <li> These items are wonderful.  I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on my nails and I am by no means a professional.  They are professional, long lasting, and great looking.</li>
    <li> It gelish enough said they lead the industry for a reason</li>
    <li> Absolutely love Gelish! Product as deceived and arrived 2 days after purchase.</li>
    <li> good....stay w/ gelish</li>
    <li> I chose this combination of base and top coat from Amazon because it was so much cheaper then buying it in a salon separately. The product is very good and I like the fact that it keep your nails pliable.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with the Gelish products, and this set is the best without buying a lot of products I didn&#x27;t need.</li>
    <li> This was the first time purchasing these two products and I feel they work well and as expected compared to my other gel base and top coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find the foundation to be a little on the thicker side compared to the top coat and not ever buying the foundation in the past I don&#x27;t know if this is normal or not.  Regardless, it still went on very smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great size, full bottle sizes compared to some Gel Polishes that are very small.</li>
    <li> Very good service and products as described!</li>
    <li> This is a good product, especially for the price. It lasts a long time and protects my nails from damage. I&#x27;ve been able to use it with different brands of polish too with no problems.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this, but disappointed, it was extremely thick and very hard to apply, as a result took over an hour to dry.</li>
    <li> Great Product for completing your gel nails! Needed for priming your nails and also completing the perfect shine. Will buy again</li>
    <li> OK not as well as when u have ur nails done in a salon.....I think I&#x27;ll pay to have them done.</li>
    <li> Not much to say, except that it get&#x27;s the job done. I only ever use this brand, and I an yet to be disappointed. ^_^</li>
    <li> I love the Gelish brand of professional nail polish. Combined with beautiful color using a UV lamp between each coat, my nail polish lasts 2-3 weeks without chipping, stays shiny and beautiful! My natural nails are finally growing since I have been using the gel polish, and dry brittle nails are a thing of the past. I have used a few other professional gel polishes, and I really think the Gelish lasts longer than all of the others.</li>
    <li> Received both of these quickly. Use once and awhile for giving myself a manicure that I need to last awhile. Used with an LED light and cures quickly. The brush on the TOP IT OFF got hard immediately upon using and I now use a regular brush from an old nail polish that I threw away. Soak the brushes well with acetone after using so they stay soft. The base coat brush is fine and haven&#x27;t had any problems. Great for a shiny clear look as well, with no color.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t  get along without these products!!!  I love everything Gelish!  I have recommended it to several of my friends and I know some of them have tried it. I will buy again...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the Gelish lasts as long as the OPI in my opinion so I switched and I will not be buying any more Gelish brand gels.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Worked as promised. Looked at a few tutorials before purchase which helped alot. Highly recommend and was a good price for first purchas.</li>
    <li> arrived on time good stuff</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m not sure you can do a manicure without this. - it&#x27;s so amazing and does the job perfectly.  the shine from the topcoat is unreal.</li>
    <li> When product arrived the box was smashed a little because of the packaging. but any way AI like what I had purchased. It was heavy in weight better than I expected and easy to apply. Product came on time as expected and will purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with gel nail polish.  I bought a dryer on amazon and after reading many reviews decided to go with gelish products.  I absolutely love them!  My nails look great for 2 wks and I only redo them because they grow out too much.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I love this polish duo! And the price really is great for a set of two of them. They&#x27;re normally $20 a piece!</li>
    <li> Worked just like at the salon. The brush on the base coat is really tiny, so it takes a bit of practice, but I quickly got the hang of it.</li>
    <li> Fast!Awrsome fast shipment ! Would recommend it! Easy to work with! !!!!! Would order again and again! Thanks!  Easy work</li>
    <li> Good value for a good product. Was a little expensive to start doing my nails myself, but am so happy I took the leap!  This product makes my nails look so nice! It gives them protection to grow without breaking &amp; splitting.  Do this for yourself. You will love having pretty nails! What a treat!</li>
    <li> This is full size and since I only have to do my nails every 3 weeks will last a long time. I will get more since I have been doing my family&#x27;s nails as well.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s easy to do and it lasts forever without chipping or peeling. I like it so much better than acrylic nails.</li>
    <li> With nail polish you never know how old it is. When recieved this product it was still sealed very well and the quality was great. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I began doing my own gel nails about a year ago, and I will never use regular nail polish again. It&#x27;s a shame because I have so many colors, but I will build my gel polish collection over time, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hesitated buying this brand because of the expense and I was misinformed. Harmony was the leader in gel polish, but CND seems to have taken the credit. Perhaps due to a better marketing strategy, and the fact that CND is only availble to salons (and on Amazon, of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with the options, IBD for $15, Harmony for $23, or CND for $30, I chose the IBD brand because of the initial startup cost (so many bottles of polish, prep stuff, and the light), but I was not overly happy with the results. I was lucky to get 5 days from a manicure (after buying an extra bottle of IBD primer-another $10), and I was still spending a lot of time doing my nails. The only positive I could find was that my nails were dry as soon as I was done (totally not possible with regular nail polish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This base coat now gives me 2 weeks (as long as I don&#x27;t get tired of the color). No extra primer needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the color, I still use the IBD brand color, and it works fine to interchange. I also have one color of CND that works fine with this brand base and top coat. One thing I can say about the color is that the IBD seems to be thicker than the CND, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a good thing or a bad thing. I haven&#x27;t tried the Harmony colors yet, but will in the future as I work to expand my color collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Harmony base coat doesn&#x27;t pull away from the edge like the IBD brand base coat does. The color doesn&#x27;t pull away from the edges with the Harmony base coat either (a problem I had with the IBD brand base coat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this brand again and would recommend the Harmony brand base &amp; top coat over the IBD base &amp; top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I&#x27;ve got, is that the polish really sticks. That means acetone soakingis required to remove the gel polish, something not really required with the IBD brand since it peeled off so easily.</li>
    <li> Very good polish have used it home and the nail Salon.  Does last at least one week I very satisfy with the product</li>
    <li> LOVE this product it will beautify ANY uv Gel polish; cheap or expensive.</li>
    <li> I used it only once, I am satisfied so far....</li>
    <li> The brush on the base coat is all smooshed up into the handle.  I can still use it, but it isn&#x27;t like a normal brush.  It&#x27;s about 1/3 as long as it should be.</li>
    <li> I actually have nails now!  I used to pick and bite at my nails when I&#x27;d get anxious so I never had nice hands  I DO NOW.  This product is a lifesaver.  PLUS, the fact that manicures last nearly a month is amazing!  I usually get bored of the color before I chip anything.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good!! better than what i expected&lt;br /&gt;give it a try, you will like it !!! ! !! !!</li>
    <li> This product is way too thick - I tried using it 3 separate times; followed the directions and it is too thick and peels off. Do not like it and would like a refund.</li>
    <li> I use this over and under all my gels and it keeps it nice for a much longer time than just the gel color.  It adds a beautiful wet shiny finish that really flatters the colors.  I buy this one all the time.</li>
    <li> My wife is pleased with the products results.</li>
    <li> Love love love this duo! The price was to die for! I would have to say probably the best brand gel polish!</li>
    <li> I use a LED UV dryer and gelish base and topcoat. I don&#x27;t like to grind down my nails with a very high grit file, but this does not seem to be an issue so far. Very durable and lasts several weeks if you apply it as you should. I even do backfilling when they start to grow out and seems to stay on very well. My nails are getting very long and I get tons of compliments on them.</li>
    <li> Arrived faster than expected. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Takes a while to receive</li>
    <li> Best top coat and bottom coats I have found.. I have used them with other polish brands- helps the cheaper ones last longer!</li>
    <li> Gelish is a good product, just not crazy about the short brush inside.</li>
    <li> These are a must if you are using Gelish products.  Just know you also need several other things to make it all work.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best gel on the market for home use or salon, would buy again in different colors.</li>
    <li> It is a good product not sure yet if I have to buy the PH bond in order do not have the nail polish feeling off I currently apply the cleanser before the base and it works well.</li>
    <li> The gelish base and top coat work great and keep my nails from chipping, I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.  I did my manicure 8 days ago and so far no chips.  Polish dries very slick and smooth.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the gelish products, I think these are the best base coats and top coats in the industry, hands down. Order came quickly and without problems, thank you.</li>
    <li> Item as promised! Thank yoU!</li>
    <li> Gelish works great&lt;br /&gt;Its my 1st purchase from this seller and shipping was fast and product still in original packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Love the Item, especially with my new Salon Edge 36W UV Nail Lamp &amp; Gloves Gel Light TIMER Spa Curing dryer&lt;br /&gt;purchased from the same seller.&lt;br /&gt;If you love gel nails, and are looking to do them at home,&lt;br /&gt;definitely purchase this item&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
    <li> What can I say , they work and again they are the larger size .5oz. I noticed some stores carry the mini .3oz for the same price. I&#x27;m getting hooked on gel/shellac nail polish.</li>
    <li> This works excellent with my UV light.  Be careful that you don&#x27;t put it on too thick or you will be lumps/ridges when you cure with the UV light.</li>
    <li> The base coat has a tiny little nub of a brush that is somewhat difficult to use.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Gelish nails. I&#x27;m so glad I order this product so I can do my own nails and don&#x27;t have to pay some one anymore. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Product got clumpy within the first two weeks.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than Shellac, and just as good, if not better!</li>
    <li> I have used other brands of base and top coats.this one works really well and doesn&#x27;t seem to be as thick as the other ones I used.goes on easily and so far no  bubbles in it,which was my pet peeve with the other brand I was using.i will definitely purchase thes again. The shine is beautiful and they wear very well also.i also love their polishes in this line.</li>
    <li> Worked perfect the only recommendation I can make is to be sure you use a very thin coat of base coat polish and topcoat I made mine a little too thick the first time around. Nonetheless they turned out beautiful.</li>
    <li> Nice nails that don&#x27;t bend and chip anymore. I am a happy person.&lt;br /&gt;If I don&#x27;t feel like doing my nails cute, I at least do them clear. I haven&#x27;t had a chip or a break in 2 months now. I have to cut and file them. That is a new thing for me. They usually just bean and break off!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with these 2 bottles! They work great.</li>
    <li> Excellent product value. Both gels work great with Harmony-Gelish products purchased elsewhere. Don&#x27;t over pay for mini size product elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I purchased another brand gel kit and wasn&#x27;t all that happy with the combo base/top coat.  So I decided to try Gelish.  And I absolutely love it!  I really like the little stubby brush in the foundation gel.  It takes a little getting used to, but it really helps to get the thinnest coat possible.  Application of both the foundation and top coats was smooth and easy.  I am especially grateful that there was no pooling of gel into the sidewalls (that was a big problem for me with another brand I have used).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those here stating that this doesn&#x27;t dry, please be aware that this is a gel product -- it must be cured under a UV or LED lamp.  Enough said about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used another brand of color gel polish, and it worked just fine with the Gelish foundation &amp; top coat.  My nails look like they were done professionally in a salon.  Now that I&#x27;ve tried the Gelish foundation and top coat with success, I will definitely purchase some Gelish colors as well.</li>
    <li> These both seem to do a good job. I had to dry them a bit longer than the directions say but it might just be the dryer I use. Nice shine and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I thought it was</li>
