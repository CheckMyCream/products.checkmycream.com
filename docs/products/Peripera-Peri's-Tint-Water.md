      <li>My quest for the perfect lip tint is over!  </li>
      <li>This stuff is AWESOME!!  </li>
      <li>The color is beautiful, but it dries my lips.</li>
      <li>i somethings like to use it as blush, works out great.</li>
      <li>I gave this 5 stars because it is a great product.</li>
      <li>It looks great alone or under a gloss.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for day-to-day wear.</li>
      <li>I love how much of a beautiful flush this gives my face, the color it adds to it.</li>
      <li>I decided to get the \\&quot;Cherry Juice\\&quot; and the \\&quot;Orange Juice\\&quot; and surprisingly, the orange one was my favorite!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t look great if you put it on top of products already on your lips.</li>

      <li>Loved it and the shipping was quick.</li>
      <li>If it didnt contain any alcohol I would love this, but since it does I wont recommend it to anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Got one for my birthday.. fell in love and ordered one in orange</li>
      <li>I guess if I had to compare it to something, it is more of a lip stain than anything.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to always follow up application with gloss...</li>
      <li>As for the product, I love it.</li>
      <li>The gels are much better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Whatever, I still love it.</li>
      <li>Benetint is better.  </li>
      <li>Nothing to complain, love this water tint, cute and easy to carry.</li>
      <li>It looked funny, bit had good color.</li>
      <li>The packaging is adorable, the color is great, and it lasts a decent amount of time on your lips (unless you eat something right after applying it).</li>
      <li>and you should always apply lip balm before applying this, because it is watery and tends to rub away really easily.</li>
      <li>Easy application.</li>
      <li>(ya know, &amp;#34;its so smooth</li>
      <li>and I was pleasantly surprised when this shade looked good on me.</li>
      <li>The tint water is good, but it takes a lot of coating to get the desired red effect.calso</li>
      <li>so pretty color!</li>
      <li>I am using this tint 4th time right now</li>
      <li>goes great with my skin, doesnt taste bad and is very easy to apply!</li>
      <li>Very fast.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>color is cute and pretty, But does not last long.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Simple and cute.</li>
      <li>Somehow the fact that this was being shipped all the way from Korea slipped my radar (paying a $7 shipping fee for a $1 product should&#x27;ve been my first clue...</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this and is worth the money.  </li>
      <li>These tints impart a fresh, soft flush of color to lips that really lasts.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted an orange lip tint.</li>
      <li>Its very versatile, and goes with a lot of things.</li>
      <li>I think if this came in a pen-type applicator with a felt tip, the color would be much easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really like the color.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had much luck with lip stains</li>
      <li>I bought \\&quot;Pink Juice\\&quot; and absolutely fell in love.</li>
      <li>the color is very cute, does see the lips with color and looks natural, not put it 5 stars because the color does not last long</li>
      <li>Shipping was earlier  than the expection date, and I got the item exactly what it shown on the website.</li>
      <li>Easy Back To School Looks\\&quot; and was curious to try them out.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s kind of hard to apply at first due to how liquidy the product is.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly so it&#x27;s not messy.</li>
      <li>Pigmented, needs to be applied frequently.  </li>
      <li>It a soft color not an in your face color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not quite natural looking with my skin color</li>
      <li>I have naturally pinkish lips.</li>
      <li>Still way better than lipstick any day tho and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>It will bleed off your lips and stain your face if you are not careful when applying.</li>
      <li>It creates a yummy light red-orange flush of color that is quite flattering when it isn&#x27;t layered to thickly.</li>
      <li>The color that is left on your lips is so vibrant and actually lasts a long while.  </li>

<li> The color that is left on your lips is so vibrant and actually lasts a long while.  </li>
<li> But this could be a positive thing as well, because it means you only need to apply very little.</li>
<li> I was disappointed I would have to wait so long for it to be delivered, BUT it arrived a week before the estimated delivery time, and they added some free lotion samples to the package, which I thought was sweet.</li>
<li> The consistency is much thinner and watery than I had expected, which makes it a little more difficult to put on than thicker tints.</li>
<li> It does not last long at all and comes off patchy if you have dry lips.</li>
<li> I could smell it immediately upon application and about 10 mins later my lips were dry and peeling!</li>
<li> Did not wait that long for this tint water to come in the mail.</li>
<li> This lip tint took a long time to arrive.</li>
<li> I waited way to long for this.</li>
<li> doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out and color stays on for a long time</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t last like other stains I have.</li>
<li> I have to fan it dry in order to prevent it from sliding everywhere.</li>
<li> even if I fan it dry.</li>
<li> I can see this little pot lasting a long time.</li>
<li> I saw this product in \\&quot;Pink Juice\\&quot; on bubzbeauty&#x27;s \\&quot;3</li>
<li> Perhaps my only complaint is that the consistency is too watery for my liking, so if you&#x27;re not extra careful applying it, it goes all over the place.</li>
<li> I also purchased the pink juice as well.</li>
<li> cuz sometimes the pink is too pink.</li>
<li> And I like this, because its subtle, but at the same time it makes my lips pop.</li>
<li> little pricey though...</li>
<li> Little did I know that this product was going to be my holy grail product.</li>
<li> Not very pleased.  </li>
<li> what can I say, it was late</li>
<li> and I was tired).</li>
<li> If you give it a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
<li> Be warned though, it tastes AWFUL!</li>

    <li> These tints impart a fresh, soft flush of color to lips that really lasts.  My quest for the perfect lip tint is over!  Yay!</li>
    <li> the color is very cute, does see the lips with color and looks natural, not put it 5 stars because the color does not last long</li>
    <li> I really wanted an orange lip tint. And I like this, because its subtle, but at the same time it makes my lips pop. Its very versatile, and goes with a lot of things. It&#x27;s good for day-to-day wear. It&#x27;s lightweight, not heavy, not very pigmented, but still quite noticeable. I put on several coats to enhance the color. Simple and cute. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> the color looks really nice but it&#x27;s kind of hard to apply at first due to how liquidy the product is. smells like oranges.</li>
    <li> The tint water is good, but it takes a lot of coating to get the desired red effect.calso, it does not last throughout the day....I give it about 4-6hrs. I probably won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I waited way to long for this. It is just tinted juice and I am giving to the kids to play dress up with . The color does not stay.</li>
    <li> Pigmented, needs to be applied frequently.  Doesn&#x27;t look great if you put it on top of products already on your lips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a tint like this before. The consistency is much thinner and watery than I had expected, which makes it a little more difficult to put on than thicker tints. The applicator wand grabs a LOT of color and I have to dab out excess tint for several seconds before applying, and even then the tint can be a bit runny. I have to fan it dry in order to prevent it from sliding everywhere. Also, some of the color winds up on my teeth (NOT a flattering look!) even if I fan it dry. I think if this came in a pen-type applicator with a felt tip, the color would be much easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I love the color! It creates a yummy light red-orange flush of color that is quite flattering when it isn&#x27;t layered to thickly. It looks great alone or under a gloss. If it wasn&#x27;t so watery, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME!!  It is unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  The color that is left on your lips is so vibrant and actually lasts a long while.  I guess if I had to compare it to something, it is more of a lip stain than anything.  I highly recommend this and is worth the money.  If you give it a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I also purchased the pink juice as well.</li>
    <li> Nope.  Benetint is better.  This one doesn&#x27;t last or sit well on the lip.</li>
    <li> Not very pleased.  It does not last long at all and comes off patchy if you have dry lips.</li>
    <li> Im african-american (think of MAC&#x27;s shade NC42) and I was pleasantly surprised when this shade looked good on me. I haven&#x27;t had much luck with lip stains so I was glad when it was a good fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this stuff may contain some alcohol. I could smell it immediately upon application and about 10 mins later my lips were dry and peeling! So this was definitely a no-go for me. If it didnt contain any alcohol I would love this, but since it does I wont recommend it to anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I thought the name &amp;#34;Tint Water&amp;#34; was just a marketing gimmick to make you buy it (ya know, &amp;#34;its so smooth it feels like water on your lips!&amp;#34;, that sorta thang) but this is actually a water-y, liquid-y based lip product.</li>
    <li> This lip tint took a long time to arrive. It bled out of my lip line. It looked funny, bit had good color.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not quite natural looking with my skin color but you can control the application. Still way better than lipstick any day tho and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Loved it and the shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> Nice color but it last for only an hour for me.</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars because it is a great product. doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out and color stays on for a long time</li>
    <li> Somehow the fact that this was being shipped all the way from Korea slipped my radar (paying a $7 shipping fee for a $1 product should&#x27;ve been my first clue... what can I say, it was late and I was tired). I was disappointed I would have to wait so long for it to be delivered, BUT it arrived a week before the estimated delivery time, and they added some free lotion samples to the package, which I thought was sweet.

But this could be a positive thing as well, because it means you only need to apply very little. I can see this little pot lasting a long time.</li>
    <li> I love how much of a beautiful flush this gives my face, the color it adds to it. It a soft color not an in your face color. and you should always apply lip balm before applying this, because it is watery and tends to rub away really easily. Easy application. i somethings like to use it as blush, works out great. Amazing product.</li>
    <li> Really like the color. It absorbs quickly so it&#x27;s not messy. I put some on my lips, and then go over it with a tinted lip balm so if the lip balm fades, I still have color from this tint. However, it is a bit drying.</li>
    <li> Shipping was earlier  than the expection date, and I got the item exactly what it shown on the website. Nothing to complain, love this water tint, cute and easy to carry. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this color! goes great with my skin, doesnt taste bad and is very easy to apply! It is nice to see products that do just what they say they are going to do :)</li>
    <li> I saw this product in \\&quot;Pink Juice\\&quot; on bubzbeauty&#x27;s \\&quot;3 Easy Back To School Looks\\&quot; and was curious to try them out. Little did I know that this product was going to be my holy grail product. I bought \\&quot;Pink Juice\\&quot; and absolutely fell in love. I decided to get the \\&quot;Cherry Juice\\&quot; and the \\&quot;Orange Juice\\&quot; and surprisingly, the orange one was my favorite! It shipped in perfect condition and is a great buy! I definitely recommend this to people who are looking to stretch their makeup collection like me! ^^</li>
    <li> Got one for my birthday.. fell in love and ordered one in orange cuz sometimes the pink is too pink.</li>
    <li> I have naturally pinkish lips. I get around it by layering with a sheer red chapstick (babylips). Be warned though, it tastes AWFUL! I will still wear it from times to time, as it flatters my red hair.</li>
    <li> Refused to export it to me</li>
    <li> so pretty color! I am using this tint 4th time right now</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t stain my skin. It stains some others skin, but it didn&#x27;t leave a tint at all for me.</li>
    <li> Very fast. color is cute and pretty, But does not last long.&lt;br /&gt;Whatever, I still love it. So I gave this product 4 star.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last like other stains I have. The gels are much better. It will bleed off your lips and stain your face if you are not careful when applying. If you have any wrinkles around your mouth, this is not for you.</li>
    <li> Did not wait that long for this tint water to come in the mail. The color is beautiful, but it dries my lips.</li>
    <li> Be sure to always follow up application with gloss... otherwise, chapped lips like you&#x27;ve never seen.  However will buy from again and recommend to friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey though...</li>
