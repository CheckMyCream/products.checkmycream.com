    <li> I am a fan of Bath and Body Works, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the prices in the store.  It was nice to get the same perfume for a fraction of the price.  For fans of floral scents, this is the fragrance for you.  It has a bit of a bite to it at first, but softens well as the day progresses.  It is my go-to perfume along with Forever Red.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!!  I even got a surprise gift of a mini hand sanitizer!! Love this scent!!!</li>
    <li> Came in perfect condition, earlier than expected. So happy with my purchase! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I was shopping out of town when i came across this product. I also bought the lotion and shower gel.  Everytime i wear this people always compliment me.If you like a clean smell you would LOVE this and you would think the apple overpower the florals scent but it works perfectly together. I work in a Hospital so i dont like to wear anything to strong because of people&#x27;s allergies. Try This</li>
    <li> just as expected!! awesome products the best smell ever!!</li>
    <li> ALL I CAN SAY IS BEST SMELL EVER MY NEW FRAGRANCE YUMMY SMELLS LIKE SPRING WILL BE BUYING MORE Love!!!!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine was wearing this sent and I loved it!  I ordered some for myslef and get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> This perfume enchanted me! I love light sweet smells with a citrus bite. This is that description in a nut shell. You definitely smell the peony, the Apple gives the bite, and the other scents help mold it into heaven. Not too heavy, definitely a day time scent although very usable for night,  great for when you are in crowds or around people with sensitively to smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other scents I enjoy: Ralph by Ralph Lauren, Happy by Clinique, and both of the Be Delicious (the green apple and the golden apple)scents by Donna Karen (DKNY)</li>
    <li> Smells like summer! Lightly floral with apple and melons. By far my favorite Bath and Body Works fragrance. Not over powering and very light. Will have to stock up.</li>
    <li> Loving it end a lot of complements</li>
    <li> Omg! I&#x27;ve never tried this scent but ordered this because I collect these perfumes. Super fast delivery and this is now one if my favorite perfumes ever!!!</li>

    <li> This scent is the best, and delivery was super fast.</li>

    <li> LOVE this fragrance...</li>
    <li> This perfume smells good and it&#x27;s perfect for those who don&#x27;t like the strong smell of perfume...</li>
