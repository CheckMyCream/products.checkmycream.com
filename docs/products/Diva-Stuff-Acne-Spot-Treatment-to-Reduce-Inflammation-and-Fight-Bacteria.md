      <li>I feel so much better using a product that is natural and GOOD for my skin.</li>
      <li>and we have noticed a huge improvement .His</li>

      <li>Thanks Diva Stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;Lisa</li>
      <li>I finally decided to go all natural and happened upon diva stuff products doing some more research.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been to the dermatologist, I&#x27;ve tried so many products that I&#x27;m literally exhausted from searching for something that will help keep my skin any kind of clear at all.</li>
      <li>So far ive been pretty dispointed in these products.</li>
      <li>and I know I&#x27;ve got a little assassin ready to kill any more pimples coming in</li>

      <li>This spot treatment didnt clear up acne nearly as fast as benzoyl peroxide</li>
      <li>I love that it is soothing: so many acne products dry out the skin around the blemish and make it all look worse, and that&#x27;s not an issue with this product.</li>
      <li>face is much more clear ,the Acne is just about gone besides a few spots here and there</li>
      <li>Whether you are a teenager or have adult acne, this works!.</li>
      <li>Usually &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products are safe</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t exacerbate my acne (cystic), but it doesn&#x27;t help clear it either.</li>
      <li>and they expect you to apply it frequently yet</li>
      <li>IT doesn&#x27;t work my blemish still the same, and i finish the whole bottle in about 4 days.....</li>
      <li>, funny thing is i got it as a sample i tried it few times and fell</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve had terrible acne since I hit puberty ranging from little pimples to cystic. I suffer from oily, extremely acne prone skin. I&#x27;ve been to the dermatologist, I&#x27;ve tried so many products that I&#x27;m literally exhausted from searching for something that will help keep my skin any kind of clear at all. I finally decided to go all natural and happened upon diva stuff products doing some more research. I have been on this regimen which has actually showed some promise, but of course nothing is perfect so I still break out (definitely not as bad as I used to). This blemish bomb product is pretty snazzy. Whenever I feel a big one coming on I rub some this product on and the giant zit never comes to fruition. I don&#x27;t review a lot of products unless I have something really great to say about it and I&#x27;m definitely gonna try some more diva products. They offer a sampler pack for $9.99 if you want to try it out without spending a boat load. Definitely recommend for anyone who is tired of all that benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid treatments that seem to only work for a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> Its not worth it. You need to but a few bottles Because every 30 mnts you have to apply it, and its almost the same size as a quarter coin, too small, is not what it shows on the picture.. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY......&lt;br /&gt;P.S. IT doesn&#x27;t work my blemish still the same, and i finish the whole bottle in about 4 days.....</li>
    <li> DOESNT DO WHAT IT SAYS</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! First review I&#x27;ve ever written for anything, but this is too good not to say anything about!  My skin has become more clear since using (with the charcoal scrubbies).  I had been previously been using another brand of face products that could not help my skin in the humidity of our summer.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I have been applying it about 3 times a day and even after the first day my blemishes looked a lot better. Love Diva Stuff!</li>
    <li> Works good, better than most zip zappers.</li>
    <li> After just once use you could see a noticeable difference!!!  I have been super happy with ALL Diva Stuff! I highly recommend their products!</li>
    <li> Smells and works like a little jar of noxema!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t exacerbate my acne (cystic), but it doesn&#x27;t help clear it either. Still haven&#x27;t found anything better than Jason&#x27;s Tea Tree and mineral gel.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my skin so smooth!</li>
    <li> I purchased the 3pk of different spot treatments and really liked this product. Soooo I decided to purchase it alone. I spent almost 10 dollars on this and it was the same size as the one I got in the sample package. I like it but not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great product if used as directed. Got rid of my over night white head pop ups. Love it!</li>
    <li> Diva stuff products r the bomb!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> So far ive been pretty dispointed in these products. This spot treatment didnt clear up acne nearly as fast as benzoyl peroxide and they expect you to apply it frequently yet the jar is tiny.</li>
    <li> I like the way in makes my skin feel and it did clear up little bumps just not my major ones</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!! it smells and feels wonderful and I actually think it works! I use it twice a day, although the directions say to use it more often for best results. I have very stubborn chin acne and this really helps keep it at bay.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from Diva stuff website, and i LOVE LOVE it, funny thing is i got it as a sample i tried it few times and fell i love with it, the sample last for DAYS!!! Unfortunately after like 3 days i drop my sample into the toilet by accident lol! This stuff actually works! Your will not regret if you buy it. So i would say go for it ! Its a great deal and very good cosmetic.!!!!</li>
    <li> I own a skincare spa. Whether you are a teenager or have adult acne, this works!. I sell it at my spa.  It is the best product out there for SAFELY removing whiteheads.  It won&#x27;t &amp;#34;kill&amp;#34; your skin --- you know, how usually the pimple is still there but the harsh product has left a one-inch patch of chemically scorched dry skin around it? --- like most products do.  Usually &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products are safe but dang it they just don&#x27;t work.  It is wonderful to have found a product with such safe ingredients that actually does what it claims to do!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with this product. I have pretty bad hormonal break-outs. Last night I put a decently thick layer of this product on my chin (my problem area) and woke up this morning with noticeably smaller and less red blemishes. I feel so much better using a product that is natural and GOOD for my skin. It smells nice and fresh, too!</li>
    <li> my son has suffered with Acne for years ,we have used many products and had no results i decided to order this for him and he has been using this for a few weeks at night and we have noticed a huge improvement .His face is much more clear ,the Acne is just about gone besides a few spots here and there a huge difference! He uses this with some other Diva products i bought him,I just wish i knew about this sooner.</li>
    <li> fast,effective and gentle</li>
    <li> After reading a review of the three package anti-acne treatments I ended up not getting this and now I&#x27;m kicking myself because I could&#x27;ve been acne free much sooner this stuff works great I put it on constantly at first now I don&#x27;t have to use it as much it works quick and I know I&#x27;ve got a little assassin ready to kill any more pimples coming in</li>
    <li> I love that it is soothing: so many acne products dry out the skin around the blemish and make it all look worse, and that&#x27;s not an issue with this product. It feels nourishing.  However, I can&#x27;t say it helps my cystic acne at all.  For minor blemishes, it seems to help a bit, at the same speed as any otc acne med you might buy at the drugstore. The plus is its lack of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t blown away by this product and hoped for more, but feel for folks with minor acne issues it coule be both helpful and nourishing to skin.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this with a previous order and,with just that sample my face has cleared up!!! This will be a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for me! Thanks Diva Stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;Lisa💜</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve tried all of the blemish products on the market, and this is the only one that does it&#x27;s job without irritating my skin. That&#x27;s tough for me to find, so I&#x27;ll be buying this stuff exclusively from now on.</li>
