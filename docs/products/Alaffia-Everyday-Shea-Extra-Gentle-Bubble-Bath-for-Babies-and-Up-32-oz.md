      <li>Smells wonderful and you can feel good about it being Fair Trade</li>
      <li>Does not need a lot of bubble bath to produce good bubbles.</li>
      <li>Just as good as CA Baby.</li>

      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love the smell and my daughter loves all the bubbles!</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>However, besides being a great overall product, the best part of this stuff is that it&#x27;s made by a company which provides jobs and assistance to women in Africa.</li>
      <li>nice size bottle.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice and they love the bubbles.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s a great product, at a great price, benefiting a great cause, it that&#x27;s not a winning combo</li>
      <li>I have to pay more for products that do not contain as many or no chemicals.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, the bubbles and feel of it.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and so does my son.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite baby/kid products we&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The lavender stood out most to us and is, of course, quite calming.</li>
      <li>Love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We ordered the Calming Lemon and Lavender scent and will be ordering more when we run out.</li>
      <li>granddaughter loved this so much that when bath time was over, she was asking for more bubble bath</li>
      <li>This is our favorite bubble bath....for the cost, you can&#x27;t get a better chemical free product at this size.  </li>
      <li>Smells really good but doesn&#x27;t produce a whole lot of bubbles.</li>
      <li>So many bubbles and such a nice smell!</li>
      <li>Having cancer on both sides of the family, it&#x27;s important to me that our granddaughter uses paraben free products.</li>
      <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love a company that puts some of their profits back into doing good??</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m suddenly in the mood for a warm bath myself!</li>
      <li>Nice light fragrance, all natural bubbles that lull me to sleep at night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>We used 1.5 capfuls and decided that just 1 capful would be plenty as the tub was still full of bubbles at the end of the bath.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice, gentle product that is paraben free and does not skimp on natural fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Awesome bubbles, natural, and tear-free for 1/2 the price of California Baby and other brands.</li>
      <li>One has very sensitive skin and is ok with this.  </li>
      <li>This bubble bath was fine for my daughter&#x27;s gentle skin.  </li>
      <li>The smell is amazing and lots if bubbles for just a tiny amount!</li>
      <li>But be warned, this provides such nice bubbles, your kids might not want to get out of the bath....</li>
      <li>Smile.</li>
      <li>would only mention that the nice pump sometimes leaks (in the plastic covering) during travel.  </li>
      <li>the smell is amazing and bubbles last for the whole bath.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way and it has the best bubbles!</li>
      <li>The water felt pretty silky; I&#x27;m guessing from the shae butter.</li>
      <li>Both of my girl have eczema and super sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Has great bubbles along lasting, smell could be a little stronger.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t even like lavender that much.</li>
      <li>This has been very helpful in combating that.</li>
      <li>It bubbles up really well</li>
      <li>We just use a capful and our whole tub is overflowing.</li>
      <li>Gentle on skin.</li>
      <li>bubbles last longer than most natural bubble bath ive used.</li>
      <li>One cap full lasts the entire bath for my 2 and 3 year old.</li>
      <li>It smells subtle but nice.  </li>
      <li>My favorite bubble bath for my little toddler!</li>
      <li>and so far, we haven&#x27;t had any tears!</li>
      <li>Last night was our daughter&#x27;s first bubble bath.  </li>
      <li>My daughter is 20 months old.</li>
      <li>This bubble bath is so gentle is doesn&#x27;t interact w my baby&#x27;s minor ezcema at all.</li>
      <li>A little bit goes a long way, as in one small cap full will produce a full tub of bubbles.</li>

<li> A little bit goes a long way, as in one small cap full will produce a full tub of bubbles.</li>
<li> My kids have sensitive skin, so I was worried since some other reviews state that it burns.  </li>
<li> Only needs about 3 capfulls for long lasting bubbles</li>
<li> We actually had to run the shower after bathtime ended to rinse away all the bubbles, so this stuff is concentrated and long lasting.  </li>
<li> Bubbles  last for a long time.</li>
<li> If I had one complaint, it would be that there are still bubbles left after I drain the tub because they are so long-lasting, but I don&#x27;t really mind.  </li>
<li> My Tiny loves this bubble bath so much he tries to eat the bubbles!</li>
<li> The bubbles are plentiful even w just a small amount of liquid; and they last a long time.</li>
<li> A bit expensive but worth it.</li>
<li> A little bit does go a long way.  </li>
<li> but a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Only need to use small amount to produce lots of foamy bubbles.</li>
<li> My little boy often has dry skin.</li>
<li> And the bubbles last the whole bath even with a crazy toddler splashing all around.  </li>
<li> Very little goes a long way.</li>
<li> However, it has an odd smell.  </li>
<li> Just wish it was a little cheaper.</li>
<li> My little guy loves the smell of the stuff and the bubbles are too notch</li>
<li> the shampoo has Neem oil which is NOT okay for babies...</li>
<li> My daughter&#x27;s skin isn&#x27;t dried up afterwards and she isn&#x27;t haven&#x27;t any bad reactions to it.  </li>

The scent is soothing for bedtime. This bubble bath is so gentle is doesn&#x27;t interact w my baby&#x27;s minor ezcema at all.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite baby/kid products we&#x27;ve ever purchased.  The scent is heavenly- we have the lotion as well and I always want to use it for myself it smells so great! A little bit goes a long way, as in one small cap full will produce a full tub of bubbles. And the bubbles last the whole bath even with a crazy toddler splashing all around.  If I had one complaint, it would be that there are still bubbles left after I drain the tub because they are so long-lasting, but I don&#x27;t really mind.  However, besides being a great overall product, the best part of this stuff is that it&#x27;s made by a company which provides jobs and assistance to women in Africa. So it&#x27;s a great product, at a great price, benefiting a great cause, it that&#x27;s not a winning combo I don&#x27;t know what is!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and so does my son. Just wish it was a little cheaper. It bugs me I have to pay more for products that do not contain as many or no chemicals.</li>
    <li> wish it wasnt so pricey but a little goes a long way. smells, feels, cleans great! lots of bubbles!!</li>
    <li> Smells good and I don&#x27;t even like lavender that much. My son loves the bubbles and the bottle feels really big. Does not need a lot of bubble bath to produce good bubbles.</li>
    <li> This bubble bath was fine for my daughter&#x27;s gentle skin.  No allergic reaction of any sort.  However, it has an odd smell.  It&#x27;s not sooo great but it made bubbles and there was no skin rash.  It arrived on time for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Three kids and I love it! The smell is amazing and lots if bubbles for just a tiny amount!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and my daughter loves all the bubbles!</li>
    <li> My little guy loves the smell of the stuff and the bubbles are too notch</li>

    <li> smells great! produces a lot of bubbles,</li>
    <li> Only needs about 3 capfulls for long lasting bubbles</li>
    <li> Very little goes a long way. the smell is amazing and bubbles last for the whole bath. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The fact that this company helps empower communities in West Africa is truly the icing on the cake! Who doesn&#x27;t love a company that puts some of their profits back into doing good?? Love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product! We ordered the Calming Lemon and Lavender scent and will be ordering more when we run out. Chose this bubble bath based on the reviews and the product purity. Having cancer on both sides of the family, it&#x27;s important to me that our granddaughter uses paraben free products. This is a nice, gentle product that is paraben free and does not skimp on natural fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lavender stood out most to us and is, of course, quite calming. Perfect for before bed time! But be warned, this provides such nice bubbles, your kids might not want to get out of the bath....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our granddaughter loved this so much that when bath time was over, she was asking for more bubble bath and it wasn&#x27;t because the tub  was running low...  She just loved it! I couldn&#x27;t blame her either. The water felt pretty silky; I&#x27;m guessing from the shae butter. Truly an awesome treat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m suddenly in the mood for a warm bath myself! Smile. Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> Nice light fragrance, all natural bubbles that lull me to sleep at night.&lt;br /&gt;I would only mention that the nice pump sometimes leaks (in the plastic covering) during travel.  Perhaps a clip to hold pump in place might help, or separate box...... otherwise great product!</li>
    <li> Has a nice pleasant scent, bubbles up well. Has not irritated my daughter&#x27;s skin. Will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Great smell. Lots of bubbles. Gentle on skin. A bit expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> Best bubble bath!! A little goes a long way and it has the best bubbles!</li>
    <li> the shampoo has Neem oil which is NOT okay for babies... I will NOT be using this brand for my baby!!!!! Returned to sender... no problem with seller.</li>
    <li> nice size bottle. doesnt have any scent.  bubbles last longer than most natural bubble bath ive used.</li>
    <li> Last night was our daughter&#x27;s first bubble bath.  We used 1.5 capfuls and decided that just 1 capful would be plenty as the tub was still full of bubbles at the end of the bath.  We actually had to run the shower after bathtime ended to rinse away all the bubbles, so this stuff is concentrated and long lasting.  It smells subtle but nice.  Daughter was happily playing with the bubbles including getting them in her eyes, and she made no complaints.</li>
    <li> Just as good as CA Baby.</li>
    <li> Best  bubble bath ever. Tons of bubbles! Bubbles  last for a long time. Smells wonderful and you can feel good about it being Fair Trade</li>
    <li> This is our favorite bubble bath....for the cost, you can&#x27;t get a better chemical free product at this size.  I love that its fair trade, and all of the scents are great no matter what you get.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product! One cap full lasts the entire bath for my 2 and 3 year old. Both of my girl have eczema and super sensitive skin. They have done great with this bubble bath. The scent is nice and they love the bubbles.</li>
    <li> makes a TON of bubbles.  A tiny dollup makes bubbles up to the edge of the bathtub.  If we don&#x27;t rinse the bath before the next bath, just adding water again creates a lot of bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t seem to both my 2 kids.  One has very sensitive skin and is ok with this.  I don&#x27;t use it as soap though.</li>
    <li> Awesome bubbles, natural, and tear-free for 1/2 the price of California Baby and other brands. Mild but wonderful smell! Only need to use small amount to produce lots of foamy bubbles.</li>
    <li> Great bubble bath for babies! It bubbles up really well and so far, we haven&#x27;t had any tears!</li>
    <li> Smells really good but doesn&#x27;t produce a whole lot of bubbles.</li>
    <li> A little bit does go a long way.  My kids have sensitive skin, so I was worried since some other reviews state that it burns.  There were no problems except having to get the kids out of the tub.</li>
    <li> I was weary about this in the beginning because I&#x27;ve only stuck to Aveeno Baby products but I tried it because of the price.  It is great.  It smells great and if I only use 2 cap fulls, it&#x27;s enough bubbles for the entire tub.  My daughter&#x27;s skin isn&#x27;t dried up afterwards and she isn&#x27;t haven&#x27;t any bad reactions to it.  My daughter is 20 months old.</li>
