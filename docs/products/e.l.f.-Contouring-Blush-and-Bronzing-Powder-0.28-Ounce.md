      <li>I love this combo and the texture is great.</li>
      <li>It comes with a good size mirror that may come in handy during touch ups.</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>The bronzer is perfect for contouring my fair complexion and the blush is very pigmented and a nice shade.</li>
      <li>Love the color and the price!</li>
      <li>I am so happy to purchase this since it is soooooo cheap yet</li>
      <li>The blush is as amazing as the bronzer.</li>
      <li>To be honest I was not expecting te result when I purchased this</li>
      <li>like I had a great tan right off the beach!</li>
      <li>Very easy to use and goof proof for me who&#x27;s not the beauty expert.</li>
      <li>The packaging is so beautiful, it looks exactly as the NARS packaging.</li>
      <li>Love the contour color very easy to build up and blend</li>
      <li>The bronzer powder is beautiful, it is more of a warm brown shade with the right amount of shimmer on it, it is perfect to use to warm up the face or to give you face a subtle yet bronzy contour.</li>
      <li>I really like the Elf products and this seller is great.</li>
      <li>I love this bronzer a lot it is close to the hoola bronzer.</li>
      <li>There is more than just this shade to choose from.  </li>
      <li>The bronzer is great but the blush doesn&#x27;t show up or build onto the brush very well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay though.</li>
      <li>I love Laguna and this looks nothing like Laguna on me.  </li>
      <li>Super cheap and VERY worth it.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Blend blend blend!</li>
      <li>This stuff is FILLED with sparkles.</li>
      <li>When I saw this product, I thought it seemed great because I wouldn&#x27;t need to buy two different products to contour when I want to.</li>
      <li>However, using it lightly and the blush heavily, is the perfect combination!</li>
      <li>I am fair skinned so this possibly could&#x27;ve been for olive skin tones.</li>
      <li>But this blush is very comparable to a MAC blush that I love.</li>
      <li>I love ELF cosmetics and they sell really affordable and quality cosmetics.</li>
      <li>It is a peachy shimmer shade, it gives you a very beautiful subtle peachy glow.</li>
      <li>I could not use the bronzer to really contour my face but after I contoured using my own products the bronzer and blush combo really brought color into my face...</li>
      <li>This is a great product, but a bit too dark for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>You only need a tiny bit of this powder and it is a  very nice colour combination</li>
      <li>the blush is exactly like orgasm by nars, yet so much cheaper!</li>
      <li>Nice product, exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I like to keep it simple and easy.</li>
      <li>It turned really orange on me and went in the trash immediately.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need much blush and really wanted it for the bronzer.</li>
      <li>Love my other e.l.f.</li>
      <li>I love the blush and use it whenever I do my makeup, however the bronzer is too dark and wont blend very well.</li>
      <li>Love this contour colors awesome when used with base and stick prior to using bronzer contour for those high cheek bone look !</li>
      <li>Both are very pigmented and they last the whole day!!</li>
      <li>Super sheer color on the blush.</li>
      <li>Awesome, really soft powder at first, gets a little dry and hard for some reason after a while of using but doesn&#x27;t effect application or anything</li>
      <li>When it comes to makeup, I&#x27;m a very natural girl.</li>
      <li>Fast Delivery as far the product exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I have ordered from her a few times and shipping is super fast with a thank</li>
      <li>and this product has kept the streak alive.</li>
      <li>It just looks a bit messy when you open it. :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s no where near the pretty powder pink that&#x27;s shown.</li>
      <li>it can definitely compare with the high end ones</li>
      <li>Which makes you look perpetually embarrassed, or maybe just like you&#x27;re using way too much blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The pigment is strong so a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>The blush is also pretty dark.</li>
      <li>When I received this, I was worried that the bronzing powder would be to dark (as it is much darker in person than in this picture).</li>

<li> Even if you use very little, it still looks just weird if you&#x27;re even slightly light skinned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> The bronzer is really dark.</li>
<li> Tried again using with less and found too dark for me.</li>
<li> just saved you $8 bucks, as well as half a bottle of your favorite facial scrub and the 4 hours that it would take you to get that awful glitter off your face</li>
<li> I have ivory skin, so maybe its just meant for people with a little darker skin.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a very dark rosey color.</li>
<li> I am usually the one to say I am all about MAC cosmetics.</li>
<li> I ordered this on Saturday in the late evening time</li>
<li> However, this product is just too ridiculous for me to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Elf has yet to fail me when it comes to inexpensive make up</li>

    <li> Powder explodes when applying with a blusher brush. I was all over my shirt and dressing table. Not compact at all.</li>
    <li> Super sheer color on the blush. The bronzer goes on a bit darker than expected. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I think the best price and quality. The colours are very good and iluminates the skin. And the case is very beautiful and easy to bring  in our bag. I recommend.</li>

    <li> I love this bronzer a lot it is close to the hoola bronzer. The blush is kind of disappointing though.</li>
    <li> Nice product, exactly what I expected. Love the color and the price!</li>
    <li> I am usually the one to say I am all about MAC cosmetics. But this blush is very comparable to a MAC blush that I love. A little goes a long way. I do makeup and always contour my face. I could not use the bronzer to really contour my face but after I contoured using my own products the bronzer and blush combo really brought color into my face...like I had a great tan right off the beach!

    <li> I love ELF cosmetics and they sell really affordable and quality cosmetics. I was blown away by the quality of this blush and bronzer duo. I feel like it can be a dupe for the NARS blush-bronzer duo. The bronzer powder is beautiful, it is more of a warm brown shade with the right amount of shimmer on it, it is perfect to use to warm up the face or to give you face a subtle yet bronzy contour. The blush is as amazing as the bronzer. It is a peachy shimmer shade, it gives you a very beautiful subtle peachy glow. Both are very pigmented and they last the whole day!! The packaging is so beautiful, it looks exactly as the NARS packaging. It comes with a good size mirror that may come in handy during touch ups.

    <li> Love the contour color very easy to build up and blend</li>
    <li> When it comes to makeup, I&#x27;m a very natural girl. I like to keep it simple and easy. When I saw this product, I thought it seemed great because I wouldn&#x27;t need to buy two different products to contour when I want to. However, this product is just too ridiculous for me to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The bronzer is really dark. Even if you use very little, it still looks just weird if you&#x27;re even slightly light skinned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The blush is also pretty dark. It&#x27;s no where near the pretty powder pink that&#x27;s shown. It&#x27;s a very dark rosey color. Which makes you look perpetually embarrassed, or maybe just like you&#x27;re using way too much blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) This stuff is FILLED with sparkles. Even if you can get past how dark and misrepresented the colors are, the sparkles just really kill it for me. This might just be a preference, but I don&#x27;t like glittery contour lines. It&#x27;s just not flattering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just saved you $8 bucks, as well as half a bottle of your favorite facial scrub and the 4 hours that it would take you to get that awful glitter off your face (exaggeration). You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Saturday in the late evening time and I received it on Monday morning. I tried the product as soon as I got it. It goes on very smoothly and the pigmentation is excellent. I will be buying from this seller in the future.</li>
    <li> The blush has glitter in it and will work great for summer. I got this for my daughter and she is very pleased.</li>
    <li> I really like the Elf products and this seller is great. I have ordered from her a few times and shipping is super fast with a thank you note included. You only need a tiny bit of this powder and it is a  very nice colour combination</li>
    <li> Barely swiped brush on colors and ended up having to wash face due to being too dark. Tried again using with less and found too dark for me. I am fair skinned so this possibly could&#x27;ve been for olive skin tones. Love my other e.l.f. bronzer tho!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
    <li> Elf has yet to fail me when it comes to inexpensive make up and this product has kept the streak alive. It applies nicely and looks great. The blush powder can get all over the pallet but it&#x27;s not even close to being an issue. It just looks a bit messy when you open it. :)</li>
    <li> What a life changer!  I have been given compliment after compliment since I started to wear this duo.  Super cheap and VERY worth it.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Blend blend blend!</li>
    <li> It is darker than I had hoped, but it is a gift so it all worked out.  Wonderful bargain!</li>
    <li> Awesome, really soft powder at first, gets a little dry and hard for some reason after a while of using but doesn&#x27;t effect application or anything</li>
    <li> Happy with this product. The colors and pigmentation are good</li>
    <li> I love this product! The bronzer is perfect for contouring my fair complexion and the blush is very pigmented and a nice shade. Although in the pan the bronzer seems to have shimmer, it doesn&#x27;t show up on the skin which makes it perfect for contouring. I use this whenever I apply makeup, I cannot do without it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, but a bit too dark for my skin tone. Looks great on my niece, though!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;d heard youtubers compare it to Nars Laguna.  I love Laguna and this looks nothing like Laguna on me.  It turned really orange on me and went in the trash immediately.</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery as far the product exactly what I expected. The bronzer is beautiful !</li>
    <li> Love this contour colors awesome when used with base and stick prior to using bronzer contour for those high cheek bone look !</li>
    <li> perfect contour/bronzer and blush. the blush is exactly like orgasm by nars, yet so much cheaper! this is my go to if I was to pick my last 5 make up products to carry on a deserted island!</li>
    <li> ELF cosmetics are just good all around and amazingly inexpensive for what you get.  this blush and bronzer combo is perfect.  There is more than just this shade to choose from.  The pigment is strong so a little goes a long way.</li>
