      <li>I received this quick and its so easy to fill.</li>
      <li>Handy small smooth and just gorgeous.</li>

      <li>Very convenient and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It was a waste of $10 for the item and however many dollars of my nice perfume it leaked.</li>
      <li>this particular one leaked!!</li>

      <li>I love it an plan to buy a second one in a different color - that way I have one for each of my 2 favorite perfumes and will remember which color is which perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>

      <li>Such a simple idea, yet brilliant at the same time</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>but they don&#x27;t hold much at all.</li>
      <li>THIS IS A VERY PRACTICAL SPRAY BOTTLE FOR PERFUME EITHER FOR MEN OR WOMEN</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>Since Chanel No.5 doesn&#x27;t have a reasonably priced purse size - I&#x27;m so thankful for this.</li>
      <li>I just mist it on my face throughout the day to cool down or mist it on my hair for a light scent.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
      <li>Although a little expensive, these work great and are really nice quality.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to guarantee it won&#x27;t leak, but it was very easy to fill</li>

      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Love this little perfume spray bottle.</li>
      <li>With several colors to choose from, you could fill each color with a different scent, and easily identify which is which.</li>

      <li>Fits in most of the purses, even small bags / clutches.</li>
      <li>well so far.</li>
      <li>No little funnels or eyedroppers to deal with.</li>
      <li>The Travalo is small, easy to fill.  </li>
      <li>bottom of the capsule is too small to fit around any of the perfume atomizers I have &amp;amp; when I do manage to find one, the perfume does not go into the capsule at all.  </li>
      <li>Only took it on two trips so far, but hasn&#x27;t leaked a drop yet!</li>
      <li>You could fill it from the bottom, see when it was low, and it&#x27;s a classy gold that matches my perfume bottle.</li>
      <li>I recently purchased the gold one &amp; a hot pink one.  </li>
      <li>These little guys are pretty genius.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for carrying in your purse or travel bag.  NO leaks!  Very easy to fill.  I purchased several.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> What a great idea to always be able to have your favorite cologne/perfume in your purse!  Very easy to fill!  Cost was excellent in comparison to others.  Received very quickly.</li>

    <li> Amazing product! I simply loved it. Thank you :)</li>
    <li> I love it an plan to buy a second one in a different color - that way I have one for each of my 2 favorite perfumes and will remember which color is which perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to fill.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Just sit it on the exposed tip of the perfume bottle&#x27;s nozzle and pump it a few times. Fills up quick and doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this and bought about 7 of them so I could also give them as gifts.  They don&#x27;t &amp;#34;leak&amp;#34; per se, but the seal isn&#x27;t tight enough to keep your perfume from evaporating.  Really disappointed it didn&#x27;t work and that the perfume was wasted.</li>
    <li> Yes, No Leaks because I make sure that it is standing up and well secured. This is expensive. It should be cheaper.</li>
    <li> I use my travalo all the time to keep 1-2 perfumes with me in my purse.  I recently purchased the gold one &amp; a hot pink one.  They&#x27;re so easy to just throw in your bag and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with them leaking at all.  I used to carry rollerball perfumes, but I don&#x27;t really enjoy applying perfume that way.  it&#x27;s nice to have the perfume with me in spray form.  These are great for handbags as well as for travel.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> So easy to fill. I fly very often, and it never leaks.</li>
    <li> Garbage product I could not get it open to insert the perfume and landed up breaking it.</li>
    <li> The product is a good concept but it does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom of the capsule is too small to fit around any of the perfume atomizers I have &amp;amp; when I do manage to find one, the perfume does not go into the capsule at all.  It will pool &amp;amp; spill out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> thats all i ask for, don&#x27;t leak. so therefore this was great for me. no leaks and take aplenty of the liquid.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to go traveling . I carry it in my purse all the time . I haven&#x27;t had any problems with that filling with perfume</li>
    <li> At first I loved this this. It was perfect. You could fill it from the bottom, see when it was low, and it&#x27;s a classy gold that matches my perfume bottle. Then I noticed it was leaking from the top (I&#x27;m not sure which component) so I decided to try to keep it upright. However, that seemed a little ridiculous considering it&#x27;s a travel device. Then I just went to refill it and notice that that hole in the bottom is now just a hole. You fill it, lift it up, and your perfume pours out of the bottom. It was a waste of $10 for the item and however many dollars of my nice perfume it leaked.</li>
    <li> These little guys are pretty genius.  Makes traveling with your usual perfume or cologne a snap. I also use in my workout bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They would get 5 stars but they do leak a tiny bit around the sprayer under the cap.</li>
    <li> I purchased several of these for our traveling. They are well constructed and &amp;#34;DON&#x27;T&amp;#34; leak.. I&#x27;m in the process of buying more for gifts and I will recommend these to my family and friends</li>
    <li> Although a little expensive, these work great and are really nice quality. They&#x27;re also a nice compact size and don&#x27;t spray a ton at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To fill, all you do is pop off the spray head of your favorite perfume and stick the plastic neck into the bottom of the Travalo and pump the perfume into it. No fuss no muss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the - &amp;#34;5ML 6pcs Amazing Travel Perfume Atomizer Refillable Mini Perfume Bottle Spray Blue,Red,Purple,Pink,Silver,Black&amp;#34;  http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00BPUAUB8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the same price as one Travalo you can get 6 of these little guys.  They aren&#x27;t as nice, but if you&#x27;re wanting a bunch they may be there way to go. I also did a review on those so you can see the differences.</li>
    <li> Excellent way to carry your favorite.scent without having to carry the heavy bottle.</li>
    <li> Very convenient and easy to use. It leaked from the bottom after two long flights so I&#x27;m not sure how well it works under pressure.</li>
    <li> I love my Travalo. I keep in my pocket and small purse.</li>
    <li> I am loving this spray bottle.  Simple to fill up and take in my toiletry bag for trips.  Such a simple idea, yet brilliant at the same time</li>
    <li> Glad I found this but they don&#x27;t hold much at all. I need to pack 2 for a 3 day trip..maybe I should consider another scent?! But it is easy to fill, takes just seconds and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> I received this quick and its so easy to fill. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Love this little perfume spray bottle. Perfect for travel with your favorite scent</li>
    <li> Sleek satiny finish (gold), no sharp edges to catch on anything, slides nicely into a small purse. Took less than a minute to fill (just follow the directions). Exactly what I was looking for. About the size of a lipstick. With several colors to choose from, you could fill each color with a different scent, and easily identify which is which.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great! Does not leak and easy fill method makes sure you do not waste a drop of cologne in pouring. I bought 2 of different colors(to distinguish the scent) for my husband to use at the gym and when traveling.</li>
    <li> Perfect for traveling or use in the car. Keeps you always smelling great!</li>
    <li> Once I figured out how to use this (thank you YouTube), I love it.  Great for travel.  Haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A VERY PRACTICAL SPRAY BOTTLE FOR PERFUME EITHER FOR MEN OR WOMEN AND IT ISEASY TO REFILL AND CARRY.</li>
    <li> Easy to fill. Keep it in my purse for quick refreshing. Since Chanel No.5 doesn&#x27;t have a reasonably priced purse size - I&#x27;m so thankful for this. Have had over a year. Looks new.</li>
    <li> Yep, the other leak, I&#x27;ve tried them all.  This little guy did get!  Only took it on two trips so far, but hasn&#x27;t leaked a drop yet!</li>
    <li> Great and by far no leaks.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for me. Fits in most of the purses, even small bags / clutches. I just started using it, and it hasn&#x27;t leaked yet.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it will stay that way.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to guarantee it won&#x27;t leak, but it was very easy to fill and it sprays well. I&#x27;m looking forward to taking good perfume on trips in it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I read how this perfume atomizer works and read many conflicting reviews. I have to say I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! This works like a dream. It&#x27;s so easy to use, it&#x27;s impossible to make a mistake. It fills extremely easily -- no muss, no fuss. No leakage, no smell at the insertion point (as someone said in one review I read). The spray works beautifully. I read reviews that said it just left droplets of the perfume on the skin. Not so in the several I&#x27;ve tried. It sprays a fine mist, doesn&#x27;t leak, is extremely easy to fill, I really could go on and on. I absolutely love this atomizer and have ordered many more for all my perfumes. I&#x27;ve always wanted an atomizer that could fill so easily from a spray bottle. This is the absolute best.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well and cannot get the perfume to go inside.</li>
    <li> this particular one leaked!!</li>
    <li> The Travalo is small, easy to fill.  A must when you travel.  No more carrying a large perfume bottle around.  You&#x27;ll want to get more than one.  I am very happy with the purchase and will be buying more as gifts for friends.</li>
    <li> amazing.  solved all my travel cologne needs.</li>
    <li> This is so amazing. I love the color and it filled so flawlessly and easily. Handy small smooth and just gorgeous. It is the best thing I have bought on Amazon hands down</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great being able to bring my favorite perfume with me anywhere.  It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; I&#x27;ve had no problems with leaking.</li>
    <li> At first, I thought this was the perfect product. I took it on a month long trip an it worked fine.  I just got it out again to pack for another trip. When I tried to fill it, my costly perfume spilled. The pump no longer works. I bought the sprayer almost five months ago so the opportunity to return it is gone. I would not risk the lost of your perfume on this unreliable sprayer.</li>
    <li> Does what it says! Have not discovered leaking.</li>
    <li> I love this.  Easy to use.  Chic.</li>
</ol>
