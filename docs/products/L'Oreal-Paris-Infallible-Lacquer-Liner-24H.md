      <li>Probably the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I&#x27;ve purchased a lot.</li>
      <li>The best gel eyeliner I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve tried department store and drugstore brands.  </li>

      <li>and I was happy to see that it stayed on where I put it one and didn&#x27;t smear all over my eyes.</li>

      <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>Thanks L&#x27;oreal!!!!!</li>
      <li>This is amazing eyeliner, but irritates my eyes a bit</li>
      <li>Really liked the gel stayed on</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and creamy</li>
      <li>Still, I get a kind of smokey look, and I apply shadow over it.</li>
      <li>I have not tried the product with eye lashes or mascara primarily because once I started using it, I did not need to add more length to my eyelashes to get great looking eye makeup.</li>
      <li>It feels very smooth when applying on my eyes.</li>
      <li>better than any eye liner i&#x27;ve used before.</li>
      <li>I love the darker brown color on my medium brown eyes.</li>
      <li>I was especially interested in.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite at this price point.</li>
      <li>The espresso (173) remains my favorite.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and is nice and opaque.</li>
      <li>It really is waterproof, and that&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>It goes on nice and smooth and lasts all day with no smudging or flaking.  </li>
      <li>I love this shade of brown.</li>
      <li>I love the product.</li>
      <li>The color is a nice rich brown--not too gold and not too red--it&#x27;s just a blackish brown.</li>
      <li>The brush it comes with is surprisingly good; I still prefer the shape of MAC or Bobbi eyeliner brushes over this one, but I really like that it comes with a cap that keeps it from getting destroyed.</li>
      <li>This liner is also easy to smudge which was one aspect</li>
      <li>Since its so creamy, it can easily get into your eyes and/or contacts.</li>
      <li>I have liked this better than most so far.  </li>
      <li>If you make a mistake, wipe it up quickly, as this stuff sticks!</li>
      <li>, I like it better for the positive reasons and will continue to use it until I find something better anyway.</li>
      <li>Aside from my Chanel eyeliner this is my daily go to and its absolutely great.</li>
      <li>The expresso is like a black-brown which totally flatters my eyes and looks great.</li>
      <li>Very good product, beauty presentation, good quality and long lasting</li>
      <li>This product is significantly cheaper than MAC or Bobbi Brown.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been this excited about a makeup product in years, and I&#x27;ve discovered two this year - this and Milani baked eye shadow.  </li>
      <li>First, I love the brush that comes with this.  </li>
      <li>This is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve found so far, and I&#x27;ve been trying out different eyeliners since I was 14.</li>
      <li>I have used many of the cream/pot eyeliners which I like far better than pencil or liquid forms.  </li>
      <li>This stuff stays on, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and the Espresso is a really pretty color, kind of an intense brown/plum.  </li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin so for people that do not have any issues this is an amazing eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really not as bad.  </li>
      <li>Stays on all day and all night depending on how you sleep but washes off pretty easily when you want it to.</li>
      <li>I have it in the slate gray, but I&#x27;m so happy with it that I&#x27;m going to buy some of the other colors.  </li>
      <li>Very rich and high in pigment.</li>
      <li>This is officially my favorite new eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>After trying every eyeliner out there, every pencil, every applicator I thought I was doomed to never be able to capture the soft lined</li>
      <li>Used Discount Code 0100-0900 at checkout to receive a 15% discount on all American Made Fisher Space Pens and 1,200 other great inexpensive pens!</li>
      <li>Waterproof, creamy, highly pigmented, and cheap.  </li>
      <li>it does smell a bit strong and my eyes had tiny reaction the first time, but after that, i was fine.</li>
      <li>The espresso brown color was really flattering on my brown eyes - bold enough for night but suitable for daytime.</li>
      <li>Love the brush and the color Espresso for my everyday look :)</li>
      <li>Must say I was surprised at how easily it goes on and stays in place.</li>
      <li>(I only apply to my top lids.)  </li>
      <li>Several people don&#x27;t like the brush--not sure why.</li>
      <li>Love this eyeliner product and will definitely purchase another.</li>
      <li>perfect dark brown, good for when you dont wanna use black but need something still dark.</li>
      <li>, it is soooo creamy, and the brush is amazing, i use it every time over my other eyeliner brushes.</li>
      <li>The positive:  </li>
      <li>This eyeliner lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t dry out in the jar like so many others.</li>
      <li>this is easy, adaptable and you can use it to the last bit.  </li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t want to give it up.</li>
      <li>You can really get the precision of a liquid liner with this but stays on and does not flake off at all like some liquids do.</li>
      <li>I love how dark the color is but it smudges really easily---definitely not infallible!</li>
      <li>I have used Too Faced Lava for years because I love the soft pencil however it has started to smudge around the outside of my eye since I&#x27;ve moved from AZ to NC - humidity!!!</li>
      <li>The espresso colour is lovely and bold while being a little more natural-looking than black.</li>
      <li>It applied fairly easily (more work than liquid eyeliner in my opinion), but I don&#x27;t like that I have to clean the brush immediately after use or risk the bristles drying out/getting hard.</li>
      <li>To me, it&#x27;s a good brush, but I&#x27;m open to suggestions about other brushes.</li>
      <li>A cotton swab with remover is the only way to clean it up.  </li>
      <li>Regular pencil liners seem to wear off and smudge far too easily.</li>
      <li>It also goes on very easily with the included brush and since I don&#x27;t use much, I can tell it&#x27;s going to last me a very long time!</li>
      <li>I decided to go for Espresso as I have too many black liners and wanted a change of color.</li>
      <li>This was my first gel eyeliner (I usually use pencil or liquid liner), and I was hoping to love it.</li>
      <li>Compared to my Sephora Liners in little pots, this one goes on very smoothly with</li>
      <li>If you mess up its not terrible to take off just take a makeup remover and swipe away.</li>
      <li>That being said, if you like and can handle gel/cream eyeliners, I highly recommend this one.</li>
      <li>Takes a little more effort to apply than the pencils, since you need to have a steady hand.</li>
      <li>Despite being so creamy, it sets very quickly, doesn&#x27;t run or smear at all, and barely fades after a long (sweaty) day.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
      <li>Its very soft and creamy to apply.</li>
      <li>It applies easily, is removed simply and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>The liner brush is versatile and allows you to do bold and fine lines - and the gel stays wet long enough to grab a brush and smudge.  </li>
      <li>It is super soft and creamy and does not dry out or crumble through the entire container as some do.  </li>
      <li>I bought this l&#x27;oreal liner in dark slate, it was a good liner, but the color was not dark enough for me, so I tried getting it in black, I could NOT find it in black for a reasonable price, so I bought it online in expresso with free shipping.</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t dry/harden quickly like some other brands do.</li>
      <li>So far I can say that I like this liner.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Eyeliner is always a tricky thing in my opinion. Regular pencil liners seem to wear off and smudge far too easily. I have endless trouble with liquid liners because I find them challenging and making my eyes look even never seems to happen. Plus, if I happen to make a mistake, it seems impossible to get it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this liner due to a recommend of a friend. It applies easily, is removed simply and lasts a long time. My only qualm is that I find it smudges throughout the day in the edges of my eye. However, with the use of primer and a &amp;#34;holding spray&amp;#34; this can be somewhat overcome.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner product and will definitely purchase another. Its very soft and creamy to apply. If you mess up its not terrible to take off just take a makeup remover and swipe away. This doesn&#x27;t run, unlike other very expensive products that wear off mid day or are impossible to remove. If you drag it out to the outer corners on the bottom lash line you MIGHT get a little in the corner of your outer eye but that doesn&#x27;t happen all the time. Aside from my Chanel eyeliner this is my daily go to and its absolutely great. Love the brush and the color Espresso for my everyday look :)</li>
    <li> I have got two colors (black and espresso) from this line.  For some reason, the espresso version seemed creamier and less smudgy than the black version. I had some issues with smudging initially, but have learned to control it:  i) before application, put a layer of concealer or eye shadow base, and some loose powder on top; ii) after application, dust some more loose powder.  I know it sounds like a lot of loose powder.  It&#x27;s really not as bad.  I love the product. __________________ UPDATE: After using it for half a year, I can manage to apply this gel eyeliner without any smudging.  I have since bought a third color (172, 173 and 174) .  The espresso (173) remains my favorite.</li>
    <li> I have used many of the cream/pot eyeliners which I like far better than pencil or liquid forms.  I have liked this better than most so far.  The positive:  It is super soft and creamy and does not dry out or crumble through the entire container as some do.  Once dry, it stays in place and lasts throughout the day although I do apply a similar color shadow over it after it dries which probably helps.  The negative:  The texture is a cream bordering on a liquid which makes it more difficult to apply and not make a mess which is impossible to just &#x27;spot&#x27; remove this stuff after it&#x27;s on.  A cotton swab with remover is the only way to clean it up.  All said, although it is not perfect and requires finesse and a steady hand and mistakes don&#x27;t clean up without remover, I like it better for the positive reasons and will continue to use it until I find something better anyway.</li>
    <li> This is amazing eyeliner, but irritates my eyes a bit so I think I will discontinue use.  I have extremely sensitive skin so for people that do not have any issues this is an amazing eyeliner.  I really don&#x27;t want to give it up.</li>
    <li> Wore it to a funeral. Stayed on despite the waterworks. Mega staying power.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I haven&#x27;t been this excited about a makeup product in years, and I&#x27;ve discovered two this year - this and Milani baked eye shadow.  I have really oily eyelids, and all (and I mean ALL) other eyeliners give me raccoon eyes after a couple of hours.  This stuff stays on, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and the Espresso is a really pretty color, kind of an intense brown/plum.  I will say the brush was a little thick, so I bought a cheap liner brush that is just a little narrower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of the Infallible eye shadows though...they are just too hard to blend, that&#x27;s what I like about the Milani ones.</li>
    <li> I have never used L&amp;#34;Oreal Paris Infallible Gel Lacquer Liner. I decided to go for Espresso as I have too many black liners and wanted a change of color. This liner was referred by the Make Up Artist, Cara - MaskCara, who blogs about the multiple aspects of beauty and all the tips and tricks. So far I can say that I like this liner. Compared to my Sephora Liners in little pots, this one goes on very smoothly with it&#x27;s small brush. Today I used it to tight line and I was happy to see that it stayed on where I put it one and didn&#x27;t smear all over my eyes. This liner is also easy to smudge which was one aspect I was especially interested in. I love the darker brown color on my medium brown eyes. Overall, I would make this purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve found so far, and I&#x27;ve been trying out different eyeliners since I was 14. It&#x27;s nice and creamy so it doesn&#x27;t dry/harden quickly like some other brands do. The espresso colour is lovely and bold while being a little more natural-looking than black. You only need to use a tiny bit at a time, so the container lasts ages. Only downside, I found the brush to be a bit too thick for my purposes. I prefer thin angled brushes, but those can be picked up elsewhere easily and cheaply enough. Also need to be a bit careful if you try to use this on your waterlines. Since its so creamy, it can easily get into your eyes and/or contacts. That being said, if you like and can handle gel/cream eyeliners, I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I love how dark the color is but it smudges really easily---definitely not infallible!</li>
    <li> I just discovered tightlining and have been trying all sorts of liners.....various pencils, powders, and gel liners.  This is the only product that doesn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes after a few hours.  (I only apply to my top lids.)  It also goes on very easily with the included brush and since I don&#x27;t use much, I can tell it&#x27;s going to last me a very long time!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t dry out in the jar like so many others. It&#x27;s my favorite at this price point.</li>
    <li> My title says it all. I tried almost all the high end liners always with black smudges under my eyes and here this little drugstore product kicking all those super pricey cosmetics out of the water! I never compliments when I wore them even before they started to run! Now I&#x27;m told my eyes pop and people have told me they didn&#x27;t realize how beautiful my eyes were!</li>
    <li> Very good product, beauty presentation, good quality and long lasting, I am very satisfied with this eye liner, so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried MAC, Bobbi Brown, Pop, Pixi, and e.l.f. cream/gel eyeliners, and for a long time Bobbi was the only thing I&#x27;d use. However, I tried this product on a whim (austerity measures) and it will likely be my staple for a while. Here&#x27;s the breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* In the jar it appears to be a lighter (redder?) shade of brown, but the &amp;#34;espresso&amp;#34; color actually goes on much richer than browns that MAC or e.l.f. carry. It is a little bit lighter than Bobbi Brown&#x27;s espresso, but when applied it still appears black except on very close inspection.&lt;br /&gt;* The consistency is very creamy, especially compared to Bobbi Brown or Pixi, making it easier to get on the brush, although slightly more difficult to apply without smudging.&lt;br /&gt;* Despite being so creamy, it sets very quickly, doesn&#x27;t run or smear at all, and barely fades after a long (sweaty) day.&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and it hasn&#x27;t dried up at all (unlike Pixi or Pop potted eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried).&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;ve had no eye irritation.&lt;br /&gt;* The brush it comes with is surprisingly good; I still prefer the shape of MAC or Bobbi eyeliner brushes over this one, but I really like that it comes with a cap that keeps it from getting destroyed. Additionally, the length of the stem of the brush is perfect both for use and travel/storage.&lt;br /&gt;* This product is significantly cheaper than MAC or Bobbi Brown.</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that I wished I would have found years ago.  Totally given up the bottled liquid liners and the stick liners. The Lacquer liner is soft, so no tearing of skin around your eyes.  Very simple to draw a thin or thick line close to the lashes.  Only use a small, small amount, too much and it will smear big time.  It goes on wet, so don&#x27;t touch the eyes, wait for it to completely dry.  I have black lashes and found that dark brown liners works better for me than jet black liner which I wore for decades because the brown stick liners would fade out after a few hours.  The Infallible Lacquer Espresso will hold up all day and all night, does not need a second application.  I have not tried the product with eye lashes or mascara primarily because once I started using it, I did not need to add more length to my eyelashes to get great looking eye makeup.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I have used Too Faced Lava for years because I love the soft pencil however it has started to smudge around the outside of my eye since I&#x27;ve moved from AZ to NC - humidity!!! I read great reviews about the L&#x27;oreal liner so I gave it a try.  I LOVE it!! I have had experience with liquid liners so getting an application technique down wasn&#x27;t an issue for me.  It goes on nice and smooth and lasts all day with no smudging or flaking.  A little goes a long way, this bottle should last months easily with daily application. I like the dark brown color as it is still dark but not as harsh as black.  I keep the brush cover to keep liner from getting all over my makeup bag between weekly cleanings.</li>
    <li> This was my first gel eyeliner (I usually use pencil or liquid liner), and I was hoping to love it. The espresso brown color was really flattering on my brown eyes - bold enough for night but suitable for daytime. It applied fairly easily (more work than liquid eyeliner in my opinion), but I don&#x27;t like that I have to clean the brush immediately after use or risk the bristles drying out/getting hard. I also hated removing the liner at night - I understand it is part of the infallible line, but it has a waxy feel that requires lots of rubbing to remove. Now, I use it occasionally for nicer events when I need my makeup to last, but definitely not for everyday use.</li>
    <li> After trying every eyeliner out there, every pencil, every applicator I thought I was doomed to never be able to capture the soft lined look.&lt;br /&gt;(Not wanting to look like a 40&#x27;s cat-eye vixen or a smudgy panda)....this is easy, adaptable and you can use it to the last bit.  Not like the twist ups that hold next to nothing or the brittle pencils.</li>
    <li> Must say I was surprised at how easily it goes on and stays in place. I have hooded eyes so I&#x27;m always looking for an eyeliner that will stay put. I&#x27;m happy with this :)</li>
    <li> Great Eyeliner... Relatively smudge proof compared to other eye liners I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
    <li> This is officially my favorite new eyeliner.  I stopped wearing eyeliner because for me it&#x27;s either smeared pencil that doesn&#x27;t stay where I put it and irritates my eyes, or an unattractive, sharp black line from a liquid.  First, I love the brush that comes with this.  I can apply the gel thick or thin with it.  I can&#x27;t even feel it when I&#x27;m putting it on.  Second, it stays on all day.  Third, I can smudge it a little when I apply so that the line is softer, more blended and less severe looking.  Fourth, it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my sensitive eyes. I have it in the slate gray, but I&#x27;m so happy with it that I&#x27;m going to buy some of the other colors.  Thumbs up on this one.  So happy that I decided to give eyeliner one more try.</li>
    <li> The best gel eyeliner I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve tried department store and drugstore brands.  The liner brush is versatile and allows you to do bold and fine lines - and the gel stays wet long enough to grab a brush and smudge.  The liner dries within a minute or so, and then the line stays put until you take it off.  I have oily skin and even oily eyelids, and this stuff doesn&#x27;t move all day, even when you blot throughout the day.</li>
    <li> it works great. better than any eye liner i&#x27;ve used before. it does smell a bit strong and my eyes had tiny reaction the first time, but after that, i was fine. i like it a lot!</li>
    <li> Probably the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I&#x27;ve purchased a lot. Goes on smooth and is nice and opaque. You can really get the precision of a liquid liner with this but stays on and does not flake off at all like some liquids do. Stays on all day and all night depending on how you sleep but washes off pretty easily when you want it to. The brush is small enough to really give you a lot of control. This even works and stays put in your water line. I initially thought that the quantity was lacking but you don&#x27;t need much at all to get a lot of coverage, and after several uses I can tell this will last a long time. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> perfect dark brown, good for when you dont wanna use black but need something still dark. it lasts all day, it is so deep and pigmented, it is soooo creamy, and the brush is amazing, i use it every time over my other eyeliner brushes. great creamy eyeliner, never smudged on me it is perfection.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the liner that comes with this.  Get a good liner brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use up the entire jar.  Every other gel liner I&#x27;ve had to throw away before using up because they get so dried up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this gets dry, a bit of makeup primer will moisten it up.</li>
    <li> I bought expensive liners that were liquid like MAC eyeliner pens, Lancome&#x27;s Artliner which is a JOKE, I bought Chanel eyeliners and they all smudged and made me look like a racoon and I DO NOT have oily lids, my skin is very dry. I bought this l&#x27;oreal liner in dark slate, it was a good liner, but the color was not dark enough for me, so I tried getting it in black, I could NOT find it in black for a reasonable price, so I bought it online in expresso with free shipping. The expresso is like a black-brown which totally flatters my eyes and looks great. I love this shade of brown. The liner stays on all day without smudging,smearing or fading and the price is GREAT. I will stick with this color and this brand of liner. Thanks L&#x27;oreal!!!!!</li>
    <li> Really liked the gel stayed on</li>

    <li> Waterproof, creamy, highly pigmented, and cheap.  I&#x27;ve used this for a few years now in every color offered.  Doesn&#x27;t dry down so fast that you can&#x27;t work with it and doesn&#x27;t flake off.  This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Turned gloppy after a couple of weeks.  No instructions on how to use.  Left smears all around my eyes shortly after application and continued to smear all day long.  Embarrassing.</li>
    <li> Very rich and high in pigment. Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> It is an AWESOME eyeliner. It does not smudge at all, and infallible. It feels very smooth when applying on my eyes. I will probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> I keep buying this eyeliner, because you can make sharp, thin lines and it stays all day. This eyeliner holds up through sweaty-faced workouts, as well as a good cry. Takes a little more effort to apply than the pencils, since you need to have a steady hand. Do not try to apply while driving! If you make a mistake, wipe it up quickly, as this stuff sticks! Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gel and not a cream, and I think that makes it easier to work with. Several people don&#x27;t like the brush--not sure why. It&#x27;s supposed to be short and firm. To me, it&#x27;s a good brush, but I&#x27;m open to suggestions about other brushes. The color is a nice rich brown--not too gold and not too red--it&#x27;s just a blackish brown. I have trouble getting a very thin line, but maybe with practice I can. After wiping it on the rim of the jar, I wipe it flat between my fingers, and that helps avoid too much product on the brush. Still, I get a kind of smokey look, and I apply shadow over it. It really is waterproof, and that&#x27;s great. I also like their gray color.</li>
