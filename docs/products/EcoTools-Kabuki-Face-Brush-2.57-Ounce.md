### Positive Reviews

      <li>Plus, it still isn&#x27;t shedding any bristles and is holding up perfectly.</li>
      <li>They feel awesome, but are not all that functional.  </li>
      <li>Plus, it still isn&#x27;t shedding any bristles and is holding up perfectly.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s great for applying mineral foundation or a dusting of face powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This would also make a great contouring brush with a darker powder for just under the cheekbones, along the jawline, or anywhere else a bit of shadow is needed.  </li>
      <li>so I was happy to get a chance to try this EcoTools brand angled brush.</li>
      <li>I also like how this brush is attractive with the bronze handle and natural-colored bristles.  </li>
      <li>The brush is angled, and it&#x27;s wonderful to apply contouring and to blend it in - I use it more for that than for applying blush, but it works wonders because of its softness and angled edge.</li>
      <li>I love the size of this one; you can apply the perfect amount of color in one sweep.  </li>
      <li>But, it does a good job with the mineral finishing powder I use.</li>
      <li>The ELF brush is a good one also</li>
      <li>This brush is a wonderful addition to a purse makeup bag because of its compact size, or to use as a primary blush brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Exceptional quality for the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to trying out more of these brushes!</li>
      <li>Cruelty-free is a nice feature.</li>
      <li>The EcoTools brush works well with mineral foundation and also with my Lancome Dual Finish foundation as it results in nice even coverage.</li>
      <li>I liked the angle of the bristles.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really an excellent multipurpose makeup brush that I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It makes application very easy and even.</li>
      <li>This is perfect for those with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I still prefer my bronzer brush for my own personal needs but this is an excellent brush if this is the style and angle you need.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t highlight with it;it&#x27;s too broad, but it&#x27;s perfect for contouring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this EcoTools brush, it&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>It may not be a good blush contour brush for everyone (it wasn&#x27;t for me at first), but at a minimum it&#x27;s a nice brush for evenly applying foundation, powder or bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the EcoTools brand, so jumped at the chance to try this brush via the Vine program.</li>
      <li>really love it.</li>
      <li>I use it for powder and love the even effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>while I love this brush it wouldn&#x27;t work for either.</li>
      <li>It’s actually my favorite that I have.</li>
      <li>I love these brushes by EcoTools.</li>
      <li>The handle is a visually appealing bronze-colored aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it’s important to me that they look nice.  </li>
      <li>It lets you apply blush with a more contoured approach.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
      <li>it seemed that more ended up on my vanity than on my face.  </li>
      <li>After time to practice, however, I&#x27;m finding I can use it for that purpose after all by compressing it with my fingers to make the angled side more dense and running it over my blush and then applying it lightly under my cheekbones, top of my forehead, etc.</li>
      <li>This Kabuki brush has all of the same great traits of that one as a makeup brush with its own characteristics, the angled brush and shorter handle.</li>
      <li>The bristles are very soft and it feels great on our screen.</li>
      <li>If you want a light application using your favorite pressed or loose face powder, than this is a great brush to use!</li>
      <li>The kabuki brush is great: very soft, easy to use to apply product.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re great makep brushes; they don&#x27;t leave stray bristles all over your face, they&#x27;re really soft, and they grab a lot of product.  </li>
      <li>given it a glowing five stars if they had made it a tad bit smaller, then it would have been the ideal brush.</li>
      <li>well, minimal shedding, and best of all, about as eco-friendly as a brush</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for those with sensitive skin as well.</li>
      <li>Yes, I got this one for free, but I&#x27;ve also purchased many of these brushes.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice quality brush, but it is very large.  </li>
      <li>The angle makes it easy to evenly coat the skin without splotches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan both of EcoTools brushes and of angled blush brushes.  </li>
      <li>I am a HUGE fan of EcoTools brushes.</li>
      <li>there is no way you&#x27;re doing anything precise with it in my opinion.</li>
      <li>It makes a great brush for final finishing products like setting powder.</li>
      <li>I own another Kabuki brush that I really like</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell what the bristles are made of but the packaging says the product is animal cruelty free and contaims bamboo and recycled materials.</li>
      <li>but the brush provides me with an even smooth finish.</li>
      <li>The Ecotools is a such a great brand.</li>
      <li>Overall, this is a great brush at this price point.</li>
      <li>Good, soft brush for makeup application.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really an excellent multipurpose makeup brush that I highly recommend.(I do have a different EcoTools brush that did indeed come with a reusable pouch.)  </li>
      <li>: I&#x27;m updating to give this brush 5 stars (originally rated 4 stars) as it&#x27;s my brush</li>
      <li>: I&#x27;m updating to give this brush 5 stars (originally rated 4 stars) as it&#x27;s my brush</li>
      <li>I like the way it feels in my hand and the brush bristles are nice and soft on my skin.</li>
      <li>chain.&lt;br /&gt;After trying this, everything she claimed is true...</li>
      <li>Nice and soft, a pleasure to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just as great as the other products in the line.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The bristles are very soft, and I love the concept of anything &amp;#34;Eco&amp;#34; friendly.</li>
      <li>so I thought I was getting a brush I could use for contouring or maybe bold blush application...</li>
      <li>It is however WONDERFUL for a final dusting of setting powder, it also works well if you have another sort of finishing powder, or even to apply to your body (something with a big of shimmer maybe along your neck line &amp; arms).</li>
      <li>which I like so much I&#x27;ve thrown away my old MAC brushes which honestly were never worth the money in the first place)... since I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about this company too</li>
      <li>Make-up goes on smoothly and consistently.  </li>
      <li>but I’m just in love with this new Ecotools Kabuki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would definitely buy more makeup brushes from this EcoTools line!</li>
      <li>This brush is an angled Kabuki which makes you think that you may have a little more precision in application (the angled design implying that you could get spot-applications and defining) but this brush is so large that it covers a good portion of my face at a time.</li>
      <li>I have a handful of different types of EcoTools brushes and the face ones are the best, IMO the eye applications are not stiff enough for precise application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The main con of this brush is that you can&#x27;t really have a heavy coverage because of the fluffyness, so it&#x27;s not the best brush to buffer in your skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the angle on the brush too, it actually does help to get it into finer spots, like focusing it right above the eyebrows where I always need a bit more</li>
      <li>The packaging mentions a &amp;#34;reusable eco pouch&amp;#34; made with natural materials and &amp;#34;EVA&amp;#34; and also that it&#x27;s free of PVC and phthalates.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re also easy to clean, and dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is billed as a blush brush, but I don&#x27;t find it suitable for applying blush, simply because the head is much too large.  </li>
      <li>Bristles are super soft, fully attached-no loose hairs-, and the brush itself has a nice weight to it.</li>
      <li>This is a nice, big brush with soft, flexible bristles.  </li>
      <li>I prefer this Ecotools Kabuki because it is much softer, more dense and larger.</li>
      <li>me, at first this brush just seemed too large to use with blush to add contour to my face.</li>
      <li>It works really well for applying mineral and other foundation (and would also produce nice even results applying bronzer or finishing powder to your face or</li>
      <li>Kabuki brush is super soft.</li>
      <li>It’s rather large too which is what I’m looking for in Kabuki brush.</li>
      <li>It applies the blush to too large an area for my liking.</li>
      <li>I think the handle is bamboo, but don&#x27;t know for certain.</li>
      <li>My favorite is the EcoTools Domed Bronzer Brush which I use for loose powder.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re inexpensive, but very high quality.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really see the point of having an angled brush to allow control when the brush is too large for anything but applying all over face powder.  </li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve been using a lot of the Real Techniques brushes also sold here on Amazon...</li>
      <li>really like the EcoTools line of brushes.  </li>
      <li>I just assume the bristles aren&#x27;t made of animal products, but I really don&#x27;t know what they are made of.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, these brushes last a long time, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this EcoTools Kabuki brush as the bristles are super soft, it works well for even application of powder and foundation, it may also work well  for some as a contour brush, it&#x27;s reasonably priced and Eco</li>

      <li>It is high quality, with super soft bristles and no bristle loss to pick off your face.</li>
      <li>This one was a bit bigger than I had expected, bigger than other Kabuki brushes I own, but per EcoTools brushes, it is so incredibly soft (and cruelty free, such a plus), and has a nice handle that makes is easy to grip.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a very subtle blush lately, choosing a bold eye or lip over vivid cheeks, and this brush is perfect for distributing a hint of color over exactly the right</li>

    <li> This is a nice quality brush, but it is very large.  I didn&#x27;t really see the point of having an angled brush to allow control when the brush is too large for anything but applying all over face powder.  But the real issue, for me, is that the bristles are very soft, much softer than the boar bristles on my usual makeup brush.  They feel awesome, but are not all that functional.  When I used it to apply loose powder, it was really too large even for an all-over face application and so soft it seemed that more ended up on my vanity than on my face.  I went back to using my smaller, stiffer boar&#x27;s hair brush.</li>
    <li> Wow, this brush is much nicer than I expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are dense, plush, and super-soft, similar to brushes that are much more expensive. Cruelty-free is a nice feature. The handle is a visually appealing bronze-colored aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is billed as a blush brush, but I don&#x27;t find it suitable for applying blush, simply because the head is much too large.  It applies the blush to too large an area for my liking. However, it&#x27;s great for applying mineral foundation or a dusting of face powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes by EcoTools. The kabuki brush is great: very soft, easy to use to apply product. I gave it four stars just because of it&#x27;s mutant size...this could be used to apply finishing powder to the faces on Mt. Rushmore.</li>
    <li> I’m a bit of makeup junkie so I have quite a few makeup brushes in my arsenal. The Ecotools is a such a great brand. I have a few Ecotools brushes and the quality that you get far exceeds the price. Their quality is up there with some of the much more expensive brands. And as a bonus, Ecotools is earth-friendly with cruelty-free bristles and recycled aluminum ferrule. They also have bamboo handles but since this is a Kabuki brush, you only see and feel the aluminum ferrule in this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kabuki brush is super soft. It’s rather large too which is what I’m looking for in Kabuki brush. This brush is an angled Kabuki which makes you think that you may have a little more precision in application (the angled design implying that you could get spot-applications and defining) but this brush is so large that it covers a good portion of my face at a time. It makes a great brush for final finishing products like setting powder. You could use this, as I did with bronzer and highlighter also but this will give you an all-over dusting and not precision, spot applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love it. It’s actually my favorite that I have. The other that I have and use regular is the ELF Studio Kabuki Face Brush which retails for $6. That brush is not angled. I prefer this Ecotools Kabuki because it is much softer, more dense and larger. The ELF brush is a good one also but I’m just in love with this new Ecotools Kabuki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE fan of EcoTools brushes. My favorite is the EcoTools Domed Bronzer Brush which I use for loose powder. This Kabuki brush has all of the same great traits of that one as a makeup brush with its own characteristics, the angled brush and shorter handle. I still prefer my bronzer brush for my own personal needs but this is an excellent brush if this is the style and angle you need. The bristles are soft and blend powder well. I don&#x27;t need blush since I have rosacea but this brush works well with my red reducer powder from Clinique, the way I need it to work. You can&#x27;t beat these brushes for the quality and price. I searched for years for brushes like this and spent lots of money on other brands that didn&#x27;t perform or feel nearly as nice as these do.</li>
    <li> This is the softest brush I have ever felt.  Ever.  I&#x27;d almost rather keep it as a pet than use it for makeup.  But, it does a good job with the mineral finishing powder I use.</li>
    <li> I love the EcoTools brand, so jumped at the chance to try this brush via the Vine program. It&#x27;s just as great as the other products in the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s extremely sturdy. The bristles are so soft they float over my skin and don&#x27;t irritate. The bristles also don&#x27;t fall out. I&#x27;ve had brushes that start loosing the bristles immediately. The angle makes it easy to evenly coat the skin without splotches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must-have for your make up kit. It&#x27;s great for those with sensitive skin as well.</li>
    <li> Quality brush. Bristles are super soft, fully attached-no loose hairs-, and the brush itself has a nice weight to it. Exceptional quality for the price. A+</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other EcoTools brushes in the past, and as usual, I haven&#x27;t been disappointed with their Angled Kabuki Face Blush brush. This one was a bit bigger than I had expected, bigger than other Kabuki brushes I own, but per EcoTools brushes, it is so incredibly soft (and cruelty free, such a plus), and has a nice handle that makes is easy to grip. The brush is angled, and it&#x27;s wonderful to apply contouring and to blend it in - I use it more for that than for applying blush, but it works wonders because of its softness and angled edge.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, big brush with soft, flexible bristles.  Make-up goes on smoothly and consistently.  I also like how this brush is attractive with the bronze handle and natural-colored bristles.  I keep my brushes in a tray on my bathroom counter, so it’s important to me that they look nice.  Overall, this is a great brush at this price point.</li>
    <li> I already am a fan of kabuki brushes and this one is one of my favorites. It is high quality, with super soft bristles and no bristle loss to pick off your face. I love the angle on the brush too, it actually does help to get it into finer spots, like focusing it right above the eyebrows where I always need a bit more (I was squeezing my old normal Kabuki to do this).  That being said, it has one flaw... Its too big.  I feel like there is less control and too much spread on the brush.  I would have  given it a glowing five stars if they had made it a tad bit smaller, then it would have been the ideal brush.</li>
    <li> I first became aware of EcoTools when a very smart and savvy teen showed me some that she had gotten at a local discount beauty chain.&lt;br /&gt;After trying this, everything she claimed is true...brush holds powders well, minimal shedding, and best of all, about as eco-friendly as a brush can get.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike a classic Kabuki brush, this one is slanted as opposed to blunt. It lets you apply blush with a more contoured approach.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m big into contour makeup to slim down my round face, this one does the job beautifully.</li>
    <li> This is the second Kabuki brush from Eco Tools that I&#x27;ve used. This brush is different from the first one I used in that the bristles are angled. I found that this brush picks up loose powder quite well. It evenly disburses the powder. The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t irritate my skin when applying makeup. I liked the angle of the bristles. This brush works well for both blush and face powder when setting foundation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this EcoTools brush, it&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve tried (I&#x27;ve been using a lot of the Real Techniques brushes also sold here on Amazon... which I like so much I&#x27;ve thrown away my old MAC brushes which honestly were never worth the money in the first place)... since I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about this company too I figure I&#x27;d try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing to note is that I was a bit surprised when this brush arrived, the description mentions precise makeup application several times so I thought I was getting a brush I could use for contouring or maybe bold blush application... while I love this brush it wouldn&#x27;t work for either. This particular brush is really really big... there is no way you&#x27;re doing anything precise with it in my opinion. It&#x27;s also VERY soft... it feels heavenly on your face, but again it&#x27;s much too soft IMO for any contouring or blush (even if you could manage to not apply it to your entire face with this, yes it&#x27;s that big). It is however WONDERFUL for a final dusting of setting powder, it also works well if you have another sort of finishing powder, or even to apply to your body (something with a big of shimmer maybe along your neck line &amp; arms). I&#x27;m looking forward to trying out more of these brushes!</li>
    <li> Good, soft brush for makeup application. Eliminates the need to blend blush at the edges, which is a time-saver, or can be used to apply face powder under blush instead of powder puff. Nice and soft, a pleasure to use. The bristles are made of Taklon, a synthetic fiber which is commonly used in artist&#x27;s brushes.</li>
    <li> This EcoTools Kabuki brush is larger than the more expensive Bare Escentuals Kabuki brush I own and is angled rather than forming a higher rounded middle like the shape of my other Kabuki brush. The EcoTools brush works well with mineral foundation and also with my Lancome Dual Finish foundation as it results in nice even coverage. I&#x27;m not sure that having the brush angled made a difference but the brush provides me with an even smooth finish. It works really well for applying mineral and other foundation (and would also produce nice even results applying bronzer or finishing powder to your face or even chest area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, at first this brush just seemed too large to use with blush to add contour to my face. After time to practice, however, I&#x27;m finding I can use it for that purpose after all by compressing it with my fingers to make the angled side more dense and running it over my blush and then applying it lightly under my cheekbones, top of my forehead, etc. Whether it suits one for that purpose is personal and depends on how and where you apply your blush and your skill at makeup application. It may not be a good blush contour brush for everyone (it wasn&#x27;t for me at first), but at a minimum it&#x27;s a nice brush for evenly applying foundation, powder or bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very soft, and I love the concept of anything &amp;#34;Eco&amp;#34; friendly. I do find the &amp;#34;Eco&amp;#34; description kind of vague. I can&#x27;t tell what the bristles are made of but the packaging says the product is animal cruelty free and contaims bamboo and recycled materials. I just assume the bristles aren&#x27;t made of animal products, but I really don&#x27;t know what they are made of. I think the handle is bamboo, but don&#x27;t know for certain. The packaging mentions a &amp;#34;reusable eco pouch&amp;#34; made with natural materials and &amp;#34;EVA&amp;#34; and also that it&#x27;s free of PVC and phthalates. I can&#x27;t tell whether it&#x27;s referring to the packaging or a storage pouch that my unit is missing. (I do have a different EcoTools brush that did indeed come with a reusable pouch.)  I highly recommend this EcoTools Kabuki brush as the bristles are super soft, it works well for even application of powder and foundation, it may also work well  for some as a contour brush, it&#x27;s reasonably priced and Eco friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/6/2016: I&#x27;m updating to give this brush 5 stars (originally rated 4 stars) as it&#x27;s my brush I use everyday single day whether for blush or powder. Plus, it still isn&#x27;t shedding any bristles and is holding up perfectly. It&#x27;s really an excellent multipurpose makeup brush that I highly recommend.(I do have a different EcoTools brush that did indeed come with a reusable pouch.)

    <li> I rated EcoTools angled kabuki face brush 5 stars because of its softness. I have a handful of different types of EcoTools brushes and the face ones are the best, IMO the eye applications are not stiff enough for precise application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this kabuki brush, it is fluffy but not too fluffy or to be oversized, the angle brush helps with better splice tin than the normal face powder version that I purchased before. The main con of this brush is that you can&#x27;t really have a heavy coverage because of the fluffyness, so it&#x27;s not the best brush to buffer in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these brushes last a long time, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality. If you want a light application using your favorite pressed or loose face powder, than this is a great brush to use! I&#x27;ve been cleaning mine weekly using rubbing alcohol poured onto a napkin and wiping the brush against it, until it wipes cleans and there is no makeup residue left on the brush.</li>
    <li> The bristles are very soft and it feels great on our screen. This is perfect for those with sensitive skin. The bristles are soft and they do not rough up you skin. It makes application very easy and even. I use it for powder and love the even effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging mentioned a reusable eco pouch but I saw none included. Was it the packaging?</li>
    <li> I own another Kabuki brush that I really like so I was happy to get a chance to try this EcoTools brand angled brush. I use it to apply my blush and bronzer. I like the way it feels in my hand and the brush bristles are nice and soft on my skin. I would definitely buy more makeup brushes from this EcoTools line!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan both of EcoTools brushes and of angled blush brushes.  This brush is a wonderful addition to a purse makeup bag because of its compact size, or to use as a primary blush brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you&#x27;ve used an angled brush to apply blush, no other shape is satisfactory.  I love the size of this one; you can apply the perfect amount of color in one sweep.  I&#x27;ve been using a very subtle blush lately, choosing a bold eye or lip over vivid cheeks, and this brush is perfect for distributing a hint of color over exactly the right area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would also make a great contouring brush with a darker powder for just under the cheekbones, along the jawline, or anywhere else a bit of shadow is needed.  I wouldn&#x27;t highlight with it;it&#x27;s too broad, but it&#x27;s perfect for contouring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the EcoTools line of brushes.  They&#x27;re inexpensive, but very high quality.  Yes, I got this one for free, but I&#x27;ve also purchased many of these brushes.  They&#x27;re great makep brushes; they don&#x27;t leave stray bristles all over your face, they&#x27;re really soft, and they grab a lot of product.  They&#x27;re also easy to clean, and dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried an angle brush for applying blush, you should; and you could do a whole lot worse than starting with this one.</li>
