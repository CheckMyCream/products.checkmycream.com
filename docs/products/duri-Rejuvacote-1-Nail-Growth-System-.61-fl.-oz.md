<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> really great stuff to strenthen your nails.</li>
    <li> I like the product very much. About 1/2 way through the bottle it gets kind of thick. It&#x27;s just a little pricey</li>
    <li> Excellent for troubled nails. If it works for my nails, it will work for anyone&#x27;s. Give it a few weeks n you will see a wonderful difference but don&#x27;t EVER run out and use it exactly as the directions state.</li>
    <li> If You Follow The Directions You&#x27;ll Get Great Results</li>
    <li> Great stuff,it works!</li>
    <li> Love it,use it everyday!</li>
    <li> A good buy. I usually buy sets of 3 but extra $ is tighter around holidays...hence, set of 2. It&#x27;s a slightly less cost effective deal but is still a good buy. A good buying experience too. I lovelovelove duri rejuvacote!!!  It&#x27;s saved my nails. From Feb 2014 when I started using rejuvacote til now (1-12-15) my nails are insanely better. They&#x27;re all almost (or at) an inch long and they&#x27;re strong and clean and look great. Acrylics had ruined them for good...or so I&#x27;d thought. Duri rejuvacote has changed me from a fake nails always type of girl to a natural nails with fab polish and designs type of girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bottle used as directed lasts 1-3 months depending in nail length and reaplication of top coats. So I&#x27;d buy the double or triple pack and save some cents. It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps...those who feel the \\&quot;burn\\&quot; are either very sensitive (skin or nails sensitive) Or probably forgot to wash their hands after removing old polish and prior to applying the rejuvacote base coat...if you don&#x27;t wash first,.it seems to react with the acetone residue somehow, and you can feel that burn. Otherwise, this product is perfect.</li>
    <li> I have tried to grow my nails all my life and spent hundreds of dollars over the years on useless products with big brand names.  I began using this product about 3 months ago.  I can not believe how long my nails are and the polish stays on for at least a week if not more.  I will never stop using this product.  I can&#x27;t stop staring at my nails.  I can&#x27;t believe they are so long I need to trim them from time to time.  For the first time I am continually getting compliment on my nails.  What a great feeling. Give it a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> works as good as it gets!!!</li>
    <li> I am a faithful user. I had peeling nails and this product has eliminated the problem. I also cannot wear nail polish on my job but this is acceptable and gives nails a nice shine.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I use this on our soft, brittle nails and they come to life! This helps our nails to grow and to grow strong and hard!</li>
    <li> Duri is ,my best and favorite topcoat for maintaining and building up weak nails. My nails are so strong now they don&#x27;t and won&#x27;t bend unless they get really too long.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  You have to commit and follow the directions and use it for several weeks. But if you stay with it.  It works!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST NAIL GROWTH POLISH I EVER USED!!!!! It does just what it says it does and my nails are so strong with continued use, and it makes any manicure look even better. I love this product very much and it is in my must have basket.</li>
    <li> awesome nail growth polish!</li>
    <li> This is the only way I can grow any length to my nailed at all.  Do have to use everyday at first though.  After they grow out  then 3-4 times a week keeps them reasonably strong.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this polish. It is the only polish at help my nails. I now have long beautiful  strong nails.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Use as base and top coat.  Keeps nails strong and polish on longer.  Can&#x27;t do without it</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish!</li>
    <li> I love this item, I have been using it for close to two years now and I can honestly tell you that I cannot be with out it. my nails are gorgeous. awesome treatment... (sorry don&#x27;t mind the bedding that I was touching) first pic touching bedding was taken back in 2014 and the glitter nail polish picture was taken on 6/18/2015.</li>
    <li> I polish my nails every Sunday afternoon or evening.  First I clean my nails with polish remover and then I used my nail brush and&lt;br /&gt;wash my hands and nails with a good soap.  Make sure you rinse really good and dry very good with a hand towel.  I use the hand towel to push back my cuticles as I dry the nails.  Next I put on a coat of Duri Rejuvacote System Rejuvenate,  Let it dry completely then I apply two coats of the polish of my choice.  When the polish is dry, I apply another coat of Duri Rejuvacote and let it dry.  If the edges at the tip of the nails wear off from doing dishes, etc., during the week.  I  just  put a coat of the color on the white nail showing.  My manicure lasts until the next Sunday and I start all over again.  I use OPI foolish, never anything but.&lt;br /&gt;I receive compliments on my nails daily, they are beautiful, very strong,  This procedure put a stop to chipping and breaking nails.&lt;br /&gt;I never have to worry about them chipping or breaking....only when I do something stupid like using a nail for a screw driver!</li>
    <li> This is the best base coat for your nail health and welfare!! Try it.&lt;br /&gt;Even your manicurist would appreciate your using it.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine has amazing nails, good length and very healthy looking. When I asked her what was her secret she recommended this for me to try. I have natural nails and until now unable to keep them strong. This works like magic! Keeps your nails strong, dry very quickly... I use it every time I go to the nail salon.</li>
    <li> The product itself is amazing. My nails no longer chip or crack and when I remove the polish, my natural nail has a nice sheen. Unfortunately, I let the product run low, so I quickly placed an order because the price was great and the shipping was free. That was five days ago. I watched this small package sit in two different drop off locations for five days. I would rather pay the shipping and have the product quicker because the date of delivery is yet another SIX days. No excuse. I will contact the retailer for reorders from now on so that I&#x27;m aware of the delivery time.</li>
    <li> I have used it in the past and it really does work, be sure and use every day for best results.</li>
    <li> I really like this polish, so I ordered two bottles . I was upset to find one of the bottles was only half full. It had leaked into the box. I had to peel the box away from the bottle to get the bottle out, only to see it half gone.</li>
    <li> Have told everyone about this because it works!  I have had terrible nails for years, but after using Rejuvacote, my nails are not only long, they are very strong</li>
    <li> After a harsh winter of playing outside, my nails were in pretty bad shape - splitting and breaking.  I swear that this product helped nourish my nails back in shape.  They&#x27;re now long and polished with a base coat of rejuvecote.  I&#x27;ll never go without it.  It&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
    <li> It seems to be working well.  It has a tough surface to help protect my nail from breakage or splitting.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for natural nails that are soft or peeling.  The product strengthens nails and encourages growth.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for some yrs. now. It really does work for growth of my nails, if I can remember to use it as often as it says.</li>
    <li> The greatest chemicals I have ever put on my nails.  I use it under and over my polish.  Then I put it on about 3 times a week on top of my polish.  Has helped my nails get much stronger.  I have given it as gifts and recommended it to several ladies.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail growth system I have ever found.</li>
    <li> Excellent….  I always order 2 and share with my cousin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that helps strengthen brittle and peeling nails. To use as directed, you&#x27;d have to keep applying a daily coat for a week, then remove and start over. I initially got a bottle from a friend to try but since then I&#x27;ve been buying this product constantly and all the women in my family were gifted with bottles for personal use. It works wonders at making nails stronger and healthier.</li>
    <li> It the best! During winter my nails always chiping and peeling. Never grew long. I tried almost everything. But didn&#x27;t work. Until i saw this from amazon. I read some of the reviews. Trust me review don&#x27;t lie. I gave it a try and that was a good try. It work! This is my second order which is my third bottles. I will definitely recommend it to all my friends. And next time I will see if possible for me to put before and after picture.</li>
    <li> use as a base and a top coat, top shiny and not bubbly top coat. worth it.</li>
    <li> This nail Polish is number one for me. I have tried other products to make my nails grow faster after I used this one but I came right back to rejuvacoat. My nails grow so much faster when I apply this polish it&#x27;s amazing. Also, my nails are very hard now, I even have a hard time cutting them because how strong it is. It&#x27;s simply amazing!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It was wonderful.  My nails are much more healthier and longer.</li>
    <li> Love love, love! As long as you use this consistently your nails will grow!</li>
    <li> If you have problems with your nails, this is the only product that&lt;br /&gt;really works.</li>
    <li> I tell everyone about this product. After faithfully using this product as they direct you and continuing with it my nails look better than and are stronger than acrylics. Everyone asks about my nails. This product is worth every penny. I still use it as a base coat.</li>
    <li> This polish definitely made my nails stronger.  I am 78 years old and have never had strong nails - and I have used a lot of stuff through the years and nothing worked.  I now have nails I don&#x27;t have to apologize for.  I have recommended it to many of my friends who also have weak nails and several have ordered it from Amazon.  A friend referred me to it.</li>
    <li> This polish works I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else for my nails.</li>
    <li> I use this as a bottom and top coat... Have been using it for about 6-7 years now. Really keeps my nails super strong</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. My nails were always breaking and splitting. Not any more.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great Service!</li>
    <li> Really helped my nails.</li>
    <li> The best product for soft and thin nails.  I&#x27;m now on a regiment of applying 2 to 3 coats per week.  Wonderful product.... kudos to whoever developed this product!</li>
    <li> Purchased for both my daughter and myself.  I had no irritation or burning with it but it peeled off quickly - you&#x27;re supposed to build up a coating everyday.  My daughter had severe pain in her nail beds after applying it - I had to quickly get it off her with polish remover.  My mother and sister had great results from it.  So I doubt this review is very helpful at all. It may work great for you or you&#x27;ll wind up tossing it in the trash.</li>
    <li> Was advised by my dermatologist&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;I like it very much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for just over a year, and after 20 something years of continuous nail biting, I FINALLY have nails and I love it!! Yes my nails still break every now and then but this stuff has made my nails strong and the longest they&#x27;ve ever been. I would highly reccomend using rejuvecote. Just make sure you follow the directions exactly for the first few months</li>
    <li> Corrected my order in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> I love duri it really works. My nails are a lot stronger and they grow so fast :)</li>
    <li> My nail were so bad. They would split. tear, crack and never grew.  Now I have great nails.  Hard and strong.  I am also allergic to many product and could not use them.  Duri growth formula has not given me any problems.  I have recommended it to all my friends with bad nails.  I look at my nails and am so pleased.  I have never had good nails. It took about 6 months to really be strong but it is worth the time.</li>
    <li> My manicurist recommended this and it is great stuff. Not 100% sure it is improving my nails overall, but it definitley makes my polish last and look shiny.</li>
    <li> works better then I ever anticipated</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least 5 years and I have had fantastic results. I have recomended it to my friends and they have also achieved long nails</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t bother spending the time or money on this product.  No results found with its use.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting the &#x27;package of two&#x27; to have only one Rejuvacote.  Instead of the two rejuvacotes I expected, it had one and one Brush On.  I have used this before and it is a great product.  When used as directed, it will absolutely harden your nails.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Have been using it for a few years. Has a great hi-gloss and really makes my nails look great.</li>
    <li> Makes my nails real strong.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have spent the last 15 years with split cracked and breaking nails. I tried product from the nail salon and it helped some but did not solve the problem. I have used this product and wow...nails!</li>
    <li> This product is great for anyone who wants to improve their nail length and strength.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> Now girls if you beautiful nice long nail (please) use this it really ,really ,really works just follow the instructions that come along with it but along with take hair,nails,skin vitamins along with using the polish trust me u will be amaze on how your nails will fill and grow ..This is my second time ordering this and yes I will order it again .This is one polish I will keep on my shelf .</li>
    <li> Best nail growth product and strengthener I&#x27;ve tried. And this is the only one that I&#x27;ve tried that also actually works! Make sure you try it on one nail as a test first before trying this product for the first time. It turned my mom&#x27;s nails yellow and I&#x27;ve read that it has done that to others&#x27; nails as well. We can&#x27;t figure out why it doesn&#x27;t do that to mine.</li>
    <li> WELL DESERVED 5 STARS! I&#x27;ve tried MANY products to lengthen and strengthen my nails, but this has been the best product so far. Adding a new top coat every day might seem tedious, but polish is faster at drying that advertised. Even when my nails are polish free, they are obviously stronger and longer. I will be stockpiling this product. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> Works great for my wife and daughter</li>
    <li> This stuff really does work to strengthen nails. How, I am not sure - but it;s highly recommended. OK? Why so many required words???</li>
    <li> Been using this for 2 weeks and my nails are growing, and are harder....seems like it&#x27;s working, keeping my fingers crossed.  My sister in laws are beautiful with this product but she has been using it for over a month.</li>
    <li> The only product that makes my nails grow consistently, and bonus: it is shiny enough to wear as a top coat too. But beware that if you put too many coats on, you nails will burn so two max</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a while and I love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for those who suffer with nails that split crack and peel.&lt;br /&gt;It will help you grow nails beyond your expectations.  I am extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the past week and a half and let me tell you it does work and quick!  But tonight when I put it on it started burning really bad on 3 of my nails. Idk why this happened and especially after that long of using it. I haven&#x27;t had no problems until tonight while putting it on. But all in all it is a wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> This is the best base coat you can find.  It truly helps your nails to grow</li>
    <li> Only product that I have found to actually keep my nails from splitting, tearing, breaking, etc.  After using this for awhile (a friends recommendation) I finally have long  nails &amp; have to cut them!!</li>
    <li> Best nail growth system I have ever used.</li>
    <li> The Polish seems weaker than the one I got through the Salon.  I haven&#x27;t gotten my nails&lt;br /&gt;to stop breaking as of two weeks,  putting it&lt;br /&gt;on twice a day.</li>
    <li> works great making nails strong.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for several years &amp; still find it&#x27;s the best nail growth system out there!</li>
    <li> Nothing works better than this formula.  I love it and highly reccomend it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Delivery was on time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least five years. It was recommended to me by my manicurist when I decided to stop using acrylic on my nails. I put a light coat on every day while the were growing out and I believe that it really made a difference.  I now use it for both a base coat and a top coat. If my nails are chipped or cracked I go back to the old regime of putting on a daily coat.  I think this is a great product and fairly priced.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best product  for nails that I have ever used. My nails are longer and stronger than they have ever been.  I recommend this product to all my friends and they love it too.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is the only product that has helped to make my nails so strong and &amp;#34;un-peeling&amp;#34;.......</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and happy with the produt</li>
    <li> I have been using this polish for about one month.  So far, I have not seen any significant changes.  My nails are&lt;br /&gt;still brittle and break easily.</li>
