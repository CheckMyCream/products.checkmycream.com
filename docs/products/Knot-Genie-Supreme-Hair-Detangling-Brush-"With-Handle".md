### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This brush is perfect</li>
      <li>I think it works best when you start from the botton of your hair and work your way up.</li>
      <li>Best brush I&#x27;ve ever used on my kids!!</li>
      <li>Great idea</li>
      <li>It works great on all four of my daughters hair.</li>
      <li>Fantastic for getting thru her hair without tears!!!</li>
      <li>Love the handled version!</li>
      <li>and now she even brushes her own hair.</li>
      <li>I had the original Knot Genie brush and thought it was great.  </li>
      <li>I have combs with curved tines that I think do a better job than this brush.</li>
      <li>I bought this on a whim and am going to buy more as backup because this brush is a LIFE SAVER.</li>
      <li>I will continue to look out for a better product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand how it got so many 5 star reviews when it won&#x27;t even brush the hair.</li>
      <li>and I love it for myself, too.  </li>
      <li>My daughter has very fine hair but tons of it, and it can get easily matted.</li>
      <li>I got to say when i opened the box and saw it and felt the bristles on it i thought for sure i would be returning it because it felt so cheap</li>
      <li>but that is fine with me since she doesn&#x27;t cry anymore</li>
      <li>Every brush stroke comes with the sound of a piece of plactice bouncing around inside of the brush.</li>
      <li>I tried this brush on my super tangled hair after not washing it for a few weeks after having surgery and it worked great!</li>
      <li>My daughter said she would rather we use or original brush.</li>
      <li>Not so special.</li>
      <li>Was really expecting more.</li>
      <li>I have found that most of the girls tangles aren&#x27;t really at the scalp - and because the brush does such a great job gently getting tangles out</li>
      <li>This brush does amazingly quick work making her look presentable.  </li>
      <li>I washed my hair first and used it on my wet hair and it worked great.  </li>
      <li>brush is very plastic-y and is too light weight for me.</li>
      <li>They frequently get knots and tangles and this brush eliminates most of the tears.</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t put out as much hair as the normal brushes which is nice, now for this brush though i have to brush a little more and have to go from underneath too</li>
      <li>Not only does it get all the knots out in 5 minutes, but it also doesn&#x27;t rip out huge amounts of hair!</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t work more efficiently or faster than using a regular brush.</li>
      <li>The oldest is a swimmer and her hair is long and a disaster most of the time.  </li>
      <li>but as you can imagine it gets very tangled.</li>
      <li>This brush worked so well, so fast, and was so gentle.</li>
      <li>I expected a near magic performance and find it is just a bit better than any other brush I have tried for combing hair to remove tangles.</li>
      <li>But I really like the handle on this new brush.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even have to hold the hair tight up top while brushing the ends or anything.</li>
      <li>her hair was dry and a mess, I thought for sure this will be the test, sure enough not one scream or tear didn&#x27;t even have to use leave in conditioner or anything.</li>
      <li>My 11 month old has REALLY a curly hair</li>
      <li>; for the little bit of plastic that looks no different than the girls barbie brushes.... but trust me - it IS amazing - and give it a chance</li>
      <li>Especially when she first wakes up.</li>
      <li>Way better than the non handle ones which are hard to grip and</li>
      <li>I have VERY thick Middle Eastern hair and spend so much money on hair products because my hair knots and dreads on its own.</li>
      <li>it does QUICKLY without pulling out (the very minimal) hair</li>
      <li>WOW this brush works.</li>
      <li>Amazing brush for those 4 year olds with curly hair who hate having it brushed but love &amp;#34;Tangled&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I even use it on my own thick hair and it works wonders!!</li>
      <li>I actually read the rave reviews out this brush before purchasing it to use on my 3 year old who hates to brush her hair.</li>
      <li>My 4 year old has long down to her butt hair, VERY think and</li>
      <li>My expectations were high so probably my own fault that I was disappointed.  </li>

<li> works wonders in taming my daughter&#x27;s (long) hair!</li>
<li> The middle had curly hair a toddler but has since just turned to wild thick hair.  </li>
<li> It states for all hair types but we have thick hair and the bristles are so flimsy that they don&#x27;t actually brush the hair so it definitely isn&#x27;t detangling anything if the bristles won&#x27;t even go into the hair properly.</li>
<li> and finally my husband can brush her hair also, going to go buy one now without a handle to keep in the car for brushing both mine and her hair after driving with the windows down and things like that.</li>
<li> Each little bristle gently works on the tangles vs just yanking out the hair - we hardly ever have hair in the brush now.  </li>
<li> It is hollow and has a rattle I did not expect.</li>
<li> My youngest has stick straight thin &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; hair... while this brush does nothing to keep her flyaway hair tamed</li>
<li> curly it is always a chore to brush her hair without making her cry and even harder for my husband he hates doing it.</li>
<li> This brush made me think I just spent &amp;</li>
<li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t read details and this is expected?</li>
<li> and no way it would hold up to brush my daughters thick hair because the bristles are so soft and flexible but its been 4 days for very hard brushing and tons of knots and still looks new and all bristles still there.</li>
<li> the black comb piece has yet to fall off like my other 2 with no handle.</li>
<li> but was not worth my investment to give it a try.</li>
<li> I feel combs provide less breakage than this brush.</li>
<li> But this is a waste of plastic!</li>
<li> we hardly ever have to &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34;</li>
<li> While yes the bristles look like they can&#x27;t handle thick hair - they can.  </li>
<li> and the sides because her hair is so thick and can&#x27;t get through it all just from the front side</li>
<li> I seriously recommend it.</li>
<li> , so I admit mine may have just been one that was poorly produced.</li>
<li> She can be difficult when brushing</li>
<li> I find the noise very annoying.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love the handled version! It works great on all four of my daughters hair. They frequently get knots and tangles and this brush eliminates most of the tears.</li>
    <li> I had the original Knot Genie brush and thought it was great.  My granddaughters don&#x27;t mind when I want to brush their hair and I love it for myself, too.  But I really like the handle on this new brush. It has the same no tangle effect on my hair but the handle makes it easier to work with.</li>
    <li> I have VERY thick Middle Eastern hair and spend so much money on hair products because my hair knots and dreads on its own. Now that my hair is almost at my hips, just brushing it can take an hour. I bought this on a whim and am going to buy more as backup because this brush is a LIFE SAVER. Not only does it get all the knots out in 5 minutes, but it also doesn&#x27;t rip out huge amounts of hair! I seriously recommend it.</li>
    <li> WOW this brush works. I can&#x27;t believe it did. My 4 year old has long down to her butt hair, VERY think and curly it is always a chore to brush her hair without making her cry and even harder for my husband he hates doing it. This brush is perfect I don&#x27;t even have to hold the hair tight up top while brushing the ends or anything. I just go at it with the brush and not one tear. I have brushed her hair even after going swimming and going driving with the windows open and by the time i got home her hair was dry and a mess, I thought for sure this will be the test, sure enough not one scream or tear didn&#x27;t even have to use leave in conditioner or anything. I got to say when i opened the box and saw it and felt the bristles on it i thought for sure i would be returning it because it felt so cheap and no way it would hold up to brush my daughters thick hair because the bristles are so soft and flexible but its been 4 days for very hard brushing and tons of knots and still looks new and all bristles still there. I also like that there is no knobs at the end of the tips so it doesn&#x27;t put out as much hair as the normal brushes which is nice, now for this brush though i have to brush a little more and have to go from underneath too and the sides because her hair is so thick and can&#x27;t get through it all just from the front side but that is fine with me since she doesn&#x27;t cry anymore and finally my husband can brush her hair also, going to go buy one now without a handle to keep in the car for brushing both mine and her hair after driving with the windows down and things like that.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I read about it in a financial magazine - odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brush is very plastic-y and is too light weight for me. It is hollow and has a rattle I did not expect. Every brush stroke comes with the sound of a piece of plactice bouncing around inside of the brush. Maybe I didn&#x27;t read details and this is expected? I find the noise very annoying. I have combs with curved tines that I think do a better job than this brush. I expected a near magic performance and find it is just a bit better than any other brush I have tried for combing hair to remove tangles. I am back to combing for now. I feel combs provide less breakage than this brush. Great idea but was not worth my investment to give it a try. I will continue to look out for a better product. I did not try to exchange or return it b/c of the rattle, so I admit mine may have just been one that was poorly produced.</li>
    <li> I tried this brush on my super tangled hair after not washing it for a few weeks after having surgery and it worked great! I washed my hair first and used it on my wet hair and it worked great.  I think it works best when you start from the botton of your hair and work your way up.</li>
    <li> Way better than the non handle ones which are hard to grip and the black comb piece has yet to fall off like my other 2 with no handle.</li>
    <li> Scratchy and toddler still upset when I brush her hair. Not so special.</li>
    <li> It was easier to use with the handle.</li>
    <li> Our dog loves being brushed with this brush</li>
    <li> My expectations were high so probably my own fault that I was disappointed.  Bought for my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush for those 4 year olds with curly hair who hate having it brushed but love &amp;#34;Tangled&amp;#34;. I just told my daughter this was Rapunzel&#x27;s brush and now she even brushes her own hair.</li>
    <li> works wonders in taming my daughter&#x27;s (long) hair! She does not fear hair combing with this brush!</li>
    <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever used on my kids!!</li>
    <li> I have 3 girls, all with different hair types.  The oldest is a swimmer and her hair is long and a disaster most of the time.  This brush does amazingly quick work making her look presentable.  The middle had curly hair a toddler but has since just turned to wild thick hair.  She is the reason I bought this brush.  While yes the bristles look like they can&#x27;t handle thick hair - they can.  The point (I believe) of the multiple tiny flexible bristles is to NOT yank out their hair.  Each little bristle gently works on the tangles vs just yanking out the hair - we hardly ever have hair in the brush now.  My youngest has stick straight thin &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; hair... while this brush does nothing to keep her flyaway hair tamed it does QUICKLY without pulling out (the very minimal) hair she has get the tangles out so she can run off in seconds vs, minutes of brushing.  This brush made me think I just spent &amp;#34;how much?&amp;#34; for the little bit of plastic that looks no different than the girls barbie brushes.... but trust me - it IS amazing - and give it a chance and it will get the tangles out...Oh and about the bristles scratchy feeling on the scalp... I have found that most of the girls tangles aren&#x27;t really at the scalp - and because the brush does such a great job gently getting tangles out we hardly ever have to &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; their scalp... we have just adjusted our brushing technique to limit the amount og pressure at the scalp - and I think the girls just said something in the begining because it was a different feeling.</li>
    <li> Was really expecting more. The brush doesn&#x27;t seem sturdy. It also doesn&#x27;t work more efficiently or faster than using a regular brush. My daughter said she would rather we use or original brush.</li>
    <li> My 11 month old has REALLY a curly hair but as you can imagine it gets very tangled. Especially when she first wakes up. This brush worked so well, so fast, and was so gentle. I wish I had bought it sooner!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic for getting thru her hair without tears!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter swear buy this brush!</li>
    <li> I actually read the rave reviews out this brush before purchasing it to use on my 3 year old who hates to brush her hair. But this is a waste of plastic! It states for all hair types but we have thick hair and the bristles are so flimsy that they don&#x27;t actually brush the hair so it definitely isn&#x27;t detangling anything if the bristles won&#x27;t even go into the hair properly. I don&#x27;t understand how it got so many 5 star reviews when it won&#x27;t even brush the hair.</li>
    <li> This has been a life saver! My daughter has very fine hair but tons of it, and it can get easily matted. She can be difficult when brushing but she didn&#x27;t complain one bit with the Knot Genie! I even use it on my own thick hair and it works wonders!!</li>
