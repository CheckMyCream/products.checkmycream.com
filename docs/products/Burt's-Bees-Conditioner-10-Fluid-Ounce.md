      <li>Not as satisfying.</li>
      <li>and I fell in love.</li>
      <li>but this smell is not as appealing as others.</li>
      <li>Could not ask for more.</li>
      <li>Seems like I could have gotten it for a better price at the drug store.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoos and conditioners for over 3 years and love them.  </li>
      <li>it was okay.  </li>
      <li>I bought it because I was looking for a conditioner with fewer chemicals in it, but if anything my hair looks better than before.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner really isn&#x27;t the best for that purpose - saving $3 (vs. one that I like much better) wasn&#x27;t worth it for a product that doesn&#x27;t fulfill my needs.</li>
      <li>They love it</li>
      <li>I love using the mango conditioner-</li>
      <li>it leaves my hair feeling light and healthy, and so easy to brush!  </li>
      <li>His hair has done a BEAUTIFUL 180 and is so soft, shiny and smooth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very rare that I find a hair product that I have to rave about, but I absolutely LOVE this stuff.</li>
      <li>I got this because my hair dresser said I should be using a sulfate free conditioner.  </li>
      <li>i use several items from this company and happy with every one of them.</li>
      <li>This product is sulfate and paraben free.</li>
      <li>This product makes your hair smell good, shine and has no harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something natural for my conditioner and have always loved Burts Bees products.</li>
      <li>This product has a nice clean scent that my whole family enjoys.  </li>
      <li>Worked really well, just a very strong smell to the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to try this Shampoo/Conditioner combo.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s so pure.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a tangy scent rather than a sweet one.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of the conditioner so much.  </li>
      <li>When smelling it out of the bottle, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>I combine Super Shiny with Very Volumizing conditioner/shampoos to get a better result.  </li>
      <li>It does not hydrate, just got out the shower and almost used an entire bottle to try and detangle hair, finally give up and had to use a conditioner with not so good stuff in it for the moisture!!!</li>
      <li>I am a mild Burt&#x27;s Bees fan.</li>
      <li>I love that the products are over 97-99% natural and paraben free.</li>
      <li>i loved the smell and the fact that it is natural but pantene repair and restore actually does better</li>
      <li>It works, but I&#x27;m not mad about it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m only giving it a 4 star review, because it&#x27;s not all that amazing, but it does the job.</li>
      <li>I completely trust the company when it comes to safe products, and would recommend anything they sell.</li>
      <li>It calms her hair and leaves it smelling amazingly fresh and shiny.</li>
      <li>My neice wanted to try some more of a natural hair care product, so I ordered this and the conditioner for her.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite natural conditioner.</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
      <li>it smells like fresh fruit.</li>
      <li>All in all, nice smell, did the job, no big complaints.</li>
      <li>I did not find this conditioner to be that much better than most of the other kinds you can get off the shelf at the store.</li>
      <li>helps strike the right balance.  </li>
      <li>Smells good but doesn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything for my dry hair.  </li>
      <li>It smells great too and it is a better value than expensive salon brands.</li>
      <li>It smells good but leaves your hair feeling very course and not very shiny if you have salt and pepper hair.</li>
      <li>I already have a shampoo that I love, but was not crazy about my current conditioner, so I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.</li>
      <li>My hair felt kind of dry and not at all conditioned after using it.</li>
      <li>Using either the Super Shiny condtioner or shampoo with the Very Volumizing shampoo or Conditioner...</li>
      <li>if I shampoo with Super Shiny, I condition with Very Volumizing and Vice Versa...</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s the first thing i&#x27;m going to say.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My daughter has long curly and we needed something to tame its craziness. This product teamed with the shampoo does the trick. It calms her hair and leaves it smelling amazingly fresh and shiny. My daughter is happy because she gets to keep growing out here &amp;#34;Rapunzel&amp;#34; hair and she loves the way it leaves her hair smelling too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has hair to her waist. This conditioner made her hair soft and silky without weighing it down. The all natural and cruelty free label got us to buy it. Now that we have used it, it&#x27;s high quality ingredients and benefits will keep us using this brand.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Sulfate free is a huge plus for natural hair ladies following the Curly Girl (CG) method. I use this conditioner in partnership with the more expensive, zero alcohol-based Shea Moisture conditioners. I start with a bit of Shea Moisture, then load up on this conditioner to create better slip for detangling. Great price for a filler!</li>
    <li> Awful! Didn&#x27;t condition my hair at all!</li>
    <li> It smells good but leaves your hair feeling very course and not very shiny if you have salt and pepper hair.</li>
    <li> I got this because my hair dresser said I should be using a sulfate free conditioner.  I loved the smell but I found that the product just doesn&#x27;t rinse well and leaves my hair feeling heavy.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I use this. He uses it on his beard. We have very sensitive skin and this does well for us. It keeps our hair shiny and soft but not matted down with product. It smells great too and it is a better value than expensive salon brands.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s o.k. but I found it to be quite heavy on my hair.</li>
    <li> The scent is very heavy and unpleasant - in my opinion. I feel as though I am smelling a bottle of Flin Stone vitamins. My hub said its more like fruit loops. I LOVE BB shampoo/conditioner but this smell is not as appealing as others. MY fav is the boabab scent (very natural, and neutral) but I like to try new things - so just a sided note to those of you who also like the products but do not yet know this scent.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly.  Tried product and like it so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now, ever since I started breaking out in hives from other shampoos/conditioners, and I love it. A lot of the other, similar products that I&#x27;ve tried either smell horrible, completely dry out my hair, or cost a fortune. These are the complete opposite of each of those. Like many of the other reviewers, I did initially notice my hair feeling not greasy, but like it had oil on it, but I think my scalp adjusted to it, because it seemed to go away after a week or two of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I definitely recommend this product, I don&#x27;t recommend ordering it from Amazon. I decided to try ordering it from them for once for convenience, but the packaging it came in was horrible, making a huge gooey mess for me to clean up upon arrival. Definitely the last time I&#x27;ll be doing that.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance, makes hair glow.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite natural conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t soften as well as other organic brands. I prefer yes to carrots or yes to cucumbers, it leaves my hair softer. This feels more like a lotion, you know how most conditioners feel a little slippery when you rinse it out, this one is kinda thick and... Not as satisfying.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair looking greasy</li>
    <li> I love using the mango conditioner- it leaves my hair feeling light and healthy, and so easy to brush!  Smells great but not overpowering and never leaves my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I am a mild Burt&#x27;s Bees fan. I read about the shampoo that goes with this conditioner in a magazine. I already have a shampoo that I love, but was not crazy about my current conditioner, so I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try. I&#x27;m glad I did because I love this conditioner! My hair is soft and shiny. It also has a nice earthy smell. Could not ask for more. This one&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> When smelling it out of the bottle, it&#x27;s not bad. Once you use it on your hair, it smells like bad plastic.</li>
    <li> Only giving 3 stars because I was highly disappointed with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Super Shiny Shampoo.  I&#x27;m not going to continue using the conditioner without the shampoo.  All in all, nice smell, did the job, no big complaints.</li>
    <li> I used this conditioner in combination with the shampoo, and each time, my hair gets greasier.  It isn&#x27;t very concentrated, thus very expensive to me.  I prefer Nature&#x27;s Gate products.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes Burt&#x27;s Bees goods.  She&#x27;s been using the conditioner for a while now &amp; it helps managed her very thick hair.</li>
    <li> I just switched to this conditioner last week in an effort to transition to more natural products, and after a week of use my hair is beyond disgusting. The entire back of my head is a tacky, greasy MESS. It is not clean, it is not shiny-- it is absolutely gross. It looks like I haven&#x27;t washed it in weeks. I admit I love the smell (it is INCREDIBLE) and I like the brand, but it&#x27;s really not worth paying this much for a product that doesn&#x27;t do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even tried this after using my usual shampoo (which got out any residual oiliness) thinking it might just be that the Mango shampoo wasn&#x27;t getting the oil out, but my hair still ended up feeling greasy and looking oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try just the shampoo to see if it makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Untangles my very thick hair, smells nice and tames my curls into soft pretty ringlets.  My hair feels moisturized. Great product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t shampoo my hair every washing, so as not to strip my hair of it&#x27;s natural oils, but I do like to feel as though I have. I use this conditioner in between &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy like others I tried do. Love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
    <li> it was okay.  i loved the smell and the fact that it is natural but pantene repair and restore actually does better</li>
    <li> Very strong mango scent. Worked really well, just a very strong smell to the shampoo and conditioner. My daughter likes it, me not so much</li>
    <li> So I started using Burt&#x27;s Bees Shampoo and Conditioners in an attempt to find one that wouldn&#x27;t strip my henna hair color. While I loved the product, my hair was too oily to be using these product since it doesn&#x27;t strip oil. After three months I had to switch to something else.. Now, my husband on the other hand, has normal to dry hair and had been considering cutting it off because of how damaged it was. I told him to give this stuff a try as well as the 2 minute conditioner hair treatment as well. His hair has done a BEAUTIFUL 180 and is so soft, shiny and smooth. I cannot fathom someone with dry or damaged hair not loving this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is now a huge Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Shampoo fan!</li>
    <li> I did not find this conditioner to be that much better than most of the other kinds you can get off the shelf at the store. It smells nice as you are using it but the next day, my hair smelled funny. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Frankly I don&#x27;t like it. In addition for not adding shine my scalp is itchy. Will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> One of best gentle shampoos!! I used to use Aveeno nourish and moisturize also. My hair is very long and gets poufy and frizzy , wavy, I don&#x27;t need much and it lathers and rinses good, first time i used it without conditioner, i was surprised at my hairs shine! it left my hair very clean fresh  and soft! when i straightened it, i was so surprised at the texture! It helps me keep my color intact, and my hair looks good after 3 days even. I will continue to use this , been using for 1yr. now. Amazon set and subscribe price is awesome for it!</li>
    <li> This conditioner has always been a favorite of mine.  I have used if for years, and it is still a nice &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; choice and keeps hair manageable.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something natural for my conditioner and have always loved Burts Bees products. I was a little disappointed that this conditioner does not have the signature &amp;#34;apricot&amp;#34; scent of other Burt&#x27;s Bees products but love the result on my hair. My hair feels healthy and soft, and it only requires a little bit for my hair. I completely trust the company when it comes to safe products, and would recommend anything they sell.</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair smell good, shine and has no harsh chemicals. My daughter who is 10 really loved it too.</li>
    <li> Use it my daughters&#x27; hair and it removes tangles without weighing it down. They love it and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals as traditional conditioner.</li>
    <li> the smell is a little strong</li>
    <li> aromatherapy &amp; shiny hair.</li>
    <li> This is the first Burt&#x27;s Bees product I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I&#x27;m really happy with it.  I bought it because I was looking for a conditioner with fewer chemicals in it, but if anything my hair looks better than before.  It&#x27;s definitely shinier and soft.  The mango scent is really nice... it&#x27;s a tangy scent rather than a sweet one.  It is a little thicker than other conditioners I&#x27;ve used... almost like a paste.  But that doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that my review is different from others who found that the conditioner made their hair greasy.  All I can say is that different hair types probably react differently.  You might want to try this and see if it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the BB SS Mango shampoo along with this, and I&#x27;m happy with that as well.</li>
    <li> Liked the conditioner but the shampoo is all you need.  will order shampoo again but maybe not the conditioner. .</li>
    <li> It does not hydrate, just got out the shower and almost used an entire bottle to try and detangle hair, finally give up and had to use a conditioner with not so good stuff in it for the moisture!!!</li>
    <li> I love BB&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners. I get keratin treatments in my hair and I find using this shampoo and conditioner helps extend the life of the treatments. Smells good, too!</li>
    <li> This product is sulfate and paraben free. It smalls great and makes hair smooth. Very happy with the great price as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, have been using it for years.  I have it on Subcribe &amp; Save so I get it regularly, along with the mango scent shampoo.  I think it is an add-on product to my Subscribe &amp; Save, but is economical through Subscribe &amp; Save when ordered with the other products.  It is quite expensive in our local department stores, and I like the ease of having it auto-delivered.  This product has a nice clean scent that my whole family enjoys.  Love that it&#x27;s so pure.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo and conditionera are amazing! I love that the products are over 97-99% natural and paraben free. These products are now a staple in our household.</li>
    <li> Love all the BB products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoos and conditioners for over 3 years and love them.  They smell great, work great and don&#x27;t contain any of the toxic chemicals that most commercial hair products contain.  I combine Super Shiny with Very Volumizing conditioner/shampoos to get a better result.  My hair is dry and thick so doesn&#x27;t need more volume but it can still go &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34;.  Using either the Super Shiny condtioner or shampoo with the Very Volumizing shampoo or Conditioner...e.g. if I shampoo with Super Shiny, I condition with Very Volumizing and Vice Versa...helps strike the right balance.  Depending on your hair type you may not have to combine them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard of so many bad reviews for the new Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo &amp; conditioner, but I bought them anyway...I love the smell of the conditioner so much.  I only wash my hair once a week with shampoo, so I haven&#x27;t gotten the chance to try that yet. The conditioner is good though. At first it made my hair feel greasy, but now it doesn&#x27;t get greasy anymore. I&#x27;m only giving it a 4 star review, because it&#x27;s not all that amazing, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Such a great conditioner! Hair is manageable, shiny and healthy looking. No tangles&lt;br /&gt;great price and great find!! Excellent for gray hair! Really brightens the color!</li>
    <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything for my dry hair.  I feel as if I could go through a gallon of it and still not get knots out. Will keep trying others...</li>
    <li> Item was exactly as described on the web site so no problem there.  It smells divine and the packaging looks nice.  I wanted to love this conditioner so badly, but it seemed to make my hair dry and brittle in under 4 days of use.  Has taken me three weeks to try to get my hair back to the shine/moisture/toughness that is was before I tried this conditioner (along with its matching shampoo).  It may be my hair chemistry or an ingredient in the product.  Not sure, but it just ended up being not for me.</li>
    <li> It works, but I&#x27;m not mad about it. Seems like I could have gotten it for a better price at the drug store.</li>
    <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees, wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> Great as always. Only one used on my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> My neice wanted to try some more of a natural hair care product, so I ordered this and the conditioner for her. She loves the natural ingredients and the end result with her hair. Happy with this product.</li>
    <li> It weighed down my hair and made it feel dirty. After one use I donated the remainder to a thrift store.</li>
    <li> a) burt&#x27;s has signed the commitment not to use harmful ingredients; b) hair is soft and shiny when using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very rare that I find a hair product that I have to rave about, but I absolutely LOVE this stuff. My thick, wavy, frizzy hair is noticeably softer and shinier after using this conditioner (with the matching shampoo) a few times. I just wish the bottle was bigger!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter on the Subscribe and Save, so I will write what they had to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They stated that it rinses away easily and it smells nice. It left hair feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Doesn&#x27;t last long as it&#x27;s a little watery.</li>
    <li> LOVE this conditioner! I was staying out of town at a friends house who had this conditioner in her shower and I fell in love. I&#x27;ve had past experiences traveling where I fall in love with someone else&#x27;s shampoo or conditioner, only to find that the water quality back home made a big difference. I was pleased to find out that the product worked just the same whether in Seattle or Miami. It doesn&#x27;t leave MY hair greasy but leaves it soft and full of life.</li>
    <li> I have really curly hair and like to leave conditioner in it for a few minutes in the shower, then run my fingers through it to detangle it. This conditioner really isn&#x27;t the best for that purpose - saving $3 (vs. one that I like much better) wasn&#x27;t worth it for a product that doesn&#x27;t fulfill my needs.</li>
    <li> the smell. that&#x27;s the first thing i&#x27;m going to say. it smells like fresh fruit. second, my hair is to my waist and it is so shiny and healthy after using this conditioner. i use several items from this company and happy with every one of them.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this Shampoo/Conditioner combo. However, I was disappointed. It left my hair with a cakey sort of feel. I went back to what I had been using and my hair went back to shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t buy this again. It&#x27;s just ok. Nothing special.</li>
    <li> Left hair feeling like it had a film on it. Weighs hair down and causes tangles.</li>
    <li> I usually like Burt&#x27;s Bees products but the smell of this conditioner was not for me. Additionally the conditioner did not make my hair shiny but at least it did not damage my hair so coupled with the unpleasant smell I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> My husband is addicted to Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo/conditioner. Makes his hair soft and manageable. Love it!</li>
    <li> I use this product paired with the shampoo and love it. Keeps my hair a lot healthier than the products with all the harmful chemicals. My hair is soft and shiny and no longer falling out! I will definitely continue to buy!</li>
    <li> I guess I am just used to using really creamy conditioner. I got this because it didn&#x27;t have parabens and other bad stuff in it, but it just didn&#x27;t make my hair feel good. My hair felt kind of dry and not at all conditioned after using it. It did however have a nice smell.</li>
    <li> Made my hair very greasy feeling &amp; looking.</li>
    <li> Clorox is parent company.,Clorox still does animal testing, especially in China where animal testing is required by law.</li>
    <li> After using the matching shampoo and this conditioner, my hair was dry like a haystack.&lt;br /&gt;I used a handful of this conditioner and it still didn&#x27;t soften my hair.&lt;br /&gt;As for shiny - I couldn&#x27;t tell- I was too busy noticing how much my hair color had faded after only one use of this product. Awful.</li>
