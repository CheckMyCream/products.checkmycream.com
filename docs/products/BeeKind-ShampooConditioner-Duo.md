      <li>My hair is noticeably shinier and healthy.</li>
      <li>Love Beekind products.</li>
      <li>I do, however, love the travel-sized &amp;#34;paper&amp;#34; box containers of BeeKind.  </li>
      <li>My husband tried these products at one of the hotels we stayed at last December and he loved how nice his hair felt!  </li>
      <li>I liked how it made my hair feel so clean</li>
      <li>I wanted to make the change to chemical free hair products, and after finishing the first bottles, I LOVE  BeeKind Shampoo and Conditioner!  </li>
      <li>Though I&#x27;ve processed my hair, after using this product my hair feels so bouncy, light, and soft.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>I got a free sample of this product at a hotel I stayed at.</li>
      <li>Breakage is also much less and my hair smell great :)</li>
      <li>First used this in the hotels in Glacier park, Had to find more when at home.</li>
      <li>I still do like how clean it makes my hair feel and the smell of the shampoo</li>
      <li>I had enjoyed using these products  at a resort so much that I took a handful of extras home with me.  </li>
      <li>Fresh clean lemony smell.  </li>
      <li>It is a lot more then what I would normally pay for shampoo and conditioner (a lot).</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>The fresh smell is also a plus and reminds me of summer.</li>
      <li>It makes your hair sooo soft, and leaves your hair looking so healthy.</li>
      <li>Make sure you use the conditioner after the shampoo, so you can have the complete effect.</li>
      <li>Better than the &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; brands in the local supermarket.</li>
      <li>I first tried these products while staying at a hotel in Ojai CA.  </li>
      <li>So I tried this shampoo at a 5-star hotel first.</li>
      <li>The shampoo leaves my hair clean and and the conditioner makes it so easy to blow dry and style.  </li>
      <li>It does not weigh your hair down, and it most defintely is not oily!  </li>
      <li>Many ingredients are organic &amp; chemical-free, but when I started using BeeKind, I didn&#x27;t like how dry it made my hair.  </li>
      <li>The price is also reasonable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just too much of a luxury.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a lot, and both products work really well for cleaning and conditioning the hair.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love the products and ordered them due to her sharing some with me.</li>
      <li>Really different from the rest and eco friendly.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>But when I thought about it, I decided that since I can get nearly as nice 70% organic shampoo and conditioner at the supermarket for half the price, that I would do that instead in the future.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine thin hair and these products were light and did not weigh my hair down.  </li>
      <li>It is a little pricey but worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>So after 1 year of hounding everyone - friends/family who live or made trips to the US, a friend finally agreed to carry it back with him from his US</li>
      <li>My hair is extremely frizzy and unmanageable, so I was pleasantly surprised when my hair felt very soft and settled after using BeeKind.</li>

    <li> I had enjoyed using these products  at a resort so much that I took a handful of extras home with me.  Decided to treat myself to more and ordered this set from Amazon.  But when I thought about it, I decided that since I can get nearly as nice 70% organic shampoo and conditioner at the supermarket for half the price, that I would do that instead in the future.  It&#x27;s just too much of a luxury.</li>
    <li> Fresh clean lemony smell.  But if you have dry hair, you will not like this as it does not really moisturize the hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. My hair is no longer falling out and feels thicker. I will continue to you this as long as it is on the market. The price is also reasonable.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, she said : this is the best conditioner she&#x27;s ever used, makes her hair very soft.</li>
    <li> My husband tried these products at one of the hotels we stayed at last December and he loved how nice his hair felt!  happy hair guy!</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this product at a hotel I stayed at. I liked how it made my hair feel so clean so I looked it up online and ordered it. It is a lot more then what I would normally pay for shampoo and conditioner (a lot). I still do like how clean it makes my hair feel and the smell of the shampoo but I found if I use it every day it makes my head itch. I would probley order the shampoo again but not the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I chose this, because our daughter had gotten samples in a hotel in Arizona and shared them with me.  My husband is a hobby beekeeper - thus the reason.  I absolutely love the products and ordered them due to her sharing some with me.</li>
    <li> My hair is noticeably shinier and healthy. Love Beekind products. Really different from the rest and eco friendly. A standout</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo. I tried it at a hotel and loved it, so I bought some. My hair is softer, combs easier, and just looks better. This after one month of daily use!</li>
    <li> My wife likes the combination, they do well for her hair. Better than the &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; brands in the local supermarket.</li>
    <li> I wanted to make the change to chemical free hair products, and after finishing the first bottles, I LOVE  BeeKind Shampoo and Conditioner!  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot, and both products work really well for cleaning and conditioning the hair.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> First used this in the hotels in Glacier park, Had to find more when at home. Nice sent and works good also.</li>
    <li> I love it.  My hair has never looked so healthy and shiny.  I washed my hair twice to get out all the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; stuff.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  It is a little pricey but worth every penny.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I came across this product when I was away on vacation, and decided to use it. Thank God I did! It makes your hair sooo soft, and leaves your hair looking so healthy. It does not weigh your hair down, and it most defintely is not oily!  I have relaxed hair, and when I use both the products, you can immediately feel the difference of softness, shine, and moisture in my hair. Though I&#x27;ve processed my hair, after using this product my hair feels so bouncy, light, and soft.&lt;br /&gt;My hair can&#x27;t deal with overly moisturous &lt;--(new word alert), heavy, or oily products. These products gave the perfect amount of moisture. Make sure you use the conditioner after the shampoo, so you can have the complete effect. It is a bit pricey, but hey if it works, then to me it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. They were in a room at a bed and breakfast that we stay in and was impressed with the product and had to irdersome</li>
    <li> Beekind shampoo and conditioner are the best hair products I have ever used.  The shampoo leaves my hair clean and and the conditioner makes it so easy to blow dry and style.  I will definitely reorder this product.</li>
    <li> So I tried this shampoo at a 5-star hotel first. It was part of the toiletries that were provided by the hotel. My hair is extremely frizzy and unmanageable, so I was pleasantly surprised when my hair felt very soft and settled after using BeeKind. But I later found out that it is not available in India!! So after 1 year of hounding everyone - friends/family who live or made trips to the US, a friend finally agreed to carry it back with him from his US trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say..I am super happy!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Breakage is also much less and my hair smell great :)</li>
    <li> I first tried these products while staying at a hotel in Ojai CA.  I fell in love!!!  I have very fine thin hair and these products were light and did not weigh my hair down.  The fresh smell is also a plus and reminds me of summer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the bees(a portion of the profits go to bee research).  Many ingredients are organic &amp; chemical-free, but when I started using BeeKind, I didn&#x27;t like how dry it made my hair.  Maybe they just aren&#x27;t good for color-treated hair.   I do, however, love the travel-sized &amp;#34;paper&amp;#34; box containers of BeeKind.  I&#x27;m giving 2 stars for the Bees.</li>
