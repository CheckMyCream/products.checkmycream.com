### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>, awesome!</li>
      <li>Washed it off after another 10 minutes and my eyelashes looked great!</li>
      <li>The best eyelash dye I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Additionally, CaliPost seller was great!</li>
      <li>perfect, works great.  </li>
      <li>The results were good!</li>
      <li>I had been using  a sealer, but it&#x27;s  longer on the market - this tint is a great solution for darkening my lower lashes without risking raccoon eyes.  </li>
      <li>Had to do it twice and wasn&#x27;t 100% happy and in pain anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Roux</li>
      <li>Then another application for 2-3 minutes for the eyebrows and they looked great as well.</li>
      <li>Looks great.</li>
      <li>I am thrilled with the results!</li>
      <li>I did reorder the Blue-Black tint the day I knew I made a mistake in my order, but I think the seller would be courteous even without my guarantee of the &amp;#34;correct&amp;#34; reorder.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and great seller</li>

      <li>Very easy and looks great.  </li>
      <li>But, it does look great on your no make up days, since you are able to see that you have lashes.</li>
      <li>Love this product!  </li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>Blue/ black is best choice for color, it is darkest and shows the best.</li>
      <li>It gives definition to your own lashes, it does not add volume.</li>
      <li>Salon quality product, saving money by doing my own lash tint.</li>
      <li>The good tint I used before is not sold in the US any more, I did try the ones sold in pharmacies (Roux and the likes) and also ReflectoCil.</li>
      <li>Love it love it love it!!</li>
      <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>very easy to apply however.  </li>
      <li>Also, my bottom lashes are all very light.</li>
      <li>I was able to sit and wait for 10 minutes with my eyes opened.</li>
      <li>This product is ok.  </li>
      <li>Applicator is more for mixing than applying.  </li>
      <li>The product does not burn/sting any more than any salon or home treatment I have used before.</li>
      <li>and I am very happy I finally found</li>
      <li>Well, I ended up getting the kit, and I am glad I did.</li>
      <li>More of a purplish.</li>
      <li>Not equivalent to mascara, but way better than nothing.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like I have mascara on or anything, just more defined lashes.</li>
      <li>I read alot of review on this product before buying it and it seemed like most people had pretty good results.</li>
      <li>Pretty good results.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I find it easy to apply even with the &amp;#34;difficult&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Easy to use, does not irritate my eyes at all, washes off skin with just water.  </li>
      <li>Easy to do.</li>
      <li>I made an honest mistake having ordered Brown-Black first</li>
      <li>the meanwhile was looking for a new good option that could permanently use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it will apply fine.</li>
      <li>I have brown eyelashes, but the tips get really light.</li>
      <li>Worked great on blonde lashes.</li>
      <li>Not as good as when I have my lashes professionally tinted.</li>
      <li>Not as I expected, Great for eyebrow tinting unless your lashes are albino then you will notice a tremendous change with this product</li>
      <li>and I am very happy I finally found my next permanent eyebrows/eyelashes tinting option.</li>
      <li>Really great solution for my lower lashes, in lieu of mascara, which on lower lashes can run and produce a  mess under the eyes.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>Washed it off -- it looked so promising compared to the tints I used before that I applied it for the second time as I longed for a good tint for a couple of years now.</li>
      <li>I could not get it to make a consistent mixture.</li>
      <li>The product works exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Better than the last lash tint I tried.  </li>
      <li>I used vaseline under my eyes the first time I used it, but I think I got some on the tips of my lower lashes and didn&#x27;t dye the tips.  </li>
      <li>Works great; minimal staining by using cotton bud to clean up as I go and any staining looks like heavy eyeliner for the couple of days that it lasts before washing off when I wash my face.</li>
      <li>This method is much preferred.</li>
      <li>but there really was not a discernable difference.</li>
      <li>I explained my mistake to the seller and they agreed for a full return and refund, that I received the day they got the return shipment back.</li>

      <li>and the likes (the ones where you put one solution on first, let it dry and then apply the second solution) were an OK short-term solution -- the color would hold for a week -10 days max.</li>
      <li>This is not as easy to use as I expected.</li>
      <li>Product difficult to use and there are better products out there that work better.</li>
      <li>Lasted for 4 weeks, and it was still on my lashes, but I reapplied after 4 weeks for the new eyelash growth.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;1000 Hour Blue-Black is my new choice of tint.</li>
      <li>finally....can stop paying ridiculous prices and dye my own lashes</li>
      <li>Was easy to use, long lasting.  </li>
      <li>Tip: do the lower lashes first, wait 10-15 mins, rinse, do the upper.</li>
      <li>I have ash blonde lashes, so every bit of color I can get is greatly appreciated!</li>
      <li>Nope, the eyelashes came out just fine, black with just a hint of bluishness&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
      <li>If you work carefully, you might get three seconds of mild stinging.</li>
      <li>Bought this tint after reading positive reviews on personal beauty forum boards.</li>
      <li>But after mixing for a few minutes it all blended just fine</li>
      <li>the few smudges that I got on my skin came out just fine with a moist q-tip</li>
      <li>I always use this with an old mascara brush to put on like mascara.</li>
      <li>I had my lashes dyed professionally for years</li>
      <li>Has lasted 3 weeks so far.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really speak on the actual dye.</li>
      <li>The dye is thick and I was bold enough to use a clean mascara wand and apply it to my opened eyes, something that I have never dared to do before.</li>
      <li>&amp; even after doing it 2-3 times in a row just to have some color - ANY COLOR - basically it looked like i went to all this trouble for pretty much nothing.</li>
      <li>Instructions require a confederate, since they tell you to apply with eyes closed, but I managed fine doing it myself (eyes open, obviously).</li>
      <li>Not very messy.</li>
      <li>i bought this elsewhere, &amp; the reason i purchased it was due to people reviewing it positively (elsewhere also).</li>
      <li>Lasts so much longer than the Roux brand from Sally&#x27;s; this stuff can last me 3 weeks of deep, blue blackness.  </li>
      <li>(I developed an allergy to lash extension glue and the the lash refills were such a time-sucking-hassle for me, not to mention the expense!)</li>
      <li>I had my eyelashes dyed professionally once before, but this product is not quite the same.</li>
      <li>not sure if plain black would have been any better, but doubt i&#x27;d want to spend this much again just to try.</li>

<li> having ordered Brown-Black first, I realized the color was wrong after opening the package and mixing the tint, so the packaging was almost completely destroyed.</li>

<li> It did however get the product on, so not a complete bust.</li>
<li> it definitely burned no matter how careful you were about it.</li>
<li> I just walk around for 30 min while it sets (being careful not to sneeze) and with a damp QTip and similar applying-mascara method, wipe the excess dye off.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if I just have very sensitive eyes</li>
<li> I had tears streaming down my face instantly.</li>
<li> Not as blue black as I thought it would be.  </li>
<li> I was worried thinking it would be blue, but it is not at all, it is just the deepest black they offer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had hoped it would make my eyelashes very dark but there really was not a discernable difference. It did cause slight irritation in the form of some tenderness along my lash line.  there was also some slight staining.  very easy to apply however.  I would recommend buying some eye guards.....it only comes with a stencil for them in the kit.  you will also want some vaseline to adhere the eye guards to your skin.  It is also easier done if you have a helper.  I did it my myself....working on one eye at a time.  it does not even come close to replacing mascara though which is what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Product not as expected.</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical at first. Reading all the other reviews made it seem like a complete hit or miss. Well, I ended up getting the kit, and I am glad I did. I have ash blonde lashes, so every bit of color I can get is greatly appreciated! The product works exactly as described. If you think this will make it look as if you are wearing mascara, this is not the product for you. It gives definition to your own lashes, it does not add volume. So no, you cannot stop using mascara all together. But, it does look great on your no make up days, since you are able to see that you have lashes. The only thing that I would like to see improvement on is the &amp;#34;wand&amp;#34;. It almost looks like a piece of plastic that was torn of something, perhaps even a flossing stick!? It did however get the product on, so not a complete bust. Next time I will use a disposable wand. The product does not burn/sting any more than any salon or home treatment I have used before. If you work carefully, you might get three seconds of mild stinging. Plus: Way cheaper than any salon price!</li>
    <li> Not too bad I wished it stained my eyelids a longer time though</li>
    <li> Product difficult to use and there are better products out there that work better. I tossed mine.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last at all. Maybe 2-3 days. Essentially is not worth the pain in the butt application or price.  I was hoping...</li>
    <li> Worked great on blonde lashes. Easy to do. I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> This product is ok.  I had my eyelashes dyed professionally once before, but this product is not quite the same.</li>
    <li> Not as blue black as I thought it would be.  More of a purplish.</li>
    <li> Works just as described. I use a mascara wand to apply. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love this! I had my lashes dyed professionally for years and oh the STING! This method is much preferred. I put it on like mascara and since I&#x27;m sitting up with my eyes open (rather than lying down with eyes closed at the esthetician) the dye doesn&#x27;t leak into my eyes. I just walk around for 30 min while it sets (being careful not to sneeze) and with a damp QTip and similar applying-mascara method, wipe the excess dye off. I find it easy to apply even with the &amp;#34;difficult&amp;#34; plastic wand thing that comes with the kit. The key is to get the dye the correct consistency - creamy- and it will apply fine. It can take a bit to mix the two together but keep stirring and it eventually will combine. I use about half the recommended amount and it is still plenty to cover my lashes so I expect this batch will last a long time.  The dye doesn&#x27;t get lighter with time- it stays very dark but as I learned in my year of lash extensions, we shed lashes a lot so after about eight weeks there is enough regrowth that only about 40-60% of the lashes are still dark. (I developed an allergy to lash extension glue and the the lash refills were such a time-sucking-hassle for me, not to mention the expense!) I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s so my lashes aren&#x27;t as thick as they were in my 20&#x27;s but with a lash growth serum (Revitalash) and 1000 Hour Dye, I don&#x27;t use any mascara. Plus I MUCH prefer this than the somewhat cheesy fake look of lash extensions.</li>
    <li> I always use this with an old mascara brush to put on like mascara. I redo it every 5 or 6 weeks. Works great; minimal staining by using cotton bud to clean up as I go and any staining looks like heavy eyeliner for the couple of days that it lasts before washing off when I wash my face.</li>
    <li> Not equivalent to mascara, but way better than nothing.  Pretty good results. Better than the last lash tint I tried.  Really great solution for my lower lashes, in lieu of mascara, which on lower lashes can run and produce a  mess under the eyes.  I had been using  a sealer, but it&#x27;s  longer on the market - this tint is a great solution for darkening my lower lashes without risking raccoon eyes.  Instructions require a confederate, since they tell you to apply with eyes closed, but I managed fine doing it myself (eyes open, obviously).</li>
    <li> I read alot of review on this product before buying it and it seemed like most people had pretty good results. I&#x27;m not sure if I just have very sensitive eyes but my eyes watered so bad instantly after applying even a tiny bit on the lashes. I couldn&#x27;t even finish the application, let alone leave it on for 10 mins. I had tears streaming down my face instantly. I didn&#x27;t even finish the application so I can&#x27;t really speak on the actual dye. But I will definitely not be trying this again!</li>
    <li> Was easy to use, long lasting.  Applicator is more for mixing than applying.  I ended up buying throw away wands to use instead. Good product for self application too.</li>
    <li> i bought this elsewhere, &amp; the reason i purchased it was due to people reviewing it positively (elsewhere also). i have blond eyelashes so definitely need some help there. this did almost nothing. it was almost impossible to get it to stay on, using the brush that came with it (or as suggested by others, a mini dental brush). it definitely burned no matter how careful you were about it. &amp; even after doing it 2-3 times in a row just to have some color - ANY COLOR - basically it looked like i went to all this trouble for pretty much nothing. people had suggested getting the &amp;#34;blue black&amp;#34; but i don&#x27;t think it worked well at all.. not sure if plain black would have been any better, but doubt i&#x27;d want to spend this much again just to try.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I have brown eyelashes, but the tips get really light. Also, my bottom lashes are all very light. I got the blue- black. I was worried thinking it would be blue, but it is not at all, it is just the deepest black they offer. The results were good! It doesn&#x27;t look like I have mascara on or anything, just more defined lashes.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. Not very messy.</li>
    <li> Lasts so much longer than the Roux brand from Sally&#x27;s; this stuff can last me 3 weeks of deep, blue blackness.  Doesn&#x27;t stain skin around the eyes, the only caveat is application.  It&#x27;s weird.  It&#x27;s hard to mix together, you MUST buy disposable mascara wands to apply it with, don&#x27;t even THINK about applying it with that white stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I will buy this stuff forever.</li>
    <li> Not as good as when I have my lashes professionally tinted. Be very, very careful or your eyes will burn!</li>
    <li> Not as I expected, Great for eyebrow tinting unless your lashes are albino then you will notice a tremendous change with this product</li>
    <li> (From the Mrs.)  This is not as easy to use as I expected. It does not mix well.  I could not get it to make a consistent mixture.</li>
    <li> Very easy and looks great.  I&#x27;m saving about $100 a month by using this instead of going to a salon.</li>
    <li> Bought this tint after reading positive reviews on personal beauty forum boards. The good tint I used before is not sold in the US any more, I did try the ones sold in pharmacies (Roux and the likes) and also ReflectoCil. Was dreading my monthly tinting every time -- ReflectoCil is literally EATING your eyes out, the stinging while washing the dye off was almost unbearable, plus the final color wasn&#x27;t too black. It seemed to be a hit and miss -- if you apply the tint too early before it gets dark black -- you are not getting black eyelashes rather light gray, if you sit around and apply it after 15 minutes of letting it sit -- you might be too late and the dye wouldn&#x27;t hold at all. Had to do it twice and wasn&#x27;t 100% happy and in pain anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Roux and the likes (the ones where you put one solution on first, let it dry and then apply the second solution) were an OK short-term solution -- the color would hold for a week -10 days max. It would always drip and smudge the skin around the eyes as well.&lt;br /&gt;All the meanwhile was looking for a new good option that could permanently use.&lt;br /&gt;1000 Hour Blue-Black is my new choice of tint. The dye got black in my little tinting glass within 1-2 minutes and that&#x27;s when I applied. The dye is thick and I was bold enough to use a clean mascara wand and apply it to my opened eyes, something that I have never dared to do before. I was able to sit and wait for 10 minutes with my eyes opened. If there was stinging, it was minimal (when the dye got into the eye). Washed it off -- it looked so promising compared to the tints I used before that I applied it for the second time as I longed for a good tint for a couple of years now. Washed it off after another 10 minutes and my eyelashes looked great! Then another application for 2-3 minutes for the eyebrows and they looked great as well. It&#x27;s been a week and there is no sign of fading (like you get with Roux-type tints).&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, CaliPost seller was great! I made an honest mistake having ordered Brown-Black first, I realized the color was wrong after opening the package and mixing the tint, so the packaging was almost completely destroyed. I explained my mistake to the seller and they agreed for a full return and refund, that I received the day they got the return shipment back. I did reorder the Blue-Black tint the day I knew I made a mistake in my order, but I think the seller would be courteous even without my guarantee of the &amp;#34;correct&amp;#34; reorder.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and great seller and I am very happy I finally found my next permanent eyebrows/eyelashes tinting option.mistake having ordered Brown-Black first, I realized the color was wrong after opening the package and mixing the tint, so the packaging was almost completely destroyed.

    <li> finally....can stop paying ridiculous prices and dye my own lashes</li>
    <li> Looks great. Has lasted 3 weeks so far. Tip: do the lower lashes first, wait 10-15 mins, rinse, do the upper. This will help avoid the burning and if your eyes tear while doing the upper it won&#x27;t wash off the lower dye. Glop it on the eyelash thick but avoid the skin and the eye. If you get it in your eye your efforts will be in vain as you will cry like a baby and it will all wash off and you&#x27;ll have to do it again or quit.</li>
    <li> Love it love it love it!! Very easy to apply. Instructions well written.</li>
    <li> Salon quality product, saving money by doing my own lash tint. Use Vaseline around your eye, put a scrap of paper towel under eye to catch drips. Use a small paintbrush and mascara wand to apply. Blue/ black is best choice for color, it is darkest and shows the best. Tint every 4 weeks or so...</li>
    <li> perfect, works great.  Lasted for 4 weeks, and it was still on my lashes, but I reapplied after 4 weeks for the new eyelash growth.  Easy to use, does not irritate my eyes at all, washes off skin with just water.  I&#x27;ve been using blue-black, will try black next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some pointers:&lt;br /&gt;-- when you start mixing it, it&#x27;s all lumpy and separate, seems like it will never blend and mix together properly.  I was sure that I did something wrong.  But after mixing for a few minutes it all blended just fine, just keep mixing.&lt;br /&gt;-- the color of the mixture is not what it will look like on your eyelashes.  Mine looked quite purple, I was worried that I will have purple eyelashes.  Nope, the eyelashes came out just fine, black with just a hint of bluishness&lt;br /&gt;-- I used vaseline under my eyes the first time I used it, but I think I got some on the tips of my lower lashes and didn&#x27;t dye the tips.  So the second time I used no vaseline.  the few smudges that I got on my skin came out just fine with a moist q-tip, I don&#x27;t think there is any need for vaseline&lt;br /&gt;-- it comes with a plastic stick wand and a mascara wand, I use both&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, awesome!</li>
    <li> The best eyelash dye I&#x27;ve ever used. I am thrilled with the results!</li>
