<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got this for my dad&#x27;s birthday. He enjoyed it.</li>
    <li> As usual this Gillete razor is very good and the starter&#x27;s set price is fantastic....the downside is that the cartrigers are rididicously expensive. The flexball is handy but not the ultimate in shaving razors design.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned! Now granted I haven&#x27;t owned a multitude of disposable shaving utensils but I have had my fair share and I can honestly say this is one of the great ones. This is not a product you get and say I&#x27;ve obviously been ripped off. This is a product where you get exactly what&#x27;s advertised and exactly what you paid for. It&#x27;s sturdy &amp; well built with QUALITY materials, beautiful, and gives a super smooth shave! Bonus for it being just plain cool lookin. It&#x27;s a bit expensive but I think worth it. If you already  have a favorite razor it probly won&#x27;t replace it but I&#x27;m willing to bet that if you&#x27;re not biased or sentimental, you&#x27;ll love this razor.</li>
    <li> Great product delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Gives a much more comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Works great as have all previous Gillette products. Blades are little pricey but last me long enough. Used to use an electric shaver and will never go back.</li>
    <li> Better than advertised.  A really smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the flexball; less control with this than the regular Fusion razor</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Very close shave.</li>
    <li> This razor gives the closest save possible. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite razor.  It definitely rolls with the contours of my face and offers the cleanest shave that I can get.  I also tend to have sensitive skin, and this razor does not cause me any problems.  The blade goes a long way as well...which means I don&#x27;t have to buy new blades as often.  Despite the fact that it is a bit pricey...I really love this product!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. It gives a close shave and the blades last a long time. They&#x27;re expensive, but when the blades last a month or more each, it&#x27;s not so bad. The pivot system isn&#x27;t too different from non-pivet, and space age look isn&#x27;t as cool as intended.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get a ton of facial hair but this is cheap enough for me. All the other people say use a safety razor  but until I try that this is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Best Razor there is. I have used the first blade for 3 weeks</li>
    <li> This razor gives a very comfortable shave.  It maneuvers easily on the contours of my face.  Amazon&#x27;s price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> The best razors on the market. I tried the Executive Dollar Shave Club subscription for $9 a month. They just weren&#x27;t as good. Went back to the Gillette and my face feels so much better.</li>
    <li> Bought this at walmart and it does shave nicely. Slices through my hair without any issues.. but the flex ball kind of makes me feel like I&#x27;m going to slit my throat sometimes. I do not recommend using this while intoxicated or sleepy.</li>
    <li> This razor realy gives a great shave. It follows the contours of your face very well.</li>
    <li> excellent . easy to use</li>
    <li> the grip is difficult(sliperry) too hold..</li>
    <li> a dream come true!  Smooth shave !</li>
    <li> I was skeptical as I have been through the era of twin blades to Mach3 to Mach3 turbo to fusion to proglide and now flexball..&lt;br /&gt;but you know what, I can see the difference. Very good product. I like it. One star was omitted for the blue lotion strip that quickly disappears after a 2-3 shaves..</li>
    <li> Like most men, I have tried dozens of different razors over the years, and this Fusion Proglide nailed it...the nearly full swivel head lets you shave at high speed, and almost recklessly...without risk of even a slight nick....amazing. I can shave twice as fast as before and get this annoying chore of shaving done in minimal time. I discovered this razor from Gillette random shipping a free one to me. Brilliant move on their part...I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this product and find it stick to the curves of my face pretty well. It does what it claims to do and gives a nice close shave. I gave it 4 stars out of five simply as I do like the power option on my fusion power and think this Razor would be even better with the power option.</li>
    <li> comparing this one to battery powered Gillette Fusion Proglide http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0062IWQVU/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1  it&#x27;s way better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s smoother and not painful at all.  I like to go shave against the grain simply because it&#x27;s cleaner, my face is white but my hair is black.</li>
    <li> Pretty nifty razor so far the first few shaves. Though these blades dull quick the first few shaves with new ones are the best shave plus the swivle head helps.</li>
    <li> I aren&#x27;t a huge fan of shaving all the time, etc. lol I am growing thick heavy beard.    U don&#x27;t need to shave just to be a dude, lol    Besides those pretty people like, with suits, ties clean face, etc. look like dorks :)</li>
    <li> Before I used this razor, I thought that the features of this razors were all gimmicky.. but after giving it a try I was proven wrong! The Fusion Proglide razor gave me by far the closest and most efficient shave I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> Came promptly and shaves super well.  In fact, it&#x27;s my favorite razor in the 60 years I&#x27;ve been shaving.</li>
    <li> It does swivel, but I can&#x27;t say that it makes any difference in my shaving.</li>
    <li> Looks cool but thats about it. I cannot believe the razor blades last only about 2 shavings.</li>
    <li> Great product for resasonable price. Wish it would have been eligible for Amazon prime.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Curves to the face and leaves your face leaving smooth and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Leaves your face smooth with no razor burn .</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome.  It&#x27;s very gives me a super close shave with only one stroke.  I&#x27;ve generally got a pretty good shadow going by evening, but my face is still smooth now (and it&#x27;s after 9 p.m.!)</li>
    <li> This was a gift, but he said it was &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Not sturdy for staight go tee looks</li>
    <li> A razor is a razor. Well that was until the mach 3 came out. But since then it&#x27;s been kinda slow in the development department. Until now. I thought the ball was a neat gimmick. Copy design cues off of an overly priced vacuum company. But I have to admit. It works. It is now almost impossible to miss spots. It is now the greatest improvement in modern shaving.</li>
    <li> Works well, I would still rather have the vibration tho...</li>
    <li> excellent thak you amazon</li>
    <li> Great Razor! I have never used Gillette products before. This is Night and day above my old Schick Razor. Smooth shave, and really does a nice job on my Noggin! I shave my head daily and I find that I have so much an easier time with this Razor. It just follows the contours of my head very easy. I will for sure be keeping tis.</li>
    <li> Best razor available. Leaves a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a straight edge shave kind of guy.  Gillette sent me a razon when I turned 18 and I&#x27;ve always used their products.  This is the best they&#x27;ve produced yet.  Great smooth and comfortable shave.  The razor lasts a number of shaves too.  It is a little expensive, but you get what you pay for.  Great product, thanks again Gillette.</li>
    <li> These things are over priced. There are much cheaper options out there. I can&#x27;t believe where we&#x27;ve gone with razor/blade prices. It&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Nothing special.  My Mach 3 is still better.  The roller ball is a gimmick.</li>
    <li> Gave my husband the best shave he has had in months.  Great razor and blades.</li>
    <li> Look no further! Your razor of the future is here.  I must admit I received this razor as part of a promotion for the brand, but boy was I impressed.  This like all Gillette razor products is high quality. The flexball, five-blade design is unmatched in the shaving industry.</li>
    <li> The shave was clean and smooth. No snagging and overall the best shave I have had in a long time. My only concern is it&#x27;s work on extremely sensitive skin, which I have. Going against the grain gave me a few small cuts, nothing that caused issues or left any razor burn, which is great considering other razors cause razor burn if I try and go against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this razor to those with sensitive skin wanting an extremely close shave.</li>
    <li> Great razor that leaves your skin bump free and smooth.  I paired with the Gillette fusion proglide shave gel and was an awesome combo.  This razor seems to get every nook and cranny without cutting the skin or causing irritation.</li>
    <li> Amazing razor leaving your face feel smooth and clean. I would recommend to anyone who loves a close shave and needs little to know effort to get those hard to angle around corners.</li>
    <li> good price.  like it.</li>
    <li> bought this for my son and he loves it.</li>
    <li> No major difference between the Fusion blades I&#x27;ve been using. Just a little more money. Buy the older styles. The work just as well, and they will save you some money.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver for most Americans, who will gladly pay almost two dollars a day for the purpose of mindlessly swiping an overpriced shaver across their face. Besides, people who labor under such limited skill sets really should not be handling anything sharper than a crayola.  The above listed Gillette gimmick looks like a tiny Dyson vacuum cleaner. However, the user himself provides the proper amount of suction. I&#x27;m certain congressional lobbyists shave each other in the shower with these overpriced Fusion&#x27;s each morning, while heating up their daily mush.  For the more aptly skilled looking for a good quick shave, I suggest trying Personna disposable twin blade razors. Just as comfortable, fast, close, and Chinese. Eight or ten Personna disposables sell for a buck at the dollar store. They&#x27;ve produced billions of them, and it&#x27;s not rocket science to begin with.  Personally, I use a old style (but effective) Personna double edge blade, and a restored 1965 Gillette Slim Adjustable. Using proper care, I then go all &#x27;Made in USA&#x27; on my face.  Many precise foreign-made shavers are also available from Amazon. They are efficient, precisely machined, practical works of art, made to last a lifetime.  Gillette killed off their patented old-style popular vintage metal precision razors in the 70&#x27;s. Now they only hawk multi-blade gimmicks which clog up, cost much more to use, and amount to plastic toys for girlie-boys.    Truly.</li>
    <li> Many times technology is put to the best, this isnt the case. I had owned almost every new razor Gillette is pumping trough marketing and sales departments and this is the worst.  This product is a pseudo-technology gimmick. It doesnt get the job done. Had to do my shaving 3, 4 or 5 times before I get a closer shave. Its as simple as physics, the wider the presure point the least presure over a point, feels like trying to shave with a wooden stick. My advice is to stick to the simple ones, they do a  better job and are cheaper.</li>
    <li> execellant razor good buy</li>
    <li> Its a nice enough razor system but if it were perfect why keep adding gimmicks?&lt;br /&gt;I would use this and only this if it were cost effective but it simply isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Go back to the handle 3 generations ago and it worked just fine for me...so does this..but instead of a ball give me an extra blade for the price and I&#x27;m in.</li>
    <li> This razor is a must for the person that wants a close shave. The blades are expensive, but I put my razor in a cup of baby oil after use and can get a month of great shaving by doing this.. I use the fusion gel which awesome. I warm up the gel in a large cup of hot water which feels better when I apply it too my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a razor that can shave as close as this one. It traces the contours of my face and it is very easy to grip too. I&#x27;m never buying another brand and will stick to this one</li>
    <li> Works great and shaves better than the versions before</li>
    <li> Does you razor come with balls, yea step up bruh. Would Recommended.</li>
    <li> Great buy with $3.00 coupon. ..</li>
    <li> I got this as a free sample from BzzAgent and have to say that I enjoy using it. I think the flex ball is helping the shave around my defined jaw line so I have to give this a thumbs up. The blades appear to be just the same as the regular blades, it is just the handle that swivels a little bit.</li>
    <li> Got tired of the disposable razors. This gives a clean and close shave - although I think I&#x27;d prefer the old style double edged razors.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and price</li>
    <li> Suddenly I must fight off hordes of women.</li>
    <li> good product will use again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this from a woman&#x27;s perspective...if this razor is good enough for a man&#x27;s face then I figured if I saw it on a great sale, it would certainly be good enough for my legs!  I love it...the shave seems to last alot longer than the cheaper women&#x27;s razors I had been using previously, and no cuts.  The shave also seems alot closer.  I have no idea why every woman doesn&#x27;t use one of these.  Perhaps one of these days I will let my husband use it.</li>
    <li> It works great and the price can not be beat plus when you use your Chase Points its free.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product, will definitely buy again!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a razor and it saves well what else could you ask for?</li>
    <li> A great shaver with smooth action.</li>
    <li> I have always used Gillette razors and continue to try all  the new ones that come out they keep getting better and better</li>
    <li> Battery went only intermediate a week or two  after purchase</li>
    <li> Smooth as a babies butt</li>
    <li> After trying all the latest, greatest new razors I had come to the conclusion that the cheap 3 for $1 three blade disposals from the dollar store were as good as any. Which is not to say great. Every razor I tried required multiple passes and the space between the blades tended to get clogged with hair so that most were only good for about half a shave. (The cheap razors with less blades had a bigger gap between the blades, so this wasn&#x27;t a problem.)  I tried the Fusion Proglide as part of a promotion, basically willing to give a free product a shot. And I&#x27;m hooked. The shave is closer with no cuts and nicks. The pivoting head makes it easy to get all but the toughest spots with the first swipe and the blade is sharp enough to get down to the skin on one swipe. The blades don&#x27;t clog up either and that&#x27;s a first for an expensive multi-blade razor. It basically turned a lengthy chore with so-so results into a two minute breeze with great results. The only drawback is the price. The claim of $1 a week looks like it&#x27;s based on getting a big pack and using each blade for about a week and a half. I think that&#x27;s pushing it a bit. Even so, the price isn&#x27;t outrageous, just a bit high.</li>
    <li> This razor has quickly become my husband&#x27;s favorite.  He likes the &amp;#34;gliding&amp;#34; aspect that provides a smooth, nick-free shave with no pullling or tugging.  We will be buying these razors on a regular basis. Gillette knows the shaving business and should be pleased to have given their consumers such a good product.</li>
    <li> I have always used Gillette Mach 3 razor to shave and loved it. Every time I used a 4 blade razor I would break out in a rash. I was asked as part of a campaign to try the Gillette ProGlide 2in1 razor. I used this razor and honestly I was surprised by its smooth glide feel across my face. It was close and clean with out leaving my skin feeling rough and dry. Very easy to edge when I wanted to keep a clean thin beard as well. I recommend you give this razor a try. I&#x27;m not going back to my old razor.</li>
    <li> Nice clean shave razor to bad that it comes with only one replacement</li>
    <li> Great razor!  I&#x27;m not one to change razors often as I&#x27;ve had my old Mach 2/3 for many years.  However, after trying a Fusion demo I got I decided I would make a jump and try the Proglide.  I&#x27;m very happy that I did!  It&#x27;s like night and day difference shaving.  Also, it should be noted that I shave my entire head with this without issue and not just my facial hair.  I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try something different and wished I hadn&#x27;t waited so long.</li>
    <li> Just loved it. Shaving is easier, smoothier than ever. Best razor I&#x27;ve tried in the last 30y.</li>
    <li> This razor is my very first razor that I have bought. The razor does a great job at getting a close shave and rotating around bends and curves. I highly recommend this along with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Clear Shaving Gel.</li>
    <li> I have shaved my face with every kind of shaver possible, disposable, electric or safety razor. They all worked fine for me. So when I received Gilette Fusion ProGlide Razor to try free as part of my BzzAgent campaign I was more than happy to do so. And boy oh boy, I was so surprised how well it works. It gave me a very clean and smooth shave.The razor contours your face, glides smoothly all over the face.&lt;br /&gt;And even though the Fusion ProGlide Razor is not the cheapest one, it is well worth it to buy it, use it and enjoy it! I really love this razor, and it has became the only one I am using now!!!</li>
    <li> Hello to all my friends. I am starting something new with Buzzagent.com.. This is a site that sends you samples to try out and you have to give you opinion on that product.  The best thing about it that is it all FREE. How cool is that. I just received my first samplefrom being a buzzagent.com myself. . Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor and Shaving Gel for Sensitive Skin. Lets first talk about the Shaving Gel.  It does have nice smell to it, (Alpine Clean).  When you first apply it, it comes out  blue , then when you rub it your hands it turns white. Goes on nice and thick, (which I like). My skin did not break out from using this product. And in fact, I did not have to use after shave. My skin was soft and scented. Has a nice grip at the top of the product, so you finger will not slip.  Has a swivel round top to lock it when you are not  using it and to lock it from curious children.  The bottle is made a plastic, so no more metal rings  in the counter tops or showers.&lt;br /&gt;Now, lets talk about the Razor.  This razor has a flex ball in the center of the razor. Meaning that it glides along your face, using thinner blades, giving you a clean close shave.  This razor has 5 blades total, for a perfect cut. Leaving you with no nicks or cuts.  You can also purchase refills for this razor. The razor is not light weight either. It is a pretty sturdy razor. Has a good design to it. I am sold that  this Razor by Gillette is the one for me. You will not be disappointed, when you purchase this razor and use it. Plus your female friends, will love to touch your face.  I recommend this razor for every man on the planet.</li>
    <li> This one is quite cheap. Especially, buy with a discount coupon.</li>
    <li> Too expensive!&lt;br /&gt;Try, Dollar Shave Club! Much better deal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very smooth shave. Probably one of the smoothest I have ever tried. It just feels loose sometimes, almost as if I can&#x27;t get a good connection with my face. Perhaps pressing down harder will fix it? Anyway, good razor but as many have said before, it&#x27;s not all that different to a regular razor.</li>
    <li> The quality of the goods is very good, very beautiful, other friends see the later also full of praise.But I also bought 4 pieces as a gift, why don&#x27;t you send me together, but can be divided into three times.</li>
    <li> meh!  Five blades work very well on the larger area of my cheeks and neck, but creates too large of a platform to get around the tight spots such as under the nose.  So I end up using my old twin blade as well.  Does not make since keeping two razors in the shower, so I donated this one to my Wife and her hairy legs!</li>
    <li> After 30 years of trying multiple razors, this is the first one I can use.  I have a heavy beard and thin skin, and every other razor I have tried has left me bleeding from multiple nicks (bad nicks that can take from minutes to hours to stop bleeding).  Up to now, the only practical option I have had is therefore using an electric shaver.  After receiving a free sample in the mail, I have been using the Fusion Proglide for a month now, and have had no trouble with it, no nicks!  For comparison I recently tried the Schick Hydro 5, and also the Fusion Proglide Power razor, but neither of them were as good (I don&#x27;t know if it was the slightly different blades, or perhaps the heavier handle, but the regular Fusion Proglide with its heavy metal handle worked significantly better than the Power version at slicing effortlessly through the bristles).  I would give it more than 5 stars if I could - for a person with my combination of beard &amp; skin type this is really revolutionary!</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a razor and it cuts hair just as well as any other Gillette Razor, but does the ball make any difference? I&#x27;m not sure if it does for a face, but I have noticed that it&#x27;s great for my legs. Those weird places around your knee and ankle seem to get a better shave with the adjusting head. I don&#x27;t seem to cut myself as often nor do I feel like I have to go over the same spot repeatedly to get into the crevices. Also, its great for the bikini line! I know it&#x27;s not pink, and I&#x27;m not sure why it works so well in-spite of the fact that it&#x27;s male branded, but all my girly shaving needs are met by this little guy.</li>
    <li> The #1 razor for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> As described and arrived on time.  Look forward to buying again in the future.</li>
    <li> I held off buying this for a while because I was certain this was another chapter in planned obsolescence by a product manufacturer.  Well, I was wrong.  Whether it&#x27;s physiological or not, this gizmo does give a closer shave.  For those considering replacing your Gillette Fusion handle, give it a try.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and I think you&#x27;ll be impressive.</li>
    <li> love the flex ball! shaves very nicely</li>
    <li> I like it alot help me  with the lines when i have a beard</li>
    <li> Damn good razor I&#x27;ve used it twice cuts good and is smooth no razor bumps but i use face wash after</li>
    <li> I am not very particular about my razors.  When they start to cut my face like a ghetto street fighter, I replace them.  Been using old Gillette&#x27;s for quite a while.  Upgraded to this and was surprised to discover my face COULD actually feel as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  This works well, pivots nicely, reaches all the nooks and crannies, without cutting off offending bumps and creases.  I like the functionality of being able to turn it over and use the trimmer blade to get up under the edge of the nose.  I&#x27;ve even used it in a pinch with just water, and lived to tell about it.  Currently use with cheap Edge shaving gel/hot water and I get no razor burn or nicks.  Maybe more expensive is better, or maybe I&#x27;m just drinkin&#x27; the Kool Aid.  If so, it is tasty stuff.</li>
    <li> One of the best razors out there but everyone has their opinion of what&#x27;s best for them.</li>
    <li> excellent product and meet what we buy. thanks</li>
    <li> Has a nice and close shave. the grip is very easy to handle. One of the best razors that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Never thought a razor like this can glide through my face with ease. Also, never though a razor could trim a lot of hair in seconds. This had me surprised.</li>
    <li> The handle is too small, too heavy and too slippery.  I am starting to develop a bit of carpal tunnel syndrome.  I do not like it nearly as much as the Fusion with the battery, which is lighter and easier to hold onto while using it.  IMHO the vibrating head is not a gimmick: it gives a better shave, in product that is more comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Fusion Proglide blades give good shave, three times. Obvious whisker pull thereafter considering the market cost.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide vs. Dorco Pace 6 Plus. The easy winner here is the Gillette Fusion. Here&#x27;s why; It&#x27;s a smoother shave than the Dorco. Given the cost of $45 you&#x27;ll spend to have 10 blades like the Dorco comes with it doesn&#x27;t seem like the smart money. Here&#x27;s the kick in the pants, the Gillette blades last forever compared to the Dorco blades and provide a super smooth shave for weeks at a time provided that you thoroughly rinse it after each use. This is in contrast to typical week or so you&#x27;ll get with the Dorco. As it turns out for me, I&#x27;d need to spend more money on Dorco Blades just to keep up with the Gillette and I still wouldn&#x27;t get as smooth a shave. I&#x27;d recommend the Gillette and the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Razor Blade Refills for Men, 8 Count. You&#x27;ll spend $45.58 vs the $20.99 for the Dorco (which by the way is a very good system) but over time I think you&#x27;ll come out ahead and you&#x27;ll be very pleased with the Gillette product.</li>
    <li> Never had a better shave ever.</li>
    <li> I am always impressed with the inventive design and quality of Gillette razors and this is their best so far. It does a great job on facial hair and is very comfortable to use. The blades are long lasting, don&#x27;t rust, and are easy to change. I once used a blade for an entire year, just to see how long they hold up. I change my blades every five to six months, because I find that is how long they last with daily use at optimum performance. My only criticism with this razor is it is difficult to clean when soap scum builds up. There are a lot of nooks and crannies that are hard to get to. Overall, this is a superior razor and a great value. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Delighted with my purchase.  The Gillette razor arrived as described by the Seller and it arrived ahead of schedule.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> You almost don&#x27;t feel the glide, yet it provides the cleanest shave I have ever had.</li>
    <li> Gives a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for men&#x27;s razors that are good for shaving legs.  (Women&#x27;s razors are more expensive.) This is a solidly built, very smooth, nick-free razor.  It shaves smoothly, without irritation.</li>
    <li> Just tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide FlexBall Handle Razor and I cannot believe what this razor delivers in grooming.  I have a goatee that needs to be shaved around and this works with precision trimming.  I am used to my electric razor and then using another trimmer razor for detail, but thought I&#x27;d give this a try and by golly, it worked.  Must be the Flexball Handle, because none of my other razors worked around the edges like this one does.  Close shave like most 5 bladed razors, but corners like no other.  I *do* have sensitive skin, which gets very dry in midwest winters, but this did not cause irritation. You&#x27;ve gotta try it!</li>
    <li> When used with Proraso shaving soap, this razor gives me the best shaves of my life. My only complaint and the reason for four stars instead of five is that the blades are insanely expensive. I manage to stretch the lifespan of blades by drying them immediately after use, avoiding corrosion that dulls the edges.</li>
    <li> The handle on the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor looks a little sleeker and feels more refined. I found the grip on the Fusion a bit, well, &amp;#34;grippier&amp;#34; and easier to hold on to with slick shaving cream. The Hydro does have a bit more heft and better balance than the Fusion manual razor and felt better in my hand. The Fusion also comes in a powered version while the Hydro does not -- it sounds gimmicky, but the high frequency vibrations of the powered razor does make a difference. The Hydro also comes in a 3 blade version sans trimmer. For the purpose of this review, I compared the manual version of the Fusion ProGlide to the Hydro 5. In comparing the two, I give the Fusion ProGlide a bit of an advantage -- the Hydro 5 didn&#x27;t shave quite as close as the Fusion, but it came in a very close second. On the first pass, the Hydro 5 slid over my face effortlessly, but also didn&#x27;t seem to take off much of my beard either. The second pass seemed to be where the shaving really began. Both razors gave me a close shave with no irritation -- a huge complement for me to give. My beard is fairly average, but my skin is so sensitive that it turns red if you look at it the wrong way. I would recommend this razor to anyone out there looking for a fairly close shave at a bargain.</li>
    <li> I received the Proglide Flexball razor as a free test product from Gillette. The razor gives me a close, comfortable shave regardless of the length of my facial hair. I shaved day-old stubble and a slightly longer (four day old) goatee with the same ease. The razor didn&#x27;t pull or tug whether I used it wet or dry. The Flexball allows the razor to conform to the contours of my face so I don&#x27;t have to &#x27;retrace.&#x27; The blades are also very durable. I&#x27;ve used this razor for about three weeks and it still shaves as closely and as comfortably as the first time I used it. I&#x27;ve not had any issues with nicks or razor burn either.</li>
    <li> Love the design. Close shave.</li>
    <li> Best razor I ever used in 60+ years of shaving!</li>
    <li> Feels Really smooth. Very good blade. Great Price for value</li>
    <li> Works really well, no complaints</li>
    <li> Gillette razors are the BEST razors on the market imo, they are sharp, precise, and EXPENSIVE! but they work well! My gf even uses Gillette for women, and she loves the way it shaves!</li>
    <li> I received this product to try for free thanks to Gillette. To make this simple, if you&#x27;re going to buy a new razor handle, and especially if you like Gillette&#x27;s cartridges, this is the one to get. I like the pivot for around my chin and jaw lines. The trimmer on the back is great for lining up my side burns and under my nose. The razor itself feels solid and fits well in my hand.  This razor isn&#x27;t going to change your life,  but if you&#x27;re in the market for a new razor, it really wouldn&#x27;t make much sense to buy an old handle anyways.</li>
    <li> My hobby is very happy with this product! He defanily recommended!</li>
    <li> Awesome razor! my head and face have never been smoother!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too bad that The Art of Shaving can&#x27;t make their expensive razor as good as the Gillette Proglide, not to mention they don&#x27;t even have one that is a power version with a flex ball</li>
    <li> This is the best razor</li>
    <li> Good clean shave!! Hope I can get a good deal on refills?</li>
    <li> What an amazing razor! I received this razor as part of a Gillette Fusion ProGlide BzzCampaign for BzzAgent.com. I was highly impressed with this razor as well as the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 shaving gel. The precision blade on the back side is great for trimming around your nose and ears, or if you&#x27;ve waited too long between shaves it helps to thin the hair before doing a full shave. The main blades of the razor stay sharp and don&#x27;t tug at the hair on your face. I would highly recommend this razor to anyone!</li>
    <li> Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Really like the trimming blade on the other side.</li>
    <li> Have been using my Gillette Pro Glide Razor for 5+ weeks now and it still shaves great&lt;br /&gt;No more dollar store razors for me&lt;br /&gt;I can throw out the cut and nick supplies to stop blood from my old razors&lt;br /&gt;Thnks BzzAgent</li>
    <li> thank you gillette.delivery timely nice product</li>
    <li> I normally use the fusion styler, so I compared this one to that.  This razor is smaller and thinner and doesn&#x27;t do the vibration that the styler has.  I&#x27;ve used this razor a few times and have to say it does a good job.  Like most of the fusion razors it is pretty comfortable and easy to replace blades.  Now, this particular version is highlighted by the flexball technology.  Well, personally, I didn&#x27;t see where this did anything for me.  I kept waiting to see how this helped but I didn&#x27;t.  Maybe I shave a little differently than some but I just didn&#x27;t see where having the blade pivot side by side helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good razor but the flexball just seems gimmicky to me.  I&#x27;d recommend this fusion if you can get it for a good price.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology balances well in the hand and shaves well, with the sharp blades providing a good clean shave.  The side to side pivoting head is a gimmick, as it does not really enhance the shave in any way.  Performance wise, it is on par with a Schick Quattro or any other multi blade razor, and shaves as well as the Mach 3.  The replacement blades are ridiculously expensive, at almost $4 a cartridge, particularly when compared to other multi-blade razors.  I cannot envision getting twice the life span out of these blades at almost twice the cost of others.</li>
    <li> Whether you think the Flexball technology is a gimmick or not, I still really like this razor (I was sent one from the company to try out).&lt;br /&gt;1. Still a quality shave from Gillette.  5 thin blades provide a close, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;2. Flip it over for precision shaving - a precision razor on the back lets you get those hard places, like just under your nose.&lt;br /&gt;3. Enhanced lubrastrip enables a gliding shave, an improvement for those with sensitive skin (or who just like good shaves).&lt;br /&gt;4. The Flexball moves with the contours of your face, like a Dyson vacuum cleaner on floors.  This is the one point I can&#x27;t say whether or not I was really feeling it.&lt;br /&gt;5. Good grippy handle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the shave was not about the Flexball for me, but it was a really good shave with or without the technology.</li>
    <li> I received the razor from Gillette to try and have loved it since receiving it - it&#x27;s a great close shave, and the new Flexball handle is amazing, it really follows the contours of my face and neck.  I&#x27;ve used a ton of different razors over the years and although some have been better than others, I would definitely say this was top-notch and amongst the best I&#x27;ve used so far.  I would definitely recommend giving it a try!</li>
    <li> Shaving is a pain, so anything helps. This new razor gives me a much close shave - in fact so close for the first few days, it was a bit much. Now my skin is used to it and I am really enjoying the closer shave.  I get no 5 o&#x27;clock shadow with this razor.</li>
    <li> Im a BzzAgent and I was fortunate enough to have been chosen to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Razor. The Gillette brand was kind enough to send me the razor to try out. Immediately after the first use I noticed a significant difference compared to other times I have shaven. Usually after a shave my face is irritated (skin looks very red) However with this razor I immediately got a close shave with every stroke that there wasn&#x27;t a need for me to constantly be reshaving the same spot to try to get that close shave which help me get that irritation free look after I was done. The flexball handle helps maneuver around the chin when shaving so I liked that. If you are someone who has sensitive skin like myself and have ended up with irritated skin after a shave try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Razor it just might help you out the way it did with me.</li>
    <li> I love the Flexball handle technology! It makes for a super close shave. The flexball makes it so much easier to shave my chin and neck without nicking myself..which I always seem to do! I now look forward to shaving!</li>
    <li> I use the regular Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor every day as my regular shaver.  I like to have the best clean cut shave in the morning and have found that even though the ProGlide is the most expensive, it offers the most clean shave.  I have used the same ProGlide handle for maybe two years now and just purchase the cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the new ProGlide with Flexball handle technology from Gillette to try and review.  The new ProGlide with Flexball uses the same cartridge as the one I have been using all the time so of course I got the same shave I was expecting and enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is so special about the Flexball?  Nothing.  It doesn&#x27;t really help in getting a closer shave or making it easier for the blades to travel.  I don&#x27;t think it even moved on the contours of my face.  In fact, a lot of times my thumb likes to rest on the flexball which hinders the movement in the first place.  All I can say is the Flexball is a gimmick.  The regular handle is just fine and I would be appalled if they decided to charge more just for the Flexball handle.</li>
    <li> I love the new flexball. It seems to move a lot better over my face. I think this is going to be my new replacement razor!</li>
    <li> When I received this razor I was excited but also hesitant as I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion Power and felt the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; greatly enhanced the shaving efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed is the handle contoured in just the right way to make shaving easy.  The blades were beyond sharp slicing right through my 2 day old stubble.  The real difference came when shaving either side of the neck and just under the jaw line.  The razor flexed and adjusted completely without me noticing but for the smooth skin left after just one pass!  I do have to remind myself not to put anymore than the lightest pressure when using a non-electric razor else I end up with skin irritation. (This is the case for all disposable razors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall fantastic, Fusion Power has sat in the drawer now since receiving this and the electric razor stares blankly at me wondering if I&#x27;ll ever use it again!</li>
    <li> I love these razors.  Fair price &amp; delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Works well.</li>
    <li> ...and you can tell, since this razor is black, this is meant for a man. But I need a new razor and here was the chance, so I grabbed it. And wow, it is very nice. So smooth, so smooth..</li>
    <li> [First and formost, I would like to thank Gillete for giving me a review copy for this review . Please note that this review is honest and I was not paid nor was told to review super negative or super positive on a said product ]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contents of package : The contents of the packaging has 2 cartridges and one razor with a really neat stand so that your razor wont get dirty in terms of bacteria on the bathroom/kitchen sink. Compatibility: The Gillette Proglide will work with Gillette Fusion blades.This makes you to not have to buy new blades if you already have the old ones ( a very nice feature for the price). Build quality: This build quality of the Gillette Proglide is one of the best I have ever seen from a razor. This razor is made of high quality plastic, when felt in your hands, feels like it will not break on you from one use. Use of Razor: This was a huge upgrade from the old cheap razors I had used. When the Gillette Proglide rubs along your skin , I feel no tugging, no cuts, no burns, and a nice clean shave on my face. Cleaning: Cleaning of the Gillette Proglide is very easy . Just put it over the sink with hot water and almost all of the gunk/hairs will fall out. Cleans very well. Comparison between a dollar tree razor versus Gillette Proglide + overall impression: I have been using dollar tree razors ever since I started shaving. There good for the price however, The razor starts to fade really quickly and thus gives you burns / cuts on your face. Also , the razors are very difficult to clean up with gunk being stuck on the razors and thus,not being hygienic. With the Gillette Proglide , it is very good for the price. With easiness of cleaning , the smoothness of the shave, and with high quality blades that will not fade for a very long time, I will now be using it as my primary razor and will recommend it to friends and relatives.</li>
    <li> I received this to try from Gillette and I must say it is now the only thing I&#x27;ll use.  Super close and comfortable shave and the flexball handle allows the blades to pivot and allow for maximum contact.  The battery may be a bit gimmicky, but I would definitely repurchase this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Gillette razor user for a while.  Ever since getting the Fusion Power, I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer.  Then, when Gillette offered to let me try the Flexball Handle, I was game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved my face this morning for the first time with the razor.  It&#x27;s almost like magic.  I generally struggle getting the hair behind my cheekbone (under my ear).  I usually will have to go up from the bottom, as well as down from the top, and I still will miss a spot sometimes.  This morning?  Different story.  Just one swipe and it was all gone.  I was amazed, truly.  I did manage to miss a spot or two on my chin, but overall, it was a great shaving experience.  I really felt the razor was contoured  to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it another try or two and come back and report in again (especially to see if I can get my chin better).  But my first impression?  A winner, and I can&#x27;t wait to see how this technology advances.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed the razor as it provided a very smooth shave as usual with the Gillette razors.  The one thing I noticed improvement on this razor over others was the chin area under my lip. That is usually a difficult area to get and takes several strokes with other razors and sometimes then patches are left.  With the new flexball technology I felt like this area was a much smoother and closer shave and I didn&#x27;t have to go over it several times to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing keeping this from five stars in my mind is the expensive cost of replacement cartridges.  The razor itself is fantastic, but not sure I can justify the outrageous cost for to replace the cartridges.</li>
    <li> Was using a Dollar Shave club razor and blade but quality of the blades became an issue - constantly having nicks/cuts after 2 or 3 shaves.  The Fusion Proglide system has been terrific - well worth the additional cost per week.</li>
    <li> My dad used this and loved it. He previously had the regular 5-blade Gillette Fusion razor but said the flexible head was even better.  He could get much closer and actually shaved faster.</li>
    <li> I have never had a bad razor from Gillette.  They&#x27;re a little expensive but have good quality.</li>
    <li> This item given to me for my review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not exfoliate using chemicals. My Korean beautician taught me to slather my face with moisturizer and run a razor over my face to get rid of peach fuzz, and any dead skin etc... She said, and I have since read, that the Japanese and Koreans have done this for centuries (although, I imagine they were not lucky enough to own a Gillette back then) The Gillette Fusion Proglide manual Men&#x27;s Razor seems to work well for this purpose. I actually prefer the old Gillette dual razor, but I can&#x27;t find them anymore. This Fusion Proglide worked, and it seemed to be gentle enough for my face with plenty of moisturizer. It did a good job.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s over priced and honestly to many blades. I&#x27;m a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow comes in by 2-3pm kind of guy. I shave everyday and I promise I gotten a better shave off using 4x blade from dollar shave club. The price was much cheaper to. Although it does have cool features there isn&#x27;t anything that separates this from any other blade. My shave is better with the 4x or my preference is actually with Harry&#x27;s razors. Basic handles no unesecary vibrations, just take an extra minute or two, so you can shave your face to perfection and in a cost efficient manner.</li>
    <li> As far back as I can remember, my dad always used a Gillette razor, and now I finally know why. Compared to other razors that I have used, the Gillette Fusion Proglide truly gives a quality and close shave. Prior to this I thought all razors were about the same, hence why I always bought the cheapest option. Now I know this is not true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball handle just looks like a razor for the modern man. It is futuristic looking with cool metal contours and orange and blue accents. The rubber grip is very comfortable in my hand and overall the handle is heavy enough to where it just feels like quality. The razor effortlessly gives a close shave with literally zero irritation. The Flexball technology allows it to adapt to every contour of my face and I rarely have to go over areas again since one swipe of the razor normally gets every hair. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me, but the blade feels a little wider than other razors, which covers more ground with each stroke and thus requires less strokes overall. And compared to my old razor, the blades are spaced apart enough so that not as much hair gets clogged between the blade, making it so I can use each blade a little longer. My only complaint (and a minor one at that) is that the holder is somewhat odd. It holds the end of the razor with the blades, but the other end of the handle sticks out and is not supported and looks kind of cheap. I keep my razor in a drawer, and if I happen to place something on top of the handle that is unsupported it can cause the handle-holder assembly to tip over. This is more of an annoyance that in no way affects the shaving performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very happy with the razor and plan on sticking with it! I think I have finally found a razor that is better than all the rest!</li>
    <li> Gillette is the best! There are not better razors.. This shaves you nice!!</li>
    <li> Perfect.  All from Packaging till price all perfect n satisfactory.</li>
    <li> Needed a New shaving  handle and am very satisfied with this one</li>
    <li> I have always judged the closeness of a shave by the amount of stubble the following day. I received the Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle free from Gillette and have been using it for three weeks now. I quickly discovered that this razor has provided me with the closes shave to date. My advice, if getting a close smooth shave isn&#x27;t important to you, continue using your current razor. Otherwise I would highly recommend buying the new Fusion Proglide with Flexball and experience it for yourself.</li>
    <li> I tried this for free from Gillette. Works like a charm. Nice clean shave. Minimal effort. Faster shave, too. The flexball makes it easy to match my face&#x27;s contours.</li>
    <li> I received this free from gillette in the mail, so i thought i would give it a try.  I normally use a 3 blade dispoabile razor and shave every day Monday through Friday and not on the weekends.  Then I throw it away and use a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave was not any closer on monday morning than my normal 3-blade.  Did not take less time, did not take less strokes.  Also, the head is so bulky, it is really difficult to get under your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it has a &amp;#34;flexball&amp;#34; but i dont see the point.  Maybe if I was shaving the top of my head it might come in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, the razor is well built - but it makes it very heavy for its size.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2Z2G3J4OYUQKM]]This is a review for the Gillette fusion proglide silver touch Men&#x27;s razor. I received this product free to try out and there are a few things that I liked about the razor right away. First was that it looks REALLY cool, I love the silver look and the hints of blue. As far as how it works, it works great.&lt;br /&gt;The swivel rocking head works great and adjusts to the contours of your face perfectly, especially under your neck and the side of your chin area just below your ear. It is actually quite a simple design, the head can rotate up and down, and there is another hinge at the neck that allows it to rotate left and right, this is what helps it adjust to your face to get those tricky spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette fusion razor gave me a very smooth close shave and left my skin feeling as soft and smooth as a baby&#x27;s rump. I didn&#x27;t use store bought shaving cream though, I used my own homemade mixture of coconut oil, baking soda, and Shea butter which helped make my skin baby smooth and irritation free. Another plus is that I did not even come close to nicking myself or cutting myself while shaving, I got a close smooth shave without any mishaps. My face did break out a bit afterwards but I think that was because of my sensitive skin and not the razor&#x27;s fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette fusion proglide silvertouch razor also comes with a second attachable razor blade head underneath the packaging in case the first one wears out.  So far I am pretty happy with this razor and I thought it works great, it does exactly as advertised. For about $10 USD you will get an amazing manual razor that gives you the close shave you&#x27;ve been looking for. I can honestly say that it did a better job than my electric razor. 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the bad video quality! I had to convert it to a smaller size because the original was too big. :3</li>
    <li> The advertised description states it has 2 refills. It has 1 refill. The razor come with one blade and 1 refill. This is deceptive. He I known there was only one refill, I would never have purchased it. That is the reason for the one star.</li>
    <li> This razor work great at hugging the contours of your face and give you a clean, smooth, and razor burn free shave. The blades last a long long time too, buy with confidence you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> This product works really well for men who shave their heads.  The Flexball allows you to take longer strokes, without the worry of missing spots.  I would definitely recommend this product to a friend, and I am glad I was introduced to it!</li>
    <li> I normally use an electric razor, but for this free trial from Gillette I made the switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillete Fusion ProGlide Razor gives a nice feel with the pivioting head.  I was able to made fewer passes to get all the hair, which left me with reduced burn, which I greatly enjoyed.  I was able to get a nice close shave with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside for me, was that I don&#x27;t like to use shaving cream.  Its an unnecessary mess that can be easily avoided with an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I was happy to give this new razor a shot, but no thanks I&#x27;ll stick with my electric.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m torn in my review of this razor. I&#x27;ve used Gillette razors for years and they always work well. This one is no exception ... with a caveat. On the pro side: It does what it says it will do which is give you a good shave. I can&#x27;t tell the flexible head helps much. I didn&#x27;t see it moving and didn&#x27;t have a complaint with my old handle. But here&#x27;s the negative: it&#x27;s expensive. The handle itself isn&#x27;t too bad I suppose but the blades are a killer. Over four bucks per blade. I get tired of paying for that so I tried one of new mail-order shaving clubs and found they work just fine, too, at a fraction of the cost. In fact, for the past week I&#x27;ve shaved one side of my face with the Gillette and one side with the other brand and couldn&#x27;t tell a difference. So while it does do a good job, why should I pay more when something else works just fine?</li>
    <li> For years razor companies have been content to add another blade to their previous top of the line model, make it incompatible with their old handles, and call it a day.  Even Saturday night comedy shows made fun of them introducing a ridiculous looking 20 blade model.  The new flexball handle from Gillette shows there is some innovation still left in the manual razor world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors since their Mach 3 blades and have tried all their new fusion products including the power handles.  Each advance in the technology since the Mach 3 has been minimal.  Sure an extra 2 blades may get you a micron closer of a shave, but it was never anything that different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new Flexball handle isn&#x27;t just another blade.  It&#x27;s still compatible with the old Fusion blades too which makes it a cheap and worthwhile upgrade for anyone who uses the Fusion razors.  The flexball pivots about 20 degrees in either direction with minimal force supplied by a piece of spring steel.  The construction feels very solid, the handle is heavy and feels no different than the old fusion in your hand (which is a good thing as I&#x27;ve always liked the balance and weight).  The pivot adds a feature you normally find in some high end electric models.  It allows the blade to conform to your face and give you a closer shave with fewer passes.  I&#x27;ve found that it tends to cause less irritation on my neck than the fixed blade because it allows the blade to cut flat instead of at an angle on your skin which reduces the chance of razor burn.  I&#x27;ve never timed myself shaving, but it also feels like it doesn&#x27;t take as long to shave as the old handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the new &amp;#34;docking station&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s shorter than the old ones and the razor handle sticks out about 2 inches from the end.  It&#x27;s not as stable and is harder to pull out with 1 hand.  It&#x27;s not a deal breaker by any means, but I can&#x27;t see any advantage to the new design except less plastic and manufacturing costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like the new handle, and for a street price of ~$12 with 2 blades it&#x27;ll only cost you ~$4 to upgrade to the new handle and enjoy all the benefits of the R&amp;D they put into it.  I&#x27;m not sure if Gillette plans to introduce a version for women (not that the razors are really any different except for colors), but I gave my wife the other blade that came with the razor and she tried it out while shaving her legs and really liked the pivoting head as well.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve gotten the razor, my shave has been smooth and close. I like the flexball technology, although my type of shaving doesn&#x27;t require too many angles. It&#x27;s still a comfortable and smooth experience. I still haven&#x27;t cut myself with it, and for being a brand new razor, that&#x27;s a big deal. I can&#x27;t find anything to complain about. It&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
    <li> Received a sample of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall from Gillette and I am very happy with it. It provides a smoother, closer shave than my old Mach 3. I keep a full beard, but shave my neck everyday. The Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall was particularly good at shaving this sensitive area.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor from Gillette to try out , I have always shaved with gillette but this razor makes it a even better shave , no razor bumps and didn&#x27;t cut me at all .&lt;br /&gt;Great product overall will be buying one soon !</li>
    <li> A well designed addition to the Fusion family. The design is simple and sturdy. At first I expected that the flexball would be too &amp;#34;twisty and make it difficult to groom my goatee, but it is actually quite easy to control. In fact I find that the flexability makes it easier to get a close shave, especially when I am in a rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this product a 4 star review because I feel that it is lacking feature:  I have used several other Fusion Proglide products, and I personally find that I prefer the powered razors. This razor does not have the powered feature but I really feel that the slight vibration really helps to reduce the amount of &amp;#34;Tug&amp;#34; as the razor dulls and extends the usable life of the replacement heads.</li>
    <li> Gillette seems to need to come up with something a little different every couple of years to protect their virtual monopoly of the shaving market. More blades, electric vibrations, lubricating strips. They ratchet it up a small notch just to keep the franchise fresh, I suppose. The rear facing blade and easy rinsing were the last major improvements for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the cost of entry is relatively low, I pretty much always check out the latest and greatest from Gillette. This one puts the head of the razor on a spring-loaded swivel. It can now move off the perpendicular a few degrees which supposedly allows it to follow the contours of your face more precisely. But I can&#x27;t tell the difference. It works fine, but so did the last iteration. And the blades are the same as the Fusion Proglide, so there&#x27;s no news there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is interested, I also want to put in a good word for Harry&#x27;s razors and blades. They are a start-up apparently from the same people who brought you Warby Parker eyeglasses. I guess they like to position themselves against near monopolies. Anyway, the Harry&#x27;s stuff works just fine and costs a lot less than the $4 Proglide blades. Nice design, too. So worth a look, though you may miss the convenience of the rear-facing sixth blade of the newer Gillette blades. I keep both at the ready.</li>
    <li> First let me say I am not a manual shaver normally its the old Thomas Edison powered electric razor for me, secondly I would like to thank Gillette for a free trial razor( Very cool of you dudes and dudettes). With those two disclosures being said just had my first shave with the proglide. After applying ample amounts of non aloe shaving cream I went to hacking, or should I say gliding. Thing thing was smooth for a manual razor, I didnt feel any tugging at all even when it sliced in to my mole ( c8ndy crawford beauty mark as my mom puts it). It was a nice close shave took a couple passes on the thick of my neck but got it smooth as a babies but. Now coming from an electric razor it would take an act of god to convert me to manual, and although this was good, its no water into wine. That being said if this thing excreted shaving cream before it hover crafted over my face, and made it soy neck was not irritated, I would be a convert. I will however use this on special occasions where the wife wants me in james bond mode.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many razors over the years and this is by far the smoothest and closest shave you can get. My facial hair grows very thick, very fast and no matter how lazy I get about shaving, this razor swipes my face clean without a hitch. Also, I start to show a 5 O&#x27;Clock shadow very quickly after shaving and this is the first razor where I actually made it past 5:00 before it started to show. I&#x27;m beyond impressed with this razor; it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve bought a razor and thought it was worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I use to shave my head it works the best out of all the razors I tried. I get about 4 head and face shaves per a razor and I am thick</li>
    <li> The overall construction is solid. Razor has a nice heft. The adjustable shaving head is comfortable. It easily glides over the face. I replaced my older Fusion cause I had a few extra bucks on a gift card. Not a giant leap up in innovation from Fusion razor but worth the extra bucks. I shave everyday and 1 blade lasts a month.</li>
    <li> The reviews by the women, who palce it at a 5 star rating is the correct one! This razor is both longer, wider, and far better than any special edition corvette you will ever own. You can shave, not that close, and you can forget shaving for at least 2 days. It is virtually impossible to nick yourself as a did when removing those little hairs in the creases of my chin! I will be very hard for the Gillette Co. to outdo this model. Do not shave that close at first guys,and then just wait, and take their money on refills.</li>
    <li> I had decided to try this out, as getting a good shave is so rewarding. However I have been disappointed. I find the shave is not any closer, and is less even than with the regular Proglide and I won&#x27;t be recommending this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am a guy that normally uses an electronic razor but I got one of these in the mail from the company to try out. I hoped that I would get a closer shave and not have to shave as often, well guess what I was correct. The proglide with flexdall was great a nice smooth shave and with the moving head it was a lot easier to shave around my jaw and even shave my head and the best part no cuts, scrapes or bumps (I usually get bumps) I used it with the Gillette shave gel and it was a very nice shave .</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first with the claims of this razor.  I got a free one to try from Gillette and it&#x27;s the best razor ever. First thing that struck me was the weight of the razor it was nice to have a little bit of weight to it. It did feel like light plastic I&#x27;m my hand. I not only shave my face but I also shave my head and no more nicks cuts or razor rash.. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different razors but this will be the last one I try for a while.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve used the proglide razor in previous iterations and wasn&#x27;t that impressed.  It always seemed that it just wasn&#x27;t quite where the competitors&#x27; blades were.  This new one however did the trick.  I decided to give it a bit of a test for the first couple of uses.  For the first shave I went about 9 days without shaving knowing that it would be a little more difficult to have a comfortable shave with the razor.  The proglide with flexball handle took it all in stride.  I had to go over areas multiple times and the razor glided over the contours of my face with ease and without causing razor burn or irritation.  The second shave was about 4 days later; again to give the razor a little test.  It passed this one as well however this time there was a bit of irritation.  I&#x27;m not quite sure if I was being overzealous because of the first good shave or if the razor didn&#x27;t handle as well with the hair not being as thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the razor did much better than I expected since previous versions weren&#x27;t up to par.  I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone in the market for a new razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every Gillette razor they have come out with, but I still prefer my old 2 blade model. At this point, I don&#x27;t think there is really much that can be done to make a difference. Everything they&#x27;ve been changing is just for the sake of marketing something new. The pivoting head I really don&#x27;t think adds much. Surprisingly, it only goes back and forth, not all over like on a Dyson ball vacuum. That being said, this razor does delivery a very smooth shave. As I complained before, there are so many razors in it it is hard to get into tight spots on your face, like under your nose. They have added a little razor blade on the back side, however, that does help get in those spots, and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive but the handle is very well constructed and substantial.</li>
    <li> I received my Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Technology, from Gillette. Before receiving this razor, I was using a ProGlide (minus the flexball) to shave my head. The three stars are for the FlexBall handle itself. The razor blade cartridge on it&#x27;s own, would get a 5 star ratting. After trying the FlexBall Razor, I found that while the razor did an excellent job of cutting hair and leaving behind smooth skin, the FlexBall felt a little too loose when cutting long strokes along my scalp. It made it somewhat hard to cut straight lines and instead wobbled as I pulled each stroke across my head. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it did cut hair very well, and pulled through hair very well, but the FlexBall just felt weird and wobbly while shaving. One characteristic I like about ProGlide handles is, if you grab one with wet hands, the initially feel somewhat slippery. But, if you simply run it under water for just a second, (get it all the way wet) - it becomes VERY easy to hold on to and quite easy to grip.</li>
    <li> Oh Gillette how I&#x27;ve missed you! When I was in college and in my early twenties, I was a religious Gillette user. After getting married and having a bunch of kids, I tried to pinch a few pennies and opted for inexpensive razors. For the most part, these give you an OK shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy to have a chance to review the new Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor and boy did I realize just how much I&#x27;ve missed my old shaving buddy Gillette. The Fusion Proglide boasts an amazing 5 blades! After shaving with one of these, your face will be as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hats off to Gillette for continuing to push the bar higher and higher with amazingly high quality razors. I&#x27;m a fan and Gillette user once again. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I recently received the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Technology from Gillette. I have been able to utilize the razor multiple times to truly gauge my satisfaction with it. To date, it has provided a smooth even shave. It hasn’t required multiple runs over the same area. I have not noticed the dryness or irritation that I often encountered when using razors with multiple blades. I didn’t feel the tugging on my hairs like I have with multiple blade razors in the past. I tend to lather up greatly with the shaving cream since I have thick, coarse hair. The streamlined comfort guard channels allowed me to still maintain the closeness without the build up and shake off I generally have to do when I have so much cream. The FlexBall pivot was the only aspect that bothered me. I was worried I would knick myself terribly because of the ease at which it swiveled. I felt powerless with the free moving motion of the head. I didn’t like the feeling that I could cut myself at any moment. Shaving is a necessary evil task, but you shouldn’t feel anxious because of the swivel. It may be better on a chiseled, well defined, toned face, but not all faces fit that mold. Don’t get me wrong; the shave was phenomenal with efficiency (less run overs of the same area) and efficacy (close shave), but the FlexBall feature I could take or leave…preferably leave.</li>
    <li> As is most Gillette razors, this one works well;</li>
    <li> I have used a wide variety of razors from a straight razor to a BIC razor to a Gillette MAC3 shaver. You can indeed shave with them all, but if you are looking for that close shave with fewer strokes... I think you need to check out this new razor by Gillette called the &#x27;Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball&amp;#34;. Initially I thought it was a pure gimmick just to sell a new line of razors...I was so wrong! I really did use fewer strokes and lesser effort to shave with this razor. I usually have a hard time shaving over my neck and I always have stubborn hair that is hard to shave. Surprisingly this razor was able to get out even those stubborn hairs and stumbles leaving me with a clean shaven face and neck. If you are like me and have thick stubborn facial hair growth this is the razor for you. I was even able to fit this razor handle onto the fusion blades I already had...that really saved me a lot of money. The flexball really does work and it does really adjust to my face contour, you will notice this the most when you shave from your face over your jaw line and onto your neck...the whole stroke is effortless and easy.&lt;br /&gt;The fusion cartridges do cost alot, but then they last for over a month for me and I shave every-other day. I honestly think its worth the investment and you will thank yourself for getting a good practical razor.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from gillette as a promotion to try and I must say that I am impressed.  The flex ball technology made it very simple and easy to use.  It got virtually ever hair on my face.  I would highly recommend this product to a friend, family member, relative, etc.  I feel this is an excellent product overall and would be the perfect fit for virtually anyone.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used.The swivel enhancement helps a lot in shaving my beard.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor for a lady. Flexible head, very pleasant to use, removes hair with no cuts or skin abrasions. Price on Amazon is the best. Comes with 2 cartridges.  Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I just got the new Proglide from Gillette. It&#x27;s really nice but I&#x27;m not sure it shaves any closer than the Fusion. With the Proglide, I cut myself for the first time shaving in over a year and I don&#x27;t recall cutting myself with the Fusion. The second time I shaved with the Proglide, I held it much lighter and didn&#x27;t cut myself and the shave felt fantastic...maybe the best ever. However, my beard came back much faster. So with the Fusion, I believe I can shave closer, but it doesn&#x27;t feel as good. With the new Proglide, I can barely hold it and it feels lighter and seems to shave on it&#x27;s own, but if I try to get as close of a shave, I am concerned I will cut myself again.</li>
    <li> i thought i would miss the vibrations of the Fusion Power razor, but after the first few times i became used to the new razor and very happy with it.. my shave was fast and very close.  also like the smaller holder it fits in vs th much larger holder of the fusion pwer razor.. the pivoting of the head is very nice on my neck.. my only concern is the much bigger cost for razor and the blades.. also does not say if these blades will fit the fusion power ir vice-versa as i have about 6 blades left form the power razor.. all in all i do like this new razor very much</li>
    <li> As a straight razor user, this Gillette fusion proglide is freakishly smooth. I had to check my face several times to make sure it was cutting the whiskers. The gel tip is really a bonus. It glides like a skater on ice.The swivel head makes smooth navigation over the face and neck. It is also well balanced in weight. Using this Gillette fusion Proglid is the shavers dream.</li>
    <li> The love of my life is a bit fussy with razors as am I and when this one became available to try I jumped on it.  I&#x27;m always looking for a better longer lasting razor and this is the best yet.  Tim has been using this for two weeks now and he just told me that he thinks it will be time very soon to change the blade head.  He shaves every other day so for this to last two weeks for him is good.  He likes the way it curves to get in those funky spots that you have to make faces  to get into usually and he said the blades give him the closest shave he&#x27;s gotten yet especially without nicking or little cuts.  This is a good company and has been around for longer than I care to think but their quality keeps improving to meets the customers wants which is what does indeed keep a good company in business.</li>
    <li> I recently received this product compliments of Gillette. Of the many razors I&#x27;ve used in the past, this one is by far the best. Previous razors were inflexible, irritable, and didn&#x27;t cut smooth. Gillette ProGlide is one razor that surpassed my expectations in every measure. It have a flex ball that adjusts to the contours of your body.  It also has a lubricant that makes it easy to shave. One quick swipe and the hair is gone. It is great even for shaving your head (trouble spot with most razors). The FlexBall makes it easy to shave the weird spots. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have just recently had the chance to  try the Gilette fusion proglide with the flex ball handle, and let me tell you ,what a difference. I have been using the Gilette proglide for years now and thought it was fantastic, but what a difference the flex ball handle makes. I have never had a closer cleaner shave. I would and have recommended it to all of my friends. Great razor hands down.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me a Proglide Razor with Flexball handle to try out and see what I thought about this new razor. I was always a disposable razor person.  It was how I was taught to shave and how I was raised.  After my first shave with the Proglide Razor I was a convert.  I have a square/round face.  I found that I didn&#x27;t have to shave the same area twice or three times (like when I used a disposable razor) and that the Proglide Razor really hugged my facial curves and corners. After the first week I knew that I would never be buying disposable razors again and I would be sticking with the Gillette Proglide Razor with Flexball handle from now on.  Gillette sending out a free razor gained a new loyal friend and customer.  5 star review for this 5 star razor. CHEERS!</li>
    <li> I love Gillette products, and this is no exception.  As expected the shave was clean and close. The addition of the Flexball Handle Technology was novel and easy to maneuver.  I wouldn&#x27;t necessary say the new handle improved the quality of the shave, but it&#x27;s hard to improve on near perfection.</li>
    <li> First off, I want to thank Gillette for providing a product sample of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor for review. Upon receipt, I started to incorporate the razor into my daily routine, and upon wearing through both blades I am now writing this review. I typically shave twice daily unless I&#x27;m growing a beard, once in the morning before heading to work and a second time in the evening before bed as I accumulate a fairly heavy five o&#x27;clock shadow throughout the day. My typical shaving routine is the use of an electric razor at night when I shower, and a straight razor or single edged safety razor in the morning. This is pretty much a tried and true routine for me, although I&#x27;m always open to anything that would improve the experience. For the purposes of this review I replaced the electric razor with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide as it did not provide a close enough shave to replace a straight razor in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With any system, you&#x27;ve got your positive and negatives. There are some definite positives to this razor...the handle is well contoured and comfortable, the replacement blades are very reasonably priced, and it&#x27;s virtually impossible to cut yourself due to the design of the cartridges (especially compared to a straight razor). The FlexBall does work, although perhaps not as advertised in my experience. I suffer from a mild repetitive strain injury from keyboarding/mouse usage, and shaving sometimes aggravates that. The FlexBall for me tended to work less as a manner of getting the closest shave, but rather lent itself towards creating a more efficient shaving process, requiring less touch up than a rigid cartridge style razor would with the strokes I normally use. The razor is not without it&#x27;s issues, however, and my main gripe is the quality of the shave that you receive from it. I&#x27;ve never been impressed with the multi blade cartridge designs, and find  that they tend to clog fairly quickly as I have fairly dense facial hair. This razor suffers from that same problem, and as I mentioned before of the increased efficiency of the shave, you also have to clean the razor out after a fewer number of strokes. Secondly, and most importantly, it still doesn&#x27;t come close to the quality of shave you get from a single edged safety razor or a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all positives and negatives weighed, the Fusion ProGlide is a solid 3/5 and by far the best cartridge razor I&#x27;ve ever used. It has it&#x27;s place, for someone looking for a quick shave that doesn&#x27;t want to use an electric razor, it&#x27;s a good fit. If you&#x27;re looking for the closest shave possible, however, you still can&#x27;t beat a straight razor, or even a single edged safety razor (which, coincidentally, my safety razor of choice is a vintage Gillette. Maybe they should look into bringing those back...).</li>
    <li> I hate shaving. For years I used electrics. However, my last electric took me 15 minutes to shave, so I borrowed a friend&#x27;s Gillette Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one effortless and painless swipe, you get a super close shave. In about 60 seconds, I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new model, with the Flexball handle tech is even better, although not dramatically so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, if you have the previous model of the Fusion, I wouldn&#x27;t upgrade.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Gillette and when I received a free razor from Gillette I was like great. I was just expecting another razor nothing special but I was so wrong. This razor was amazing. It was a nice smooth and close shave that I don&#x27;t get from other razors. The flexball technology allows for that close shave and also allows the razor to contour to my face. I have never really had a close shave like the one I got with this razor. If you are looking for a razor that can glide over your face and not have to stop to switch angles then this is the razor for you. Always been a fan of Gillette and this is nice upgrade in my opinion.</li>
    <li> When Gillette sent me this razor to try, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much more than a gimmick playing off the popular high-end vacuum brand with the ball technology.  Much to my surprise, the subtle side to side movements afforded by the Flexball handle made for a nice comfortable shave.  The blade seems to stay flatter against the skin for a closer, more efficient shave.  One con, however, the moisturizer strip seems to wear out quickly.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me this product in order to give it a try...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Gillette products, and this is no exception. As expected the shave was clean and close. The addition of the Flexball Handle Technology was novel and easy to maneuver. I wouldn&#x27;t necessary say the new handle improved the quality of the shave, but it&#x27;s hard to improve on near perfection.</li>
    <li> I recieved a razor for testing from Gilette.  I have to say that I have not kept up with the current razor trens as my Mach 3 was still my go to razor.  However the fusion is now my new choice.  I felt it provided a great close shave and continued the great quality that I had come to trust from my Mach 3.  I am happy to say that the Mach 3 has now been retired and repalced by the Fusion, providing my best shave possible.</li>
    <li> Not just for the guys.  Women have all sorts of contours that they shave also and this razor is absolutely wonderful for that purpose.  Love the ball head - makes it slide over my knees and under my arms without a single problem.  I don&#x27;t know why razor manufacturers don&#x27;t realize that many, many women prefer a man&#x27;s razor.  I don&#x27;t need the bells and whistles on so-called &#x27;ladies&#x27; razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now I have a minor war on my hands.  Better half used this the other day and wants to take it away from me - he just loved the smoothness that the five blades gave (which is one of the reasons, I love it too).  So, I reckon I&#x27;m going to have to buy him his own.  Hands of my new razor.</li>
    <li> I received my free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor (with &amp;#34;FlexBall&amp;#34; handle technology) from Gillette and put it to work this morning. The result? My skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt. I know that sounds kind of cliche, but I actually do have a 3 month old baby at home and her butt really is exceptionally smooth. But I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, I wasn&#x27;t blessed with a bountiful wealth of facial hair, but I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a few days and was a little nervous about shaving off whatever I&#x27;d grown out. But this razor did the trick. I didn&#x27;t really have to go over any spots more than once, which helped prevent any razor burn. And the tougher areas that did require an extra once over felt totally fine afterwards - no irritation, no bleeding. And now almost 12 hours later my skin STILL feels pretty smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only small complaint is that I wish it had a plastic cover for the blade. As it comes it&#x27;s a large plastic thing that holds blades and the razor all in one which is a little bulky, and the razor doesn&#x27;t snap in to place on holder well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the whole &amp;#34;FlexBall&amp;#34; thing is nice and sounds great, but it&#x27;s almost TOO flexible. Going around the chin line I almost wished there was a little more rigidity to it because it bent, or &amp;#34;flexed&amp;#34; too easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all that&#x27;s a really small complaint. The razor itself was awesome and I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Well I have now been using the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle, that I recieved from Gillette, for nearly 3 weeks and I am still loving it. I love how it follows the contours of my face and glides effortlessly, all while giving me a close and smooth shave. I have very sensitive skin, so a good and easy shave is a must. I am definitely sold on this product. And the best part is that I am still on the original blade cartridge that came with the razor! If you want a smooth, close shave, then buy the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle!</li>
    <li> A nice close shave and I actually felt like I got done shaving faster!  I couldn’t of been more satisfied with this item and I will definitely be purchasing it in future!</li>
    <li> I received this from the company to try out and I love it. It just glides over my face, I don&#x27;t feel any tugging and it shaves well enough that I don&#x27;t have to go over an area more than once. I end up getting a better shave than my last razor in less time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion razor for a few years now and have tried both the powered and unpowered (manual) versions extensively. That is a great blade - expensive but gets the job done. So I was excited to see how Gillette had improved on the design of the Fusion with the Flexball version. I&#x27;m not sure how much the Flexball actually moves the razor head while I&#x27;m shaving - I shaved slowly around some contours of my face and really didn&#x27;t see much movement unless I intentionally changed angles (like those pivoting vacuum heads) but this just made it awkward to shave. I believe the blade was to be improved but I also didn&#x27;t feel like I got a closer shave compared to my regular Fusion Power razor. I did like the handle. It&#x27;s a bit heavier than the plastic handle of my Fusion Power and has a nice grip. All in all, I don&#x27;t feel or see much of the improvement and will probably stick to what I&#x27;ve been using from Gillette.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide FlexBall has to be one of the most amazing razors I have used. It glides around my face like butter. I will never use a regular razor ever again. I showed all my friends and family member and they love it as well. I  received the product from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I think this razor is good and a great new idea, but not really much more than the novelty of a different handle.  This is just a cool trick to get people to spend money on a new handle.  The razor is the same as the other Fusion.  If you need a razor, buy this one, but I wouldn&#x27;t replace my old Fusion with a new one just because this one has a Flexball Handle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall that I got for free from Gillette for almost 2 months and I have never had a better shave.  I&#x27;m turning 40 this year, so over the years I&#x27;ve gone through a bunch of different razors.  I&#x27;ve always preferred Gillette razors, but this is the best one that they have made yet.  The flexball lets the razor glide over the natural bumps in a man&#x27;s face and neck.  I&#x27;ve recommended this razor to friends, and will gladly continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I recently switched from a multi blade razor to an old school double edged safety razor.  I did this for two reasons:  the cost of the cartridges keep climbing and climbing and I thought this razor was good enough for my grandfather, so why not try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette sent me this Fusion Pro Glide sample asking that I write a review for them.  When I received this Gillette Fusion Pro Glide, it felt like heaven compared to the old school razor I&#x27;d been using.  Being the skeptic that I have become over the years, I wanted to use this for a while before I wrote a review on the new handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette does make awesome razors and has been on the leading edge of shaving technology.  This one fits within their history.  I liked the way it seemed to hug my skin a little better than previous Gillette razors I have used.  Is it enough to warrant going out and buying it for the \\&quot;FlexBall Technology\\&quot; after using it for a while?  I don&#x27;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the same closeness as my other Gillette Fusion razor with no cuts and burn after using it.  It does a much better job when I&#x27;d go a couple days without shaving as compared to using it daily.  Will I replace my double edged safety razor with this one?  No I will not.  The cost of the replacement cartridges is too high for me, but I will hang on to it for the times when I need a very close shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced the cartridge and gave it to my wife to try since she love all of my razors except the \\&quot;grand dad one\\&quot; so she called it.  It felt very good in her hands and the FlexBall helped to move around her ankles a much better than the Mach 3 she normally uses.  She also loved the way it handled under her arms since she didn&#x27;t have to go over and over the same spot due to the nicer blades on the cartridges with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both give it a huge thumbs up for the way it feels after we&#x27;re done shaving.  Thank you Gillette for sending me this to try out!  You&#x27;re leading the development of razors very well!  I have to give it only 4 stars simply due to the cost of the cartridges.</li>
    <li> I just received my new Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball . It provided the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with a manual razor, without any nicks or cuts. The Flexball allows the razor to glide over all contours of my face without any pulling or catching on cheeks or chin. I had been using Gillette Mach3 Disposable but will definitely make the switch to Fusion Proglide as my face feels much smoother and without any nicks.</li>
    <li> iReceived this product from gillete and couldn&#x27;t be any more satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;leaves a smooth babes butt skin sensation on my face and the new flex ball technology gets every hair at all times even those under the chin!&lt;br /&gt;easy to use easy to clean great product all around.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent razor it&#x27;s better than any other ones</li>
    <li> I just got this razor from Gillette and I&#x27;m impressed by how solid it feels in my hand and the important shave feels still really good after one week of daily shaving  !!</li>
    <li> Love It, Love It! Such a close shave. No cuts or ugly bumps afterwards. Great feel and smooth skin afterwards. Makes touching it even more pleasant. The vibrating action makes it feel like it is getting it as close as it can get. Love It! #BzzAgent. #GotItFree. definitely going to be buying lots of refills for this puppy.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Handle Technology is yet another feather in Gillette&#x27;s cap of constant innovations. Your mileage may vary. The razor felt like it &amp;#34;dragged&amp;#34; across the flat sides of my face  and I had to put more pressure than Im used to shave with it. I am a daily pro glide power user who gets  a 5 o clock shadow within 12 hours of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s where the razor shined, when I had to go over my chin, the razor glided across and cut the grain well.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure, I did receive this razor from Gillette as a trial. I am almost exclusively an electric razor user, and have been for the past 2 years. That being said, I was impressed with the Fusion&#x27;s performance. I unintentionally had 3 days growth when I used it for the first time. It glided across my face, and really did a great job on the first pass. Aside from under and on my chin, I really only needed that 1 pass. Usually I have a harder time getting a close shave on the lower part of my neck, because the hairs are finer. But this did a great job. There is a trim blade on the back side which I was able to use to trim up my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside that I found was that the second time I used the razor, I did get a bit of razor burn on my neck. Now, because I am so used to electric, I am going to chalk that up to not cleaning it well enough afterwards. But I did think it was worth mentioning.</li>
    <li> This razor has been great! It took me awhile to get use to the movement of the blade part but after having a close shave around very curve of my face I really enjoy it now!!</li>
    <li> Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, the razor is not bad, its just that there seems be be only a few minute changes from the only proglide to this one. Theres not much to say, I owned the previous Proglide and switching from that razor to this razor has yielded very few differences, that being said, it is definitely a step up, but its such a small step that you could easily skip this step and wait for the next one. Yes the grip is better, and the shave is even closer, but in reality, there are practically no differences to the old Proglide. The razor I received from Gilette will definitely convince me to switch to the newer line of Proglide razors, but I doubt that most people will notice the differences.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving but it is a necessity and I am always on the lookout for the next great razor to make the task less daunting. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall Technology is a man&#x27;s tool but if it works for their delicate faces then why not my body hair?  So I used it while lathered up in the shower and it worked quickly and cleanly at removing hair from my legs, underarms and more delicate regions and I had zero cuts due to the 4 blades and the smooth gliding due to the flexball. It even went around my kneecaps with ease and that&#x27;s usually where I get a nick or two. I loved the handle grip and I will be buying this one when it is on sale to keep in my shower for  safe comfortable hair removal.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor! As an African American it gets really close with out the razor bumps and irritation.</li>
    <li> I am a regular shaver but not daily.  I figured I would give this razor a try to see how well it performed in comparison to my normal razor (Schick Hydro5).  Granted, the new flexball did move to the contours of my face, but from a shaving perspective, in my opinion, it did not perform any better than what I am used to.  The price seems a little high, but all razors seem to be these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did the job, but I&#x27;m not going to switch from what I am my current razor.</li>
    <li> My 15 year old son, all 6ft 3in of him, asked me to show him how to shave.  We had encouraged him to wait as long as he could, but the time had arrived.  I surprised him with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor and told him this is the razor that all other razors aspire to be when they grow up. He marveled at the hair-pin turns and precision control this razor delivers. The shave was everything you would expect from the superior Gillette blades. My son&#x27;s first shave was a super success! No loss of earlobes, lips, or nose.  Not even a cut to wipe blood from.  Thank you Gillette for a great Father/Son moment to last a lifetime!</li>
    <li> I just received this razor from Gillette for free in exchange for my review of the brand.  I can say that it is a significant upgrade to previous Fusion razors and all other manual razors I have tried.  In the past, Fusion blades have been too thick and made of very soft metal which dulled after 2-3 shaves.  I use a layer of shave oil under shaving cream directly after showering to soften/lubricate hair in order to ease discomfort and extend razor life.  However, all previous Fusion designs started going bad after 2-3 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this razor with the improved blades, lubrication strip, and flex ball, and I can say that it performs much better.  It cuts through my thick hair much easier than previous versions, and leaves behind a smooth shave with fewer strokes.  The flex ball seems to help in tight spots on the chin and on your neck, which is a welcome addition too.  I have used this razor 3 times now, and I can confidently say that I cannot perceive any loss in sharpness yet.  It also seems as though hair is less likely to get caught in-between the razor blades than on previous versions.  Hair comes out with a simple rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the style and aesthetics of the razor are nicer than previous versions, and it is much lighter than the battery operated Fusions which offered no benefit, but cost more to purchase and maintain.  The only improvement I would suggest is to make the plastic case a stand like in previous versions.  This would allow you to store the razor upright and save space under my sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.  One that finally works for me without discomfort or premature wear.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for 5 weeks now and I do like it. If they added the power to it I would love this razor. It dose a great job of giving me a good smooth shave with a good deal of comfort I would just like to see them add the power.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m a woman and I loveeeee this razor. It&#x27;s the only kind that makes my legs feel silky smooth! Woman razors suck! I used my boyfriends once (probably not smart lol) but I&#x27;ll never use a woman&#x27;s razor ever again haha.</li>
    <li> One of the best razors that I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve sensitive skin and this one does help is lessing the irritation (so far). Also because of the flexibity it offers, it becomes that much easier to shave around the neck. I would recommend it a lot.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Flexball serves as a great disposable razor. I actually received a free trial sample of the Gillettte Fusion Flexball from the brand. The first time I tried it I was skeptical as to whether it would give me a better shave than my old Gillette Fusion; however, you can now call me a believer. The Flexball handle allows me to reach all areas of my face and neck in one pass. With my old Gillette razor, I needed to make multiple passes of certain areas to get a good close shave; this would often cause me to nick up my face, which is never a good thing. Since I&#x27;ve been using the Flexball, I haven&#x27;t cut myself once while shaving (a minor miracle for me). All in all the Flexball also gives me a great smooth shave without making my face feel like sandpaper when I&#x27;m done. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> I got the Gillette Fusion Proglide as a samples as part of my participation in the Bzzagent campaign to review the razor.The razor had a good balanced feel in my hand when I used it. it gave a close shave I did not see the advantage to the Flexball technology it did make shaving the chin area a little simpler but not significantly.</li>
    <li> Not quite what I expected, but gave a decent shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic razor I mean what more needs to be said. Buy it....like buy it now it&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
    <li> I received a fusion proglide from Gillette and I have to say I LOVE IT! I have tried almost every type Gillette has come out with and while I have enjoyed those this was the first one that gives a very close shave due to the flexball. With it moving with the curves of my face not only did it cut close to the skin but I also didn&#x27;t get any cuts on my face! I definitely plan on keeping this as my permanent razor.</li>
    <li> I have extremely coarse facial hair, and as such I am very picky about which razor I use. I received the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide to try direct from Gillette. First of all, it does adjust to the contours and lines on your face better than any other razor I&#x27;ve used. Having said that, the adjustments made the blade itself miss spots and require multiple strokes from different angles to get certain areas. This results in a couple spots of razor burn. Overall, it&#x27;s better than most razors on the market and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it over any disposable.  If you&#x27;ve got a tough beard, you might want to consider other options.</li>
    <li> I recently got the Proglide and also use Gillette Products such as the stylist and the five blade and was very satisfied.The Proglide is something I use everyday now and is simple to you that it is more flexible and can be more efficient and less Time consuming normally taking two minutes of my time.</li>
    <li> I received a Fusion Proglide from Gillette and I have found it a bit underwhelming.  I have traditionally use a Gillette Mach 3 for my shaving needs and love it.  The Proglide was a lot bigger and heavier.  The flex ball didn&#x27;t seem to add anything to the shave.  It would actually hold more water in it and drip water when going from the sink to face.  I shave my head as well and this unit would clog so quickly that shaving was very tedious.  The blades are simply to close together for head shaving.  I was happy with the closeness of the shave.  If I had to shave everyday and only did my face I think I would have liked it a little more.  I will continue to use it on my face but I will stick with my trusty Mach 3 for my head.</li>
    <li> First I have to admit I have always been a Schick fan. Having said that, I was blown away by this razor! I have arthritis and found that I could shave easily and effectively with either hand. I have a fairly round face and this razor hugged it with every pass. I have a very course and thick beard so only negative was the need to rinse constantly to prevent build up in blades. You must really give this razor a test drive.....</li>
    <li> Our favorite razors...I use them AND my husband has his own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE!</li>
    <li> Not really worth the upgrade from the regular fusion. its the same thing</li>
    <li> I have been a user of the Gillette Fusion for years.  The new flexball technology only improves the performance of this razor.  This razor is by far the more comfortable razor I have used, I have very sensitive skin and this razor allows me a VERY close shave with no problems.  Highly recommended.  This is an expensive razor, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Why do they do gendered marketing for razors? Why would I want to spend an extra couple of bucks for an inferior product in pretty pink packages? Whenever I used Gillette&#x27;s counterpart marketed towards girls, I never had that perfect, satin skinned feel that you&#x27;re supposed to feel when you shave. I literally stopped shaving for weeks because I hated using my razor so much. Today I noticed my leg hair was pretty unreasonably long, and that I needed to make a change. So I went to target and picked this baby up, hoping for a change in performance.&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, this product is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The flex ball really helps in achieving the perfect shave - no more sore armpits and splotchy legs. You can get the perfect shave the first time for once. If you need it for shaving your legs, arms, and pits, this is the product to help you get that nice, smooth shave. I&#x27;m pretty sure it would work really nicely for your face too, but that&#x27;s not something I would know.&lt;br /&gt;I wish Gillette made more gender neutral products. I will settle with the steely gray and orange design for now, and relish the feeling of my smooth, smooth legs in the meanwhile.</li>
    <li> After seeing this display at the store recently I was very intrigued to see what Gillette has been up to with innovating new razor technology. Gillette was kind enough to provide me with one to try out, and I was blows away! I was pleasantly surprised when I first picked up this razor at how comfortably it fit in my hands.  I&#x27;m usually pretty lazy at shaving and typically try to just get it over with as quickly as possible.  This was accomplished easily with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor.  The ProGlide made a really big difference with how much contact the razor has with your face.  Instead of being worried that I would cut myself, I knew that the razor would hug the contours of my face and give me the best shave possible.  I am very satisfied each and every time I have shaved with the ProGlide razor.  I have had no tugging, my face is always SMOOTH, and I never feel as if I am going to cut myself.  I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone, especially people who are tired of shaving and just want it to be seamless and smooth! Keep up the great work Gillette, thanks!</li>
    <li> Considering the price. This is the one of the best razors on market.</li>
    <li> You couldn&#x27;t spend twelve bucks in a better way. The shaves are fantastic!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think it could get better than the previous Fusion model but it did. I shave my head daily and though I&#x27;m not sure if the shave is much closer, the Flexball does speed up the process by maintaining better contact with my dome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using cheaper disposible razors that come in pink. Wow. The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual (with Flex Ball) is way better even keeping in mind that it is a new blade. 5 blades in fact. That&#x27;s two more than my old razor. My legs feel fantastically smooth. I think my spouse won&#x27;t get to try this out as I&#x27;m keeping it. (-:</li>
    <li> Just want to add . I resiliently  tried a couple knock off brand razors and they don&#x27;t compare. And since using the PROGLIDE RAZOR I really like the shave I&#x27;m getting. Just want to say thanks to GILLETTE for this awsome razor.</li>
    <li> This very well could be the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. It was smooth and comfortable to use. It gave me a very close shave without any irritation. I highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for a new razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised at how much better this razor or the blades feel.  I&#x27;ve used it twice and each time it feels like the razor is super sharp.  I am very happy with this razor.</li>
    <li> Probably the biggest hype job ever perpetrated on the public. This &amp;#34;Ball&amp;#34;  thing is a loser. The shave is nothing more than Gillette&#x27;s other products, in fact,it might be a little worse. Too bad Gillette can&#x27;t be honest..</li>
    <li> Just home from a week camping trip in the adirondack to fine a brand new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with FlexBall ! Humm lets put this baby to the test, nice smooth and clean! But don&#x27;t take my word! When i gave my wife a big welcome home kiss she let me know, that is a very smooth shave indeed!Thank to all at Gillette!</li>
    <li> Personally, I did not get any appreciable benefit from the swivel feature they&#x27;ve designed into the handle. But it uses the Fusion blades and they really outdid themselves when they brought those to market several years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it five stars because I&#x27;d give the non-swivel [[ASIN:B00AFCPA26 Silvertouch]] razor/handle package that rating and it is the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you do not have particularly tough whiskers you can get the [[ASIN:B003983HRI Fusion Proglide]] and save a few bucks. If I were having to choose a new handle I&#x27;d buy this one. Not because the flexball doesn&#x27;t work but because I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> This razor that I received from Gillette is really awesome. I would have to say that I have never got such a close shave with such ease as I did with the Gillette Fusion Proglide with the flexball. The way it moved because of the flexball is uncomparable to any razor that I have ever used. I recommended this razor to my father and he thinks it is best shave he has ever got and we would and will recommend this to every one that we know.</li>
    <li> Review for Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology.  I admit to being a little reluctant to try it right away, I wasn’t’ sure about shaving my head with a different type of handle than I’m used to.  I had nothing to worry about!  The razor is comfortable to use, and gave me a very close shave with only one pass, normally I go over my head twice.  It also worked great on my face.  I highly recommend the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall hand technology.  Note:  I received the product from the brand, NOT from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a little over a week now. The blades are still sharpens the cut without any pulling! It feels like a brand new razor still! I recommend this razor to anyone looking for a good, reliable razor</li>
    <li> This is a great razor I shave not only face with it but arm and chest . I love the way the ball allows it to move . It has to be about the closet save I have as of yet . The only down fall is the handle is a little small for some one with big hands .</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me the Gillette Fusion Proglide to try out and review. I have been using disposable razors as they provide a closer shave to me. I found the Proglide razor provided a great shaving experience. It glides along your face allowing the razor to contour to my face without any burn. I love that the back razor allows me to trim my sideburns. Great product....</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT RAZOR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of gimmicky razors with millions of blades and vibrating this and that but I have to say, the slight rotation of the head is a really nice addition to an otherwise already solid razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single trimmer blade is also a nice bonus, and makes for clean lines and easy beard shaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is typical Gillette, very nice. I expect to get some good use out of the first blade before changing it as well, most likely good for a few shaves from stubble to clean shaven.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver Gillette has made so far it is very smooth and gives a really close shave and the way it goes around the edges of your face without disconnecting from your face. Another great shaver from Gillette once again they have outdone themselves.</li>
    <li> works really well close close shave ...</li>
    <li> Super awesome and even has a $8 dollar coupon inside.</li>
    <li> I received this razor to try for free from Gillette. At first I wasn&#x27;t overly excited since it seemed like another new gimmicky razor.  However I tried it, and the Flexball handle of the Gillette Fusion Proglide does actually make quite a difference, makes going around contours much easier.  I told my girlfriend about it and she insisted on trying it.  I think she may have taken ownership of it now as she fell it love with it, she said it made shaving legs and bikini area much easier since it contoured nicely to the curves and tight spaces.  This razor gives a very nice close and precise shave.  I will continue to purchase blades and use the Gillette Fusion Proglide, if not buy another one since I think I&#x27;ve lost it to my girlfriend.</li>
    <li> Very Good......Thank You.....Jose</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but no better. I bought this because I was curious about how the rotating head might work, and truth be told, I&#x27;m not too happy. I have worked as a barber, and used to shave with a straight razor in the past, but like most, I got tired of having the sharpen the blade. A modern razor is just to comfortable to use, although I still recommend getting a straight razor shave as a once in a lifetime experience! The thing is, and this is something you&#x27;ll only notice once you have the item in your hand, why would you put a rotating joint on the razor, if you already have one included on ANY razor,  and one which gives you many times more control. Yup, you guessed it. If your reading this, you probably have a wrist, and it gives you much more control that this ball joint which lets the head move whevever it wants. It&#x27;s great if that doesn&#x27;t matter to you (no beard), but if you have a goatee like me, it just takes away your precision. By all means, I can still shave perfectly with it anyway, and you would too, but really, it&#x27;s like putting some gravel in your shoe before a race. Simply unnecessary. I kind of liked the old one better, and time will tell if I go back to it.</li>
    <li> Great improvements compared to my old Gillette razor which has 3 blades. I like this one, better feeling with the flex ball, but not as comfortable as I thought.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette for testing purposes. As someone who needs to shave on a daily basis my boyfriend thought this razor was amazing. It was really easy to use and contoured to his face effortlessly. It offered a nice close shave as well.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Used the same blades for almost 2 weeks straight no problems what so ever... best shave of my life.  :)</li>
    <li> Husband says it&#x27;s the best shave ever!</li>
    <li> This is the easiest razor to use - smooth, close shave with minimal effort! The new flex technology covers the contours with comfort. Great product!</li>
    <li> Great razor. The flexball helps me shave my neck better and faster than previous razors. It also comes with an extra cartridge.</li>
    <li> overrated. just stick with the proglide</li>
    <li> The razor is cheap in price and where they make the money is on the blades you will need. They are pricey!! It shaves ok but not that much better than a disposable IMO. The swivel is kind of a gimmick. BTW it does not tell you how to replace the blades but push the yellow button to release the blade assembly.</li>
    <li> I recently received a Fusion Proglide from Gillette, and have been using it daily for a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up until now I&#x27;ve been using the Power Fusion Proglide (vibrating, non-Flexball version), and found it to be a great razor. I don&#x27;t really feel like this razor gives a closer shave, per se, but I really find the Flexball to be helpful in providing that little extra &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; when shaving the curves on my face (neckline, jaw, etc), as well as the contours on my body. I like to keep my body smooth, and really find the Flexball helps with shaving those tricky areas such as around the knees and elbows. Everything feels soft and smooth afterwards, so I&#x27;m super happy with it. Oh yes, and it also fits in the hole in my shower caddy, that the Power Fusion&#x27;s handle didn&#x27;t... bit of a bonus, for me anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be sticking with this razor, from now on. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The blades are very smooth across my face and the pivoting handle helps to get the hard to reach spots along my jaw line.</li>
    <li> It works fine. I got it free from Gillette. Every couple of years Gillette comes up with a new razor &amp; I must admit I do get suckered in and buy one. But first I always make sure I use up the old blades first if they won&#x27;t fit on the new razor.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free from Gillette to trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works better than I expected. I wouldnt have figured a razor with a ball as the only new tech would make a difference, but it does conform to your face pretty well. I&#x27;ve got a few Gilette razors, a Schick, and a Harry&#x27;s razor--- this is the best of the multiple Gilette razors, and about as good as my Harry&#x27;s. The blades are crazy expensive - but on a day I really want a close shave, I&#x27;ll probably use this razor.</li>
    <li> Yeah the ball or &amp;#34;flexball handle&amp;#34; is cool and worth trying. The cartridges seam to be the exact same as the non ball version which I enjoy because I have some from the older version without the new ball in the handle. If you have always bought disposable razors and don&#x27;t mind the single blade you will never understand paying this much for a razor but once you have you will never go back. This product gives you a very close shave. You will actually notice the difference as you shave up from you neck around your chin. Wish it came with more than 1 extra cartridge.</li>
    <li> I was quite surprised by the seeming quality of this Giillette.  It has a hefty feel, not the toy like feel of it&#x27;s former styles.  Too, the swiveling head does help getting into tough spots.  Well worth the higher price of the toys that preceded it.</li>
    <li> One of the cleanest shaves I have ever had, no ingrown hairs or razor bumps. I had to go back to a 3 blade one day and the change was noticeable, never again.</li>
    <li> Works great&lt;br /&gt;Came with only one extra</li>
    <li> The product provided an extremely smooth shave with little irritation.  The Flexball handle technology seemed to help guide the razor more smoothly than the traditional Gillette razors.  I received the product from Gillette and am happy that I tried it.  I appreciate Gillette&#x27;s continued innovation - leading to improved products.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor, two for 11 bucks.  Be careful it&#x27;s really sharp.</li>
    <li> works great! keep an eye out for it to go on sale!</li>
    <li> I was given a Gillette Fusion Proglide to review.  At first I was a little skeptical that this razor would perform as good as I heard but when I got mine I was pleasantly surprised to find out that not only was it as good as I had heard but it also was better than the first Gillette Fusion Proglide that I have been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have trouble with my hands so using a razor that glides smoothly over my face and has a handle that is comfortable for me to hold has been a challenge.  The  first Fusion razor worked good but the new one glides over my face much better and easier. The handle is bigger and more comfortable than other razors I have tried making it more comfortable to use. The new re engineered blades that have thinner finer edges for an even closer shave than the old fusion razors as well as other razors I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying this razor especially for people looking for a comfortable to hold handled razor that gides over the contours of your face with ease giving you a closer shave with less tugging and pull thanks to the advanced lubrastrip that is enhanced with mineral oils and lubricating polymers that allow the razor to move gently over your skin.</li>
    <li> I actually think the pro glide without the ball works better</li>
    <li> I think this is the best razor out there, but I&#x27;m not writing this to tell you how good a shave you get - very close &amp; comfortable. What I want to tell you is how long the blades last. I bought this Proglide and a pack of the new blades on July 28, 2014. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve seen the dollar shave commercials. Sounds like they would be cheaper, but I had my doubts. I decided to write down the dates I start/stop using a blade. I started using the first blade on Aug 1, 2014. I shave 5 or 6 days a week - &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; beard. I installed the second blade 6 MONTHS LATER, on Feb.1, 2015. I&#x27;m still using it! No cuts, no scrapes, still comfortable. Admittedly, I have to go over the tough spots a little more than when the blade was new, but...  No, I do not work for, nor do I have any investments in, Gillette. I&#x27;m not getting anything for this review and I AM NOT EXAGGERATING. Each of these blades has lasted 6 months or more, HONEST! [Haven&#x27;t lost a drop of blood! :) ]</li>
    <li> Shave it now, shave it good, shave this... Just like you should..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best razor I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t clog, my skin is smooth and honestly it lasts. Most razor only last one or two shaves for me but this one is going strong. Buy it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I was just an ordinary boy before buying this. Now I am a crime fighting man! With one look at this mighty weapon I realized what my calling was. To fight crime as the mighty (and well shaven) pro glider. I attach these artisan pieces to the bottom of my feet and I am able to slide across ice at the speed of smell to shave off those menacing mullets and pesky overly sized... Sideburns. Lucky for all of you, there is a hero out there fighting for justice against these 70&#x27;s-out of date offenders. And at only $20 for three, only a small fee to pay for justice and a clean shaven, mullet/pesky overly sized sideburn-free face. Thank you so much, this is captain pro-glide signing off.</li>
    <li> does a great job shaving</li>
    <li> The Gillette Proglide is a really intense razor. The swivel head in the handle was a bit scary looking, but it performed well. I used it a couple of times. My only gripe is that my hair style causes me to get razor bumps when growing back, which explains why I used it minimally. I don&#x27;t believe it was the fault of the razor at all however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades were super sharp but I barely nicked myself (more of a poorly cleaned mirror/unsteady hand issue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all the product was very good. I would recommend it to any of my friends with softer facial hair.</li>
    <li> Have you ever studied how many WOMEN use MENs razors?&lt;br /&gt;I wish Gillette would consider this AND COME UP WITH ONE CLASSY FUSION VERSION that either male or females can/will use.  If not, I&#x27;ll be buying the bettor men&#x27;s razor instead of women&#x27;s lightweight disposables.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re not inferring that women are somehow not as important as men.&lt;br /&gt;Time to be environmentally sound while noticing gender inequities large and small.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for many years and have never used any creams, lotions or liquids to shave with. My first experience with the Gellette Fusion was impressive. The weight and balance of the razor felt a little strange but after a short time felt natural. The shave is close and smooth without any nicks or cuts like all the fixed blade razors that I have used in the past.I would recommend this razor to anyone and if you truly want to test the quality of a razor, try it without lubricants.This is one high quality product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think I would love it this much but I really do! Get one if you can!</li>
    <li> Simply put - this is state-of-the-art shaving.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it, spend $10 to experience the pleasure the rest of us know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are smooth magic, and the FlexBall is technology not available anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just try it once.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using my wife&#x27;s account because she usually does all the shopping but I was really wanting to try one of these razors. I have been using Gillette for a long time and the razors the continue to come our with a getting better and better but the price keeps going up. Which is to be expected with a great razor. I had the opportunity to give this razor a try and truly like it. Felt I got a great close shave without any razor burn, cuts, nicks, or left over hair. My wife enjoyed the how close the shave was too. Definitely would recommend it to anyone looking for a new razor.</li>
    <li> Since switching to the ProGlide and Nivea shave cream along with using Dr Carver&#x27;s shaving butter as a preshave, I have had the smoothest shave of my life. Trying to get the closest shave that I could get, I would get irritation in the neck area with other razors but not with the ProGlide and Nivea. Cannot tell if the battery makes a difference but whatever it is, my shave is outstanding. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor, but to be honest I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference between that one and the usual one I use. I still recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> I like that razor I&#x27;ll buy that again soon</li>
    <li> I wish women&#x27;s razors were this good. I have never had a smooth time with my underarms but this provided a good clean shave without nicks. I&#x27;m gonna put my electric Panasonic aside for a little while and use this. Electric is ok but I noticed that my hair stubble was significantly longer with electric. When I shave with this it&#x27;s like there&#x27;s nothing left at all. It&#x27;s amazing. The shave is so smooth. After years of disappoint with women&#x27;s razors I think I will continue to buy this product. It&#x27;s more expensive than normal women&#x27;s disposables but it&#x27;s a better shave. In the end it may save money because I think men&#x27;s razors last longer. 10/10</li>
    <li> This Shaver is the Best I have ever used. I have VERY sensitive skin and can only shave once every 5 days , which gives me that Hobo look around day 4.  Whith this shaver , I can shave every 2 days and it cuts Beautifully.  Smoothest shave Ever !!</li>
    <li> Seemed the blades were old but a good price and were brand new.</li>
    <li> when i received this razor from gillette fusion in was a little skeptic but then i tryed it once for the first time in i was like wow close shave quick easy to use i am one of those guys with thick facial hair so i just know it was going to be pulling my hair or cutting me nothing it was like i was using clippers to trim my hair instead of a razor all in all i could make this razor my primary razor for my facial hair  thks gillette fusion nice work love it</li>
    <li> My husband received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Technology. He said that its a very good manual razor compare to the others in the market. He would like to have one that is electric. It shave close than the other manual razors.</li>
    <li> Was really pleased with the razor.</li>
    <li> I got to test this product from the brand. It was a good solid razor. Not flimsy. Gave me a great close shave.Liked the strip infused in mineral oil. It glides well over your skin.I did not feel any pull or tug on my hair or skin. I loved it and I would certainly buy it and recommend it.Great shaver.The flexball contours to your face and gives you a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> Cuts just as well as every other Gillette razor. I really felt no difference from this to last seven pro glides. IT was nice of Gillette to  give me a trial though. Great company as always!</li>
    <li> I thinkit is great. My wife is jealous. Is there one for women? I do not have to manipulate the razor when I shave.Same great blades Smooth. Before this  I had dificulties  moving from my Chin to my face. Will buy. Thanks</li>
    <li> Follow up post from my first review:  I still love the close shave and lack of irritation I got from using the Fusion Proglide, but after two weeks of using it the one blade cartridge that came with the razor began to dull (no surprise there, right?).  Gillette sent me the product for free, so I haven&#x27;t looked for Proglide cartridges in the store.  In the meantime, I went back to using my (still a Gillette product) Mach3 razor - and I could feel the difference almost immediately.  More irritation and not as close a shave.  So, I go to the store for more cartridges to the Proglide... and my jaw dropped on the price of the refills.  Over $18 for 4?  A pack of 12 for $40??  My enthusiasm for the new razor deflated rapidly... and now, I&#x27;m left with a dilemna:  continue as before, or pay up for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still rating the razor as a 5, but the overall package loses some of its luster when I am forced to factor in dollars and cents.</li>
    <li> Great product, follows the curves of the face just as advertised.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t really see nothing special but it does it&#x27;s job...</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle from Gillette a few weeks for free to try. I have preferred the Fusion ProGlide razor over anything else I have tried, since they originally came out, without the FlexBall handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor head itself is awesome! I have not gotten a better shave with another razor. I always, shave in the shower, where I get the closest shave. Comparing the difference between the razor with the FlexBall handle, and without, I did not notice a difference though. My face is fairly smooth and I don&#x27;t have any areas, except for the jaw line, that the FlexBall really would have made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I could not see a difference between the Fusion ProGlide and the Fusion ProGlide with the FlexBall, but the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razors themselves are the best I can find!</li>
    <li> Wow, I&#x27;m blown away about how bad this Flexball really is. I have used Gillete&#x27;s razors for 15+ years and they have in my opinion only gotten better and better. This Flexball is subtracting by adding (if you know your HBR b-school lingo) as it is as follows: 1) adds weight; however, it adds not performance advantage IMHO; 2) The entire handle feels a heft that, paradoxically, is not maximizing the best benefit of the Fusion system...the uber excellent blades.; 3)  I just do not get the benefit....the flexball makes the product worse (the myth of progress is proven here).</li>
    <li> Great product I received free form Gillette. It had a  close shave and didn&#x27;t nick me at all. will be buying one soon!</li>
    <li> The razor can get to places most can&#x27;t but I did have a little more razor burn than normal. Overall good razor.</li>
    <li> I recently received this product compliments of Gillette. Of the many razors I&#x27;ve used in the past, this one obliterates all of them. In the past, they were inflexible, irritable, hard to work with, and tough on my legs. Gillette ProGlide is one razor that surpassed my expectations to the extreme&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it have a flex ball that adjusts to the contours of your body, it also has a lubricant that is infused with mineral oil that makes it easy to shave. One quick swipe and the hair is gone. The razor is so smooth, I almost forgot I was using a razor. There was very little friction between the blades and my skin. For once, it actually felt good to shave. The FlexBall makes it easy to shave in weird positions and adjusts to your way of holding it. It also comes with a neat little holding case. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to everyone who&#x27;s tired of using crap shavers. Look no more people, Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual is here!</li>
    <li> I love my Gillette flexball razor. I honestly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had a closer shave. The part that impressed me the most was on my neck.  The shave was so close and no pulling whatsoever. Iwould recommend this product to anyone,  especially individuals with a coarse, thick beard.</li>
    <li> After using this razor it is a nice razor but I don&#x27;t believe it is for my shaving.  I only shave twice a week as my second job is the only one that i need to shave for.and I need to rake my face many times to cut through the stuble. I believe the five blade are too many. I am a Gillette mach three user and it takes the stuble much easier. I believe if someone shaves every day it would be a great razor . Maybe I am one that likes what I am used to so I will give this to my wife she will love it</li>
    <li> I am a Gillette fan for many years. My Father recently gave me the Gillette Fusion Proglide. Have used it for several shaves now still sharp as can be. Also like the trimmer edge as well. Good shave will most likely get rid of my disposable razor,</li>
    <li> I just received this from Gillette to try out.  I was very happy with the quality of the razor as well as the blade.  I hate shaving, so I generally only do it every 2 or 3 days.  The blade was tough enough to handle that.  The swivel head was also a big plus.  Handled the cheekbones and chin without a nick.  I liked it well enough that I may start shaving more often........UPDATE.... I have used this razor for a few weeks now and every time I use I like it more.  No nicks, no bumps, and best of all no stubble left on the jaw line.  The flexball makes shaving along the jawline easy.  I definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I received this from Gillette in the mail after seeing it advertised as an instore demo where the blade rolls on a contoured surface. I really like the razor. I&#x27;m not a daily shaver, but the razor had very little drag to the glide, and I wasn&#x27;t having to over areas of my face repeatedly like I do with other razors, even the area under my nose wasn&#x27;t an issue and only took a couple of strokes instead of the usual four due to the lip pit. Also, the handle is compatible with the razor heads for the other Gillette Fusion Proglide products, which is a plus having a couple of them still on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part and the reason for the 5 star review is the flexball did speed up my time shaving.</li>
    <li> honestly a quality made product&lt;br /&gt;i was impressed. sharp blades; nice and easy on the skin (:</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using various Gillette razors over the years, and I have to say, I&#x27;m usually discouraged from buying into the latest gimmick.  I am also very turned off by the ridiculously high price of replacement blades.  I used to use the Sensor Excel blades for many years. Thankfully, I grew my beard out several years ago, and my wife really digs it, so I only shave under my neck and a bit on the face just to keep it looking clean.  I use a trimmer to keep my beard at the length I like.  I received the pro glide from Gillette and decided to give it a try- as I do not need to replace the blades nearly as often as when I shaved my entire face every day.  It worked very well.  Good grip and feel.  I usually shave upwards on my neck because the other way usually results in a bloodbath!  Upwards was a nice, clean, comfortable shave.  I tried it downwards and while I felt it dragging a bit, there was no nicks or anything.  All in all, seems like a very good razor.</li>
    <li> Received this razor from Gillette and I was surprised how good it was. My wife bought me the Philips Norelco Electric Razor and I have to say, this product is definitely comparable to the $250 electric razor.  I get a very fine shave from this and with NO NICKS.  Sometimes I even catch my wife stealing this razor to shave her legs because it shaves so smoothly. Overall, two thumbs up! Great item!</li>
    <li> Brand new.......very good price..</li>
    <li> Great. Shaves smoothly.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I do my face and head in no time. The blades last , but the refills are costly.</li>
    <li> As good as other Gillette Razors which I love. Couldn&#x27;t feel any difference as per as flexball handle is concerned - Probably it does what it&#x27;s suppose to but doesn&#x27;t make much difference to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product quality wise it&#x27;s very good and I would buy Gillette again - with or without flexball</li>
    <li> These razors work really great last for long time to</li>
    <li> I like the concept and it works well but if you get ingrown hairs easily this may not be good for you.  I get ingrown hairs pretty easily, especially when my razor gets a little dull.  However, this has caused me to get them even with a brand new razor, it must have something to do with cutting the hairs at slightly different angles than the normal razor.  It works well, but for me it has caused a bunch of ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> How raw hamburger looks is how your face will feel after using this over priced razor. It is so unwieldy you have to go over and over your beard to get a clean shave and as a result your skin is raw!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so disappointed with this razor; I threw it and the extra blade in the trash (re-cycle bin) after three uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to meet the suckers who have given this praise and sell them a piece of the Brooklyn Bridge.</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m actually amazed.  This razor is Gillette&#x27;s best by far.  It&#x27;s light, and the flex technology allows the blades to curve, thus giving me a much more comfortable shave than with any other product. The blades last about a month.  Most importantly I haven&#x27;t had a nick or cut in the several months that I&#x27;ve been using this razor.</li>
    <li> I went through many razors before finally settling on the fusion.  Close shave plus the benefit of a single blade on the reverse.  Flexball isn&#x27;t just a gimmick.  I definitely feel the flex allows me to get a better shave.</li>
    <li> A simple 2 blade razor is all you need if you shave right. This is total overkill &amp; a massive expense. It&#x27;s appalling that a razor blade would cost so much.</li>
    <li> Decade old user of Mach-3 and I just switched to this one. I think that the whole flexball doesn&#x27;t help me much, that&#x27;s just me. Mach-3 was a bit more nicer on my skin. Although, the blades on this seems to last much longer.</li>
    <li> It works better then the basic Fusion.</li>
    <li> Here is my analysis and test results for the new Gillette &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The razor comes with a very handy stand to hold while not being used. Fits well, stays put. The razor is very hefty--about 1.8 oz measured on my scale. By contrast, a disposable typically weighs-in less than 1 oz. I measured a Gillette disposable at 1/2 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The razor body is very solid, and has a comfortable feel to it. I liked the feel of the razor body--it felt solidly constructed, and is also well-balanced. I also liked the black raised ergonomic contours on the body of the razor. Again--felt very solid and well constructed. The color of the body is black with silver trim, plus the orange Flexball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #1,&amp;#34; I did not shave for several days, so that I had a 3-day beard. I washed my face with cool water, left my face wet, then applied a smooth layer of the Proglide gel. I then waited several minutes for my beard to soften. I began shaving in the easier portions of my face, where the whiskers are lighter, then proceeded to the heavier sections around my chin. The razor nicely navigated all the crags and contours without the slightest drag or snagging. The blades cut very close without the hint of scraping or cutting. I examined my face very closely after shaving, and I was very pleased with the result. The razor did an outstanding job, providing a very close, clean shave. (For the records, I do NOT have a really smooth face--it&#x27;s about normal roughness.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #2,&amp;#34; I had just the normal 1-day beard. I washed my face with warm water, left my face wet, then similarly applied a layer of the same gel. I waited exactly 3 1/2 minutes for the bristles to soften. This time, I paid attention to how well the razor traversed over the chin and down to the neck. I wanted to see if the rotating head of the razor could smoothly navigate this hilly territory. As before the razor did a similarly outstanding job, providing a very close and smooth shave. Thus, both the Field Tests confirm the capability of this product. It works as advertised. When I completed my shaving, I rinsed the razor, and noticed that it is somewhat difficult to get the blades entirely clean of shaving gel. With 5 blades closely spaced together, this is not a trivial feat. After cleaning, I thoroughly dried the cartridge, as I hope to extend the life of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The famous &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; is obvious because of its bright orange color. The Flexball pivots in 2 different ways. As you hold the razor in front of you, it pivots left to right, in an angular fashion--perhaps up to 15 degrees in each direction. There are little &amp;#34;stops&amp;#34; on the Flexball that prevent it from rotating too far. You can see a very fine band (at first I thought it was a wire) that allows the angular pivoting. This movement is very smooth--no hitches whatsoever. There is a small screw-like pivot-point, around which the movement takes place. This fastener appears to be very solid; I doubt anything will come lose. The head of the razor also pivots forward and back, using a thin &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; going into the head of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The above Flexball is very impressive engineering. It appears to operate flawlessly. All of this is to allow the razor to match the contours of your face. That&#x27;s a nice way of saying, shave around all those divots and dents in your face (not that YOU have any, of course, but someone else might.) To further get around those slight detours, this product uses extremely thin, five blades that are designed to glide more smoothly; thus, there is no tugging on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ Gillette also claims to incorporate a proprietary strip called the &amp;#34;Enhanced Lubrastrip.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s the part of the cartridge that is pale green. This strip contains mineral oil and &amp;#34;lubricating polymers.&amp;#34; Well, my skin appreciated those &amp;#34;polymers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ SUMMARY: My shaving &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; passed with flying colors. My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags. The razor feels very solid. One possible caveat--the razor itself, and the replacement blades are not cheap compared to other products. However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♫ A Review by Chris LawsonY: My shaving &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; passed with flying colors.

    <li> After receiving this new Gillette FlexBall Razor before it was introduced to the public, I&#x27;ve to say I&#x27;m hooked!  Once again Gillette has gone above and beyond the competition with this razor.  I&#x27;ve been a longtime user of Gillette Razors, most recently the Power ProGlide since it was introduced, but I&#x27;ve got say I&#x27;m staying this new flexball handle.  I curves with the couture of your face, chin and neck providing a pretty darn close shave.  The handle is build well and the blade is easy to maneuver; No irritation and no nicks with over 2 weeks of use now.  I would highly recommend this product to whomever is looking for an other great product from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Flexball Handle free from Gillette. I have used their products for almost twenty years now and off and on tried various electric razors, but I always find myself coming back to Gillette. This is by far one of the best manual razor heads I have ever used. I can tell the head is swiveling as it glides across my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who prefers a nice smooth shave, even if you have sensitive skin as I do, it is a great razor for a close shave. I didn&#x27;t mention the blades that came with it as there are plenty of reviews for the razor cartridges. I have been using the Gillette Proglide cartridges for a few years now and find them to be some of the smoothest and best blades out there. If nothing give them a try, along with the Proglide Flexball Handle I think you will stick with Gillette as I have.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor as a test sample from Gillette. I have to say Gillette makes the best razors in today&#x27;s market. I can recommend them above other brands such as Schick and BIC. I have several Gillette razors in my cabinet. The last one I used was the ProGlide with vibration. I just love the razor cartridge design. However, I never used the vibrations, because it sounded like a gimmick. I love Gillette blades, and the five blades make the shave very smooth. My wife even uses my Gillette blades for her needs. However, the five blades sometimes make the hair get stuck easily. I have to tap the blades hard to make the hair come out from among the blades. I like the feature with the single blade at the top, but as far as the blade cartridge, they are the same as previous models 5 blade models. The FlexBall sounds like a great idea when seen on paper, but it feels like another gimmick.  I don&#x27;t find the FlexBall usable for my uses, because I feel like I need to move and cure my wrists and face for a safe shave. The flexball seems like a good idea if the razor is like an electric razor (Norelco 3D), and does not cut. There is no such thing as a quick shave with any manual razors. However, if you want the best shave you must take your time with one of these Gillette Fusion razors.&lt;br /&gt;The lack of usable improvements over current products and the selling price of the razor and cartridges should knock off a star, but I got this one for free. Also, wholesale stores such as Amazon, Costco, BJ&#x27;s, Sams offer cartridges for cheaper than smaller drugstores. I believe $3 per cartridge as the wholesale price is still to high. After buying the cartridges I don&#x27;t feel bad paying today&#x27;s gas prices. Overall, I recommend this razor and genuine Gillette products to every man (or woman) who wants to have a great shave. Thank you Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Pro-glide as a promo from Gillette. My first impressions of the Gillette Fusion Pro-glide was: this is a nice looking razor, does not look cheap, coolest looking razor I have seen yet, and the holder looks great. After I opened the packaging on the razor and held it, I was very impressed. The razor is nice, heavy and does not feel like it is made out of cheap material. I noticed the blades are the same blades from their previous razor, which is nice since I own some replacement blades for it.&lt;br /&gt;After using the Gillette Fusion Pro-glide, I noticed it cuts the same as other razors. I felt some tugging while shaving, which I experience with all manual razors. The blade does work great at getting around the contours of my face. I thought the moving from side to side was more of a gimmick, but it actually helps the blades follow the face. The razor does provide a nice close shave and my face was not irritated at all after words. After using manual razors my face usually burns and I put after shave on to cool my face. With the Pro-Glide my face did not burn afterwards and I did not need any after shave. I really like the one blade on the back for the precision shaving which works great for the sideburns and under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the holder for the Pro-Glide, it keeps the blade from going dull from bouncing around in my drawer. It looks great and is really nice to keep the replacement blades with the handle. No more forgetting where I placed my extra blades. Overall I am really happy with this razor and will recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> First, let me just say that I received a free sample of this product from Gillette.  Prior to trying the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball handle, I had both tried and liked other Gillette Fusion products.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide line of cartridges has always provided a clean, close and relatively injury free shave the first time I use them (and usually the second), so they aren&#x27;t incredibly long lasting, but some might find the rather exorbitant cost of replacement cartridges less daunting than I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I didn&#x27;t find the Flexball, a handle based rather than a cartridge based feature, to be something that improved my shaving experience.  Rather than letting the head pivot up and down as with normal razors, the Flexball allows it to pivot from side to side.  This made trimming and sculpting an insurmountable sort of task, primarily because the razor simply didn&#x27;t feel stable.  I found myself going over and over the same spots because of that, which gave me razor burn uncharacteristic of experiences I&#x27;ve had with other Gillette Fusion Proglide products.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t provide a trimming blade (like Schick Hydro products) either, so if you have sculpted facial hair, I suspect that, much like me, you&#x27;ll be happier with a different razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the lack of control I initially felt, I tried using this razor more than once with the same frustrating result, so it just isn&#x27;t the right razor for me or my needs.  The good news is that (according to the package), all Fusion handles can be used with all Fusion cartridges, so I salvaged the other cartridge that came with this razor and used it with my regular Gillette Fusion Proglide handle.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from Gillette. and what a great razor! the flexball handle allows the blades to move easily with the contour of your face/neck and from my experience minimizing cuts and scrapes. the lubrastrip was nice on places running thin on shaving cream/gel. I have used it several times now and every shave has been close and clean like the first. I will definitely be buying this product in the future!</li>
    <li> Call me a cynic, I honestly can&#x27;t say that this is an excellent razor because of the 5 blade technology.  Nor can I say that the flex ball makes for a better and cut free shave over the other types of razors.  But I still recommend it!  Why?  Because I get a better shave than I received from my old Norelco electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been a Norelco owner for over 40 years, necessity deemed that I try a Fusion Proglide when I left my electric razor at home while on a two week vacation.  The results were a revelation to me, and this version of the Fusion Proglide is my second razor.  I still receive the occasional minor cut, but it&#x27;s worth it.  I get a smoother shave, by a long shot.</li>
    <li> Generally speaking, I dislike Gillette razors.  I think them over-priced and easily dulled and usually find that I could get a better shave with less skin irritation with my Buck-Knife, so when Gillette sent me the Fusion ProGlide to review I was skeptical. That being said, the Fusion is a little better than the rest, but not much.  I just can&#x27;t get a smooth shave with these things.  I&#x27;ve used straight razors, safety-razors and cheapo-cheapo disposable razors and by far the worst of the lot tend to be anything Gillette.  I find with the Fusion that I have to go over an area several times, including against the grain, to get a decent shave which, obviously, makes for much more irritated skin.  Maybe I simply have a particularly thick beard, I don&#x27;t know.  But the razor takes a lot of work to get my shave to where I want it and the razor blades wear out fairly quickly.  Which, since they are supposed to be disposable, I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much except for one teansy-tiny thing.&lt;br /&gt;It costs thirty bucks to replace them!  And you only get eight!  I feel like I&#x27;m being conned at a used car lot.  Yeah, sure, the razor is only $11.00 but if you are foolish enough to buy it then, like a car payment, the price you pay each month somehow winds up being more than the original car.  And frankly, even the razor itself gets to me a bit.  It&#x27;s shiny and silver and the big, rolly ball is a neon racing orange.  The packaging has lots of swooshes and strong fonts to look tough, fast, and masculine.  At a certain point, you have to ask: do I look like a woman?  I don&#x27;t have some deep need to be emotionally uplifted about how my stuff personifies my identity in today&#x27;s culture.  Just give me something that works.  And I don&#x27;t think this does.&lt;br /&gt;So, I recommend stay away.  Buy the cheapos on the bottom shelf or get yourself a straight or safety razor.  They last longer and cost significantly less in both the long and the short run.  You&#x27;ll be doing yourself, and your face, a favor.</li>
    <li> Its awesome. Very smooth and elegantly designed.</li>
    <li> This is a review my husband gave me to submit for this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this razor.  It works freat to give a nice smooth shave that doesnt cause my sensitive facial skin to get red and burn like most razors.  If u want a smooth shave i definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> All the Fusion ProGlides are great razors but this FlexBall that I got from Gillette for free to try brings it to a whole new level of shaving those hard to reach angles. I mean it when I say this will be my razor from now on if I can find replacement blades for the next 5 years or so. I have not had any issues shaving with it and I&#x27;m quite pleased with it&#x27;s performance. My wife is now trying to steal mine to shave her legs.</li>
    <li> I have always used some type of Gillette razor and I recently tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor and was really impressed with the performance of the razor.  I thought the razor itself was pretty lightweight. I thought that the flexball was made it very easy to maneuver around your nose/jawline.  I did not experience any skin irritation or cuts! Also,  Gillette is a brand that I trust!!</li>
    <li> I received this as a Gillette promotion. My main razor is a fusion pro glide which I love. I have a beard so straight lines are a must. The new ball idea might be great if you are shaving you&#x27;re whole face but for someone with a beard it&#x27;s just a pain. I would recommend the Gillette brand but this razor was disapointing.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion line is a great disposable razor system. Gillette gave me this product to try and since I was already using the fusion line I thought what the heck. I will admit I was leary about trying this since I had such good luck with Proglide Power.  Flexball handle noticeably improves the razor&#x27;s ability to follow the contours of my face. With my old Fusion handle, certain areas of my neck and face would require different angles to get every whisker. I seem to have whiskers that grow in at different angles, The Flexball handle seems to adjust just enough to keep the blades flat against my face and neck at all times, eliminating the need for extra passes. The weight of the razor&#x27;s body is very nice and substantial to hold; it&#x27;s not flimsy and fly-away like those disposable razors. Mu daughter who hates my prickly face (5 oclock shadow) when I get home from work even commented that my face did not hurt her. She totally loves how my face feels.  Now if I could get a free Flexball Power razor, I would be set!</li>
    <li> I got a free ProGlide with Flexball technology to try from Gillette. I regularly shave with a ProGlide Power. Bottom line: this razor is well made and feels good to shave with but the Flexball technology doesn&#x27;t improve the shave. I prefer the ProGlide Power, although the Flexball handle seemed nicely heavy and felt good to use. Too bad the shave wasn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
    <li> When I received this Gillette Fusion Pro Glide with the Flexball handle from Gillettte to try, I was very excited.I have been using Gillette for years as they work the best and give a nice close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Gillette makes really great razors and is the market leader when it comes to shaving technology. This razor fits perfectly into their line. I love how close to the skin it gets. I have used the previous version of the Fusion Glide razors and this one works just as well though. Gillette&#x27;s razors are expensive but worth the money as they last longer. Is this one worth spending more for because of the &amp;#34;Flexball Technology&amp;#34;, probably not.&lt;br /&gt;I can get the same close shave as my other Gillette Fusion razor with no cuts and burn after using it. I can go an extra day or two without shaving though than with my regular Gillette Fusion razor though. The Flexball helps move around better and adjust to the skin unevenness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall a great razor but one star less because of the cost.</li>
    <li> To start off, I typically shave with an electric razor because it&#x27;s faster in the mornings before going to work, which is important to me. A disposable razor certainly gives me a closer shave, but requires me to use shaving cream along with it, making it harder to fit into my regular schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Proglide Razor with Flexball provides the close shave with almost no bleeding as I would expect from a Gillette, and the Flexball gives a very nice place to put my thumb. I noticed the ability to rotate the blades on my first shave because I was concentrating on the new aspect of the razor, but I did not really notice it on subsequent times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, the razor is of quality build and the razors certainly stay sharp enough to be used many times, but I didn&#x27;t find the Flexball to be so much of an impressive improvement that I would spend extra money for it over a regular proglide.</li>
    <li> Thought this was going to be another gimmick razor.....I was wrong.  From the balanced weight to the swivel head, this is the nicest razor I have ever used.  Gives a great shave.  No missed spots or pulled hairs.  Would highly recommend this razor to anyone!</li>
    <li> I normally use a Gillette Mach 3 razor. I received a Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Handle Technology for free to try. I&#x27;ve tried other razors over the years and none of them have shaved as smoothly or as safely as the Mach 3. The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Handle Technology is no different than the others. It tries to be something new and different, but fails in execution. Most of the razors I&#x27;ve tried have done an adequate job. However, the Proglide with Flexball gave me a nasty case of razor burn. My face is more sensitive than most and maybe that makes a difference, but I can&#x27;t recommend this razor to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this shaver. It actually shaves even hard to do areas.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball is by far the best safety razor blade on the market. I really like being able to pull the blade across my face without having to feel any drag or catch like most blades I have used. The flex ball is a nifty invention to an already awesome blade as it gets around my face with ease and gets virtually every hair with one pull. I will say however that it still almost seemed unnecessary as I can easily move my hand, twist my wrist, or even pull in a different direction without the flex ball. I will also say that after two weeks using the blade on a daily basis the blue bar disappeared and turned white faster than some of the older Gillette models I have used. Overall it is really nice to have a manual shave razor that cuts down shaving time to almost nothing.</li>
    <li> This is great razor work great</li>
    <li> The new fusion proglide is super smooth and slick, it cuts very close, with little to no tug and pull. I&#x27;m impressed</li>
    <li> awesome razor would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> This was first time I used Gillette and I am going to use them from know on.</li>
    <li> This Razor is awesome.  The pivot head makes all the difference in the world.</li>
    <li> I received the product to try from Gillette. I did a one month comparison where for two weeks I used the ball and then two weeks I used the pro glide. There is no difference. No added feature. No closer shave. I&#x27;ll stick to the pro glide without the ball.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this razor (yes, we each have our own!) and you can&#x27;t get a closer shave.</li>
    <li> First, the blades are great and give a good shave, but what on earth is the swivel part for...shaving a rock!!  If this were used for its swivel in mind there would be many, many cuts.  Skip this and find the similar blade without the silly swivel.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Never felt so smooth.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it.  Sure beats the disposable ones.</li>
    <li> Works good. Just a little getting used to it.</li>
    <li> Works great, good shave.</li>
    <li> It really does shave smoother and faster with no burns or cuts. These things keep going up in price, but I can get about 10 to 12 shaves or more with each blade, something not possible with my old single blade razor. Good product.</li>
    <li> The price was better here...than any store I&#x27;ve found. But...the new design isnt anything incredible. I shave every day...and have tried many different razors. It is just like a normal Fusion. The new ball system isnt anything different.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t going to change your life with the flexball. It&#x27;s just a handle in my opinion. Stick with your old gillette proglide razor and just replace the heads.</li>
    <li> Super great deal.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I shave every other day and I find this razor gives a fairly close shave. The razors last me quite a few shaves before dragging. My biggest disappointment was with the price because you know who was cheaper buy a few dollars.</li>
    <li> Great razor i loveit.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price</li>
    <li> Before I review this razor head/cartridge system, let me give a quick history of my shaving evolution: disposables, electric, Trac-II, Sensor, Mach3, Fusion and vintage double-edged.  I shaved with aerosol creams to gels to soap pucks to snobby British creams in search of the perfect shave experience.  Here are my regular guy results:  The double edged thing is nice when you have the time but sometimes life gets in the way of having time for a 15-20 minute shave.  I have to shave almost every day and for that type of routine I have found the Fusion, in combination with some Arko soap, a brush and the RazorPit blade freshener (see my Wet Shaving Listmania for additional details) to be a decent combo of convenience, economy and comfort.  The Fusion system is not my favorite cartridge system but as a result of its availability and periodic specials on refills, it is currently my go-to cartridge razor.&lt;br /&gt;As for the Flex-Ball, having &amp;quot;upgraded&amp;quot; from a standard Fusion head, this one is minimally different in my humble opinion.  Plus there is a thin piece of metal that affixes the FlexBall to the handle that I suspect will cease to effectively work or even break in time.  For the newest shaving gadget (which I totally fell sucker for), it works admirably and for a few dollars over what two cartridges would have cost anyway, I gave it a try.  This razor is now in my travel bag.  You will get a safe, comfortable, forgiving shave with the Fusion, but I am not sure the FlexBall is worth going out of your way to get.</li>
    <li> I the razor has a little strip that is supposed to help lubricate but I have never found those sufficient so I soaped my faceand went at it. One swipe was all I needed and after I finished  with no visible wounds  I was able to shave  without really being any more careful than I was with my old razor and got no cuts. Feeling brave I did under my arms and again a clean shave with no cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess this means I will now be buying the Gillette fusion proglide to shave its my best! The razor takes refills so I will definitely be purchasing more of them. The only thing that I had wished was that the razor came with a cover for the blade so that I could put it in my make up case without cutting myself when I am traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to othersr, the Gillette Fusion Proglide does the job in about a quarter of the time with no cuts. I always had to go over areas twice with theother Razor but this one gets everything in one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I got a sample of this great razor and would recommend it to any men looking for a close shave with no cuts.</li>
    <li> This razor pivots/flexes as advertised. Great for the man or woman in your household. all blades for any razor eventuall become dull with use, be sure to order spares.</li>
    <li> Ok first, let me say... I am female. I use men&#x27;s razors, coz razor&#x27;s that are made for women are made like the way some men think women should be.... dainty, cheap and lightweight. With pretty frufru colors and flowers.    So, I bought this razor coz my mach 3 was really old and I wanted one with more blades. This razor is the BOMB. With its pivoting head, it really hugs your curves like the blade is curved itself. You can shave faster with this razor... and not a single nick. It also cuts really close for extra smooth legs.    Totally recommend this razor to anyone, but especially women. You can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Good razor !!!  pivoting great for doing legs...better than sissy girl ones.</li>
    <li> Its no different than the other razors</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Flexball razor system provides a clean and easy shaving experience. I noticed that the flexball really does make quite a difference when shaving because it allows the head to remain in conact with your skin throughout the entire stroke and provides even pressure across all of the blades. I have fairly coarse beard hair and the razor did an excellent job of getting nice and close to my skin the first time unlike my previous razor. I would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great razor! I used this razor and was immediately happy with it. I have a heavy jawline and it&#x27;s always hard to get a few spots, this razor allowed me to get those areas much easier. I am very familiar with Gillette products so the 5 blades was nothing new to me but the rotating head makes this thing feel like nothing I&#x27;ve used before. I&#x27;d recommend this razor for anyone who shaves. You shan&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was speculative at first when I saw the ad for this razor on T.V. However I trust the Gillette brand, and when I first used this razor I was not a single bit disappointed! With just one clean stroke down my jaw line I was able to shave down to the skin, and there wasn&#x27;t a single spec of blood. I did not have to lift the razor at all to get that precise shave, the ball does EXACTLY as Gillette claims it can do! This razor has cut down the time it takes me to shave in the morning significantly, and I highly recommend it; if you are curious or just don&#x27;t believe the hype, try it for yourself and you will see that the hype is truly well deserved.</li>
    <li> awsome product! easy on the skin&lt;br /&gt;very sharp blades probably the best razor i have used so far plus the flex ball is pretty cool hah</li>
    <li> I started buying this razor for my husband and son - especially my son who refuses to use an electric shaver. They both do not want to use anything else. We have run the gamut of the disposable shavers - and soon found that those were just not going to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We then ventured into the avenue of the more expensive razors such as the Fusion. And this is where our search stopped! Both my husband and my son love it. They claim their shaves have never felt as close and smooth - and clean. Gillette uses quality blades that do not dull quickly. The combination of the different blades provides a shave that feels comfortable while it is being used without leaving a &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;chafing&amp;#34; afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uh-Hmmm . . . they bragged about their so much that I simply had to try it out myself! Now our bathrooms have THREE sets so that I have my own! LOL!</li>
    <li> An amazing shaver, very close shave and the flexi ball is just brilliant.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Fusion for years now and it was time for a new handle. I saw this ball headed handle and thought &amp;#34;ok it makes sense.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of the ball head is nice but this does not shave any better than my old Fusion without the ball head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a new handle, then go for it, otherwise; if you are thinking of getting a new handle because of the ball head, then wait for something better to make the jump. I rate it 5 stars because it does the job as well as the old Fusion.</li>
    <li> Gillette fusion proglide is definitely a smooth operator!  The blade is the best i ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many multi-blade razors before, but the Gillette Fusion Proglide is thus far the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the shipping confirmation telling me that Gillette had sent out my new razor, I stopped shaving.  The moment my new razor arrived, I shaved off the three days worth of beard, and it was the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades give a phenomenally close shave, and the pivot action head really does follow the contour of my jawline.  The detailing/edging blade on top is FINALLY worth my time and effort, and really helped square up the bottom of my chops.  No irritation from shaving.  All in all, I&#x27;m fairly certain I found myself a new razor.</li>
    <li> I received a free Gilette Fusion Proglide from Gilette so I had a chance to use it. Normally, I use the Gilette fusion vibrating razor. This razor, although it doesn&#x27;t vibrate, is a great razor. The only thing that could possibly make it better is if it did vibrate. The moisturizing strip on the blade lasts a bit longer than on the others I&#x27;ve used. The blades are smooth and have a very comfortable feel while using them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s razor, expensive refills, just buy them at Costco.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> So I received this razor from Gillette to try out.  Not my usual type of razor, but it does work well.  The five blades do really get a close shave, and it is easy to use.  Feels comfortable in my hand, and I like the weight of the razor itself.  I&#x27;m not too sure about the flexball technology.  I can&#x27;t tell if it really plays into how well this razor works.  But let me say, to the guys, watch out, because your lady will take it from you!  My wife tried it out to shave her legs, and she LOVES it!  Says it gets a really close shave and removes hair well.  And her legs do feel extra soft after using it, so I&#x27;m not complaining!  All in all, it is a good razor.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> So far i love it. good quality and comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> I received the flex ball razor from Gillette. I was skeptical at first. I was Worried that with flexibility i might be more apt to cut myself.  Turned out to be the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Definately worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have never used a razor on my face before because of my sensitive skin. If i needed a shave i would go to a barber but after using the&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Fusion Proglide from Gillette, my view on razors has been changed. Using the Proglide cartridges felt extremely nice. I loved the shave and after the shave my face had a clean look and felt baby soft. It didn&#x27;t cut which i was grateful for and the feel of shaving was astonishing. I recommend if you haven&#x27;t tried a Fusion Proglide razor before, definitely give that a go; they work extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly though, after a week or two, it started to dull a little bit. it wasn&#x27;t shaving quite as well as before but i still felt the smoothness after using it. But lucky with this one, it came with two cartridges. But i would definitely buy more replacement cartridges when these has lost their use. I believe it was worth it, coming from a person who doesn&#x27;t use razors.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.  He was very impressed by this razor!  He has already bought new cartridges.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift and received rave reviews. Very nice razor, gently on the skin!</li>
    <li> This is way much better than older model. Shaving does not take more than 5-10 mijs now. However buy razor without battery as it is good to hold and feels heavy and stable.</li>
    <li> A razor is a razor, what more can I say, it takes the stubble off.</li>
    <li> I was using mach3 for last 13 years. Gotta love the swivel design.&lt;br /&gt;It feels more natural and clean after shaving</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good,but very expensive</li>
    <li> Absolutely nothing special about this thing.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: Gillette sent me a free ProGlide razor to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for this product, but this isn&#x27;t anything truly better than what I already have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a user of an old Remington dry electric foil shaver, I had been told by friends and family that I should try one of Gillete&#x27;s manual shavers. Most people I talked to highly recommended them and explained that they got the smoothest, silkiest skin after using their product. So I thought I&#x27;d give if a shot and buy some shaving cream at the store after receiving my free razor in the mail. Upon first picking up the Gillette shaver, I was quite impressed on the build quality. The metal felt strong and the handle was nicely weighted. (This is in comparison to my Remington which is very plasticky and rubbery, and whose button has fallen off) After my first shave, I cut myself several times on my chin and neck, but I figured that this is pretty normal, since I was new at the manual shaver. I still had to touch up a few spots with my electric razer since the Gillette couldn&#x27;t remove all the hair. Well, after one week of using it, I improved and had about the same spots that I would get cut on my neck as with my electric shaver. However, the Gillette blade still could not cut my sideburns very well, even if I flipped the blade over and used the back side like they mentioned. I also didn&#x27;t feel that the Gillette gave me that much of a closer shave nor cut any faster than my old Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple cost analysis... With this manual shaver, I would have to buy shaving cream monthly ($4) and an 8 pack of new blades every six months ($30). This comes to an annual cost of about $110. With my Remington, I only need to change the blade and foil once a year, which costs $25. I could even replace the entire shaver every year for $40, replace the blades twice a year and still come out ahead than with the Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m not convinced yet to switch to this manual shaver. Until the price of Gillete&#x27;s products can match the competition and a revolutionary product comes around, I&#x27;m better off sticking with what I&#x27;ve been using the last 10 years.</li>
    <li> The razor works great.  The ball is pretty much a gimmick as I&#x27;ve yet to see or feel it actually move but you can&#x27;t beat the razors.  Tried dollar shave clubs best razor before this one and it isn&#x27;t even close.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh!! My husband spent a fortune buying every kind of electric shaver you can buy and he tried every kind of hand held razor you can find and all he could do was cut up his face. First let me state that my husband is 60 years old and he thinks his hair is changing a bit and a lot on his face. He never had problems shaving before but now and for the past few months he&#x27;s been miserable. He would cut his face to pieces and he was so unhappy with it, he really didn&#x27;t know what to do. Now this is how we found this Gillette Fusion razor. I read a lot-and I do mean a lot!! I read all my books on a Kindle. If you&#x27;re familiar with Kindles, you know that when you open it up (mine has a really pretty but light weight protector on it) ....first pops up and ad for something. It can be anything, really. One day I opened my book to read and up popped this Gillette Fusion Proglide Men&#x27;s Razor and I decided to order it. Why not, he&#x27;d tried everything else and I KNEW of ALL the ones he&#x27;d tried. I thought: Big deal, this is will probably be like all the rest but I&#x27;m going to order it and at least let him give it a try!! Well lo and behold: This razor DEFINITELY TOOK THE CAKE-!! CAN YOU SAY: OH HAPPY DAYS?.........He was as skeptical as he was with alllllllll the rest he&#x27;d tried....and lo and behold........it glides over his face and he can shave alllllllllllllllll day long with it and it ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT CUT HIS FACE....ABSOLUTELY NO WAY-!!!!!! He practically started jumping up and down on the bed telling me how FABULOUS this razor is!! He&#x27;s been using it since around Christmas time and he&#x27;s still using it and EXTREMELY HAPPY with it-more than happy! NOT ONE ITTTY BITTY NICK with this razor!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this works for your husband. I was so thrilled that I found that ad on my Kindle!! He had given up looking at razors at the store because he was tired of getting cut up!! He had gone back to electric ones even if they didn&#x27;t do a good job, at least he wasn&#x27;t getting cut up every day. So this razor is worth more than mere words can say for him!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now listen to this ladies: Don&#x27;t borrow this razor from your husband because they are very inexpensive and you can have your own and they will shave your legs as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind!! You&#x27;ll love this razor, too!! I have very fine hair and this razor will not cut you so you&#x27;ll be very happy with it-guaranteed!! If it doesn&#x27;t work for you-then I will go and eat rocks!! I have the smoothest legs ever!! They downright shine-without any lotion on them!! So don&#x27;t think twice about giving this razor a try!!t up every day. So this razor is worth more than mere words can say for him!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now listen to this ladies: Don&#x27;t borrow this razor from your husband because they are very inexpensive and you can have your own and they will shave your legs as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind!! You&#x27;ll love this razor, too!! I have very fine hair and this razor will not cut you so you&#x27;ll be very happy with it-guaranteed!! If it doesn&#x27;t work for you-then I will go and eat rocks!! I have the smoothest legs ever!! They downright shine-without any lotion on them!! So don&#x27;t think twice about giving this razor a try!!</li>
    <li> a bit awkward, requiring adaptation; very close shave; trimming blade for sideburns/around nose very helpful...time will tell...have only been using for one month</li>
    <li> Gillette supplied me with a Fusion Proglide razor to try and I was intrigued by the &amp;#34;flexball&amp;#34; technology. It moves well. The flexball gives it the ability to follow the curves of my face easier. But, honestly, it isn&#x27;t that much better than other 4 or 5 blade razors that I have in my medicine cabinet. I will use this razor until the blades go dull an then probably shop by price. Or, use my wife&#x27;s Venus Embrace. The handle is bigger and I don&#x27;t need to shave my mustache/upper lip, so the lubricating strip doesn&#x27;t get in my way. Those are really nice razors. I&#x27;m a hairy guy and, sometimes, need to use more than one razor to get all the hairs growing in at random/strange angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about it, go ahead and give this razor a try. It does offer a good, close shave, but the flexball technology doesn&#x27;t really make a difference for me.</li>
    <li> As with all Gillette products, the razor is sharp and clean.  It lasts through several shaves, at least four or five, if I shave daily.  The roller ball feature didn&#x27;t add anything, for me.  At first it was strange to use, but I overcame that easily, but it didn&#x27;t make it easier or closer.  A would still recommend a try, perhaps it was just me and the shave is great anyway.</li>
    <li> My hubby is getting a much better shave with this new razor. Yes, I will buy one for my son soon.</li>
    <li> This is John I am Mary&#x27;s husband and I got the razor free to try. I have a very tough beard and when I use disposable razors I have to use at least two and it takes forever to get my face smooth. Today I tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide and not only did it leave me smooth but it only took a few minutes!! SO if you have a tough beard like mine then this is the razor for you and it saves money because you use less.</li>
    <li> On the plus side, the gillette fusion razor is excellent. It&#x27;s a precise, thorough, and clean cut. The 5 blades make it very comfortable and easy to get all the strays that any other razor might miss. I&#x27;ve always loved the gillette fusion razor. I&#x27;ve been a faithful customer for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, I&#x27;m not so into the pro glide. I thought it would be great for getting odd edges, but the swivel head is so flexible that it cut me. If you make a sharp curve to get a different angle, where a stationary razor would move with the rest of the handle, the razor head will stay while the handle turns. When that happens, you end up dragging the razor from side to size, cutting the skin. Maybe I&#x27;m just not used to the motion path of this razor yet, but basically a stationary razor worked fine for me for the last few years. I only gave this one a shot because it was a good deal online. Not sure that I&#x27;d go for it again. Others with better dexterity might warm up to a product like this, but be careful!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Razor from Gillette to review.  As a 60 year old male, I have been around the block with razors.  I have seen it all. This razor is marketed as being  the razor for the edges and contours of ones face.  Also,for ease of having your hairs pulled ass you&#x27;re shaving.  When I opened the package,the first thing I noticed was the heavy razor. I was very impressed by this. Who likes a little dinky razor? Okay,so the first test was a good grade.    Next was the look. It looks nice....moving on.    The Gillette Fusion Proglide claims that it can move with the curves on my face and get those little edges that some may struggle with.I didn&#x27;t have to lean into the mirror to get closer and closer as I usually do with my BIC razor. It is the little things that matter when shaving a part of your stache.I don&#x27;t want to mess it up to much.    I have to say that the blades are pretty sharp and DO NOT pull any hairs while going from point \\&quot;A&#x27; to point \\&quot;B\\&quot;. I shaved rather fast. It is summer and so I got rid of my facial hair last week as the temps got a bit higher. See,I usually go to my barber who uses old scool technology;a simple straightedge.    This razor does let me maintain throughout the week and a half before I visit the old timers to get my beard or mustache tamed.    I would say that it is much better than a simple cheap plastic razor,but it should be. It also came along with 2 blades. Would I purchase a refill,yes?  I purchased one for my son and he was already using it! Thanks dad he said,but he too visits the local barber. He likes to be clean shaven and I think my DIL loves it too. He in turn gave it to my grandson who can grow one heck of a beard. He just keeps his goatee in tip top shape with an electric razor,but will give this one a go.    In all,this is a good razor. It will NOT be as good as a straightedge.  It is a decent price point and will last. I shave probably around 3-4 times a week to maintain my hair. I haveused this razor for a month and I have a replacement to boot.</li>
    <li> Seriously speaking, after watching so many videos and reviews I thought this product will be amazing.. but 5 blades doesn&#x27;t do any magic at all as they say, its just same as MACH3. I was using MACH 3 before.. I like that better than the Fusion with the 5 blades.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know.. they created lot of buzz with this machine, its not a must buy product. Not worth it, If you have Mach 3 already... continue using the same one.</li>
    <li> The head moves around too much and causes nicks and irritation.  I only used it a couple of times and wish I could get a refund.  The original manual ProGlide is much better, and it&#x27;s the razor I continue to use regularly.</li>
    <li> Thought it would have battery with vibrator.</li>
    <li> Awesome product I love it it worked great.</li>
    <li> I honestly couldn&#x27;t notice a significant difference between this Fusion and other Fusion razors when shaving my face.  However, I was blessed with a perfectly rounded dome that grows very little hair.  This razor works wonders to get rid of those pesky hairs that keep trying to grow and distract the world from my shiny head.  For all of my fellow chrome domes out there, I&#x27;d recommend giving this razor a go.</li>
    <li> Extremely close shave.  Shaving head mobility helps prevent missed spots</li>
    <li> Great razor and arrived FAST</li>
    <li> DOES NOTHING!!!!. DOES NOT SHAVE ANY BETTER THAN ANY FIXED RAZOR.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide is the best razor.  I got it free from BzzAgent. This is a great razor.  I recommend it to all and anyone.  I didn&#x27;t think the ball thing would make a difference, but it does.  It goes smoothly over my chin.</li>
    <li> I received the gillette fusion Proglide razor. I absolutely love it I&#x27;ve tried many different razors being in the military i have to shave every day. This is by far the best one yet.</li>
    <li> For those of you who like Gillette, stick to the proglide. I found the top of the ball hitting my nose when shaving my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;If you want the best shave available, use Schick Hydro 5.  Don&#x27;t bother with anything else!</li>
    <li> Arrived here very fast and is the real deal</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide for free from Gillette to try. They&#x27;ve been adding additional blades one at a time through the years, but this is different. FlexBall technology makes it a bit easier to move around as it contours your face. Honestly, it shaves as cleanly as any other 5-blade razor, but the ball does move better and it doesn&#x27;t cost much more, so why not? The ball helped Dyson revolutionize the vacuum industry, let&#x27;s see what it can do for razors!</li>
    <li> To be sure, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this razor. In fact, every time I&#x27;ve used it over the past few weeks after receiving it as part of a Gillette promotion, I&#x27;ve come away with a well above-average shave. Leaves your skin very smooth and I&#x27;ve had no razor burn or irritation that I can recall. So no complaints there. But...it seems like it&#x27;s pretty much exactly the same as the regular ProGlide that I already have in my cabinet. The Flexball Handle sounds good and looks great on TV, but I can&#x27;t say I noticed the slightest bit of difference between it and the more static cartridge of the ProGlide. I haven&#x27;t noticed it move to accommodate the contours of my face once. Which, hey, maybe you&#x27;re not supposed to feel it move. That&#x27;d be great design right there. But even after paying closer attention to it in the mirror while shaving, I haven&#x27;t seen it adjust much, if at all. Maybe my eyes are missing it, as well. You certainly won&#x27;t be disappointed with the results of your shave, but the Flexball stuff feels a little gimmicky.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re in the market for a new razor try this out. Very smooth on sensitive skin and leaves no stubble. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> All in all I am very satisfied with the razor. Gets the Job done. But I can not feel any benefit from that new feature (flexball). I have been using the Mach 3 Turbo and it is literally the same feeling. I would recommend it to my friends but if I should give them my honest opinion I would tell them to buy the Mach 3 instead. It is cheaper and the minimal difference is not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I loved this razor!. I saw commercials about this razor and it made me want to try it. I love the new ball flex feature. It works well with the curves of my body. I didn&#x27;t even cut myself with this razor like I do with most that I​​​​ have tried in the past</li>
    <li> Compared to most other razors I&#x27;ve used, this one takes the cake. I love how close of a shave you can get without having to worry about razor burn our cutting yourself when going over the curves of your face. I will continue to purchase this product for years to come!</li>
    <li> Close shave but I think the pivoting actually makes nicks and cuts more likely. Update: tried this again this morning and I was correct -- it gives a close shave but I had several abrasions and nicks that I wouldn&#x27;t normally get from shaving. It felt similar to when my prior razors were getting dull; I think the &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; technology means that the razor swivels in a way that the blade moves at a weird angle sometimes and I am guessing that&#x27;s why I have the feeling of razor burn. So it&#x27;s a close shave, but with nicks... So I think given that, I would rather have a less-close shave with fewer nicks (or no nicks at all). So I&#x27;m sticking with my old Fusion model, or a safety razor, or my Headblade. But I won&#x27;t be buying refills for this thing. They&#x27;re more expensive anyway, and the razor is kind of a monstrosity. Oh well... 9 bucks down the drain.</li>
    <li> Closest most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Excellent product from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Gilette Fusion Power razor without the flexball. It used a AAA battery to vibrate and &amp;#34;lift hairs up&amp;#34; for a closer shave. When the battery died, I chose not to replace it and never noticed a difference. I received a free sample of the flexball from Gillette and decided to give it a try. My first impression was that the flex ball seemed pretty gimmicky, especially considering my experience with the Fusion Power razor. After using it, my thoughts are the same. When I shave using the new razor, the flexball never moves. This flex ball might be useful for people with broken wrists... but it makes no difference to me. I will say however, the new pro glide blades feel smoother than the plain Fusion blades. The Fusion razors and blades are a great series, but the &amp;#34;flex ball&amp;#34; is nothing to get excited over if you already own a Gillette fusion razor.</li>
    <li> very nice these razors can each last a month with daily shaves</li>
    <li> The retail version has a complete set of refil razors with it...however this had one refil...three were missing. Great razor however i feel kind of ripped off knowing they took some refil razors out. Great razor...buy in person from a store to get the full value</li>
    <li> I was using Gillette mac-3 razor for few years now and got chance to try Gillette Fusion Proglide razor as part of BzzAgent campaign. I started using Gillette Fusion Proglide razor couple of weeks back. It gives very smooth shave and great clean skin. I definitely prefer this razor and will be using this in future till Gillette comes out with another better product.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusions with Pro glide is an amazing razor.  I took on the manliest of my neck beards and tamed my upper beard from taking over my cheeks with ease.  Would I let this 5 bladed ninja near my beard? hell no....It would make quick work and leave my beautiful friend in the bathroom sink.  But it does leave my neck smooth and irritation free.</li>
    <li> I feel ultimate smoothness when I shave, specially on my neck... It is awesome!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the old plastic razors for years.  The Proglide gives a close shave and does a better job without pulling.</li>
    <li> This is my first razor. I used electric shavor before.&lt;br /&gt;The experience is just smooth and perfect, and the razor is easy to handle even for a first time user.</li>
    <li> Great price and razor. With how expensive the blades have gotten. It&#x27;s sometimes cheaper to replace the razor too. This is a great deal and was excited to see it had a coupon I could clip so it saved me even more. Happy camper!!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a promotion from Gillette, and boy am I glad I did.  Combined with the Fusion 2 in 1 Shave Gel, the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide razor effortlessly sweeps over your face , leaving smooth skin behind. The innovative no-mess, rustproof gel can complimented the experience greatly, having an indicator to warn when you are getting low.</li>
    <li> I received this Gillette Fusion ProGlide blade as part of a promotion for BzzAgent and I have to say that I found my new blade. I have never been able to grow a full beard because their are patches on my face that just won&#x27;t grow in. I have to shave regularly so that I don&#x27;t look like an idiot. Usually, I shave with an electric razor then I follow up with a Gillette Fusion razor blade to get a clean shave. This is the only way that I can avoid the discomfort of the razor pulling on the hairs of my face. This razor accompanied with the Gilette Fusion ProGlide Ocean Breeze gel did not pull at all. No discomfort. I was amazed .Even after three weeks and my wife using the blade on her legs.......no pulling. The design of the razor seemed to help the razor in clinging  to the corner of my jawline without the need of repeatedly shaving the same area over and over again. I would like to say that I purchased some new blades but the old blade is still going after three weeks...........</li>
    <li> I already am a big fan of Gillette shaving products so when I got an chance to try Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care  for free I was very excited.  The shaving Gel smells good and very easy to apply and lathers nicely. The shave itself was smoothest ever I have ever experienced. its a very close shave in almost half the time it used to take me. The blades are pretty easy to clean. The shave left my face with a nice shine and smooth skin. Gillette has done it again .</li>
    <li> Super clean multiple shave. Keep the blades clean and they&#x27;ll keep you clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. The price was good.</li>
    <li> I expected a bit more from this razor. Actually don&#x27;t see any advantages comparing with Gillette Mach 3 Turbo. The razor if not very good with hard-to-reach areas probably due to too much flexibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to switch back to Mach 3 turbo once all razors are wore off.</li>
    <li> Very good, it&#x27;s my latest favorite in gillette family</li>
    <li> The razor has not gotten nearly as close of a shave as other razors I&#x27;ve used and the flexible handle wasn&#x27;t all that flexible. Not necessarily a bad razor but not an especially good one either.</li>
    <li> The precision trimmer on the back of the blades is pretty amazing.</li>
    <li> Great to shave. Cheaper than other places, such as target and Walmart! I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Fusion for years and years.  It&#x27;s definitely a little better than the last model, although I always hate myself for buying each new generation.  At least they didn&#x27;t add another 5 blades to the thing.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I got this razor,I&#x27;d like it! THS Amazon</li>
    <li> The razor is great, just hope they get the refills in stock soon. shaves like you went to the barber.</li>
    <li> Have four of these razors. Love&#x27;em</li>
    <li> Last iteration of the fusion series was solid, and enough to persuade me to buy the Flexball. However there is a little hinge on top that tends to scratch the hell out of my nose when shaving my upper lip. Very uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> The smooth shave has always been razor easy, yet the added flex-ball handle is over the top smooth for a daily shave. I hope you continue to research for continued improvement, which will  lower the cost.</li>
    <li> Much better than my older Gillette system.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette to try out and I loved it!  This razor is awesome and gets the close shave that I need.  I love the 5 blades and think that I will be ditching my Mach 3 for this razor from now on.  The power glide or flex ball aspect wasn&#x27;t that noticeable to me but I did like the number of blades.</li>
    <li> I have used Fusion in the past, but it wasn&#x27;t the right razor for me - even though I thought it was a very good razor overall.  I received a Fusion Proglide free from Gillette to test, so gave it another try.  It seems to be an improvement over the original Fusion razor, the flex-ball is a great new feature.  It still isn&#x27;t quite right for me, unfortunately - my beard hair is just too thick or coarse or something, the razor clogs and pulls too much for me.  I think it will make a great first razor for my teenage son though, as he will have less facial hair (at least to start) &amp; the flexibility of this razor will be a good way to help keep him from cutting himself.</li>
    <li> Having used Mach 3&#x27;s for several years, I received this as a trial. Although it seemed a bit bulky at first, the swivel joint is quite large, I found that the pivot does indeed allow the head to track better - in two directions instead of one. Blades seem to last longer than average for me (based on other reviews), and I am on week three with the first cartridge just now needing to change it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning may take a bit more effort if allowed to build up, but if properly maintained this handle should last for a while. Overall, this is a functional piece.</li>
    <li> Love the blades.  Recommend the initial investment for this razor.</li>
    <li> I am a woman, but I wanted to try something a little more hard core since my hair is thick and grows back especially fast. This works alright, not much  better than the ladies razors though.</li>
    <li> Best shave ever !! I did not think the previous Gillette Fusion could be topped but thos one does it.</li>
    <li> Hide it under your mattress with your other valuables. Very pricey for the refills (they suck you in on the lower price for the handle and maybe ONE refill).  Works well though.</li>
    <li> Great shave at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a female, and purchased this razor because many times mens razors are sharper and better quality than women&#x27;s. This is very sharp and does a good job (my legs are silky) however, I feel like I don&#x27;t have full control over the razor because of the ball and the way it moves. This is why I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars. I feel the ball is a bit over rated and potentially dangerous if you are shaving anywhere other than your face. If it didn&#x27;t have the ball and the unique flex, it would probably be a pretty good razor since it cuts well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice. A little better than the original.</li>
    <li> This product has given me the best shave I have ever had. Normally I get velcro face after an hour, but with this my velcro face is gone all day. This razor is how I plan on shaving permanently.</li>
    <li> I hate to Shave ! I have been a fan of Gillette Razors for a long time .I have been a fan of the regular non flexural razor since it came out . I decided what the heck ill try this one out . WOW!!!!! I found the feel of this razor on my face is like rolling a glass roller over my face ...No Nicks , No cuts just a very close Shave . This is by far the best Shave i have had ever and I&#x27;m 61 Years old .</li>
    <li> My husband is beyond satisfied....THANK GOODNESS! I got tired of him complaining about his old fusion glider and he kept hinting at wanting the one with the rollerflex. Now that he has it and using it, he&#x27;s happy (silent) camper. Peace at last!</li>
    <li> hubby loves this brand..close shave every time</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace an old Fusion handle.  Didn&#x27;t expect much from the Flexball, but that it actually works extremely well!  It definitely gives me a noticeably close shave without having to go over the same tricky curved areas as many times.  At $6.99 for a flexball handle plus 2 fusion blades, the price was really good too.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Its a good razor.  I wouldn&#x27;t go dumping last years model just to get this one, though.  Not because one is all that much better or, really, different than the other but because it isn&#x27;t much different.  The Flexball just takes over some of the action your very own well designed wrist would normally handle.  No if you have a stiff wrist due to injury, fear of shaving, or just plain laziness then you need this razor.  To most of us it won&#x27;t make any real difference, but it will get the job done as well as it always has.</li>
    <li> Used to use electric, but always had to &amp;#34;clean it up&amp;#34; with a disposable razor.  So I decided to see if I could find a non-electric razor that&#x27;d do the job, and am I glad to have found it on the first try in the Fusion!  I have a medium beard, and when I shave, I like for my face to feel like baby skin, when I&#x27;m finished.  The fusion does it!  I got mine from amazon on January 24th.  I rinse it off after use with clean shower, and would you believe that it is now April 27th and I&#x27;m still on the original blade! Do the math!  I&#x27;ve been using the same blade for over 3 months!  That is incredible!  Boy, did I get my money&#x27;s worth with the Fusion!</li>
    <li> Works great. As an occasional shaver, not everyday, I always used throw aways. they were ok, but this gives a much closer shave without any irritation.</li>
    <li> I have experimented with many different razors; none have came close. I always go back to Gillette Fusion.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it would be just another gimmick to buy more expensive razor blades, but it is a good razor and works well and most, if not all fusion blades fit it. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend loves it!</li>
    <li> Gillette pro glide with flexible razor is really good and convenient.</li>
    <li> DOES NOTHING THE HYPE IS TOTALLY WRONG WITH OR WITHOUT THE SO CALLED &amp;#34;FLEX BALL&amp;#34; THIS DID NOTHING TOO ENHANCE THE SHAVE TELL GILLETTE THEIR RAZORS AND REFILLS ALSO ARE WORTHLESS I WOULD ADVISE THE PUBLIC TO NOT PURCHASE IT</li>
    <li> My husband really loves this razor. He said it&#x27;s one of the best he&#x27;s had.</li>
    <li> This is the best shave ever.  I bought this at Walmart when it first came out since it was on display and I remember seeing the commercial for it so I threw it in the cart.  This will change shavers, I bet even electric trimmers will use this ball technology.  The price of the blades is steep but I love how I feel after shaving with this.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my dad. This product is not available in India. He said he really enjoys his shaves now.</li>
    <li> The razor only slightly tilts back and forth and doesn&#x27;t seem like a compelling reason to upgrade</li>
    <li> I use the manual razor for the first time. This one is very good. I like it.</li>
    <li> There is a lot of misunderstanding  of this product. What  they did was improve the movement of the blade, the razor is still the same as the old Gillette fusion proglide.</li>
    <li> Better than the regular gillette fusion.</li>
    <li> Cuts my face. I prefer the Mach 3 or 4 or whatever it&#x27;s called</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was tired of buying disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1. Handle feels nice. Lots of grip so it doesn&#x27;t slip even if I get a little soap or shaving cream on my hand. Good heft and feel.&lt;br /&gt;2. The blades are okay. I still get the occasional nick here and there (I always do). Nothing special but they&#x27;re not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. Not sure about the swivel head. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference but I also nicked myself less. That could also have to do with the newer blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t regret spending $12 on this razor. I&#x27;ll probably keep using it. Seems like a decent purchase.</li>
    <li> Great shave with this razor</li>
    <li> very easy to use seem to handle my IRISH face quite well</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so shaving isn&#x27;t the most comfortable task for me. I&#x27;ve been using the standard Fusion razors for years and they have given me the best shave out of all the different companies I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I received a coupon for $3 off the new Fusion Flexball. At first I was thinking yet another gimmick razor but I decided to give it a shot since I was saving some cash. Too my surprise, I feel like I had just gotten my best shave with this razor. It seemed like I saved at least a few minutes off my shave time with the improved razor with the Flexball also. I didn&#x27;t have to go back over the same areas again.  But most off all I had NO razor burn like I usually do. This is my first shave with the Proglide razors as I used the standard Fusion in the past. I recommend this razor for people with sensitive skin and hope you have as good a shave as I did!</li>
    <li> Dad said it was great</li>
    <li> Save yourself the trouble and buy a safety razor. Cartridges are $$$$$ and provide a mediocre shave.</li>
    <li> I decided to bow to marketing pressure and get one of these. I rolled my eyes at the revolutionary-flavored ads, but I figured the most I could lose was a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I did! I get a smooth shave over all the curvy bits -- &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; razor, puh-leeze -- because that little pivot ball really pivots. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> I suppose this gives a better shave? I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s any easier or less time-consuming. It seems Gillette updated this product because Fusion has been around awhile and cheaper competitors are popping up.</li>
    <li> A very &amp;#34;pricey &amp;#34;shave but you will be comfortable and look good! That&#x27;s the point!</li>
    <li> Smoothest shave I have ever had. I am giving one to each of my adult sons.</li>
    <li> Honestly.....I wanted to hate this razor. I mean, a ball? Has someone finally jumped the shark in the razor wars? But after using it for a week or so....I have to say no, it is a real solid improvement over existing razor technology. Until there is an iPhone app for shaving...I will stick with this.</li>
    <li> I brought this down to 3 stars because I don&#x27;t get a close shave from it but since I&#x27;m a woman maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s made for a man&#x27;s face. I don&#x27;t know though. I&#x27;ve always bought men&#x27;s razors because they seem to work better but in this case, not so much. I was drawn in by the swiveling head but this is NOT the ball joint one, even though it appears to be, it just flexes side to side and that doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
    <li> First off, this is the BEST razor I have ever used! I have tried Bic, Schick, Norelco electric razors and a Gillette Mach Turbo 3 .  None of them come close to this.  Other razors don&#x27;t get all of the hairs.  With the other razors, hairs were missed and I got razor rash on my neck.  Not the case with the Fusion ProGlide.  It gets EVERY hair the first time!!! The razor rash is gone. It&#x27;s such a comfortable razor it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m shaving.  This is as good as it gets! The handle provides great control too.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Thank you Gillette for taking the pain and hassle out of shaving.</li>
    <li> Shaves very close and the shave last longer. Have had no nicks either.</li>
    <li> I was able to try the new battery powered razor and I&#x27;ve always been hesitant to believe the batteries could help, but they do.  I&#x27;m a believer and I&#x27;d recommend this for everyone.</li>
    <li> I currently received the product to try for free from Gillette.  With this new model using the Flexball technology, is quite innovative. I do feel like it is a smooth shave, I&#x27;m sure that it is due to the actual blades, however the flex ball compliments it very well and results in easy, comfortable gliding. My face is as smooth as baby bottom with little to no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before getting this product make sure you know which razor is better for you, Gillette has wide variety of different style razors. Unlike the power run razors, this model in particular is the manual razor which gives you the perfect amount of control. With the Flexball, it&#x27;s a lot easier to manuever around our facial contours for a much smoother shave.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;d use again. Good movement. No nicks. It got the job done with no irritation. So - a winner around here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor with the same cartridge since I received it three weeks ago and I&#x27;m still getting a mostly smooth, irritation, cut and nick free shave.  I would highly recommend this razor to anyone that shaves, I&#x27;ve used multiple brands and styles of razors and this one is in my top 3!  I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing a new cartridge in the coming days.</li>
    <li> Best shave ever.  I like the power version and miss the buzzing, but the glide ball is&lt;br /&gt;Much better. I like it alot</li>
    <li> As a business/medicine student and DJ on a hurry I cannot deal with time-consuming cuts and/or hair patches. This razor provides the most smooth shave I have ever felt on my life. The Gillette Fusion literally glides on my skin and hard to reach neck areas. Without cutting my skin! I needed to recommend it!</li>
    <li> I hate disposable razors. Such a waste to throw away the whole razor when just the blade needs replacing. And of course the handles are cheap and not very nice too. That&#x27;s why I was eager to try out the ProGlide. It certainly is much nicer. The blades do a better job (less nicking, fewer passes required) and the handle is 10 times nicer to use. The flexball, I must say, is a little weird, though. I think I&#x27;d be happier with a traditional, fixed handle, but it doesn&#x27;t get in the way, at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I like reducing the amount thrown in the landfill, the ProGlide is a lot more expensive than a disposable razor. I got this one free from Gillette, and while I think it&#x27;s worth it, but I won&#x27;t lie: I&#x27;d rather get it as a gift than have to buy it myself.</li>
    <li> Received Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Fexball Handle Technology FOR FREE, tried on the spot. Love the construction feeling in hand. Had a smooth shave with Fexball Technology, it took me less time to shave compare to other razors. Super easy to fine tuning my hair edge line with the top single razor, love it, love it, love it. Didn&#x27;t feel this hurting hair pulling while shaving. No irritating skin, no redness, no cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give 4 stars cause razor head seems to be a little big, obvious more razors in it, but can&#x27;t have a perspective sometimes when razors starts and when ends.</li>
    <li> I had the old one for few years &amp;recently I received this one from bzzagent for free to try , it is really amazing, it goes on your skin so smothly .highly recommended</li>
    <li> By far, the only razor I can use consistently - with the purple can of shaving gel - that avoids all nicks and scratches.  Did not realize that I even though I shave maybe every other day to 2 days (a blessing to be sure), I was using the blades on these a bit longer than I should have and thus realized after more easily getting the refills through amazon, my shave remains close and even better.  The battery or power version of this same razor seems to be a waste for me, not sure the benefit except it vibrated and was bulkier/heaver.  The little ball on this guy lets you easily get all the around your chin/neck area in a breeze.  My go to razor for a while and see no need to change.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Amazing razor. I have a very thick beard and this doesn&#x27;t pull at all when shaving. It glides across the skin. Would absolutely recommend this.</li>
    <li> 100% reliable recommend thanks for everything</li>
    <li> Awesome item using it now</li>
    <li> Lets be honest......... I manscape......... this gets the job done well. nice smooth shave no ingrown hairs no cuts just a smooth downstairs.</li>
    <li> came on the original blister, great razor.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if my particular razor was defective, or something, but it was horribly dull. I bought this because it was a bit cheaper than the mach 3s (which I&#x27;ve had a for a very long time; always satisfied with performance) and I regretted it immediately. Using a scaly fish would offer a better shave!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really good, and i really love it!</li>
    <li> Great shave but expensive for new cartridges.You be lucky to get them for $3 apiece.</li>
    <li> Works fine, expensive, but works fine</li>
    <li> Awesome. I love manual razor than automatic. Best grip and designed to avoid cuts.</li>
    <li> This razor is overrated. It does not give me a better shave than Gilette Mach 3 or those cheap Dorco 4x blades sold by DSC. I will most likely throw it away after using both cartridges that arrived with the handle.</li>
    <li> Check out the video  So I was convinced to try dollar shave club after seeing all those cool commercials and checking out the website .So this is my opinion comparing years of using the Gillette razors vs Dollar Shave Club mid range 4x razor    [...]</li>
    <li> The razor itself it great but this ad is wrong. The product comes with 2 blades total, not 2 refills (implying that these 2 are in addition to the one mounted to the head of the razor). Was disappointed by this and would have probably purchased a different one.</li>
    <li> Best razors you can buy. Clean shave every time and no razor bumps or anything of the sort.</li>
    <li> new and improved. I like the easier shaving and less cuts this razor gives me better than my older Gilette razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m converting to this one.</li>
    <li> Very nice shave.  The multiple blades is the key.  I&#x27;ve never had a closer or smoother shave with electric or other razor. I like the power feature in the older model but all this does is buzz a little.  I compared the two side by side and the older one definitely vibrates about twice the strength as this one.</li>
    <li> I have a pronounced jawline and I found that this razor fit my needs well as it hugged the contours of my face and gave me a nice smooth shave the first go around. Typically I have used electric shavers and have to go over my face 5 times to get all of the hair but with this razor I was able to speed that process up and I didn&#x27;t have to deal with a itchy face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette blades for a long time, and periodically I would accidentally slide the blade across my skin and slice myself around those tricky areas like my upper lip. I got the Gillette Flexball Handle to try for free and review. With the Flexball Handle technology, I don&#x27;t have this issue. The new blades catch every hair so I don&#x27;t show up for work with those tiny patches I used to miss sometimes. The blade contours to my face perfectly and gives me a perfect close shave. So much so, friends have started commenting on how soft and smooth my skin is. Thanks for the confidence boost Gillette!!! I would recommend this blade for Gillette newbies and dedicated Gillette users alike. You won&#x27;t regret!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty fine razor in my opinion. There&#x27;s a bit of heft to it, which allows for a confident, close shave. The flexball tecnology allows me to confidently traverse the countours of my face. Overall, a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, will it make me leave my power Proglide razor? No. Not for a minute. But it will definitely be my razor of choice at my summer home.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s an old Saturday Night Live commercial spoof about a razor that has so many blades (for a closer shave!) that it actually takes off layers of skin, and can even slice out the hair follicles, so that you never grow hair again. This is kind of like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is a neat shaving device (I hate to call it a &amp;#34;Razor&amp;#34;, since it has, like, 5 blades.), and it&#x27;s very comfortable to hold. The flexible head is good for going along with the contours of the face. There&#x27;s even an edging blade on the back for detail work. (This blade is REALLY sharp, and you can get some good cuts from it until you get used to it. I&#x27;m not used to having a blade on the back, so I kept grabbing it and cutting my fingertips.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The problem with this shave is that it&#x27;s got so many blades that it&#x27;s huge and hard to get used to. The multitude of blades make the head of the shaver gigantic and unwieldy, and the blades are so sharp that it caused serious skin irritation and breakouts. (Your mileage may vary, since I have really sensitive skin.)  I really like the look and feel of this shaver, but this is an expensive proposition-Between the unit and the blade refills, it&#x27;s a chunk of change. My sensitive skin usually fares better with twin blade disposable cheapies.</li>
    <li> The young man in the house reports that this razor feels solid in his hands and works well, especially around the angles of the chin.  The shave was close and non irritating and he has sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a guy but I do shave and like precision shaving as well. I have used the original Gillete Fusion razors and found them to work really well, this works great also.. a little better than the original. Really gave me a close tight shave even in the more curvy areas. Great razor!!</li>
    <li> This Flex ball is the best hand held shaver ever. He received the closet, smoothest and most comfortable shave in all his years of shaving.  This is such a great razor, Hubby made sure that I post a review on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No improvements needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a Gillette fan, and personally I think they&#x27;ve made a big step forward with the Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball.  The Fusion Proglide already offered what I felt was the best comfort of any manual razor on the market, but now with the Flexball technology I feel like any remaining comfort issues were completely nullified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared the Fusion Proglide with Flexball to my regular Fusion Proglide, and here is what I experienced:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I felt like I had a closer shave with the Flexball.  I felt like the blade was better controlled and required less guidance for hard to reach neck areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I felt more comfortable. The regular Fusion Proglide handle already delivered superior comfort to anything else on the market, but the Flexball handle has definitely improved on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I feel like the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball is a superior product to anything else out there.</li>
    <li> I have used Gillette razors for the last few years, and I received this one from Gillette and found this one is another great offering from the brand. I would recommend this razor. I prefer the powered version however i do like the Flexball technology.</li>
    <li> I love the Gillette Fusion brand. Always have, no matter what types of other razors I may use too. It&#x27;s my go-to razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Flexball Handle technology is not anything special or innovative. It doesn&#x27;t shave any better or contour to my face any more than the other Proglide razors. I don&#x27;t really notice a difference from the other Proglide Fusion lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still really like the Gillette Fusion Proglide line. I am just not that impressed with the Flexball Handle. If anything, Gillette should incorporate the Proglide Power cartridges (with the little combs that straighten out hair to make it better to shave) in every razor including this Flexball handle technology.</li>
    <li> I usually have a beard and need a quality razor to line it up.  I have used this razor with much success.  No cuts or razor bumps.  I will definitely use this in the future.</li>
    <li> Up until about a day ago I had a full beard for two years I decided to shave it off completely.  So I used a Gillette Fusion Proglide and let me tell you I&#x27;m so glad I chose this razor to remove my beard..what a great shave and it really does follow the contours of my face. This is definitely my new favorite razor.</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing and brings with it an improvement that was much-needed. I received this to try from Gillette and love it! The Flexball Handle Technology allows the razor to glide more smoothly along the contours of your face without you having to contort or pull your face in weird directions. This makes shaving much easier and quicker. I was a fan of the proglide, but will now be buying this because of the new technology. At least for me personally, it is worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have the razor for a week, it was a free product from Gillette. I like the handle of it. shaves close. the grip of the razor works well when wet. I think it is a great item. It has been a few weeks know, I am not sure if the razor is worth it the swivel sometimes moves more then I need it too. It works well but so does the Gillette fusion that does not swivel.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Not much change from the previous Gillette, but all in all, its a great razor. Smooth start &amp; finish, no issues going from my face to neck.</li>
    <li> I was sent by the manufacturer Gillette, a (Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle Technology)to try out. As far as the product is concerned for me, I would rather use a smaller shaver. It is not the quality I refer to but the overall bulk and size I am not comfortable with yet.  My father used the latter model and was extremely happy with it however I have a trimmed beard and am more comfortable using a smaller disposable razor. When it first arrived from Gillette I was afraid to use it because I thought I would not be able to maneuver around my beard and I thought it might cut my neck when I was shaving. In reality I got a very good shave and not one cut. Since it is just my first shave with it I will take more time and try to get accustomed to a larger shaver. The real proof will come over time since I have to replace the disposable shavers every 4 or 5 shaves. I will continue using the Gillette Fusion Proglide and update this review in a couple of weeks.    AS PROMISED MY FOLLOW UP.  After using the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle Technology that I received in the mail as a free trial from the manufacturer Gillette, I have to update my review.  This razor is incredible! I have used it now for over two weeks and have gotten use to the size. I have not had one cut and get the closest shave I have ever had in my 40 plus years of shaving. My other concern was the cost of replacement blades since I was using cheap disposable razors for as long as I can remember. Usually they last about 5 shaves before they get dull enough to cut and I have to replace them. This razor has made 14 shaves so far and is still going strong, Amazing!  I am going to continue using this incredible razor.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Gillette and I seen this razor in stores and was not sure if i was going to buy it or not,  when I received a free razor from Gillette I was so ecstatic. This razor is amazing. With the blades being so thin it gives a really smooth and close shave that other razor dont really give me unless i keep going over it. The flexball  allows the razor to contour to my face without any tug. I have never had such a great experience with a razor gliding and cutting the hairs so smoothly like the one I got with this razor. I would highly recommend this razor to any one.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette, not owning a Gillette before this i am very impressed! Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> When I recieved the new Gillette Fusion I was amazed at how the quality of the razor was, I&#x27;ve never seen a razor with so much class and comes in a regular package. Smooth yet firm and never misses a hair this razor is one of the best in it&#x27;s class.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those guys who used to buy the big bag of cheap 2-bladed plastic-handled disposable razors at Costco all the time. They&#x27;d each last a few days, then get gummed up or scratchy and I&#x27;d move on to the next one.  Not any more!  A few weeks ago I decided to follow the advise of someone I trust, who told me that you get what you pay for. Okay, the Gillette Fusion Proglide does cost considerably more per blade, but what the heck, maybe the quality is worth it. Might as well try it. Well, after several weeks I&#x27;m still using the first of the two blades that came in the package.  I keep waiting for it to get scratchy, but so far it still shaves smooth, easy, and very close. With the easy-to-wash-out open area I can easily rinse out between all five blades with a quick squirt from my faucet. I carefully blow on the blades after washing them, to remove any remaining water, and this simple and easy technique has kept the blades completely gunk and corrosion free. So far I love this razor!</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me a free sample of th proglide. Ever since I got it I have been a baby face like never before. This razor gets parts of my face I normally can&#x27;t get. Overall I think this is the best razor iced used this far and I would recommend it to whoever is looking to get a great shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for a few weeks now, and I have found it to be quite similar to the previous model in terms of closeness of shave, ability to maneuver around facial contours and general day to day shaving. The &#x27;Flexball Technology&#x27; didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference, as the shave was just as close and had the same feeling of the previous model. I will continue to purchase the Gillette Fusion blades as the shave quality is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model was provided to me by the manufacturer for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Gillette razor since I started shaving. This is the best Gillette razor yet. I love how it curves around my face. Thank you for a great product</li>
    <li> I love the way it works know matter  how I turn it.</li>
    <li> I intentionally left behind my normal razor when I went on vacation a while back and brought this new razor with the Flexball Handle Technology. I didn&#x27;t fully expect to be impressed, but I was happily surprised that the Flexball Tech did exactly what was advertised! It kept the blades around the contours of my face without giving me any nicks or cuts</li>
    <li> I recieved this razor from the company as part of a promotion. This was an adequate razor that shaved well and left  a smooth finish afterwards. The ball joint was cool to look at and made the razor look cool but I cannot say that I noticed a difference in the way that it shaved. I think the joint is more about appearance than function. It was a fine razor though, I have no complaints about it.</li>
    <li> This razor is a great idea in theory, but lacking in execution. The razor cartridge is, as always, top notch. The Gillette Fusion cartridges are second to none in their comfort, closeness of shave and durability. The razor handle itself, however, is far too heavy to be used comfortably. It is difficult to control as it&#x27;s very top heavy. While I like the Flexball Handle Technology, the materials used to manufacture this handle, while extremely durable, weigh much more than a razor should. When I&#x27;m shaving, I don&#x27;t want to feel like I&#x27;m working out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the concept is great, but if this product continues to be produced, I think Gillette should look at lighter-weight materials to be used in the production of the handle.</li>
    <li> I started using electric years ago. I don&#x27;t like the time it takes to get a good shave with a regular razor, and my skin gets irritated by the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the FIRST &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; razor I have ever liked. It moves nicely with the curves of my face and the multiple blades (who knew that Saturday Night Live would have it so right years ago) actually works to cut EVERYTHING in one pass... saving my face the irritation of standard razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually good enough that I would consider giving up my electric ... but I probably won&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> If you shave every day with a razor, then this is the perfect razor to have.  But personally, I like to shave less frequently, partially because I&#x27;m one of those people who couldn&#x27;t grow a beard if he tried--probably because I&#x27;m part Native American.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The previous version of this razor was too flexible, so it was like brushing your face with a soft brush. It wasn&#x27;t rigid enough to really be effective, but this one is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, bottom line, nothing beats the [[ASIN:B00EBA2LA2 Gillette Sensor Excel Razor with 2 Refill Blades]].</li>
    <li> What can you do to improve a razor??  Gillette has gone a step further with the next &amp;#34;proglide.&amp;#34;  Essentially, it is a very good product but the head swivels or adjust to contours of your face for a more consistent shave.</li>
    <li> Over there years i have watched all the gimmicks company&#x27;s have done to try and sell you there razor. When i received this razor from Gillette i really wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I mean it is just a razor right? Well i am man enough to admit i was wrong. I really like this razor mostly because of the flexball. I would have never though of what a difference it actually makes. I believe i get a better shave. My face feels nice and smooth and i don&#x27;t have any irritations like i did before. Maybe it is there improved blade design or the new improved handle? What ever the case i highly recommend this razor to any one that wants close comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I was provided a handle and two blades by Gillette; normally I used a three-blade Gillette (Mach3) instead.  My normal razor was decent, but in the military I required a close shave every day - and every couple weeks I would get a nick, probably when I was tired.  The new razor gives a very close shave with fewer strokes, keeps sharp, and no nicks for a month and a half.  I&#x27;m not sure what feature is the most helpful, but there seems to be more of the lubricating strip and the blades are individually thinner.</li>
    <li> Excellent item, timely shipment. Complete satisfaction!</li>
    <li> The best and clean shave I&#x27;ve gotten in a long time.  The ability for the razor blade to move and curve around the skin allows the razor to get closer and cut better.  No longer have a need to reshave over the same spot multiple times. One time does it. Highly recommended razor.  Can be used by women too to make their legs smooth like silk.</li>
    <li> this is best gillette razor every and affordable comes with one more blade which will last forever</li>
    <li> After the first razor was used I could not get another razor to stay on the handle! It Kept coming off! No matter what I did it would not work. It&#x27;s overpriced garbage. Going back to sensor if they still sell them.</li>
    <li> glides along my boyfriend&#x27;s skin well. excellent!</li>
    <li> works great, no complaints...</li>
    <li> The fusion Proglide gives a close clean shave with no irritation, even without shaving cream/gel. Only downside is the price. Much more expensive than a whole pack of disposable razors. I got to try this as part of a free trial campaign.</li>
    <li> I received this razor via a BzzAgent campaign.  Twice.  I&#x27;ve been using the razor since I got the first one.  It does a great job, gives a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the second one I was given to my father.  Up until now, he&#x27;d just been using cheap disposable razors.  He was surprised at how nice this razor was compared to what he&#x27;d been using, more or less, his whole life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like my father, do yourself a favor and get a decent razor.  You&#x27;ll be quite pleased with this one.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when i saw that they had changed up the Gillette fusion as i have always wanted a closer shave with a manual razor but have always been disappointed. I received my proglid from Gillette as a sample to test out and i couldn&#x27;t have been happier. Not only is the shave closure but the track ball design helps me eliminate nics and leaves my face feeling kiss ably smooth or so my wife says. I have since purchased the item and will continue to as long as they keep making this great razor.</li>
    <li> I recently received Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology from Gillette. So far, I have really enjoyed using this razor. The razor itself gave a quick and easy shave, without having to go over the same spots multiple times on my face. It was an extremely close shave, and I didn&#x27;t have any irritation afterwards that I have gotten in the past with multiple blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexball was nice for going from my chin down to my neck, but was not a life changing improvement over the standard razor where the head flexes up and down a little. Maybe it is because I have never had the ability to do so, but I still found myself simply shaving in a down and straight motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I love and have used Gillette&#x27;s multiple blade razors in the past, I would not have switched over simply for the Flexball addition. Everything about the razor is great, but would have been just fine without the swivel option.</li>
    <li> I have tried many a razor in my day. Electric ones with goo. Manual razors with what seems like a never-ending number of blades. Manual razors that buzz, electric razors that cool you down. The Fusion ProGlide with the Flexball may be the best one yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are certain websites and people who say you don&#x27;t really need to spend more than a dollar to get a good shave - and if works for them - bully for them. But for the rest of us who have round faces, the ProGlide with the Flexball may be the solution to the problem a lot of us face - getting around the curves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially skeptical when I first received this razor from Gillette. and was asked to review it. While the razor may have been free, the opinions are my own. I already use a Gillette Razor - the Proglide Power. I thought it did a great job on getting my stubble loose and then lopping it off. That is until I tried the ProGlide with the Flexball. It really does flex and maneuver around the contours of my face. It probably is the easiest shave I have yet to have. It is a smooth shave, a quick shave, and it works with and against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flex is not only right to left but up and down as well. So you feel like the whole razor is working on every swipe. I am not kind of regretting buying a big refill for my power razor. It may not get much use now that I have tried the Fusion ProGlide with Flexball.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver to buy to trim the edge to a beard.  It also shaves close enough that you can get that extra day between shavings. This is an incredible shave - I hesitate to say that because I do NOT want the price to go up. I was amazed at the shave I got and that just shows you how great this razor is. It is awesome at hugging my face and not tugging.  I received this shaver as a freebie and it is awesome.</li>
    <li> I have been a longtime user of Gillette blades, currently the Fusion ProGlide. So when I was given the opportunity (by the manufacturer to test drive one of their new Fusion ProGlide Razor&#x27;s with the FlexBall handle I jumped at the chance, but also took it seriously. I put the FlexBall up against the current ProGlide as well as the Dorco Pace 6+ in a multi-week face off and the results were a bit surprising. As far as closeness of shave, all three performed equally as well with daily shavings w/ shaving gel, none of them seemed any better than the other. However, where the FlexBall did shine was in the dry shaving and friction departments. The FlexBall definitely glided over my face with the least amount of pulling and friction and made for the most comfortable shaving experience, especially when shaving w/o shaving cream. That being said, I don&#x27;t feel like the experience was so overwhelming better that I would spend more money on these blades vs my existing ProGlide. If they were priced the same, I&#x27;d definitely go with the oddly shaped (made me think of my dyson vacuum) but very comfortable FlexBall. The only thing I really didn&#x27;t like about the FlexBall was the new half case that it comes with, which is much more difficult to quickly snap the razor into one-handed. I definitely recommend picking up a FlexBall to try for yourself, especially if you are someone who doesn&#x27;t use shaving gel when you shave</li>
    <li> I got it free from the manufacturer to review and it works as advertised.  Weight is excellent and the trackball helps it navigate contours and curves well.  Definitely converting from my old razor, assuming that the price of blades is reasonable.  Not much more to say than that except it provides a smooth shave.  Update: went to Costco to buy blades and they are about 50% more than my old blades.  Not sure the better shave is worth $3 per blade.</li>
    <li> I received this Fusion Proglide from Gillette and after using it for several weeks, have found it underwhelming. I don&#x27;t believe the flex ball adds anything to the shave. From own experiences, just about any razor with 5-blades gives me a great shave...it is the blades after all that do the shaving...and this blade is not better than the others I&#x27;ve tried. Its not a bad product but I&#x27;m certainly not sold on it.</li>
    <li> This razor is just ok.  The five blades are definitely a plus, and the flexibility of the razor position is great.  The single trim blade on the back of the head is both useful and precise.  Unfortunately the lubrication strip does not last long, and the blades begin to dull after only a few shaves, which began to irritate the skin.  In looking at the cost of the refills, it appears to be expensive to maintain at approximately $5.00 per replaceable head, or $20.00 for a pack of 4.  At that I will remain with the razor I have been using for several years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s basically the same as the rest of the fusion brand razors, the flex ball handle doesn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference in a smooth cleaner shave as far as shaving around the contour of the face.. It would be nice to see if  maybe they would add in an battery  powered one.</li>
    <li> I used the Gillette Fusion Proglide for the first time this week, and I thought it was great. Smooth shave, no nics or cuts, which has happens to me often when I get a new razor.  I would recommend that if you are tired of always getting cut or nics when shaving to try this razor.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor from Gillette to try out and see what I thought about it. I really liked how well the razor worked. It got areas that the razors I normally use don&#x27;t reach so well. The razors I&#x27;ve used in the past leave stubble in uneven areas under my chin, the Gillette Fusion Proglide left my face feeling smooth. I normally use alittle cheaper brand of razors, so I&#x27;m comparing this brand to those brands if that makes any difference. Overall I liked it a lot. Not sure how pricey it is though and if its worth the extra cost. It is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever had to be honest.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan. I usually use my 15+ year old Gillette Mach 3 and it does a better job. And cheaper too.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best razor I have used. I have gone through my fair share but nothing comes close to the Gillette Fusion Proglide. The closest and most comfortable shave. I recommend this razor to everyone! This should be a razor used by everyone. Not only is it a close shave for guys. Girls would benefit from how flexible the razor is. The razor hugs the curves of legs as well as the neck and face.</li>
    <li> Really great shave!!Best I&#x27;ve ever had really..smooth,easy to handle,really close comfortable shave.Go in your bathroom now and throw out your old razors because if your not using this your face probably feels like a hot road on the way to Las Vegas!!</li>
    <li> I gave this Razor 5 stars because I truly believe it is the best razor on the market. It gives me a closer shave on my neck with less irritation than any other razor I have owned. However, I think a power version of this razor would be nice as well. I&#x27;m used to the power versions and I&#x27;m convinces they also help! While no razor is perfect, this is the best made yet!</li>
    <li> Solid Razor, comfortable to hold, clean shave!</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband. He really likes it. He said it gives a good, close shave.</li>
    <li> The Fusion ProGlide has given me the best shave I&#x27;ve experience.  I have tried different models, but this one gives me a cleaner shave in less time.  Gone are the days where I would have to shave two or three times in order to have a complete, clean shave.  With the Fusion ProGlide my shave looks better and my skin feels better.</li>
    <li> I got a Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology from Gillette as a promotion.  I really loved how close of a shave I got from using it.  The way the head swiveled was amazing.  I have not gotten any cuts or burns while using the ProGlide.</li>
    <li> Great Razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no mountain man. It takes me a few days to grow noticeable facial hair, and even then it&#x27;s a little splotchy. But, this is the smoothest razor I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I buy mid-level disposal razors - not the basic, blue Bics (1-2 blades, simple white strip) - but also not the fanciest kind. This very much impressed me.&lt;br /&gt;The Flex Ball makes the razor contour around your neck and chin very easily (far easier then the standard Gillette Fusion). This is definitely the easiest spot to nick yourself, and that is nigh impossible with this razor. The number of blades and the soft palette make it so you only need to run over your face once as well.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes when I&#x27;m in a hurry, I just splash a little soap and water on my face and this razor still takes care of it the first time through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a quality standpoint, this razor is top-notch. Feels very solid. And at only $15, it really isn&#x27;t that absurdly priced either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this Razor from Gillette as a promotion rather than purchasing it at the store. But going forward I will be purchasing replacement blades and continue to use this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT BUY!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have a hard time shaving above my upper lip. The skin is very tender. The Proglide works pretty well for this, but for general shaving I would much rather use a Gillette Guard razor (a single edge cartridge razor made in India). In fact I haven&#x27;t bothered using the Fusion Proglide since the 1st week I&#x27;ve had it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor&#x27;s okay, but there are better choices.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide really does give me a close shave.  I wanted to use the razor for at least 1 month before giving the review and I like it much better than my previous Mach3 blade.  The shave is much closer to the skin without causing irritation.  I was a little worried that it might irritate my skin, but it was really nice. It felt clean and the blade has lasted me the whole month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels really nice and was a vast improvement over my out dated Mach 3 shaver.</li>
    <li> i tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide Men&#x27;s Razor  with Flexball Handle Technology and to my surprise found it gave me a very close shave without any skin irritation. I have a tender neck and many times break out after shaving.. but not this time not the next few shaves i had using this new razor.  I did think the retail price is a bit too high. also are the older fusion blades usable in this new razor??  I also prefer the full holder rather than this shortened holder. The full holder is especially better when the razor needs to be packed in a suitcase for a trip.  all in all i do like this razor very much.. i might also add that i previously used a power fusion razor and still do prefer the power version,, though this razor is excellent for my face and skin.</li>
    <li> good one but I like Mach 3 only</li>
    <li> I give up. I keep trying these four- and five-blade razors because they&#x27;re everywhere and easy to find, but every time I remember why I keep my old Excel two-blade around despite the decades of caked on shaving cream residue. Every additional blade just makes the things harder to get and keep clean (which of course makes the blades last much less time) and at this point seems to actually make the shave LESS close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this specific razor, I like the idea of the flexball, but in practice it doesn&#x27;t actually do any good -- maybe if I were just learning to shave I&#x27;d make use of it, but after (again) decades of using razors that don&#x27;t have the flexball, I instinctively turn the razor to keep the blade straight at all times, so I don&#x27;t think I made use of the flexball once.</li>
    <li> Dropped it in the shower and it broke. Called Proctor and Gamble for an exchange. Never received or heard anything back. Called again and was told they were investigating. Called again and was told that I return too many items. This really disappointed me as I do not usually return items and new had with P &amp; G. They made me feel like a criminal who is scamming them. Too bad, they make their money on the blades, not the razor. I&#x27;ll stick with my Shick razor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine I guess.  Is it better than the previous version that lacks the &amp;#34;Proglide&amp;#34; contraption?  Who knows?  I read that Gilette has 80% profit margins on razors.  I am sure they make every bit of that on this expensive puppy.  You&#x27;ll get a good shave and it certainly is no worse than a previous Fusion.  I just can&#x27;t decide if it&#x27;s better.</li>
    <li> Compared to my powered gillette, it really does not offer much more in it&#x27;s swivel feature that for me I still prefer my old version&lt;br /&gt;however as it uses the same blades it makes a good back-up</li>
    <li> There are five blades on the usual side and one blade for trimming on the other. The problem is that the trimming blade keeps cutting into my nose causing bleeding. I really dislike that feature and won&#x27;t be using Fusion blades in the future.</li>
    <li> This system is the best yet in my opinion.  You swipe once and get a close comfortable shave without having to tighten your skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent choice, really good product</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to upgrade from the non-flex version as it looked like I would be losing control of the razor. After trying one I realized that there was no loss of control and a significant improvement in the shave. I liked it well enough to buy a second one for my travel kit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s different in a very good way. I hate to shave, but this razor makes it much easier. Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> These razors are amazing.  I shave my head bald with them and I never get cut.  I use each blade for probably 2 months, so the seemingly high price really is not.</li>
    <li> So I have never had a straight razor shave but I imagine this is the closest I&#x27;ll ever get to one. The 5 blades of this razor allow for a quick and close shave. The multi-directional flexibility allowed me to easily shave the edges of my chin and down my neck. I was very pessimistic about this razor until I actually tried it. Huge fan of the Gillette Fusion line, particularly the flexball razor now. This razor will definitely become a part of my regular shaving routine. Pair it with their new 2-in-1 shave gel, and your skin feels great afterwards. Side note about the gel, it has a wonderful cooling sensation that keeps your skin feeling great during AND after your shave.</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying I am not an everyday shaver. I tend to shave once or twice a week. So after recieving my free sample Gillette Fusion Pro-glide razor with the flexball, I had relatively long stubble to be removed. My first shave with the razor was incrediblely painful! It felt like I was pulling out each hair individually. It was so uncomfortable I stopped using it halfway through the shave and went back to my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly thought I&#x27;d never use it again. But after talking to some friends who use it and like it, I gave it another shot. My second shave went much better. When finished it did leave my face feeling quite smooth. I would use this razor if I shaved more frequently because it is good for very short facial hair. However, if you have more than 3 days growth you might be in for a painful experience.</li>
    <li> Honestly am not thrilled about the razor, but it may just be me. I shave my entire head and face with it. i think i am just not a fan of razor&#x27;s with more than 3 blades, as they pack them in too close in my opinion. this gives for a razor that keeps getting stuck for me and yanking hairs. I have gone back to my 3 blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;looks great though if you want to hang it on a wall!!!</li>
    <li> This is a remarkable razor, much better than I expected.  I bought it on sale at Costco last summer (with six cartridges).  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but the sale price was low enough that it was worth taking a chance.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  My main concern was the cost of the cartridges, but what I&#x27;ve found is that if you&#x27;re willing to put some effort into it, they can last three months or more.  The key is keeping the cartridge clean and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to know how long they lasted, so I&#x27;ve kept a record of how long I&#x27;ve used each one.  n the eleven months I&#x27;ve used, it, I&#x27;ve used up the initial cartridge and four others, and I recently started the sixth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first cartridge lasted four weeks.  I cleaned it by placing it under briskly running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second cartridge lasted five weeks.  I tested claims that razor blade life can be dramatically extended by storing it in a sealed bag with desiccated gel.  It added about a week to the life of my cartridge. However unless you live in the desert, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the extra effort.  I live in a relatively warm and dry location in the San Francisco Bay Area and had to dry the gel in my microwave several times during the five weeks.  If you want to try it, the gel I used was &amp;#34;FotoTech 2 Pack Moisture-absorbing Silica Gel Desiccant with FotoTech Velvet Bag (2 Pack)&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 3rd, 4th, and 5th cartridges lasted 80 days, 101 days, and 78 days.  Instead of using the desiccated gel, I cleaned the cartridge carefully with a toothbrush after each use and blew the cartridge dry afterwards.  Most of the time I just blew on it, but once in a while I used a can of compressed air without the long nozzle tube.  This combination worked remarkably well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of my life, I&#x27;ve switched between manual and electric razors several times.  I like the convenience of electric, but have never cared for how they shave.  I was using an old Gillette Sensor before buying the Fusion Proglide and only switched because the quality of Sensor cartridges I was buying declined sharply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now on my sixth Fusion Proglide cartridge, but because of the California drought and water use cutbacks, I&#x27;ve reluctantly switched to an electric Norelco razor temporarily.  When water use restrictions end, I expect I&#x27;ll return to the Fusion Proglide.n Proglide and only switched because the quality of Sensor cartridges I was buying declined sharply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now on my sixth Fusion Proglide cartridge, but because of the California drought and water use cutbacks, I&#x27;ve reluctantly switched to an electric Norelco razor temporarily.  When water use restrictions end, I expect I&#x27;ll return to the Fusion Proglide.</li>
    <li> All of these new technologies in razors make my head spin. 5 blades versus three, lubricant heads and bases and now a pivoting head. But I have to write that it actually works, and well. My old twin blades would give me a cut no matter how carefully I prepped, This one is grab- gives a close shave and rides the curves of my admittedly angular face like a sports car, giving me a great shave very time.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Gillette razors, ever since they sent me a free one for my 18th birthday, almost 18 years ago. I have had almost every version of starting with the Gillette Sensor Excel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I was selected to review the Gillette Fusion ProGlide with NEW FlexBall Handle Technology I was using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power, which I loved. The Power pulsing handle made shaving more comfortable than I have experienced with a non-powered razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like the most about the Gillette Fusion ProGlide with NEW FlexBall Handle Technology is how it feels in my hand. The handle is a solid metal handle, it feels great holding it compared to the ProGlide Power&#x27;s plastic bulky handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I prefer the Power over the new FlexBall Handle because I feel like I get a more comfortable shave. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, The Flexball still gives a great, comfortable shave, but the vibrating handle makes it feel like it&#x27;s gliding just a little bit better if you don&#x27;t mind the bulky handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Gillette can figure out to keep the same handle on the Gillette Fusion ProGlide with NEW FlexBall Handle Technology, but give it power, it would be the ultimate razor.</li>
    <li> A GOOD RAZOR GETS A LITTLE BIT BETTER&lt;br /&gt; June 16, 2014 by ajb71185&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the standard version of the Fusion for a few years and have been very happy with it. So when I received this razor from Gillette about a month ago, I was excited see how they could improve this proven design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a little background I typically shave once or twice a week. Usually when my whiskers are on the line between 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and my face looking like a mangy dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my first use of this product I was closer to the mangy dog side of things. Initially, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference between the Flexball razor and the standard (original) version. After my third and fourth shaves with this product, I could start to notice the handle move a little which seemed nice.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. He perfers this over the fancy electric razor.</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette razors &amp; blades for over a half century and the only improvement that I can honestly say made a difference to me was the invention of the dual blade pivoting refill which allowed me to shave more quickly with less care and preparation effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truthfully, if you are careful, you can actually achieve a better and closer shave than ANY of these new razors with the really old single blade razors but you must properly prepare your beard before shaving and you must take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this new razor to do an excellent job but no better than any of its numerous predecessors. Even my older Gillette&#x27;s that only have two blades still do a wonderful job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, these Razor companies should seriously get a grip on the seemingly endless barrage of gimmicks they use to get men (and women) to buy their product. There have been so many ridiculous changes such as vibrating handles, more &amp; more blades crammed onto each refill, different handle contours, skin sensitive lotion strips to lubricate the skin, different colors and now we have Flexball Handle technology. Furthermore, this razor also boasts a separate blade for &amp;#34;edging&amp;#34;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Folks - its all about money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a rest Gillette.</li>
    <li> I like the new Fusion Proglide with Flexball handle. I get a good shave with less irritation. The flexball allows the razor to easily glide across the curves of my face without resistance. The only thing I would consider changing is the size of the handle. I would like it to be thicker so I can grip it better.</li>
    <li> I have long used disposable, two-blade razors, so using this one represented a change. I was frankly amazed by how close the shave was and the fact that I only had to shave once. Normally, with the two-blade razors, I have to go over the area under my chin and along my neck twice, and I never get the truly smooth feel. With this, one time worked incredibly well and I could really appreciate the difference. I have only two slight qualms. The width of the thing with the four blades (the razor&#x27;s head?) is significant, so getting right under my nose was not easy. But I still had the two-blade razors to take care of that problem. The other is that I don&#x27;t know how long these blades will cut as closely and smoothly (and painlessly) as they have so far. So I can&#x27;t really comment about the economics yet. But for a close shave, the Gillette Fusion worked extraordinarily well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every shaving device except a straight razor.  I have a cabinet full.  With this razor I get 6 weeks per blade.  I must qualify this by stating that I don&#x27;t shave every day.  4 times a week at most.  But...I get a great shave with a new blade and a decent one as the blade dulls down.  In any case, I bought 12 blades from the little &amp;#34;e&amp;#34; company for about $24 or so.  That&#x27;s a year and a half worth of shaves.  Or, about $1.33 a blade.</li>
    <li> Provides a very close, smooth shave - particularly when used with the Gilette Proglide shaving gel.  I received both the razor and gel from Gillette via BzzAgent, and have found both to be excellent.  I&#x27;ve never had a smoother shave, but the replacement cartridges are quite expensive and may not last much longer than those I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Still, if you&#x27;re looking for that closer, smooth shave. . look no further.</li>
    <li> Best razor on the market!</li>
    <li> I was sent a free Gillette Razor to test from BuzzAgent and the first thing I notice is its solid feel and ease of holding in my hand. Next, the head of the razor pivots from side to side and back and forth. This razor has some heft to it. How does it shave? Great!!! With no pressing or pulling, this razor gives a close, fast shave. It has a blue, lubricating strip on top and five blades. Unfortunately, the razor is a bit too large to reach completely under the nose, but it comes very close. Each personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s face is uniquely shaped and each of us will have a different experience with this razor. I happen to love this razor.</li>
    <li> Not good ss there send mr the manual one not thr the power one</li>
    <li> Great blade. No cuts. Pricey!</li>
    <li> Great product. The swivel design is slick and makes shaving easier as there is more control. Although I suspect the blades are what makes this razor stand out from competition, the weight of the handle makes shaving feel more luxurious.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the utility of the flexball, but its performance has won me over. The subtle shift of the head helps the razor to hug my face when transitioning from the check to under the chin in the same stroke. The five blades do an excellent job of shaving with fewer passes and have remained sharp over the past week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the flexball adds to the blade&#x27;s effectiveness, similar to an electric razor head. Fusion blades are famously good for removing body hair, and this one works even better. With a fresh blade, shaving lotion wasn&#x27;t even needed and the shave was very close.</li>
    <li> Received the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall free from Gillette some weeks back o try it out.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is by far amazing. it gave me clean shave. My face is smooth but over my jawline with regular razor i have to shave 2 ot 3 times, but this razor adapts to the face contour giving smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall awesome razor.</li>
    <li> I have been using an electric razor for most of my adult life. It&#x27;s been easy and quick, but not always the best and closest shave. Gillette sent me a Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology razor to try so I gave it a shot. I noticed how close the smooth was. I was very cautious at first, but quickly realized that it was very comfortable and easy to get a nice shave. I also shave my head with an electric trimmer, but I decided since I had success on my face I&#x27;d try it out on my head. Again, it was incredibly close and comfortable. Close than I could ever get with the trimmer. This razor has come a long way from the non-flexing ones I first learned how to shave with. If I had learned with something like this, I would have never started using an electric razor! The razor has a nice balanced weight to it and feels very substantial. More than what I expected from a &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; type razor. :)</li>
    <li> I am really in love with this razor.  It does not pull at the hairs on my face, and really truly allows me to reach the closest, smoothest, and maximum shaving experience.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Yes, a very nice shave and easy to maneuver the blade. It&#x27;s like a Dyson for your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall is the only razor I have used for the past month. I have electric razors, regular razors and yes, this one is NICE. It is a unusually comfortable shave. The blade itself seems like all of the previous Fusions but it&#x27;s how the ball allows the razor to curve to your face that makes this a very easy to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this ProGlide Razor with FlexBall to anyone that needs a razor or is about to go get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My blade has not dulled yet so hopefully it will hold it&#x27;s edge a while longer. Nicely done Gillette.</li>
    <li> A Great shave with an easy to maneuver blade, I will go back to a razor over electric shavers again. It&#x27;s like a Dyson for your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this razor in the mail and have been using the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall for the past month. I have electric razors, regular razors, but this one trumps them all. It is an unusually comfortable shave. The blade itself seems like all of the previous Fusions but it&#x27;s how the ball allows the razor to curve to your face that makes this a very easy to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this ProGlide Razor with FlexBall to anyone that needs a razor or is about to go get a new one.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette for free, in order to try it out. I was very impressed by all aspects of the razor. It gives you a very close shave and doesn&#x27;t irritate your face at all. The razor was easy to use and is very durable. The handle is solid and not flimsy at all. It feels very comfortable in your hand. I definitely recommend this razor to anyone who wants a close shave, without having to deal with irritation.</li>
    <li> It is an easy gliding razor.  The blade it came with seems to last longer than the orange fusion blades.  I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I have been a longtime user of Gillette blades, currently the Fusion ProGlide. So when I was given the opportunity (by the manufacturer to test drive one of their new Fusion ProGlide Razor&#x27;s with the FlexBall handle I jumped at the chance, but also took it seriously. I put the FlexBall up against the current ProGlide as well as the Dorco Pace 6+ in a multi-week face off and the results were a bit surprising. As far as closeness of shave, all three performed equally as well with daily shavings w/ shaving gel, none of them seemed any better than the other. However, where the FlexBall did shine was in the dry shaving and friction departments. The FlexBall definitely glided over my face with the least amount of pulling and friction and made for the most comfortable shaving experience.</li>
    <li> i love it , i have always shaved with gillette but this razor makes it a even more closer,better, and faster shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll stick with the original razors.</li>
    <li> I use Gillette fusion blades only. When they came out with the new tech on this razor I didn&#x27;t know if I wanted to try it. But I did and do not regret it! Nice smooth shave and my regular fusion blades fit it as well. Good product! Keep up the good work Gillette!</li>
    <li> I received this from Gillette to try out and I found it to be a very good razor.  I have been using it for 5 days now and it works exactly like a razor should.  I am one that often has problems with razor bumps and razor burn, but so far this razor has caused neither.  My facial hair grows very fast and if I skip a day of shaving razors will normally pull my hair more than cut it.  However, this razor does not feel like it pulls at all.  The flex head on this razor is also very nice.  My hair grows in so many different directions it is hard to go in the direction the hair grows, but this new razor does a fantastic job of moving around my face so don&#x27;t cut myself when changing directions.  Overall, I love this razor and will definitely be replacing my old one with this one.</li>
    <li> I have to say this is a nice combo, the flexball seems to actually make a difference, what I noticed the most what the curvature of face seems to flow well with this razor, less strokes and less pull, I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great razor!  This is by far the best razor I have used by Gillette.  I have used many different razors and this is the best one!  Smooth and a close cut without the irritation.</li>
    <li> I would have to say that I have never got such a close shave with such ease as I did with the Gillette Fusion Proglide with the flexball. The way it moved because of the flexball is uncomparable to any razor that I have ever used</li>
    <li> Received this product from Gillette to try it out. I really liked the handle and the quality was great as with all their products. One thing i noticed waas that the flexball was just covered by a rubber ball and could easily come off. It also doesnt move a lot like in the commercials. Either way i had a great shave. Worth for trying it out.</li>
    <li> Nice price even if you are just considering the two cartridges. Was a coupon included on the purchase and that made it very reasonable. Easy to open package. No scissors needed.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with the Flexball handle is absolutely amazing!  I&#x27;ve used many different main brand razors over the years and this is by far the best.  My job requires me to shave on a daily basis... With that said, it is imperative for me to have the best, and that is exactly what this razor is.  The flexball handle helps the razor get all areas of your face when you shave.  I don&#x27;t have to shave over areas several times around my chin, under my mouth, and under my nose.  The razor actually bends and flexes to conform to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this razor to anyone that needs a clean shave in a timely fashion!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide free from Gillette.  This razor gives you a close, smooth shave that is effortless, this is the next best thing to a safety razor.  I love the flexball technology and also that this razor seems to keep irritation on my face to a minimum.</li>
    <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor. I&#x27;ve used quite a few different types of razors in my time but this one was probably the easiest to use. It&#x27;s got a satisfying weight to it as well, it&#x27;s more ergonomic than Gillette&#x27;s previous razors and at the very least, shaves a few seconds off my routine each morning (see what I did there). I haven&#x27;t been using the razor long enough to comment on the longevity of the razor blades but I haven&#x27;t seen anything in the first two weeks that would suggest it&#x27;s any shorter than Gillette&#x27;s other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: This product was provided to me by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write too many reviews but when I come across a good product, I feel like I need to talk about it. I normally buy disposable razors because I shave every other day and I go through razors pretty fast but when this came out I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  The razor has a nice weight to it so it feels good in the hand when you are shaving. The main plus to this razor is the moving head which really helps when I shave my head. The blades are really sharp and they cut very close. This thing ain&#x27;t cheap but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> Smooth...It is very comfortable to use and gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> Finally, a Gillette razor that really is the best a man can get!</li>
    <li> I am a woman and I love it. So smooth to shave with no more nicks.</li>
    <li> I like this razor glides very well. would be better if they had a version for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to womens razors. Mens razors do a much better job and I don&#x27;t end up with nicks on my legs everytime.</li>
    <li> The best thing was the 5$ coupon for refills</li>
    <li> As good as it gets this razor is awesome.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave, good price.</li>
    <li> This razor and shaving cream combo delivered the closest shave I have ever had with a manual razor.  However, the refills for the razor are quite expensive.  Thanks to Gillette, I tried this razor and shaving cream for free!</li>
    <li> Shaving beard shaved effect is very good, very clean, very smooth.</li>
    <li> I was a long time electric razor user but had a chance to use this razor and blades for a promotional campaign and ,I must say I am very pleasantly surprised! The shave is not only closer but much, much faster. A great clean shave in just minutes really helps set the day off well, I also got over a month of shaves which offsets the somewhat high cost of replacement blades. The electric has been relegated to the drawer!</li>
    <li> awesome have scar on face and it was smooth for it did not cut scar at all best ive hasd</li>
    <li> Good quality. Could cut better, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain. Definitely worth a buy.</li>
    <li> Great new design, does what it is supposed to - twists and turns well - no neck-area nicks - I love it...  Wish the blades weren&#x27;t so expensive, other than that - awesome modification to an already great product!</li>
    <li> cheap and feel very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I received a Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology from Gillette to try for free. I love how close of a shave I got. The way the head swiveled I feel really made a big difference int how close the shave was. My wife is pleased as well</li>
    <li> When I got this razor as a sample from Gillette, I was super excited. Fancy new razor technology? Heck yes! Time to throw out all of those old, un-scientific razors and shave my way into the future, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the downside of this razor is that the whole thing is a little bit of a marketing gimmick. The actual processing of shaving isn&#x27;t that different, and the shave itself isn&#x27;t magically smoother than a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upside is that this is a Gillette product and as such, it totally is a solid piece of facial hair removing equipment. You&#x27;ll still get a nice, close shave, even though it isn&#x27;t one that is any better or worse than another other Gillette product. If you&#x27;re looking to buy a new razor, or want to upgrade from using disposables this would be a great choice, but you shouldn&#x27;t go out of your way to purchase this.</li>
    <li> I am loyal to the Gillette Sensor, but after receiving the Gillette Fusion with flexball technology directly from Gillette to try out, I am converted!  I especially like the ability to conduct longer strokes vs. the Gillette Sensor standard 2 blade razor.  Great innovation!</li>
    <li> I received the razor from Gillette to try it out. The biggest difference I see with this razor, is that since I began using this razor, I haven&#x27;t nicked my self. I like the pivot function of the design, and I feel I get a close shave. However my main complaint with this razor is that it gets clogged rather fast, the blades are pretty close together, so it doesn&#x27;t take much, for hair to get caught in between the blades. Another thing is that changing the blades can be a bit tricky at first it&#x27;s not very straight forward.</li>
    <li> I usually go with razors from Harrys because they fit into my budget more efficiently. However, after getting a free razor for the manufacturer I may have to rethink my decision. It does provide a closer shave because the razor blade itself is on a swivel that moves with the curve of your neck and body more than my Harrys razor does currently. I have already reccomended this razor to my friends to try and I hope they have the same reaction that I did &amp;#34;Wow my face is smoother now than in a long tme&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I recently received this razor free from Gillette to review. This razor takes the concept of the five blade razor to a whole new level. Powered by a AAA battery the razor vibrates giving a much closer and deeper shave than conventional razors. I would highly recommend this product to everyone who wants a superior shave.</li>
    <li> My husband was fortunate to receive this razor from Gillette to try.  It gave him a fantastic shave (but he admitted it was not much different than his &#x27;regular&#x27; Proglide--and he likes them all).  I wanted to make sure to give a shout out to this product since I tried it on myself!  I have had problems with getting a &#x27;perfect&#x27; shave on my incredibly bumpy knees and underarms--no matter how I try to carefully shave, I seem to not be able to get a very smooth surface and am beyond frustrated when I have taken the time to shave carefully and find a few stray stubbles on my knees...usually when I&#x27;m on my way out to dinner and can&#x27;t turn back!  This razor did the trick--the flex ball handle seemed to allow for the razor to navigate the bumpy areas in ways other razors have failed.  This is a great product!</li>
    <li> We received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care Bzzkit and I switched to it as my daily razor. I was very pleased with the smoothness and the sharpness of the blades, as well as the ergonomic handle. Since I switch from a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor with FlexBall, the form factor was very similar and familiar. I found I got results that were on par with the powered razor, and the heads interchanged. Overall, I am pleased with the close shave, the heft of the razor, and the performance overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a product provided to me for free but I really enjoyed it and found it to work well.</li>
    <li> This takes some getting used to but does give a good smooth shave after learning how to manipulate it.  It could be made easier to use</li>
    <li> cheap and good quality</li>
    <li> I is much better than the old mode</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought every advance Gillette come out with in shaving technology and each improves upon the last. The difference between the new Flexball and the previous model is subtle, but it does get those difficult shaving areas easier. The only problem I can see is the moving part is more likely to break if dropped enough. Other than that it&#x27;s another advancement.</li>
    <li> Great blades but geez...why do they have to be so dang expensive. Greedy much gillette?</li>
    <li> The blade feels like steel and shaves better</li>
    <li> Replacement blade cost will be a problem down the road, but after shaving with this razor a couple times, I am very satisfied with its performance and my resulting close shave.</li>
    <li> Just not a total fan. Not like the commercials.Much rougher than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Shaves really well and close</li>
    <li> Great Price, quick delivery, exactly as described. Buy with confidence</li>
    <li> Does the job on using the razor. A little bit expensive blades.</li>
    <li> Love this razor. This is such a great deal! Also got here super fast.</li>
    <li> Good Price for a Good Product at a nice convenient way to purchase</li>
    <li> As advertised, quick shipment, great product. Recommended seller.</li>
    <li> There are not many things that separate a good razor from a great razor. This razor gets separated because it is easy for the wife/girlfriend to use when she shaves her man. A man that shaves, can shave with anything. It really comes down to how easy it is for your partner to shave you with your razor. The ball AND pivoting head really makes that easy, and NO CUTS!! The up or down direction thing is a thing of the past. Not to mention, is has really good blades. It lasts about a month (I&#x27;m pretty hairy) before the blades really start to tug on my face. If you&#x27;re married, get two though, the wife will use this to shave her legs. Yeah, it&#x27;s that good. She will ditch her pretty little Chic, and grab yours every time.</li>
    <li> new and nice stocking stuffer</li>
    <li> Forget Dollar Shave club or buying new blades at the pharmacy. This is a much better deal and you get a whole new razor with two blades for the cost of half a pack of replacement blades. I like this method better because if they come out with a better razor next year I am not obligated to use it for a year or six months waiting to use up all the replacement blades I purchased. In terms of the shave quality this is the nicest I have felt. i had the Mach 2 for 4 years then got a free Proglide non ball razor from Gillette. The shave was better but by far this is the smoothest shave yet. I hear people talk about a safety razor or straight blade but &amp;#34;ain&#x27;t nobody got time for all that.&amp;#34; The shave is adequate and lasts about two and a half days, Cuts are very rare and the precision blade on the back of the razor blade is great for lining up side burns and under the nose shaving.</li>
    <li> Makes no difference than the previous fixed head</li>
    <li> This product is not one that I would recommend nor would I purchase it again.  I used it one time on my face and I ended up throwing the remaining cartridge along with the rest of the thin g in the trash.  It caused me to have razor burn and discomfort, not for me.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to have been able to try this razor as part of a promotion from the brand and I am hooked. This razor gave me a clean shave and the ball was great for those areas like the chin and neck. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a close clean shave.</li>
    <li> The Fusion Proglide has been a complete surprise at how smooth the shave is.  I have used Gillette products in the past and this razor has proved to be the best one that I have used.</li>
    <li> overall I would say this razor is a step up from the normal proglide that doesn&#x27;t move.  It makes shaving easier and I don&#x27;t feel like I am pulling as much.  I did receive the razor free from Gillette through a BzzFeed promotion to try and provide reviews on.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a free sample and I have been very pleased with the close shave I get with using the razor!  With the swivel head it is easy to shave my face and I like that one blade seems to last a few weeks.  It doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs, but glides smoothly across my face and gives me a close shave without any irritation.</li>
    <li> Very,very Nice!Great Item&#x3D;Great Seller+Fast Shipping+Great Communication.Thank U</li>
    <li> I got to try the ProGlide Razor as a part of the Bzzagent trial and have to say that it did give a very smooth shave. I think the pivot is what allowed it to move so smoothly on the face because I&#x27;ve tried other multi-blade products and maneuvering the razor was more of an effort. I&#x27;ll keep using this razor and comparing it to my older Gillette razor to see if I continue to have the same result. At first try, it was easier to shave this morning and to get around the tricky angles of the face. I recommend this!</li>
    <li> Good razor, for your face and even for man-scaping. Definitely worth the money. Smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had for a while and definitely beats disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Great razor fits Avery part of my face.</li>
