<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is a very amazing product when I run out I will probably use it again</li>
    <li> Great value for the money</li>
    <li> My teeth are whiter already and I have only used it a few times.</li>
    <li> Burned my gums... Didn&#x27;t complete the pack but I saw results after the first try</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on day 4 and they seem to work. I used Crest whitestrips like 4 years ago and wanted to try something different. I had good whitening from the strips. I&#x27;m not sensitive to the gel so I can wear them for the 15 minutes. I have to reshape the trays tho. I am just curious to know if the blue gel is needed. It says that you &amp;#34;can&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t say that it is required. I will edit this later for a better review after results.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! Okay I had a wedding to attend and I could not get an appointment with my dentist before the wedding date, I got the invite a week before the wedding! So one of my friends suggested brilliant hd pro and she was kind enough to let me have an extra pack she had for me to try because she had recently purchased a two for one deal and was looking for someone to give the extra one to anyway. So I did the treatment the day before the wedding I followed the instructions and it was very easy to do, the tray fit perfectly into my mouth and it was not uncomfortable or painful. I got so many compliments on my teeth the next day at the wedding. My teeth were even whiter than the brides teeth! I was extremely pleased to see my perfect smile in pictures when I saw some of the pictures from the wedding. I noticed that every picture I was in, my smile was the best in the picture. Brilliant hd pro is also great for taking awesome selfies! I definitely recommend brilliant hd pro 2 everyone who wants a perfect smile. It works fast too, I was finished applying the treatment in 15 minutes. Also, I used brilliant hd pro over a month ago and my teeth are still white to this day.</li>
    <li> Most impressive thing about Brilliant HD pro was how it felt during the use. The trays are flexible and sit comfortably around the teeth without digging into your gums that can get annoying at times.&lt;br /&gt;This is a really good kit. Its so easy to use&lt;br /&gt; I recommend it over using whitening strips.</li>
    <li> As a person whose job requires presenting a processional face to the public, I was very impress about how white the Brillant HD Pro Teeth Whitening kit worked. Not only did it improve the slightly darken shade of my teeth but the product did so without making my teeth more sensitive to cold as it has been with other products.    Leaving in the trays for a short time period is easy and convenient. The product works beyond expectations and in my opinion is one of the top teeth whitening kits on the market.</li>
    <li> As a child growing up I often refused to brush my teeth and now as an adult I have come to regret such decisions, burdened with the look of yellow, unattractive teeth I set out to do something about it. I stumbled upon this problem, it promised results that I could only imagine in my wildest dreams, but after trying this product, my dreams came true and my teeth have never been whiter than they are now, I don&#x27;t know how to praise this product enough due to how much it has changed my life, I am forever in debt to this product and would recommend it to everyone without a glimmer of doubt!</li>
    <li> Awful. I have been bleaching my teeth for years. I ordered this kit and was excited to use it. I followed the instructions perfectly and within one minute, my gums were on FIRE. The product burned my gums to the point where they were peeling the next day. It hurt pretty bad. I used less gel the next night and tried to bear the pain - but still - it&#x27;s too powerful and painful. So I got back on amazon and started reading the reviews again - specifically the ones with only 1 star - and realized that a lot of people were pointing out the dates on the really amazing, glowing reviews for this product. Indeed, all of the reviews were left within just 2 or 3 days on each other. I agree that the reviews have been created by someone working for this company and they are bogus. Do NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried one of the other brands from the pharmacy but not happy with the results.  I decided to try this one and so glad I did.  Coffee stains have really been bugging me lately and after using this system....my teeth are so much better.  It&#x27;s amazing how just whitening your teeth makes such a difference.  Trays are the best!</li>
    <li> Amazing after one application my teeth are whiter.  This product is easy to apply.  I would recommend it to anyone with stained teeth!  I am sold.  I will continue to use this awesome product!</li>
    <li> Perfect teeth whitening kit. I saw this product on Amazon and decided to give it a try. I must say that after only a few uses my teeth are pearly white. It is the best product that I have bought and acts just the way that it says on the label.This product removes years worth of stains from your teeth in a few very easy and comfortable treatments. It provides dentist-used, professional strength teeth whitening results in just a few minutes. It uses the same dental-grade Hydrogen Peroxide that dentists use; and the gel is enamel-safe. Heated trays fit perfectly to your teeth, making this no-hassle at home teeth whitening experience both cheaper and more effective than teeth whitening strips. I would say that everyone who is serious about teeth whitening should try this product and you will have no regrets.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used different whitening products in the past and it is not only made my teeth extremely sensitive but in additional they burned my gums. Brilliant HD kit is gentle and didn&#x27;t cause any pain at all. Big plus- it&#x27;s super easy to use! The Brilliant HD kit brings satisfaction and doesnt cost much.  I like to drink a lot of coffee every day and need to change teeth color from yellow to white. I&#x27;m on day 5 but am definitely seeing real result.  I was never able to complete the program because so much pain and sensitivity. Can&#x27;t beat the price either. I recommend Brilliant HD kit for everybody.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a professional-grade teeth whitening at a low cost, look no further! The Brilliant HD Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit whitened my teeth by 3 shades in just one week! This product was easy and quick to use and it didn&#x27;t completely wipe out my bank account. It is also completely safe because it uses the same ingredients that professional teeth cleaners use. I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to give up their coffee or smoking habits but who also doesn&#x27;t want to have yellow teeth stains visible every time they smile. This product has given me my smile back and I am forever grateful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a bunch of these kits for several years and this is one of my favorites. It&#x27;s easy to use and you see results almost immediately! Makes my teeth a little sensitive but that went away in just a day, so no problem really. Thanks!</li>
    <li> In searching for Teeth Whitening products, there are so many on the market.  I selected Brilliant HD-  PRO Teeth Whitening Kit and I am so glad I did.  My teeth have been stained from years of coffee and wine drinking,  and I wanted the smile I used to have.  I have been using these mouth trays for the last few week and I have seen the most remarkable results.  I see my teeth going from yellow to a creamy white, and soon will be the sparkling teeth I have wanted.  The trays are quick and easy to use, and do not hurt my teeth enamel at all.  My dentist asked me what I am doing to get my teeth looking so good,  I smiled and said a little product called Brilliant HD : )</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but figured I would give this tooth whitening kit. I was very pleasantly surprised that after only a few uses, I could see a real improvement and I&#x27;m a coffee and red wine drinker! No issues with sensitivity, either. I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
    <li> I had gone to the dentist for a cleaning and he said my teeth weren&#x27;t badly stained (yes I like my coffee and red wine) but could benefit from a professional whitening procedure. When he told me the price, I said uh you know let me think about that. I went on line and searched for a whitening kit that really worked and fast. After reading the many positive reviews of Brillant HD, I thought I am giving this a try.  Mmm 35.00 a opposed to 500. Much more in my budget range. And it works quickly. I noticed my smile was brighter with in a week.  I am impressed with this product as I didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity as well.  A rock solid deal.</li>
    <li> Wow! I recently switched to this brand and I am loving it so far! I started to see result within the first 3 days I was surprised but impressed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a heavy coffee drinker so naturally that leaves my teeth less white than I&#x27;d life them to be. Every so often I get my teeth whitened yet that proves to be expensive in a lot of cases so when I saw this teeth whitening kit I thought I&#x27;d check it out and I was thoroughly amazed at the results. My teeth look whiter than ever and even better was I got them at lower than the price for new teeth. Definitely worth it. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve grown up in a family of dentists and medical professionals -- I know quality when I see it. This is good stuff! I&#x27;ve used this product for months now and, unlike many other products I&#x27;ve tried on the market, these are consistently great. They aren&#x27;t messy, they work, and they work fast! Love it.</li>
    <li> It works! My teeth were stained yellow and I was surprised that they whitened a couple shades. I am going to keep using this and show off my pearly whites. I couldn&#x27;t be happier, super easy to use and comfortable. Thank you!</li>
    <li> i have the two worst habits when it comes to yellow teeth...smoking and drinking way to much coffee...hey i&#x27;m 21 and living in LA what can i say?  ive been trying to cut down but i work retail and a bright smile goes a long way so i needed a faster way to brighten up my teeth than to just brush them like crazy. after using the brilliant hd whitening kit i started seeing results in a week! it was amazing, my teeth brightened up to the point where even my friends noticed, i even have some customers asking how i get my teeth so white, its such a nice feeling!</li>
    <li> So, I was looking for a teeth whitening system to whitening my teeth because my teeth were awfully stained. After using this product, my teeth has been crispy white--seriously. It removed all of the stains on my teeth. The whitening ingredients are designed to destroy all of the bacteria on your teeth. Also, the product provides an easy-to-use instruction manual, which is great. If you are looking for a whitening system, look no further--you have found the right product!</li>
    <li> I had a great experience with this product. I&#x27;ve used other at-home whitening systems before, and although they do work, they usually require multiple treatments over a period of weeks before they show noticeable results. This one worked as well or better after a single treatment! This is a great alternative to expensive dental cleanings. One caveat is that my teeth were a little bit sensitive for about a day after treatment, so you should avoid hot drinks for a day or two.</li>
    <li> In the past I have used the whitening strips on my teeth. They did not work half as good as this product. This is a professional formula that leaves my teeth white as ivory. And I do not have to use it repeatedly. I recommend this to anyone with stained or yellowish teeth.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for getting your teeth whitened without having to visit the dentist. I really hate having to go and spend so much money on their &amp;#34;preferred&amp;#34; treatments. This is seriously my favourite, its not even that hard to do to start whitening my teeth with these. It doesn&#x27;t burn at all like other whitening treatments do, so that makes me happy.</li>
    <li> I have been using the trays for two weeks and someone asked me where I had my teeth bleached. &amp;#34;My home,&amp;#34; I replied. I am loving these. My teeth are pearly white. Yay!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this product because I&#x27;ve tried many other products in the past for whitening my teeth but thought, &amp;#34;What the heck, I&#x27;ll give it a go anyway.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m really glad I did because after just a few uses I started to notice that my teeth really were whiter. I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with the results and also with the compliments I received from friends who asked if I had professional whitening! I would recommend this product to anyone and I will absolutely keep using it, since I am an avid coffee drinker it really helps balance out my bad habits in keeping my teeth white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the tray is very comfortable to have in which is a bonus because I&#x27;ve used some trays in the past that were somewhat clunky but this one fit in my mouth quite easily as the plastic is flexible and contoured well. I also didn&#x27;t suffer from much sensitivity luckily and was happy about that because thats been one of my problems with other whiteners in the past. So yes, over all a very very positive experience and if you are looking to whiten your teeth I&#x27;d definitely recommend Brilliant Hd-Pro!</li>
    <li> Would rather go with white strips. It was such a process to use everyday.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected and now I can&#x27;t retrun.</li>
    <li> I drink quite a large amount of coffee, and it tends to stain my teeth. I decided to try this product because my teeth have been getting yellow and I wanted to get them whitened up. The procedure is fairly quick and pain free, and my teeth do appear more white.</li>
    <li> If you hate your teeth and gums you should buy this and use it.  This product is criminal.</li>
    <li> Hassel free !&lt;br /&gt;I took this one before going on my vacation .With so many last min chores i ended up taking it with me to mexico.It was so easy to use and i saw instant results. My discolored teeth becoz of so many indian spices was so embarasing but with brilliant i feel so happy .I smile more confidently.This is also cost effective than going to a dentist .&lt;br /&gt;I am going to recommend this one to everyone .</li>
    <li> I noticed that all of the reviews are all written about the same time. None of the users actually purchased Brilliant HD. This looks an awful lot like a scam. BE WARE OF THIEVES AND CROOKS. NONE OF THE 5-STAR REVIEWS ACTUALLY PURCHASED THE PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALERT **** ALERT **** ALERT *****</li>
    <li> Such a huge difference in one single treatment I can&#x27;t wait to see what it looks like in a few months</li>
    <li> After using for about 3 months, I&#x27;ve seen some significant improvements. My teeth was originally light yellow but now it&#x27;s white. THe trays fits into my teeth easily and was very easy to use. Now I can smile confidently in pictures!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It made my teeth whiter in only a couple uses and hasn&#x27;t made them sensitive like some of the other whitening products I&#x27;ve used. Definitely worth the money, I can&#x27;t wait to see how much more white my teeth will be after this is all gone!</li>
    <li> I agree with almost all of them and years of neglecting my teeth are nothing now—we can all take our teeth back. Thanks to this product&lt;br /&gt;Brilliant Hd - PRO.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about one week now. I use it every day sometimes twice, it hardly shows a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I would not recommend this to anyone .. It just does not&lt;br /&gt;Do what it is advertised to do.  Very poor quality.  Not good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been self conscious about my teeth so I&#x27;ve tried multiple treatments to whiten my teeth and nothing seems to work. I have these mouth trays a try and it was a no brainier that I had to keep getting these. They&#x27;re perfect, they fit correctly and they work just how they&#x27;re described. My friends noticed that my teeth were whiter in less than 2 weeks! Incredible product!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a toothpaste that whitens my teeth but isn&#x27;t the normal brands that seem ineffective (like colgate, crest, etc..) So I ended up buying this kit and trying it out, not expecting too much..but I was so shocked! My teeth are so much whiter and finally no more yellow teeth! Feels good to be able to finally smile without feeling like people think my smile is disgusting.</li>
    <li> Just used for 5 minutes first time today. Product is very messy, the mouth trays don&#x27;t seem to work that great. No directions on what you&#x27;re supposed to do about spit..it&#x27;s just too messy to mess with.. Will update in a few weeks to see if it actually works.</li>
    <li> Removes years worth of stains from your teeth in a few very easy and comfortable treatments, not confusing and easy to follow instructions!&lt;br /&gt;Heated trays fit perfectly to your teeth, making this no-hassle at home teeth whitening experience will make you see a lighter shine in just a few days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Quick use, quick results, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None! You save money on dentists appointments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great easy product. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> If you want the effect of Brilliant Hd-PRO Teeth Whitening Kit turned up a notch then go for the IMPROVED version of the Brilliant Hd PRO Teeth Whitening Kit. You now have the luxury of taking your smile and turning up the brightness. So since you&#x27;re already comfortable with original Brilliant-PRO Teeth Whitening you have finally graduated to whitening your teeth to the highest level. Visualize this product,as  a the laser-teeth-whitened-experience-part 2! So again use this product for up to 15 days. Do not over do it. It will not damage your enamel and you can continue to enjoy the brightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
    <li> I was put off by my dentist&#x27;s quote of $450 for making custom teeth molds so I searched Amazon to see the alternatives. I&#x27;ve had mixed results making mouthguards at home using the boiling water technique so I didn&#x27;t really want to go that route for whitening trays. I was pleasantly surprised to find Brilliant Hd - PRO Improved Whitening Mouth Trays that includes customized molds based on at-home clay mouth molding. Preparation of the molding kit was simple. I&#x27;ve only been using Brilliant Hd - PRO for a couple days so I can already see on whitening results, the whitening gel is the same carbonide peroxide used by dentists so thats awesome and a lot less then dentist prices.</li>
    <li> This kit is actually a home-dentist... You simply need to apply the formula and follow the instructions and you get your teeth shiny and bright.. I have got treatments done professionally several times before, and one big advantage of this teeth whitening kit over the professional treatment is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your teeth sensitive at all.. Go for it</li>
    <li> To me, a healthy smile is very important.  The key to a healthy smile is healthy teeth. With this product, you can regain the confidence of someone with perfect teeth. I definitely recommend this product for those who have smoked or drank coffee.</li>
    <li> This product does work.  Just give it a little time.  My teeth were not bad at all but my dentist suggested I try a whitening product to lighten the yellow from some of my teeth.  I can honestly tell you that this product worked for me.  My teeth are perfectly white now and I&#x27;m SO happy with my smile.  Its definitely noticeable.  My wife noticed it immediately after I used it the first time.  This product is worth every penny.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to brighten their smile!</li>
    <li> the trays easy and convenient to apply. Its almost a month and I have seen improvement. My dentist even ask if I had been taking appointments to get my teeth whiter. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have always been super self conscious about my teeth and I have wanted to fix them the cheapest way possible. After the first few days of using this product I was amazed. My teeth were whited and I gained a new self confidence</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t take the title lightly, this product really whitens your teeth to the highest extent. I felt like I just went to see a dentist when I was done. I only use this when I&#x27;m having to go to a business meeting or something serious the next day. Coffee doesn&#x27;t phase this product, not for me lol.</li>
    <li> Did not whiten after 2 weeks, had to then buy a different whitening product. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Package did not arrive on time. Also, there are no mouth trays inside the retainer case - it&#x27;s empty!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know how to use the item at all without the mouth trays.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a scam. Don&#x27;t fall for the fake 5 start reviews.</li>
    <li> This product came in an opened, damaged box. No safety seals on anything inside. Notice the incorrect spelling of treatment twice on the box! None of the 150 5 star reviews are from verified purchasers. Do not buy this product- I didn&#x27;t even try it because I was so concerned about the quality once I got the item- reading the other 1 star reviews I can see this product doesn&#x27;t work and causes pain. I reported this to Amazon and got my money back. This isn&#x27;t safe or sanitary, and is a scam. No thanks! I&#x27;ve learned to only trust verified reviews in the future.</li>
    <li> So sad to admit it, but it is a scam. The product burns my gums and did not whiten my teeth at all, and I have been using it every day for weeks now. The five star reviews are fake. I knew it is hard to believe because there are so many of them. There are typos on the label and I&#x27;m not even sure the product is safe to use, what is really in it? I&#x27;m disappointed in you Amazon for letting this kind of thing happen. Companies should not be allowed to write over 200 fake reviews on a product.</li>
    <li> Woo hoo! I am so so happy to have tried this. I had on trying strips, and they could never stay on right. I tried the good ol&#x27; baking soda and peroxide...and that only worked a little. Then I decided to try this...and the difference is apparent RIGHT AWAY. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Worth every red cent. No trouble with use and I didn&#x27;t suffer any discomfort.</li>
    <li> This is truly the best teeth whitening system on the market. Way better than crest or any other competitor. The trays fit great and the product is easy on the teeth. Great product. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> When I got it, the gel was spilled out into the package &#x3D;(.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried, my teeth trays fell apart and broke... Now I&#x27;m left with just the gel tubes and no mouth trays.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never been this white before. People been asking me how I got my teeth so white did I go to the dentist. And I just smiled my beautiful pearls and said &amp;#34;no I use this product I bought from Amazon&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s amazing. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this teeth whitening kit! I am photographed a lot and have to attend many events where image is extremely important, so a product like this is gold. The gel and mouth tray is really comfortable and doesn’t irritate my gums at all. It’s really simple to use and the results are a lot quicker than most teeth whitening products I’ve tried in the past. I’ve been using this kit for a little over two weeks now and I am very pleased so far and will continue to use it. I recommend the Brilliant Hd-Pro to anyone looking for the right results quickly.</li>
    <li> I have years of stains on my teeth and I did Shine about three times a week for maybe three weeks and my teeth are seriously three to four shades lighter. Very happy with results.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to anyone who craves a whiter smile. This product is awesome and works great under pressure. I was frustrated with my dull smile but couldn&#x27;t skip the morning (and sometimes afternoon) cup of coffee. I found myself searching for a way I could brighten my smile, whiten my teeth and skip a costly visit to the dentist. I found it! I was able to whiten my teeth and due to the fast results, I made it in time for my sister&#x27;s wedding. I will continue to freshen up my smile with this teeth whitening kit!</li>
    <li> As a coffee drinker and occasional smoker teeth whitening is on my revolving door of regimens. This product definitely does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and in a painless way. Using it was simple and self explanatory. I didn&#x27;t taste anything gross or burn anything. Best of all my teeth were shades whiter in a few minutes of folding laundry and watching tv. Great kit for super multi-tasking and getting your teeth pearly white.</li>
    <li> This is the same product that people pay thousands of dollars for treatments of at a fraction of the cost! Once heated, the tray inserts fit perfectly as a mold of your mouth and the gel wipes away years worth of stains. I used to smoke, drink time of coffee, and you would never even notice that now based on the effectiveness of this product. NuNutrients has done it again! This product is tested domestically in a facility specifically for dental hygiene, and uses hydrogen peroxide infused gel to clean your enamel. I&#x27;ve never been more satisfied with a teeth whitening product. It truly works and is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I bought this kit to prepare for a job interview coming up, I didn&#x27;t want my teeth looking like I drink 3 cups of coffee a day! I was really surprised by the speed at which it worked.. only 3 treatments in so far but I see my teeth are noticeably whiter. I have no issues with the trays either, some people say they&#x27;re too big for your mouth but I have a very small mouth and I am fine. I think you should try to heat them multiple times in boiling water until they fit, that&#x27;s the best technique. They have to be really floppy!</li>
    <li> I have been drinking coffee on and off for the past few years. Usually I don&#x27;t have much of a problem, as I just brush my teeth three times a day if time permits. However recently, I have been noticing some discoloration and I have been feeling shy about smiling as I don&#x27;t want others to see the stains on my teeth. I tried small name brand whitening kits. Too messy, irritating, and takes up too much time. Then I came across this on Amazon and it indeed is helpful to get rid of my stains, and I appreciate how fast and effective this product is. It is saving me many teeth brushings and keeping my mouth hidden, now I can smile without worries.</li>
    <li> My teeth have been super yellow for as long as I can remember. I would put off brushing my teeth as a kid &amp; am a regular cigarette smoker &amp; coffee drinker. I&#x27;ve tried using different kinds of strips, toothpastes, &amp; mouth washes but they all either making my teeth insanely sensitive(more than they ALREADY are haha) or just straight out don&#x27;t work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine recommended this product &amp; I had nothing to lose so I gave it a shot. All I can say is it&#x27;s the best whitener I&#x27;ve come across over the years! You can really see results after the first use &amp; after a couple weeks your teeth look brand new...</li>
    <li> another scam product with FAKE 5-star reviews. ALWAYS read the 1-star reviews first.</li>
    <li> The whiting strips never stayed on my teeth as they should. I guess b/c my teeth aren&#x27;t perfectly straight. That&#x27;s why the Brilliant HD Pro kit was my first choice. Having teeth trays are a must for me!! I must say after only a few treatments my teeth are looking brilliantly whiter!!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as it says. The trays are comfortable in the mouth. The product isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t have a weird after taste like other products do. Within a week, I noticed a noticeably whiter smile - and I already have white teeth! My gums and teeth don&#x27;t feel sensitive either.</li>
    <li> As like everyone I was worried about my yellow stained teeth.I had wound in my gums that made more deposition and uncleanable. I tried tooth bleaching but after few months the color will be back to yellow stains and that caused great pain due to weak gums. Moreover the process was reducing the thickness of my teeth. I tried several treatments that were not progressive. I came to know about this Brilliant Hd - PRO - Teeth Whitening Kit - Improved Mouth Trays through my friend who had succeeded in using this. The results were visible in less than a month. I gave it a try and it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy with the results and it even improved my gum strength. I placed the order in Amazon and got the product delivered on right time and delivery was free. I started using it right away and the results were amazing and my teeth stains Vanished like magic. I am happy about this product and its results. I would recommend others too to use it who have similar problems.</li>
    <li> Was seriously pondering before I purchased this product while on holiday in the US. But then I thought you only live once and zi hsve to say ot was $40 well spent. I went from a mild mahogany to pearly whites within a week and a half, this is definitely recommended if you care about the appearsnce of your teeth</li>
    <li> I only been using this product for a handful of weeks, maybe even two or so, and I am already seeing results. That’s pretty good and better than expected. I was getting my teeth ready for wedding photos in my friend’s party and I am pleased to report that my teeth will look great and I think I will continue to use this for a while.</li>
    <li> This Teeth Whitening Kit is easy to use. My teeth are so much whiter and finally no more yellow teeth! Feels good to be able to finally smile without feeling like people think my smile is disgusting.  This is an inexpensive yet efficient way to whiten your teeth.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this product, to brighten my smile, which had suffered, due to my use of coffee.  I received my order quickly and was ready to try it out.  I could not believe how easy this was to use.  Follow some simple directions, and it worked great!  I had used Crest strips before, which didn&#x27;t work, because they would not stick to my teeth.  Wow, I noticed the difference almost immediately!  I did not have to worry no more, I could enjoy my coffee,  and not worry about the stains that come with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a good deal, that turned into a great deal, with the added bonus of FREE SHIPPING.  I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> My aunt got me a sample of this product. She was assertive about the results and made me use the kit. I&#x27;ve had used many teeth whitening products in the past, but none of them could show lasting results. Brilliant HD Pro is a bit different and way more efficient. I had coffee stains on my lower teeth and it took just 1 treatment for me to get rid of them. It was easy to use and showed quick results. It is a highly recommended teeth whitening kit for those who struggle with ugly stains and yellow teeth. In just one treatment you can get back your confidence and get the freedom to smile without any hesitation. At least, this is what it did to me :)</li>
    <li> after several applications, I cannot really see an improvement in the whitening of my teeth  I would like to add that I just started using this product, so may be too early to measure accurate results</li>
    <li> I was born with thin tooth enamel and told by my dentist that I couldn&#x27;t whiten my teeth. Despite this news, I tried Brilliant HD after hearing about it from a friend, and actually got results! My teeth whitened noticeably by the second day, and continued to progress through the 15 day cycle. A few of my friends use other whiteners with strips, but they always complained about sensitivity and minor pain afterwards. I didn&#x27;t have to deal with this by using the trays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also scared of the taste, but it isn&#x27;t bad. It takes a few minutes of getting used to your first time, but the experience was an overall pleasant one. Since I started using this product, I smile bigger and actually don&#x27;t mind showing my teeth. I always thought it was something small, but I really do enjoy being more confident in that way. This method saved me tons on whitening treatments I didn&#x27;t even know would work, and delivered awesome results!</li>
    <li> This burned my gums; I ended up looking back at the reviews and realized that all of the positive ratings were false. They were all posted within the same time period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very angry!</li>
    <li> At first I thought, yeah, just another hype.  I had nothing to lose cuz nothing else worked on my teeth at ALL.  So, I tried it... and MAN! I&#x27;m so glad I did!  WOW!  Cigarette and tea stains I thought were permanent were gone with just a few treatments.  Great product and worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product since about a week or so and already with noticeable results, this is an amazing product and works just as advertised. I have tried many products that claim they can do the same but I have tried a few and none could give me results like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very solid product and would recommend to anyone looking to get some solid results.</li>
    <li> This kit is $60 on the company&#x27;s website, so good price. (Although original price on here has $89.99, it&#x27;s not). Works as well as all other peroxide based whiteners.</li>
    <li> I usually have lots of issues with my teeth being very sensitive with these whitening products. They always work and I look great but I am grimacing inside as the air passes through and jumps around in my brain almost bringing me to my knees. It’s nuts. Well Brilliant HD Pro is fine for me. I thought it was going to be because it doesn’t work but it works fine. I’m glad I found this product and will continue to have nice teeth.</li>
    <li> I’m not NOT drinking coffee or tea. I need it to stay away during work. But the downside is that it peels away my enamel and reveals how our teeth are yellow on the inside. I tried whitening strips but they were hard to use. Someone I know told me to look for a tray system and I found it on amazon not in stores. But that’s fine because the cost is competitive and affordable. This stuff actually stays in my mouth and whitens my teeth and doesn’t waste my time. I will be safely drinking my tea and coffee and keeping my white teeth thank you.</li>
    <li> So far, I can&#x27;t say much about this product because I haven&#x27;t yet tried it out. But, I want to clear the hype first with the one and five star reviews! First off, a statement of the one-star review is true: the packaging (the BrilliantHD Box) itself was not in the best possible condition but supportable to the point to making you think no one rummaged inside of it. The quality state of the actual products inside (physically) was ideal. The syringes and gel and mouthpieces looked brand new! However, the physical arrangement of each one of these products inside of the box was not ideally organized, yet as stated before, supportable to a degree. Everything looked a bit sloppy but untouched, which was what mattered for me. Also, unlike some of the one-star reviewers claimed, THERE ARE NO TYPOS or any grammatical mistakes of the English language ANYWHERE on the damn box. That was just to clear up any scares the one-star reviewers made up. WAIT, I&#x27;M NOT DONE YET! I do agree with the one-star reviewers in one way, though! There is absolutely NO WAY that the majority of those five-star reviewers are in fact, true to any degree whatsoever. Nevertheless, I have no idea of what quality or goodness the use of the product is as I haven&#x27;t used it yet. Therefore, I chose three stars because there are truths and lies in both the reviews of the five and one star, and three was in the middle, which for an unused product seems ample (enough). I will post an update soon about the condition of my teeth after one treatment while using the product. So stay tuned for an update in 15 days or so!!!!</li>
    <li> I was using this every day because I wanted to get my teeth as white as possible. It started to hurt a bit so I had to dial it back to a couple times a week maybe three times. The results are very noticeable after a couple weeks and I am happy with the result.</li>
    <li> The product it&#x27;s ok. One thing I really hate about it it&#x27;s that it made my teeth super sensitive. I continue the treatment and I can see some change. My teeth do look whiter. Now I did recieved this product to sample and so I have. You can believe what you like but this what I believe.  The product brings 2 clear gels,1 blue gel and 2 mouth trays. Now the mouth guards are not the best. It didn&#x27;t fit me well and I think that also cause my teeth to be even more sensitive. After using it can see some improvement. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best but it has helped me. I will continue to use and give you a real honest update.  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own real honest opinion where you believe or not my opinions are real.</li>
    <li> After just one use I really noticed a big difference on my teeth. From yellowish teeth to white teeth.</li>
    <li> My teeth seem to be a lot whiter now with the help of this product. Kudos Brilliant HD Pro.</li>
    <li> I read a TON of reviews prior to purchasing, and I&#x27;m not one for conspiracy theories, but, turns out, maybe there is something to all the claims of false positive reviews on this one. I tried the product for a week with daily use and followed all instructions diligently. I was able to form the mouth trays effortlessly. My teeth MAYBE got one shade whiter. It just didn&#x27;t perform as well as all the reviews claim. I wish I had spent my money on a better performing product. If you do decide to purchase, tread cautiously and don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
    <li> What first got me about this product was that it was dental grade and I liked the idea of using something that I could purchase in my doctor&#x27;s office (speaking of which, I nearly did buy a system from my dentist which would have cost several times what this one cost!). This product is easy to use, hasn&#x27;t caused me any discomfort or any sensitivity, and doesn&#x27;t cause a mess either (something I was afraid of). It&#x27;s also enamel safe, which is important to me (I like my teeth !) and my teeth are very white (I have gotten several compliments on my teeth recently). I smile a lot, so it&#x27;s important to me that my teeth look good !</li>
    <li> I had a set of trays made years ago thru a dentist office and because of teeth being pulled and just time in general they no longer fit. The thought of having to go to the dentist again, and cost to have another set made didn&#x27;t appeal to me. I was so excited when I came across this kit on Amazon. The results i have witnessed since are absolutely tremendous! I rate this product 10/10! Very good!</li>
    <li> Brilliant Hd Pro is a teeth whitening Kit that uses dental-grade hydrogen peroxide.  Thus, the kit yields the same professional whitening results.  Price just under $40, it&#x27;s a bargain.  Most customers are pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> There are so many teeth whitening stuff in stores now that its hard to decide which one will really work for you. I have tried many of those, even very expensive ones but nothing actually worked. Then my sister told me to give a try to Brilliant-Hd-PRO Teeth Whitening kit so I just thought of giving it a shot too. I was very surprised with the results and extremely happy. Its not as expensive as others are and very easy to use. I found my teeth atleast two shades whiter in just a week. I will continue to use this product and highly recommend it. A must try!</li>
    <li> Okay, this product is great if you have 1) sensitive teeth 2) little time and 3) found other products to be ineffective. I like this company personally, so maybe I am a bit biased. I use a few of the products and I think they provide great service and great products for an amazing price. I Have found this  product to be effective and simple to use. I like that it is not a hassle and that is fast. Sometimes w don&#x27;t have 2 weeks for those strips.</li>
    <li> Brilliant Hd Pro is a teeth whitening Kit that uses dental-grade hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the kit yields the same professional whitening results. Price just under $40, it&#x27;s a bargain. I have been using it for 3 days and the results are already noticeable. I will complete the treatment!</li>
    <li> I like the mouth tray system—I find it very convenient and easy to use. I will continue to use this product until the end of time, until my teeth are just permanently white. If I keep using Shine maybe that will happen, based on past results.</li>
    <li> There was not enough remineralizing product to go with the whitening tubes. I had to purchase extra from another source. I am still in the process of whitening-it seems even one cup of coffee a day seems to  re stain my teeth so not sure how it will pan out in the long run.</li>
    <li> The Brilliant HD Pro Teeth Whitening Kit is made in the USA in a GMP certified facility with professional dental supervision. When I saw that description at the Amazon listing it gave me pause, it’s nice to buy a product that is made in the USA. I support any good business, but it’s great when a product is made locally. The product claims to remove years worth of stains from your teeth in a few very easy and comfortable treatments. I’ve used the kit for 10 days, and have noted some improvement. I drink tea several times a day, and drink wine at least once a week. Every few years I used to go to my dentist for what I call a “touch up”, but with all the comparable over the counter whitening options there isn’t much need. The kit is easy to use – the directions are simple. Unlike other kits it comes with a re-mineralization gel. I do advise testing your teeth to see your level of sensitivity, I have sensitive teeth so I do not use a lot of the product and only do 5-10 minute treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Brilliant HD Pro Teeth Whitening Kit at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This was a gift from my sister and I&#x27;ve actually used the Brilliant HD Pro Teeth Whitening Kit twice.  I&#x27;m always super impatient to start using something new but I highly recommend reading the directions a few times - unless of course, you&#x27;re a seasoned pro at the whole teeth whitening thing.  There&#x27;s a certain hang to getting the trays malleable enough to properly fit your teeth as well as working the syringe to apply the gel to the trays.  The trays have to stick properly in order for the product to work.  Once you&#x27;ve got that working properly, it&#x27;ll brighten your teeth.  I noticed a difference the first time and by the second use, a way bigger difference.</li>
    <li> As a former long-time smoker, coffee and tea drinker, my teeth have always been a bit yellow. Now out and about more, I&#x27;ve become more concerned with the appearance of my teeth. Seeing younger people with &amp;#34;pearly whites&amp;#34; makes me feel envious. I have been experimenting with different tooth whitening systems over the past year. I had read reviews for all the products here in amazon and thought I&#x27;d give this one a try, it seemed to among the best, if not the best. I am pleased with the results. It is easy to use (be careful to follow the directions precisely!)...and I saw the results almost immediately. Brilliant is simply a brilliant innovative product!</li>
    <li> I just love brilliant HD. It is really a brilliant teeth whitening kit. I enjoy smiling when I once was ashamed because of stains from years of bad eating.  I tired many brands and nothing else has gotten the job done like brilliant. I love my new smile. I recommend brilliant to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive yet effective way to brighten their smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliant  is easy to use and not messy. Within a few days, I noticed a difference in my teeth. My teeth became brighter by the day. My family and friends notice and ask me who was my dentist because my teeth were so white? I laughed and replied, I use brilliant. They were amazed. Within days a few of my family members and friends started expressing to me how they purchased brilliant and it was working out for them. Within weeks I notice their new bright smile too.</li>
    <li> After years of coffee and tea, I needed to address my teeth yellowing before it gets any worse. The mouth tray fits well and the application is not messy. As far as sensitivity, I don&#x27;t notice it with this whitener. My results will be different, but at about 2 weeks it was very noticeable when I compared before and after pics. So don&#x27;t get discouraged and stick with it.</li>
    <li> The reviews got me to buy it and when I got it I felt like I got cheated outta something good. I honestly felt like what did I just buy? Couldn&#x27;t return it so I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Some reviewers seemed to get a little sensitive to using this but i had no issue at all with it. It was a pleasure to use and i have a lot of gel leftover (a whole syringe) for the next time i want to whiten my teeth. Next time will be so much easier because i already have the trays set up.</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product. I feel scammed, and rating this one star is being generous. This product failed to do the only thing it was purchased for - whiten teeth. The mouth trays are bulky and unmoldable, no matter how many times directions were followed. The bottom tray did not even fit in my mouth. The gel syringes were a sloppy mess. I gave this product more chances than it was worth and it let me down big time.</li>
    <li> Gotta admit... .was super skeptical about this product... but the results were hard to deny. This stuff works fast. No real complaints except be careful for teeth sensitivity. Its best to use it every 3 days not everyday.</li>
    <li> I must say, I have tried a lot of teeth whitening products and this is really making my teeth a lot brighter. I like that with this product the tray actually fits my teeth comfortably. Also a plus that this is enamel safe, so I don;t have to worry about my teeth being damaged. I noticed results after the first application and it is only getting better and better. Totally recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love this whitening tray it really works. It took all of the stains out of my teeth and its harmless and it didnt do any damage to my teeth an gums. You should give it a try it works very well.</li>
    <li> There is a second gel for gentle teeth. That’s enough for five stars. It works and my teeth feel great.</li>
    <li> Instead of going to get it done professionally to my doctor, I choose this teeth whitening because its cheap and still looks white as it is done professionally.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have amazing results the first day or week but after consistent use my teeth are whiter than they have ever been. My teeth are usually not very responsive to working strips and my gums are sensitive normally. The trays are great and there&#x27;s more than enough gel.</li>
    <li> The trays are certainly comfortable enough to sit in your mouth. Some of them feel really strange or awkward in your mouth, but these seem to fit really nicely! Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I ordered this Brilliant HD-PRO-Teeth it for myself. I have staining on my teeth from drinking multiple cups of tea a day. I am quite impressed with the packaging and information that comes with the product and on the BRILLIANTHD.COM website. Due to the information I have not begun the process as I should consult with my dentist first. It is clearly stated on the box product instructions that if I have a medical condition which has the potential for producing mouth sores that I must see my dentist first. (I have Crohn&#x27;s Disease. Please read the valuable information for the product.)&lt;br /&gt;This product is for direct use in a customer&#x27;s mouth. I noticed that the box is securely closed with tape to prevent easy access which protects the materials inside. I like this. The substance that is used to apply to my teeth is packaged in syringes so it is safe and ready for direct application. The tray case has a unique snap shut cover which gives added security to the two mouth trays used for the process inside. The product has a caution to the customer stating in general that the customer resumes responsibility for product use and once again advises contact with the dentist. I am excited to get to whiten my tea-stained teeth but want to do as advised. Disclaimer: I purchased this product at a reduced price in return for my own unbiased opinion. This is solely my opinion. As I progress with the process I will update.</li>
    <li> I’m self conscious about my smile. My teeth are a bit crooked but also I guess I don’t have strong genes in the teeth department. I started yellowing very early in life and I’m sure nobody else notices but it makes my confidence level take a nose dive. I started using Brilliant HD Pro and I got results almost immediately. It was a few days and you could tell it got lighter and lighter until my teeth were almost fresh out the womb white. I feel better and the work to get it is not expensive or hard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many teeth whitening products over the years and most produce good results so when I had the opportunity to purchase this brand of teeth whitening at a reduced price so I could try it and then give my honest opinion of this product I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything different than other brands. I was pleasantly surprised, the trays that you put the whitening liquid in are first warmed in hot water and then put in the mouth to form around your teeth for a good tight fit. That was very easy to do and I liked that they were essentially made for my bottom and upper teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The whitening gel didn&#x27;t burn my gums or irritate my mouth at all and that was nice because I assumed to have white teeth you had to have some amount of irritation of the gums. The gel didn&#x27;t run all over the place nor did I have to sit with a cloth by my mouth and keep wiping up all the gel that would run out of my mouth which I&#x27;ve experienced with every other brand.&lt;br /&gt;After you&#x27;re done with the whitening gel there is also a small tube of blue gel that is a remineralizing treatment for your teeth. That&#x27;s also a first for me and I was impressed with that. After only 3 treatments and leaving the trays in my mouth for only 6 minutes each time I had a noticeable improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. I&#x27;m pretty happy with Brilliant HD whitening kit and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I started using this product because I used to use strips and they kept falling out of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually got a professional bleaching done and I didn’t want to spend that kind of money again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I started to use Brilliant Hd - PRO and it has worked out. It is very affordable and my teeth are almost as good as after I got them bleached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silly to think I ever did that in the first place.</li>
    <li> I’m very happy with the results I’ve seen here. I read the reviews so I tried it as a trial and my teeth are whiter and it’s great.</li>
    <li> Seems almost all of these reviews were made about the same time and I don&#x27;t see any from verified purchasers.</li>
    <li> I seriously didn&#x27;t think anything could help my teeth. Years of abuse, coffee drinking, and just not taking care of them, but this product helped me look better. It is a little difficult to use the first time, but after a couple of applications, I found my confidence improving and it became easier to manage the whole system. It is much less expensive than a trip to the dentist. I would recommend it to someone who wanted an easy way to brighten their teeth.</li>
    <li> Since childhood I have had issues with discolored teeth that would be so embarrassing. I don&#x27;t have dental insurance and money is tight so professional whiting services are out of the question. I&#x27;ve tried home remedies and none have worked well enough to remove the stains. When a blog that I follow recommended the Brilliant HD Teeth Whiting Kit and said how well it worked for them, I decided to give it a try. I was skeptical at first, but after using it for the first two weeks, I can see a remarkable difference. My teeth and gums are super sensitive too and the gel and mouth tray don&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
    <li> I have used other whitening kits in the past but by far this one has worked the best. It is easy to use and not messy like other whitening kits can be. This made my teeth whiter in no time which was great. I get more compliments on my smile now and would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good teeth whitening kit to use.</li>
    <li> It actually tastes minty when you use it, not like other whitening gels that taste like chemicals which i dont really want to put on my teeth.Five stars.</li>
    <li> You should also use the q-tip technique recommended in the instructions, it will help you keep the product off your gums. If you follow the instructions and use it once every few days, you&#x27;ll notice whiter teeth pretty immediately and without sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend picking up shine whitening because of the great results I&#x27;ve gotten and absolutely no side effects.. A lot better than other more expensive brands without a doubt.</li>
    <li> Very happy about this whitening product - its been 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve only used it 4 times but each time I&#x27;m seeing some significant whitening. I don&#x27;t recommend using this daily, just use it when you need a touch up, that&#x27;s the best way.</li>
    <li> My teeth are brighter and I am very confident in my smile. My coworkers have commented, not on my teeth per se but just that I seem happier. Sometimes all it takes is a little boost of confidence and I think after using Brilliant only a handful of times my teeth look great and feel whiter. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have cigarette use stains on my teeth for many years. I’ve found Briliant HD Pro to be very effective at cutting them down a bit, and making my face more attractive overall. I use it three times a week and I’m happy with what has happened after I use this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SET!! I was very excited about this product. My smile has always been one my my biggest insecurities. As soon as it arrived I got the box and read the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I molded the trays to my mouth as soon as they arrived. I have a strong gag reflex, so it did take some getting used to when I put both trays in my mouth. After I did that and set my trays up, I started the clock for 5 minutes. It feels kind of minty, it also doesn&#x27;t hurt. I made sure none were near my gums, and the instructions tell you to do that as well. There&#x27;s a guide on the box and you can match your teeth color to before and after so you can see how many shades you lightened up. I included a before and after my first 5 minute session so you can see how well it works. I plan to do it one to two times a week so my teeth don&#x27;t get too sensitive. It also comes with a blue gel to help reduce sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing product and my mom wants it too. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions stated are my own and derived from actual use of the product.</li>
    <li> This was amazing! Great options for teeth whitening if you do not want to spend a lot of money.</li>
    <li> I personally enjoy the tray system. Whitening strips fell out of my mouth so I am looking forward to using this more often and avoiding that kind of experience.</li>
    <li> The tray system keeps everything in your mouth, the gel doesn’t get all over the place and I think it’s pretty ingenious. Five stars.</li>
    <li> After a couple uses my smile is brighter and I am happy with the results. I will continue to use it and I think it will be just as good a month from now.</li>
    <li> This Teeth Whitening Kit is easy to use.  Now, my teeth are pearly white for all of the Holiday Parties I&#x27;ll be attending!</li>
    <li> As a smoker, yellow teeth are a problem for me. No matter how much I brush, they are still yellow. A friend of mine told me to purchase this product. I was a little skeptical at first. I have tried some teeth whitening products in the past and they did not work at all. But I finally decided to purchase this one and I am very happy with the results. It is super easy to use and I could see results right after I used it. People have actually been complimenting me on how white my teeth are! This is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> okay! so I have seen so many different whitening kits that pretty much say the exact say thing!&lt;br /&gt;But I can say this one really does what it says, from seeing so many commercials about different kits, it&#x27;s kinda difficult to pick just one but after doing some searching on Amazon, I finally found the right one! it&#x27;s really easy to use and it&#x27;s priced pretty well compared to many other kits, you just can&#x27;t go wrong ! if you have ever been interested in whitening kits you might as well give it a try !</li>
    <li> I chose this product because of  the high accolades for it on Amazon and I couldn&#x27;t afford a professional teeth whitening with my dentist. Insurance doesn&#x27;t cover it because it&#x27;s considered cosmetic. I was incredibly happy with the results of this treatment and the mouth trays which were far better than another name brand (Crest) whitening system I&#x27;d tried from the local pharmacy. This included free shipping, so what the heck. I saw about a 3-4 shade difference in my teeth brightness. I will definitely continue using this when my teeth start getting grayer again from chronic coffee drinking - lol!</li>
    <li> Because of the various acids in our foods- our teeth can become discolored especially from coffee and tea. Brilliant Hd-Pro provides the right combination to help you smile bright again. It was easy to use and effective. I am a daily tea drinker and will not be giving up my tea and now I won&#x27;t need to.</li>
    <li> I just recently have gotten my braces removed this year, and due to them I have some stains. They&#x27;re not noticeable but it bothered me so I decided to try a kit. I see a lot of progress so I&#x27;m a happy camper. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Used this a few times. works great and did not make my teeth feel super sensitive. easy to use instructions.</li>
    <li> I love white teeth and Brilliant HD Pro gives them to people, so I bought a bunch for my friends and family and I have only heard good things back from them, gotten great feedback.</li>
    <li> I have sparkling white teeth only after using it a few times, in a few weeks. I am very happy with results. Friends and family and coworkers have all been asking about it. I have recommended the product to them and so I decided to also leave a review on here to recommend it to all of you as well.</li>
    <li> My father is a dentist and this is his most recommended kit for whitening your teeth.  Why pay more when you can get the same results for a cheaper price.  The instructions for using this whitening kit are very simple and your teeth will be whitened in only a few hours.  Some people claim that their teeth become sensitive afterwards but it only lasts for a couple of days at most.  I would also wholeheartedly recommend the Brilliant Hd pro teeth whitening kit to all those who want whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a friend. I was reluctant to use the whitening kit as most other never really did the job. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this kit was to use! I seen results very fast! So much easier than whitening strips that never stay in place! Thanks again!</li>
    <li> 5 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have improved a lot&lt;br /&gt;I started using this a few weeks ago and I think the results have been good. My confidence is up and people have noticed that my teeth are whiter, or at least that I’m smiling a lot more often. I find that the tray system is simple to use and fits easily in my mouth now. The gel is cool and minty. My teeth have become a bit more white and I enjoy using the product a few times a week. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This looks like a carefully choreographed ruse. All the &amp;#34;reviews&amp;#34; were written within days, many coming in on the same day!  And not one of the 31 reviewers has actually purchased the product. Fishy, eh?  This is virtually impossible. And check out the reviewers. They all seem to be reviewing many of the exact same products...which (surprise, surprise) they also have not actually purchased. If it smells like a scam... Folks, witness honest to goodness dishonest crooks.  Update:  Today is Nov 28, 2014. Since my unveiling of the fraudulent reviews on Nov 23rd, there have been 30 --yes 30 -- new 5 star reviews posted for this product. All but one coming from Nov 24th to 26th.... and again, none of them have actually bought the product... and once again, these &amp;#34;reviewers&amp;#34; have given &amp;#34;reviews&amp;#34; for many of the same products, namely supplement products with strangely identical labels. Now, anyone with a brain should see that this is fraud in plain sight. I don&#x27;t know why I am taking the time, only perhaps because I hate to see people get ripped off. And make no mistake, these thieves are ripping people off.  And keep an eye on the number of people who find this review helpful. On the 25th of Nov, it was 6 of 7. Today it&#x27;s 7 of 13. So the thieves are now attacking this review.  Can&#x27;t wait to see how this plays out!  Stay posted.  Update: Well, the thieves are still at it.  Today is March 24th 2015. Notice now that this review is voted &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; to just 99 of 151 people. Here&#x27;s why. The thieves who sell the product and the crooks they are paying to put up fake reviews are also &amp;#34;voting&amp;#34; on all reviews. They want the most damaging ones (like this one) to be pushed down the page of 1 star reviews so that prospective buyers won&#x27;t see it and won&#x27;t be influenced by them. This is common on amazon. For as great as amazon is, it&#x27;s a bit puzzling why they allow this. But until they stop allowing it, scammers will continue to scam the system andput up fake reviews. Just another form of cyber crime, only this is very public. Stay tuned. Oh, I almost forgot. If you find this useful and you want to help other people from being scammed, make your opinion known. Vote &amp;#34;Yes.&amp;#34; Check out all the 5 star reviews from almost exclusively non-buyers. Have a nice day. Thank you for shopping at amazon!</li>
    <li> Th Brilliant Hd Pro Teeth Whitening kit is simply amazing. The mouth trays fit wonderfully to contour around teeth and allow for excellent whitening. The process is easy and extremely effective. The gel is easy to apply to the tray and the process is not long so it only takes minutes out of your day. THe best thing is that it removes the residue caused by smokeing, caffeine, coffee, soda and any other teeth staining products. This product is professional grade and works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best whitening kit compared to those on the market. Reasonable priced and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This works here. For the longest time I&#x27;ve needed whitening treatment, and had tried some to little avail. For whatever reason they really worked and after awhile I resolved to stop wasting my time with them. But after taking this on for the past couple weeks I can say it works. I have seen a considerable difference in the color of my teeth and I feel better about it. I really enjoy this product!</li>
    <li> After I got my braces off, my teeth were completely stained! It was so embarrassing to even smile for pictures. I was trying to find a way to inexpensively whiten my teeth, i bought many store products and none seemed to work for me. After hopeless failed attempts, I decided to give my teeth one last try and thats when I came across Brilliant HD. I won&#x27;t say it did a miracle in 24 hours but, after a week of using it I started to notice a difference. Its been a month and my teeth are pearly whites I cannot be anymore please with this product!</li>
    <li> This teeth whitening system has made my teeth look AMAZING! I cannot believe how much more confidence I have. I used to never show my teeth in pictures and now I ALWAYS do! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Growing up in a small farm in a small town, having white teeth was not much of a concern. But now that I live in an urban area, and have a professional business job, having white teeth became much more important. It can drastically alter how someone views you, and I wanted to be seen as clean, neat and professional. So, I turned to Brilliant HD. The reviews don&#x27;t lie, this product can definitely make your teeth shades whiter in just one use. I recommend using it for 15 minutes each day for maximum results. I have been using it for around 10 days and my teeth are so much whiter. I couldn&#x27;t be happier-- its cheap, and it works. The trays fit perfectly in my mouth, and even came with a little case for them (which for me, being slightly unorganized, didn&#x27;t get much use). The 2 syringes it comes with will last you a while if you use this right. 10/10</li>
    <li> Some of the best money that I have ever spent. I was asked to be in a friend&#x27;s bridal party, and I hated being photographed because of my discolored teeth. This product was so simple to use...yet it worked! It gave me back my confidence, and allowed me to have a great time at the wedding and to relax around the camera. The photos came out great, and I am a believer!</li>
    <li> This was one of the first products to show up when I searched for teeth whitening kits. I was sure that with so many high reviews, this was a great product. Unfortunately, most of the reviews are fake. Too bad I found this out after I ordered the kit. The box actually misspells the word &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; twice, which is to me a no-brainer. I won&#x27;t be using this on my teeth, and I&#x27;m sad that I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> After spending $1,000&#x27;s on my braces my dentist quoted me an additional $500 for custom teeth whitening trays. I went home, did a little research and came across Brilliant Hd. It was the same thing at a fraction of the price!  I have been using every morning for a week, and the results are really amazing. I did it for 30 minutes and the results are so noticeable. It was easy to use and comfortable in my mouth. This product is better than Crest strips, and with the new and improved tray I was able to comfortably wear it for the entire whitening time. I am so happy I found this product I am able to smile with out feeling embarrassed of showing my teeth.</li>
    <li> What I love about this product is that it is something that I could purchase in my doctor&#x27;s office. It&#x27;s easy to use, hasn&#x27;t caused any discomfort or any sensitivity, and doesn&#x27;t cause a mess either.  It&#x27;s also enamel safe and my teeth are whiter than ever.</li>
    <li> Do not buy. The 5 star ratings are fake. Look at the rating left by the people who leave the 5 star ratings..... I bought this because of the ratings. I received the package which had two tubes of bleach, one tube of mineralization gel, two moldings, and one applicator cap. The moldings were horrible. They did not form well, and were huge. After several attempts to get them to form, they were destroyed. I ended up buying more from a different manufacturer. Why would you send one tube of mineralization gel, with two tubes of bleach? I ran out of mineralization gel. This also came with one applicator cap, so after using the bleach I would have to remove the cap and screw it onto the mineralization gel, then press out the remaining bleach in the cap to get to the gel, then vice-versa then next day to use the bleach again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with the Brilliant Hd whitening kit. My teeth were a few shades whiter in no time at all and were significantly cleaner after I completed the treatment. In terms of quality and ease of use it surpasses many of the home whitening kits, even the big names.&lt;br /&gt;The new tray is really comfortable and makes the whole concept of at home teeth whitening less of a chore.Sensitivity wasn&#x27;t an issue for me, which is rare. I usually experience some sort of discomfort, but not while using this.&lt;br /&gt;I use these home kits quite often and have tried out many of them Brilliant HD is definitely one that I will be using again.</li>
    <li> Screw the crest white strips! I&#x27;ve been looking for something to get rid of the coffee stains on my teeth and this kit works like magic! you get dentist quality for a fraction of the price.  I can&#x27;t believe how much brighter and cleaner my smile looks. No more closed mouth smiling for this guy, i&#x27;m all pearly whites now!  definitely recommended for everyone! so easy to use</li>
    <li> Great stuff, the tray worked really really well and the product really helped my smile by whitening my teeth. My smile looks 100 times better and the trays help so much in the process!</li>
    <li> My teeth has turned into yellow color and I was unable to smile especially in the crowd. That is when, I came across this revolutionary teeth whitening kit. As most of the reviews about this product are positive and hence, I decided to give a try. When I started using this kit, I am able to observe the change. My teeth started to turn into brilliant white color. Today, I can proudly maintain a broad smile on my face. Thanks to Brilliant HD.</li>
    <li> Brilliant Hd&#x27;s teeth whitening product is the most amazing such product on the market. Through the years I have tried various teeth whitening products to lift old soda and coffee stains but nothing has worked the way I hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the urging of a friend, I ordered Brilliant HD and I was finally able to lift those stubborn stains that have hung on for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for the best teeth whitening product on the market, look no further. You too will be writing a 5-star review in no time!</li>
    <li> When my dentist suggested that I could benefit from teeth-whitening treatments, I was apprehensive about how much it might cost. After doing some research online I discovered that Brilliant Hd Pro Teeth Whitening Kit uses the same teeth-whitening treats that professionals use. So, I gave it a try. After a few easy treatments I noticed a huge improvement to my smile. My teeth are vibrant and dazzling, and it cost me less than $50!</li>
    <li> Love this whitening kit. I have gained so much more self-respect and self-confidence from this kit. My teeth were really yellow and it was making me really uncomfortable being around people because they would always focus on my teeth. I was seeing results within two weeks and my teeth are still getting a little brighter every time I use this whitening kit. Great price and you don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune to look better.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference in My teeth using this product and the mouth mild is terrible. Would much rather send the money on the crest strips.</li>
    <li> The tray system feels pretty good in the mouth. You have to stick it under a faucet or in a bowl of hot water and then let it form in your mouth, so it’s almost like a soft plastic pillow for your teeth. Let it sit there for a while, and then it’s just done. You have a personal piece of oral hygiene. That way when you insert the gel into the piece and then put it back in your mouth for two to three times a week, you can just chomp down on it and play video games or something, instead of worrying if the strips will fall out of your teeth. The results are similar to other whitening products so this is a no duh moment.</li>
    <li> Just bite down after warming it up and it forms into your mouth. The trays are a good system and I found it worked for me. Beaming smile too.</li>
    <li> Way better than Crest&#x27;s product! With the new and improved tray I was able to comfortably wear it for the entire whitening time (very rare for me). I drink a lot of caffeine, mostly coffee, so if I do not do whitening treatments my teeth get pretty stained. This whitening kit really does get rid of stains, and doesn&#x27;t cut up your gums while doing  so!</li>
    <li> Love this kit! It so far has been the only affordable way of whitening that has worked for me. It&#x27;s super easy to use and it really gets my teeth white. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and I&#x27;ve already started getting compliments, and I&#x27;m definitely a lot more confident when smiling. Would absolutely recommend to those looking for a way to whiten their teeth that ACTUALLY works.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been happy with the color of my teeth for years but my dentist recommended this product (he was selling it for a lot more though). I am incredibly happy with the results and the mouth trays are very comfortable. My teeth are noticeably whiter and I&#x27;m more confident with my smile.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after seeing the great results a friend of mine had from using it. She&#x27;s a smoker and black coffee drinker, and her teeth had been pretty darkly stained. But after about a week of using this, her teeth looked so much brighter and whiter! It made her look younger, and happier -- more &#x27;up,&#x27; you know?  My teeth weren&#x27;t as stained as hers, yet about a week after using this friends began complimenting me on how &#x27;bright&#x27; my smile was. One person at work remarked how happy I seemed.  Frankly, I don&#x27;t think it was the way I acted, I think it&#x27;s that my teeth are now sparkling white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this item is easy on the pocketbook. Another reason why I&#x27;ll be reordering a fresh supply soon. . .</li>
    <li> Probably the best teeth whitening product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Easily worth the price, and probably a lot more.  I tried this after various store bought whitening products, and it worked way better than the others.  I would even wager to say it&#x27;s the one product that did any sort of whitening, fantastic product!  5/5</li>
    <li> My teeth are much more white now. I was using whitening strips before but this product brings better results than those strips. It didn&#x27;t really take that long for the results to be visible on my teeth. I had many stains on my teeth but now it&#x27;s cleared off.</li>
    <li> I drink coffee, smoke cigarettes and (as a child) never brushed my teeth. I brush them now, but it sure doesn&#x27;t combat those stains! However, I ordered this product and since using it, my teeth have been whiter than ever! It was a pleasant surprise.</li>
    <li> If you want to find something fresh without invasions for your mouth, you need to use this product! This one was the phrase that my friend told me before to buy it!. Right now I would like to say that is a great product with a lot of good property. I really love it because make me feel so fresh and my teeth looks so clean. Thank you Maggie! I mean, my friend!</li>
    <li> FAKE! Wish I was more careful before buying this product. Came in a crushed, open box, with no safety seals or instructions inside; trays were TERRIBLE, and 2 applications made 0 difference. Also hurt my gums really bad! Will not be using again and am hoping for a refund.</li>
    <li> This was so much easier than i thought it would be.  The heated trays make all the difference in the world! Very effective, fast, and simple to use!  I recommend this product to ANYONE!</li>
    <li> Made in the USA in a GMP certified facility with professional dental supervision.&lt;br /&gt;Removes years worth of stains from your teeth in a few very easy and comfortable treatments.&lt;br /&gt;Provides dentist-used, professional strength teeth whitening results in just a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Uses the same dental-grade Hydrogen Peroxide that dentists use; Gel is enamel-safe.&lt;br /&gt;Heated trays fit perfectly to your teeth, making this no-hassle at home teeth whitening experience both cheaper and more effective than teeth whitening strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down best teeth whitening product i&#x27;ve used... i&#x27;m a coffee/pop lover &amp; I smoke cigarettes so i&#x27;m always looking for the next best teeth cleaning product thats when I found this product. It worked way better than whitening strips &amp; the costly toothpastes that promise whitening but fail to do so.</li>
    <li> This is the best product anyone could buy for themselves.  A bright smile and healthy teeth is so important. Often times, that is the one area that people forget.  I can&#x27;t afford to go to the dentist, this is starting to and will continue to brighten my teeth and get that coke stain off.</li>
    <li> The Brilliant HD Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit PRO is the most effective over the counter product in whitening teeth. You can start seeing amazing results after the first two uses. The trays are relatively easy to use and they sit comfortably. They do not cut or harm gums and there are no issues of sensitivity. If you have a history of neglected teeth, try this product and you will be amazed!&lt;br /&gt;The price is amazing for dental grade whitening and you will see that the same ingredients are used by Dentists. So say goodbye to ugly yellow teeth and show that smile with confidence.</li>
    <li> I used this product as directed and my teeth lightened several shades immediately without sensitivity.  I will absolutely buy again.  The trays were very easy to mold in hot water.  I did cut the tabs off the front of both trays with scissors to make them more comfortable.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this teeth whitening kit! I am photographed a lot and have to attend many events so keeping a perfect image is important. The gel and mouth tray is really comfortable and doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums at all. It’s really simple to use and the results are a lot quicker than most teeth whitening products I&#x27;ve tried in the past. the bright side of this is that it only took 2-3 weeks to see major improvements.</li>
    <li> It worked for me after a few times. So I bought some for my husband and his teeth have also improved. We’re a white smile family now. I never knew what having white teeth could feel like, it feels like people treat us like we’re cleaner or something. Brilliant HD Pro is easy to use and I will continue to purchase it and use on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> This Product made my teeth amazing, initially i cant believe myself after seeing the result of this product and now i am very happy with this product , this product is little low cost than other teeth whitening products in the market so i can say that good product with little low cost</li>
    <li> I noticed after one used of brilliant hd, I can see the results and I was anaze. My teeth isn&#x27;t the whitest, but brilliant help it become white and shiny. My boyfriend and I use it and we always give each other big smiles and conpliment each one teeth. I love it and he does also.</li>
    <li> Please do not get duped by the fake 5 star reviews like I did! I purchased this kit after looking through reviews on Amazon while comparing whitening kits and this one seemed to have the best ratings/reviews. There I was, all excited about whitening and brightening my chompers, anxiously awaiting my package. Then it came. Inside the Amazon box was a beaten up, taped back together to \\&quot;look new\\&quot; box with the whitening kit in it. Red flag number one. Then, after reading the back of the box (the only directions with this sketchy box of chemicals, red flag number 2) I decided to look on Amazon to see if any of the other reviewers had had this issue. Boom. That&#x27;s when I saw all of the 1 star reviews. In my excitement and haste I had originally (and naively) skipped over the 1 star reviews because there were so many 5&#x27;s. I cannot stress this enough - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT IS A SCAM. Amazon, my sweet, sweet Amazon, please do not sell this ever again.</li>
    <li> Use the trays. It’s great. It’s way better than strips and I’m really happy with what has been happening in my mouth.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but my teeth are not as white as other people I know.  I don&#x27;t drink pop that often and the only coffee I drink is Starbucks frappuccino and latte (sometimes).  Anyway, I was sick of not having white teeth so I bought this product because it looks promising.  I tried it for less than a week and my teeth was whiter and look cleaner than anyone else.  This product also doesn&#x27;t cause my teeth to ache like some teeth whitener I have used in the past.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I always wanted to whiten my teeth. I drink coffee a lot and that is my big problem. I used to buy a lot of products, which promised a shiny teeth, but it always was a simple waste of money. I bought Brilliant Hd - PRO without a big hope to get a desired result, but in a several weeks I saw the difference. And my friends saw it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like the most about Brilliant Hd - PRO are the two things: 1) it doesn&#x27;t harm my teeth. I know that many of these products can make your teeth bleeding, but with usage of Brilliant Hd - PRO I&#x27;ve never had this problem. 2) The whole structure is very convenient, you can use it almost everyday and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This fixing alot of tough stains and grease from teeth very whitening its like oxy clean lol</li>
    <li> My teeth needed some serious whitening...and fast. I tried the cheaper products but as the old saying goes...you get what you pay for, or in my case you don&#x27;t get what you pay for. Still the price for this product isn&#x27;t too bad. the results? Got my pearly whites back and in a short time. If you want to try a great product...this is the one!</li>
    <li> This product has done wonders for my teeth whitening! I have tried many other teeth whitening products and nothing compares to Brilliant Hd Pro. Brilliant leaves my teeth shining and feeling clean. This product really helps combat my &amp;#34;smokers teeth&amp;#34; stains and helps me feel more confident.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this product to my friends and family and they have not stopped thanking me for it. There is no other product that can compete with the quality of Brilliant HD.</li>
    <li> Way to powerful!!!!  Maybe this would be good for clearing a clogged drain but not for putting in your mouth.  I Injured my gums badly after just several minutes.  A day later and my gums are still very sore and injured.  I threw the whole kit away - would never put that near my gums again!!!  Sure it&#x27;ll take the stains off your teeth and probably the rust of your old Chevy !!!</li>
    <li> Worst product.  It is so hard to use.  Doesn&#x27;t keep your teeth white more than a week or so.  I don&#x27;t know how it has so many positive reviews...Weird...</li>
    <li> Just Amazing. Brilliant Hd - PRO  is my choice for the simplest and most effective treatments for a teeth. It given my smile back.I am totally satisfied with it</li>
    <li> This thing totally works for us.&lt;br /&gt;Me and my family were using an old fashioned toothpaste which kind of changed the color of our teeth&lt;br /&gt;But Now after using this product I can laugh aloud speak anything expose my teeth .</li>
    <li> This product does what it&#x27;s supposed to - that being said it can make your teeth temporarily sensitive. I plan on using it again and using sensidyne at the same time to counter act the sensitivity.</li>
    <li> So my biggest concern with teeth whitening system is having senstive teeth. They are already and I didn&#x27;t want a product to make it worst. I was very surprised that I had no sensitivity after the application.  My teeth are noticeably whiter. I will be using it again.</li>
    <li> This product gave me a much whiter smile after just one use. My teeth were pretty bad and I had tried tons of stuff before finding this. If this didn&#x27;t  work I would have probably given up. I can&#x27;t  afford to pay for professional whitening so this has really saved the day. I found my teeth were a little more sensitive after using it,but not terribly so. I will probably buy this again in the future. The price was fair for the quality.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed by this product. I&#x27;ve tried many other whitening kits, and can honestly say Brilliant Hd - PRO out shines them all (literally!) It takes away years of deep rooted stains, and leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean. Brilliant Hd - PRO definitely came in handy when my husband and I decided to take some up to date family photos. Now I can put on a real smile and be confident knowing that my smile is brightening up a room for all the right reasons! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of whitening products, but this one seemed to work the best for me. It removed my nasty coffee stains that turned my teeth yellowish. You know which ones I&#x27;m talking about! There&#x27;s no way I am quitting coffee so thankfully Brilliant HD exists. My teeth look really white now, they seriously shine in photos!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions were easy to follow and the process didn&#x27;t take too long. My teeth felt a little sensitive after but it didn&#x27;t last so I was able to go on eating whatever I wanted. I ended up getting this kit for my brother as well as he was looking for a good whitening product. I wish I took a before and after!</li>
    <li> I am a long-time coffee drinker, former smoker, so I do a lot of teeth whitening. This product is one of my favorites. It is easy to use and mild on my gums and teeth (I have sensitivity issues.) Best of all, the results are excellent. My teeth are NOTICEABLY whiter. Maintenance whitening only takes a couple times per month. Well worth it especially since it is so easy to use and a good price.</li>
    <li> Loving Brilliant HD pro.  I received great results and I&#x27;ve been using about a week now. My teeth were stained pretty bad from drinking so much coffee. This whitening system has worked wonders. It&#x27;s easy-to-use and the price is awesome. Order ASAP!!</li>
    <li> GOT MY KIT IN THE MAIL TWO DAYS AGO LOOKS GOOD, PACKED GOOD, A+ SELLER. WILL USE AND REPORT BACK ON MY RESULTS. THANK U AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Strips kept falling out of my mouth. I used the strips by Crest and they really just kept slipping off my teeth. Brilliant Hd - PRO has a system where you stick a thing in your mouth so it’s just that much easier. You keep the mouth guard around like a toothbrush or something, like an appliance. I think it’s worth it to keep it around just based on ease of use.</li>
    <li> Drooling. It will happen while using this. Can&#x27;t be helped.  No idea why nobody else mentions this.  Otherwise, I think the product works great. This is my second time around buying it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of mouth trays. I get a teeth whitening every year from doctor. Hard times fell and I couldn&#x27;t afford the procedure this year. So I turned to this and what do you know, it works just as well. I may never pay for another expensive procedure again now that I know Brilliant HD exists.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have perfect teeth, and always have a hard time with products like this. This one, however, worked wonders. I was able to get the trays on easily, and so far, there is a huge improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. I&#x27;m very satisfied and recommend this product very highly!</li>
    <li> Guys care about white teeth too. So if you’re a lady don’t think you can just strut out there with your bodies. Teeth are a dealbreaker, if they’re bad. A few treatments with this product can up your game from a 6 to an 8, easy. Take it from me. I recommend this product because it’s cheap and easy to use and works well on top of that.</li>
    <li> I smoke cigarettes so my teeth have naturally become very yellowed over the years. I didn&#x27;t think anything could help my teeth become white like the way they were until I tried this product. I was astounded at the results I saw after just the first treatment! I can&#x27;t believe this product works so well and I am highly satisfied.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! The trays fit perfectly and my teeth are significantly whiter after using this product (and they say white!). I have tried to find other products like this in the past and this is by far the best one I have found. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Really liked this product.  Most over the counter products are not effective whitening my teeth but this one worked great!</li>
    <li> This product was able to get me the full white teeth smile that I have been longing for years. I always got noticed for my yellow teeth but now am getting noticed for a better reason. This product was able to make my smile one of a kind. I would recommend this product to anyone trying to get their smile a little more white.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a scam!feel pretty dumb. I usually check reviews more closely.</li>
    <li> I drink coffee... I eat ice cream... I eat candy... Yes all bad things for my teeth, but who doesn&#x27;t love to have sweets? My teeth ended up getting stained a bit and the dentist prescribed some strong toothpaste to whiten them up. Only problem is the paste taste HORRIBLE. I needed something effective and did not taste bad. I looked at Crest and Colgate and just seems to not work as well as this product. I always like to give things a try and this works with results seen in a week.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product! I&#x27;ve only been using bit for a week and I&#x27;m absolutely in love with my new teeth. I have brand new pearly whites and I love showing them off. I have recommended this product to all of my friends and family. Just be careful and do not get it on your gums! Worth every penny, you have a buyer for life!</li>
    <li> On this new year, I was invited to a very large party. And I had to look perfect. I decided to make a gift for myself and bought a brilliant HD! I was pleasantly surprised. My teeth have become a few shades whiter in just a few uses. I also very pleased with the ease of use. It is the best teeth whitening I used before</li>
    <li> I needed to find a whitening kit for my dad when I noticed that he’s teeth was yellow. I came across the Brilliant HD and he was very hesitant to use it. My dad is old school and very stubborn. It took another week after buying the Brilliant HD (Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit) before he finally gave in and tried it.  It’s been a month now and he’s teeth are looking really fantastic. He promised not to be so stubborn when I suggest something to him in the future. He’s smiling a lot more and he actually bought three more kits and gave them away to his friends.</li>
    <li> I just love this product! Since I started using it I&#x27;ve notice how my teeth have started getting really beautiful and white. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a product that can make your teeth white with a professional quality.</li>
    <li> This kit is superb! The tray is so easy to use, I looked around for teeth-whitening products and was recommended this one by my dentist, after only 2 treatments my teeth were so much whiter. My husband immediately complimented my teeth! I tried the Crest Whitestrips but these clearly are superior to those. Very affordable as well, a must buy for anyone wanting to whiten their teeth!</li>
    <li> This. Product. Is. Sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a smoker and big coffee drinker, so yellow stains on my teeth have always been a huge problem for me, especially since i spent thousands of dollars straightening them. Not even a trip to the dentist can bring back the white in my teeth. I&#x27;ve been using this for less than a week, and my teeth are already whiter than they&#x27;ve been in years! It&#x27;s super easy to use, barely takes any time, and makes a huge, immediate impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this my highest possible recommendation!</li>
    <li> This is so much better than Crest White Strips!!! The last time I used the Crest White Strips, my teeth were in ridiculous pain for the next two days. This is gentle enough to use and you will see results immediately. The best part about it is that I told my dentist about it and she agrees that it works amazing. I will buy again! Hopefully I will only have to use it 1-2 times a year.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful feeling! Seeing my teeth like they used to look after so many years is really a fantastic feeling. My teeth were probably never this white and I cannot remember them feeling so clean.  This kit was so easy to use and gave me such great results and more importantly I began seeing results almost immediately.  the best whitening buy I have ever made.  I have tried so many whitening solutions over the years.  None have really given me the results I expected or delivered what they promised.  Finally, thanks to Brilliant HD I have a solution that actually works and works well.</li>
    <li> For years, I have been looking for a product that would help whiten my teeth and remove years worth of stains. I work a full time job, so finding the time to go to the dentist was simply impossible. I have tried many different products from CVS/Walgreens/Target, etc. but I couldn&#x27;t find one that got the job done. As a last resort, I ordered this product. My only complaint is that I wish I found it sooner!    I used Brilliant HD for 10 minutes a day for 10 days, and I began seeing results after my FIRST use. I can honestly say that THIS is the only product that has worked for me. If you are like me, I recommend that you look no further and give this product a try. It really is a no brainer!</li>
    <li> My friend used it and suggested me to buy this product.Now I suggest everyone to buy this product, And say good bye to yellow teeth.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a top-notch teeth whitening product at an affordable cost, this is it! The Brilliant HD Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit whitened my teeth by a couple brighter shades in just one week of using it! This product was easy to implement and it was really affordable too. It is also completely safe because it uses the same ingredients that professional teeth cleaners use. I would recommend this product to anyone who has an insecurity about their colored teeth, because now, all I see is white!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the solution to whithen my teeth ..I often visit doctors and go for cleaning of teeth .But with in no time my teeth used to change color.And after much await found this beautiful kit through a friend.It really works wonder.After 2 weeks I have seen improvement in the color of my teeth .Very Happy with the product.Loved It.</li>
    <li> Excellent teeth whitening</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;ve tried many different kits through the years. The Brilliant HD Pro Teeth Whitening system has been the VERY best one in terms of effectiveness when it comes to my stubborn coffee stains. I know I&#x27;ve found my product. Finally. No more wasting money on ones that don&#x27;t work. Brilliant HD Works!!</li>
    <li> I have spent so many years trying to find an at-home whitening system that really works. All of the money I&#x27;ve spent on useless products probably would have more than paid for a professional session with a dentist, in fact. Finally, I&#x27;ve found something to combat my tea drinking and smoking and give me back a dazzling smile! I noticed real results from Brilliant HD Pro Whitening after one use; a week later and my teeth were several shades whiter. Most importantly (to me anyway), I wasn&#x27;t left cringing from hot or cold beverages like other whitening products. The price is right - you have to spend twice as much on those whitening strips for half the results.</li>
    <li> I have never used a product so effect like this one. I am a huge coffee drinker, as well as smoker, what makes it worse is I am always in the light. I am always doing music videos and photo shoots, so trying to hide the yellow/brown teeth can be a big challenge to hide. I saw results the first go around. The next one was even more impressive, now I dont have anything to hide and my teeth are the light. I still smoke and drink coffee and no one can tell.</li>
    <li> Seriously works! Better than any over the counter teeth whitening products from the store!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: No flimsy thin strips to put on your teeth, works in a manner of hours! Lasts through coffee, lipstick, or any other stains you may get through a daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Nothing so far! I have been using these for 1 week and can already see a difference that I can also feel in my smile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product is as it say it is and I would HIGHLY recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing Teeth Whitening Kit! My smile is so much brighter. I drink coffee, tea, smoke, and this whitened my teeth right up fast. No more stains, no more yellow. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Being this wasn&#x27;t my first time ordering a teeth whitening kit, it wasn&#x27;t that I was totally skeptical, I know they work, just how well? It was that I couldn&#x27;t get past the aftertaste that most strips/kits ended up leaving behind that I could end up tasting for a few hours afterwards and that some ended up not whitening as well as advertised. Well I go ahead and try it out like any other, then I come to realize the taste is more or less a neutral one at that. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a after taste as I first thought. Just as stated containing peroxide, that&#x27;s about all I ended up tasting afterwards, was a cleanly inert feel and taste to my teeth after I was done compared to the others I&#x27;ve experienced in the past. I&#x27;ve also noticed my teeth to be a lot whiter and cleaner look to them then when using crest and other brands.</li>
    <li> This product by far out does Crest in my books. This was so easy to use. Brilliant Hd Pro Teeth Whitening Kit is easy to use &amp;#62; they Tray fits my mouth perfectly and doesnt make my mouth hurt like some trays i have tried. My teeth can be sensitive to whitening at times but with this I had no sensetivity to the product or application and I was able to do use the product for the whole length of the time.I feel like I can smile a whole lot more now that I dont have stains showing on my teeth. I will be using the product again as it helps my teeth look great.</li>
    <li> For years I have been making my teeth look horrible.  I smoke cigars, drink multiple coffees per day, and am an avid wine snob.  My teeth were starting to look pretty nasty and I needed a change.  I started to look into different teeth whitening options.  I didn&#x27;t really want to spend a lot of money so going to the dentist was out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried out a few different lower cost options like trays, strips, and toothpaste.  Some of them worked, some were less impressive, but nothing worked like the Brilliant HD Pro trays.  I popped these guys in expecting the same blah results from everything else and was pleasantly surprised that my teeth were noticeably whiter.  I went to a wedding last weekend and a couple people even asked me what I was using to make my teeth so white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend the Brilliant HD Teeth Whitening Kit to anyone looking for a brighter smile.  This stuff works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a smoker for some time know and a friend recommended this to me I was skeptic at first cause I had tried a lot of things before but this has worked awesome for me no only does it get your teeth white it helps them stay white! I recommend this to all smokers or individuals just trying to get white teeth!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best teeth whitening products I have ever tried. After using you can see the results almost immediately and there is no harsh aftertaste after using. I love the affordable price and love that you can purchase it online.</li>
    <li> I had tried so many products which promised killer smiles and pearly whites. Instead I received painful teeth and glue that took forever to get off.  After complaining to my hygienist,  she recommended this product saying that it was not false advertisement and will be a safe and efficient way to whiten my teeth. I went on amazon immediately on my phone and saw the discounted price and had to buy it. Within a few days this product became my daily beauty regime. I feel confident and beautiful. I flash my killer smile without thinking twice. I can tell you that this product is worth a try and can lighten your teeth a few shades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve whitened my teeth so much that I think I qualify as a teeth-whitening professional.I have noticed a huge difference in my teeth, Brilliant Hd has done the job.</li>
    <li> This is a very simple and effective solution to stained teeth! Anyone who has paid a visit to the dentist for whitening treatment knows how tedious and costly it can be. The fact that this kit gives you the power to do it at home at your own time is in itself a blessing!&lt;br /&gt;The trays are very easy to use and do not hurt your gums at all! And the results afterwards are surprisingly professional. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> I was concerned that my not exactly yellow but not bright and healthy looking teeth were sending the wrong message to people at my job, possibly that I was unhygienic. So I decided to do something about that. This kit is relatively easy to use. After a week I did see a difference in the brightness of my teeth which I am very happy about and I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;ve been smiling more which probably makes me look more approachable and confident so that&#x27;s a great plus. My teeth were a bit sensitive for a couple hours after I first starting using the trays but the sensation didn&#x27;t stick around so I&#x27;m not concerned about it.</li>
    <li> I was concerned about my smile looking perfect for the pictures at my sisters wedding, so I decided to give brilliant hd- pro a chance. And I can honestly say I was I&#x27;m pressed by how white and beautiful it made my teeth.  I love this whitener way more than any others I&#x27;ve tried and would recommend it to anyone who wants a show stopper smile.</li>
    <li> Ive been drinking coffee since I was a teenager so I have some tooth stains. A friend told me that they had tried this product and it worked for them so I decided to give it a shot. Within less than a week I saw a noticeable difference and my teeth appear whiter. By the second week coworkers were complimenting me asking me what I was using. Im very happy with the results and its cheaper and less scary than the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trays are comfortable to use and the gel is decent tasting. I think for what you get from it the price is a good value, now Im not afraid to smile anymore!</li>
    <li> I got this for my brother. As an avid coffee drinker and smoker  his teeth have seen better days, but after about a week or two of use we all began to see the difference! His teeth are noticeably whiter and are becoming more and more stainless every day with continual use. Amazing product, and he will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> More time consuming than I expected.</li>
    <li> I am big on Innovations and scientific breakthroughs and this Teeth Whitening Kit is one such breakthrough I have been anxiously waiting on. Let me be frank - From years of using teething whitening products I was sorely disappointed that for such a major problem no one could really develop a product that actually work. I had almost given up when a friend said to me, hey! have you tried Brilliant HD PRO Teeth Whitening Kit? I shrugged at him because of my past experiences but he promised to pay me back if it didnt work or I will pay him if it did - well I am writing this review so you know what was the outcome!! Thanks to this product I am whiter than ever before.</li>
    <li> Rip off. The PRO kit is exactly the same as the Deluxe kit, just $6 more expensive. Don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
    <li> I have been comparing different whitening products for a while, and this has been the most effective one I have encountered! It completely removes all stains from my teeth, and makes them so white I can almost not believe it! With only two uses of these trays, I have noticed an incredible change in my smile! The price is so much better than going to a dentist, and I could not imagine any better results! The trays are easy to use, and the whitening gel stays put and does not leak into the rest of your mouth, which other products tend to do. The gel also tastes much better than others, fresh and minty! It is such an easy, painless process and my teeth look incredible. I would certainly recommend these trays over all other ones I have tried!</li>
    <li> Works good. The trays fit my teeth nicely. Other teeth whitening trays rubbed my gums, causing sensitivity and redness. My teeth are light yellow, so only a few treatments are needed to make them white once again. I am a coffee and Coca-Cola drinker, so if you share my drinking interests, this may be a good solution.</li>
    <li> I am an avid smoker and this habit had taken its toll on my teeth I tried other methods and it seemed like i was just throwing money in the garbage can... of course the dentist was an option but it was very expensive and I knew there were other options out there. I started looking for different things and this item called my attention. I used it for 15 days and found little difference, is it bad? no not really i think it does ok but i expected more for my buck if you know what i mean. i would recomend it if you had little to no stains... like no horrible bad teeth.. I had them ok but not shinny white,,, and like i said... little difference... i expected more...</li>
    <li> LOVED this whitener! Took about 2 weeks to notice a difference, but as used continuously works really well! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Ok product, but trays are somewhat difficult to get a good fit. I have heated and reheated the trays and I am still not happy with the fit. The gel is typical whitening gel (I have used before), but be careful about getting it on your gums. Due to not getting the trays correctly fitted, I slightly burned a portion of my gums. I will continued to fit the trays, but if unsuccessful will opt to get another product/service that takes impressions and custom makes the trays.</li>
    <li> Can you say platinum white?  I&#x27;ve tried the whitening strips but don&#x27;t think that I will go back since the Brilliant Hd trays work wonders.  My teeth haven&#x27;t been whiter and I have never received so many compliments before.  What&#x27;s more is that it is made in the USA.  God bless america and god bless these whitening trays.  Don&#x27;t hesitiate to give this a try.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and actually works. I&#x27;ve tried many whitening products, including strips and I definitely prefer this. I had fast results with very minimal sensitivity.</li>
    <li> The best teeth whitening kit I&#x27;ve ever had, in my life! My teeth are as bright as gold, it doesn&#x27;t have any after effects (hurting teeth etc) the perfect kit for me, I recommend you get this!</li>
    <li> This is the best teeth whitener I have found so far. Easy to use tray and its comfortable to wear. The biggest thing for me is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive after use like the crest strips do. Even my sister complimented how noticeably white my smile looked after I hadn&#x27;t seen her in about a week.  Definitely recommend!</li>
