      <li>For the first time in over 20 years my eyebrows look great and natural.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Maybelle brow gel too &amp; compared to this product - it wins!</li>
      <li>Color is perfect, just the right blend of black and brown.</li>
      <li>It works well to fill in light spots, blends nicely, looks natural.</li>
      <li>It looked good but it sometimes would show on her skin as as too red.</li>
      <li>daughter who has lovely red hair and very light blond brows was using the Auburn color up until now.</li>
      <li>Love this product, perfect for summer wear (and possible melt down).</li>
      <li>At first sight, I though the sable color was too light, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
      <li>This is fine with me as I really try to avoid the &#x27;Joan Crawford&#x27; look.  </li>
      <li>its a bit watery but really good produce , one morning application last the whole day .....</li>
      <li>lasts longer than an eyebrow pencil, with much more natural looking results.  </li>
      <li>Based on other Amazon reviews she is now using the Blond gel and it looks really, really good.</li>
      <li>mousse is just right texture and color to keep my brows in check and looking presentable.</li>
      <li>easy to apply, and very natural looking.  </li>
      <li>This product consistency is not bad, but the color is much lighter than shown.  </li>
      <li>First time I&#x27;ve tried this type of thing.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that you need to have a light touch to have it appear natural.  </li>
      <li>This was the first brow tinted gel I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>My eyebrows are very thin and the sable shade blended in perfectly with my medium/dark brown hair.  </li>
      <li>Easily applied, brushed on, and really defines &amp; improves your brows as they fade lighter &amp; lighter.</li>
      <li>It really works and looks super natural if you use an eyebrow brush across the brows after the tint dries.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re only using it for hair, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Little pricey but worth it to look natural</li>
      <li>Glops at the very end of the brush.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much for your product.</li>
      <li>The color is okay - but once applied, it is darker than I expected.</li>
      <li>Went back to the powders, it looks more natural.  </li>
      <li>Very nice thin application, which allows for desired shaping.</li>
      <li>Faded brows make you look older.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this brow tint.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>My brows are naturally thin, light colored and fine.  </li>
      <li>The Sable shade looks very natural on my brows.  </li>
      <li>My brows look natural, not done or drawn in.</li>
      <li>Takes seconds to apply looks natural Dznt smear at all.  </li>
      <li>I think the smooth brush will give more control to make a thinner less dramatic look.</li>
      <li>With a little care and practice, the application is easy and long wearing.  </li>
      <li>The only thing i would change, or at least have an option of, is to make a smooth eyeliner type brush  to accompany the mascara type.</li>
      <li>The mascara type brush is definitely good for combing the eyebrows; but a little hard to control from not making brow too wide.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that the brush is too big and chunky to apply to fine hairs.  </li>

<li> This product did just as I expected.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the consistency of this brow makeup.  It covers just enough and doesn&#x27;t go on too thickly.  My only complaint is that the brush is too big and chunky to apply to fine hairs.  I actually use it with another, smaller brush.</li>
    <li> This product came in a timely manner and I am very satisfied with it.  I wanted something that I could use on my eyebrows that would not leave a heavy line - this works!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this!  It doesn&#x27;t get stiff like mascara--easy to use and even sweat proof.</li>
    <li> Brow tint is a must for me.  As I have aged, my brows are thinning, lighter and those few I have are unruly.  This tinted brow mascara is perfect to fill in without that drawn on look.  Helps the shape too.  Will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this brow tint.  It did a wonderful job covering the gray without looking painted on and made my brows look beautiful. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This review should be for the color Fawn not sable.  Disappointed in this color.  My eyebrows are black with a few grey but I didn&#x27;t want to add to the black brows by adding more harsh black so I ordered fawn.  Wrong choice.  Way too dark.  I actually looked at the wand thinking they may have sent me the wrong color because this is black. really, really black.  Unable to use and afraid to reorder and won&#x27;t because of the cost.  Think twice before purchasing as colors are not true.</li>
    <li> Goes on easily &amp; makes my brows look fuller and gets rid of the gray!</li>
    <li> I like the product but the color has too much red in it. Need a dark brunette that&#x27;s dark brown/black.</li>
    <li> easy to apply, and very natural looking.  Wipe excess off brush before applying to avoid blobs of color.  lasts longer than an eyebrow pencil, with much more natural looking results.  love it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I have been looking for a good eyebrow filler and darkener, and, until this, have always had to resort to pencil.  I have even tried eyebrow dyes.  This is by far the best solution to the problem thinningm fading eyebrows.  I goes on well and lasts a long time.Thanks!</li>
    <li> I just love the brow tint!!  It really works and looks super natural if you use an eyebrow brush across the brows after the tint dries.  My brows are naturally thin, light colored and fine.  This is just the right solution!!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Keep in mind that you need to have a light touch to have it appear natural.  This is fine with me as I really try to avoid the &#x27;Joan Crawford&#x27; look.  Mainly, I want to color the greys and darken just a little.  It stays in place well and washes off easily when I remove my makeup.  I was happy to find this product and recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is great for my sparse brows, when used with a pencil.  The only drawback I encountered was with the spooly  The spooly is too big to apply with precision  If the spooly was smaller like that of the Benefit brow gel it would be 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Does everything it promises!  I&#x27;ve never used any eyebrow product until I saw a couple of gray hairs starting to pop.  Since my eyebrows are dark, and I&#x27;ve never used a pencil, I was at a loss on how to deal with those gray strands.  At first sight, I though the sable color was too light, but it&#x27;s not.  It is a natural, dark color when applied . . . not that rough black look.  With a little care and practice, the application is easy and long wearing.  Haven&#x27;t tried it on gray roots, since that&#x27;s not too bad of a problem, but I&#x27;m sure it would work on that as well.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> Glops at the very end of the brush.  It just doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
    <li> This is the product I have been waiting for. My eyebrows are turning white!  I needed a quick and effective way to hide those whites.&lt;br /&gt;This product is the perfect answer.  It is not too dark (I had to avoid the Eddie Munster look) goes on easily, no flaking and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I have a mix of dark brown and gray hair.  The Sable shade looks very natural on my brows.  A very lite touch works best.  The gel stays where I put it, yet it is easy to remove when I wash my face.  I will order this gel again.</li>
    <li> The color and application was not what I was expecting. The application is messy because the wand is not easy to use.  I&#x27;ll stick with my eyebrow powder and brush that I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> This product did just as I expected.  It is used to fill in my eyebrows.  The color matches perfectly and stays on until it is washed off.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Not bad! First time I&#x27;ve tried this type of thing. It works well to fill in light spots, blends nicely, looks natural. I&#x27;m practicing application so I don&#x27;t smear it one my skin, but if you just hit the hair it works great!</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for your product. Love it! My brows have been getting a little sparse and this is just what this mommy needed!</li>
    <li> A little darker than expected for my eyebrows but it is perfect to cover my gray hair.  All in all I like it.</li>
    <li> This brow mascara is amazing.  I was horrified when my brows started turning gray and plucking them was not an option....this is a lifesaver!</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are very thin and the sable shade blended in perfectly with my medium/dark brown hair.  Would definately purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This was the first brow tinted gel I&#x27;ve used.  I like it.  I purchased the Maybelle brow gel too &amp; compared to this product - it wins!</li>
    <li> This product consistency is not bad, but the color is much lighter than shown.  You have to let it get dry, dry, dry or it will rub off.  I have heavy brows that are losing their color so I need a good tint . . . and I still haven&#x27;t found one.  Gonna keep looking.</li>
    <li> They stopped selling the eyebrow mousse I used to buy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve looked in all the drug stores in town.&lt;br /&gt;So thrilled to find this.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t bear to pluck my straggly, graying, eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;This mousse is just right texture and color to keep my brows in check and looking presentable.</li>
    <li> I liked the ease of use and excellent results. I was so pleased that I gave one of the two I ordered to my daughter and she loved it. Now we are both recommending it to other people that we know</li>
    <li> Works great.  I use it to cover partially white brows.  Takes seconds to apply looks natural Dznt smear at all.  Also use it as touch up on roots super easy looks great,  better than anything I&#x27;ve tried that&#x27;s made ESP for roots.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> For the first time in over 20 years my eyebrows look great and natural. I&#x27;ve turned my sister onto it, too. Please never stop making it!</li>
    <li> This wand is not usable on eyebrows - you end up with a mess, just way too big.  If you&#x27;re only using it for hair, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Color is perfect, just the right blend of black and brown. Does not run or smear. The only thing i would change, or at least have an option of, is to make a smooth eyeliner type brush  to accompany the mascara type. I think the smooth brush will give more control to make a thinner less dramatic look. The mascara type brush is definitely good for combing the eyebrows; but a little hard to control from not making brow too wide. After i&#x27;m done, i take my fingers or Q-tip to make thinner. Would definitely buy again though.</li>
    <li> Got sick and tired coloring eyebrows, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It covers the white superbly, and keeps until washed. Very nice thin application, which allows for desired shaping. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Here, at last! Love this product, perfect for summer wear (and possible melt down).</li>
    <li> Not too heavy like some I&#x27;ve tried.  Wish the brush was a little smaller like Benefit.  I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Product is just as described.  I am pleased.</li>
    <li> Love this! I will purchase again; however, I will go a little lighter. The color is okay - but once applied, it is darker than I expected. I do love this easy to apply tint!</li>
    <li> Faded brows make you look older. They define your face and this gel is perfect. I brush it on and let it sit for a bit I apply the rest of my makeup. I then blot it and then swipe it off (most of it stays on the hair) I then use a dry brush to gently brush what remains on my skin to thin it out so it doesn&#x27;t look crumbly. My brows look natural, not done or drawn in. I&#x27;ve got chestnut colored hair w/ highlights and I use Sable but... this may be too dark for some but since I swipe some off it is perfect. Work with it to get the application down. .&lt;br /&gt;My daughter who has lovely red hair and very light blond brows was using the Auburn color up until now. It looked good but it sometimes would show on her skin as as too red. Based on other Amazon reviews she is now using the Blond gel and it looks really, really good. She&#x27;s very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Little pricey but worth it to look natural and it lasts a long time. Thank you Mommy Makeup.</li>
    <li> its a bit watery but really good produce , one morning application last the whole day .....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s darker than on the picture ( I got Sable). Also it doesn&#x27;t shape the eye brow, just colors it.&lt;br /&gt;So you get messy, dark brow that smudges.</li>
    <li> Applied three times in an hour, didn&#x27;t stay on even though I never touched eyebrows after application. Tried several times with same affect. Threw it away.</li>
    <li> Great product! Highly recommend. Easily applied, brushed on, and really defines &amp; improves your brows as they fade lighter &amp; lighter.</li>
    <li> I Love this product.  Works great</li>
    <li> It was clumpy and the color was off and I really was not impressed at all with this product.  Went back to the powders, it looks more natural.  This makes you look like you put mascara on your eyebrows!!!</li>
