<li> Flossing is essential to good health, but I hate reducing the circulation in my fingers and reaching far back into my mouth with my fingers.&lt;br</li>
<li> These flossers go into a handle that is long and allows the user to reach the back of the mouth.</li>
<li> That said, I hope that they continue to make this for a long time.  </li>
<li> I give them as gifts to folks who cannot use regular dental floss, or the tiny short flossers due to physical limitations that do not allow holding such a short, thin product.  </li>
<li> Product was what I expected.</li>
<li> That is due to these flossers.  </li>
<li> All in less than one year...  </li>
<li> It is getting increasingly difficult to find at retail outlets (especially the non-minted variety).</li>
<li> I would hate to go back to less convenient methods.  </li>
<li> In the store these are very expensive.</li>
<li> hate it when manufactures discontinue things that I like, so I buy these in bulk.  </li>
<li> one of these days after I&#x27;ve been in some nasty places I am going to tell her, &amp;#34;You sit here and let me place my hands in your mouth ...</li>
<li> I work and get my hands in nasty places...</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t like the mint and can only get these on the internet.  I work and get my hands in nasty places...my dental hygienist is always asking me to place my hands in my mouth...one of these days after I&#x27;ve been in some nasty places I am going to tell her, &amp;#34;You sit here and let me place my hands in your mouth ...then she will know!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Neuropathy and spinal cord injuries limit fine motor skills in the hand. I used to buy these locally, but can&#x27;t find them now. I give them as gifts to folks who cannot use regular dental floss, or the tiny short flossers due to physical limitations that do not allow holding such a short, thin product.  These flossers go into a handle that is long and allows the user to reach the back of the mouth.</li>
    <li> I really like the unflavored floss sticks best. Couldn&#x27;t find these in the stores anywhere. Thank you for these being available.</li>
    <li> Use of these flossers is certainly one of the essential steps int maintaining good dental health as specified by my dentist</li>
    <li> I like these flossers very much.  They are effective and they involve much less plastic going into the environment than is the case with other flossers that I have seen.  I plan to keep ordering them, and I would recommend them to others.</li>
    <li> See the evaluation for the last seller feedback for additional comments.  Don&#x27;t stop selling this because it is the only one I can use and it helps clear my teeth well after brushing as I build plaque and calcium really fast.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in the stores locally.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to order them in &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; and not have to pay outrages prices for them!  It was also nice to receive the exact product that I thought I was going to...thanks!</li>
    <li> Always a winner. I have been using Reach for years.</li>
    <li> My dentists over the years have repeatedly stressed the importance of flossing.  I have never been able to floss correctly.  I end up with trying to cram my hands into my mouth with the ultimate result that I would give up and just rely on interdental brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the flosser handle and the refills, I have made my dentist and me very happy with the results.  From, six 4&#x27;s and three 5&#x27;s to three 4&#x27;s and one 5 to one 4 and no 5&#x27;s.  All in less than one year...  Yea!!</li>
    <li> Received product prior to promised date. Product was what I expected.</li>
    <li> In stores it is difficult to find the regular, most store sell the mint and the mint causes gum irritation for me, so I was totally elated in finding these!</li>
    <li> We use these on a daily basis. In the store these are very expensive. By buying the pack of 6 you save yourself some money.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time , and it was easier to get through amazon, very easy to use and comfortable too.</li>
    <li> I have used this product effectively, for years. It is getting increasingly difficult to find at retail outlets (especially the non-minted variety). Thanks for making available to me.</li>
    <li> I think it is great to be able to order these flossers on the internet rather than pay the big prices at the drug store.  i would recommend these to anyone, the dentist now says I have a great dental care routine going and that I  should keep it up.  That is due to these flossers.  Get a handle and order some, they are great!</li>
    <li> Still the best but getting hard to find</li>
    <li> Love them and the price is fantastic compared to store prices.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for these for a while and finally found them here. Got them quick and just as described.</li>
    <li> Flossing is essential to good health, but I hate reducing the circulation in my fingers and reaching far back into my mouth with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this unflavored type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate it when manufactures discontinue things that I like, so I buy these in bulk.  That said, I hope that they continue to make this for a long time.  I would hate to go back to less convenient methods.  Buying in bulk also saves on shipping.
