      <li>Now, if I could just find an amazing eyeliner...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok doesn&#x27;t have a curve like the picture shows but still good.</li>
      <li>To each his (her) own.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nice, but not out of this world.</li>
      <li>but I rather liked it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of many types of maybelline products including foundation, finishing powder, concealer, and eye shadows!!</li>
      <li>it is normal, volume is not the best</li>
      <li>I would have liked more volume and length</li>
      <li>and I loved it so much I bought my own !</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many mascaras and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Makes  my lashes look luscious and I feel sexy, Maybelline has done it again.</li>
      <li>The gel is nice and smooth and coats evenly.  </li>
      <li>It does what it says it does, with the most lengthening and thickening I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
      <li>but it worked OK.</li>
      <li>I love how my eyelashes look.</li>
      <li>it is ok, i was waiting a better mascara bat</li>
      <li>I love maybelline.</li>
      <li>I love this one</li>
      <li>The wand is ok, but feels kinda cheap with the bristles, but it&#x27;s doable :)</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump and was easy to wash off with a make up wipe.</li>
      <li>and I can easily get my metal eyelash comb through it to separate my lashes.</li>
      <li>I find that it doesn&#x27;t come off easy when I wash my face with Dove soap -- but a dab of coconut oil does the trick to get it off.</li>
      <li>It stays put all day and comes off easy.</li>
      <li>Pretty good mascara over all and not a bad price.  </li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m going out at night as well I&#x27;ll touch it up, but otherwise it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>Amazon subscribe and save make this super affordable!</li>
      <li>As I have short lashes, this product has done a great job of bringing them out and making them appear longer.  </li>
      <li>By far my favorite mascara, and everyone I tell about it ends up loving it as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really nice mascara if you want to look natural but have twice as many lashes.</li>
      <li>, removal isn&#x27;t as easy so use the right products.</li>
      <li>As promised, this mascara has a Mega Plush brush that holds just the right amount of mascara!</li>
      <li>I bet you&#x27;ll like it as much as I do. :)</li>
      <li>I use Philosophy&#x27;s Purity, warm water and an unscented baby wipe for sensitive skin for makeup removal.  </li>
      <li>How ingenious!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on a mission to find the best mascara available (keeping in mind everybody&#x27;s lashes are different with different needs), but I think this would work for anybody.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last FOREVER, but it&#x27;s good all day, which is all I want.</li>
      <li>I have mild trichotillomania, which is an obsessive compulsive disorder where I sometimes pull out my eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best layered when still wet, but a second coat goes on surprisingly well over dry if you get distracted.</li>
      <li>but it was worth a try</li>
      <li>Maybelline wins every time.</li>
      <li>Other that it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>The mascara is not clumpy and the design of the brush is very user friendly.</li>
      <li>This mascara does exactly what it&#x27;s called, creates plush like eyelashes.</li>
      <li>My eyelashes aren&#x27;t short, I was looking for more volume.</li>
      <li>nothing is wrong everything is perfect.</li>
      <li>OK, enough of this therapy session.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s not the waterproof version, I checked twice), so I have to use makeup remover on top of regular face washing.</li>
      <li>which this mascara manages to fill in pretty well.</li>
      <li>First of all I didn&#x27;t get mega volume at all.</li>
      <li>I also like to use 1-2 coats of the regular formula, and a coat of the waterproof formula to top it off.  </li>
      <li>I love this mascara I already have long lashes</li>
      <li>Not the best mascara ever, but I like it because it doesn&#x27;t dry to a hard crust</li>
      <li>This really gives volume and length to your lashes, but with a weightless feel</li>
      <li>I bought this mascara to try because I usually really like Maybelline mascara.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also VERY BUILDABLE.  </li>
      <li>; it really means it.  </li>
      <li>(so i don&#x27;t feel the need to pull on them as much).  </li>
      <li>Big fail Maybelline, If you definitely want a Maybelline mascara then I think you would find better results with the Maybelline Colossal that one is good!</li>
      <li>The huge bristles in the middle of the brush cause the mascara to mark my upper lid in a very gothic way - so I have to clean it off...</li>
      <li>Thanks to the flexible shaft that holds the brush, I can&#x27;t accidentally &amp;#34;scrape&amp;#34; off mascara at the tips of my lashes, so I get more length from this mascara than any other I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
      <li>like the gel formulas and find them superior to the old school creams that go on thick and clump.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This time I got a washable one since I wear contacts and that&#x27;s a little better for me to get off my lashes at night</li>
      <li>I like how it doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes hard but still volumizes and lengthens nicely.</li>
      <li>but it is normal</li>
      <li>Maybe after a few more months I will revise to 5 stars</li>
      <li>Since we all have different hair/lashes/features we might not have the same experience but so far, this is my favorite drug-store</li>
      <li>It always feels like I have a loose eyelash, so I&#x27;m constantly tugging on them, so they fall out more.  </li>
      <li>I like Maybelline&#x27;s New York Volume Express mascara</li>
      <li>The key is to use the flat side first, to make your lashes really long, and then the pointier side to add more mascara if you want it darker.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m usually not that picky with mascaras</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara and am on my second tube.  </li>
      <li>One coat gives me a natural look and two coats give me a ton of length.  </li>
      <li>I only gave it as much as 3 stars because I have a friend who loves it.</li>
      <li>I like also that my lashes stay soft when I use it, in stead of getting crunchy.</li>
      <li>It took me twice as long to apply because you can&#x27;t really &amp;#34;dig in&amp;#34; with the rubbery wand.</li>
      <li>For less than 10 bucks it is totally worth it.</li>
      <li>For less than 10 bucks it is totally worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super lightweight because it&#x27;s kind of a mousse, and I can build several layers to get the look I want without ending up with a bunch of icky thick clumps.</li>
      <li>My natural eyelashes are blonde, thin, but they have a little length to them so for me, this product is great.  </li>
      <li>I naturally have short lashes so for someone who has naturally long lashes, I could see this working very well for them.</li>
      <li>If anything it weighed down my curl and defeated the whole purpose of a mascara.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t so much that I get clumps (at all), and there isn&#x27;t so little that I need to put on 3 or 4 coats to see the mascara.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I finally found it my holy grail mascara! It&#x27;s super lightweight because it&#x27;s kind of a mousse, and I can build several layers to get the look I want without ending up with a bunch of icky thick clumps. It&#x27;s wonderful and I&#x27;ve purchased it for friends to show them how awesome it is!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many mascaras and this is by far the best. The brush is fluffy and triangular. The key is to use the flat side first, to make your lashes really long, and then the pointier side to add more mascara if you want it darker. It stays well, but also rinses off with water and maybe a little soap. I like also that my lashes stay soft when I use it, in stead of getting crunchy. I forget I&#x27;m wearing it. It&#x27;s best layered when still wet, but a second coat goes on surprisingly well over dry if you get distracted. It doesn&#x27;t last FOREVER, but it&#x27;s good all day, which is all I want. If I&#x27;m going out at night as well I&#x27;ll touch it up, but otherwise it&#x27;s fine. It doesn&#x27;t flake, or get on anything once it&#x27;s dry. By far my favorite mascara, and everyone I tell about it ends up loving it as well. It does what it says it does, with the most lengthening and thickening I&#x27;ve ever seen. (Falsies is also good but I&#x27;m allergic).</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara to try because I usually really like Maybelline mascara.  This mascara goes on with little to no clumping, and it separates lashes and coats evenly. The only problem that I have with it is that after a few hours it starts to wipe off onto the skin under your eyes and creates dark circle look.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and I&#x27;ve noticed this every single time.  Other that it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Not the best mascara ever, but I like it because it doesn&#x27;t dry to a hard crust and I can easily get my metal eyelash comb through it to separate my lashes. The brush is too big to use on my bottom lashes without getting all over my face, so I use the Maybelline mascara that has the 2 different brushes (which is horrible for my upper lashes) for my bottom.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s nice, but not out of this world. 2 coats look a bit clumpy. The brush itself is very uncomfortable and pokes me in the eye. The huge bristles in the middle of the brush cause the mascara to mark my upper lid in a very gothic way - so I have to clean it off... Does not provide any extra plushy or voluminous feel/look. It does elongate my lashes, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing revolutionary about the gel-mousse formula either. It&#x27;s just a mascara, and yes, it did clump my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;It does not come off with my regular face wash - it just gets smeared around the eyes (it&#x27;s not the waterproof version, I checked twice), so I have to use makeup remover on top of regular face washing.</li>
    <li> Makes  my lashes look luscious and I feel sexy, Maybelline has done it again.</li>
    <li> This item is very good. I used my friends before and I loved it so much I bought my own ! Very good.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara and am on my second tube.  I discard every 4-6 weeks so I have been using this for almost two months.  I have used Buxom, Guerlain Maxi Lash, Dior, Two-Faced and a lot of very expensive brands as well as many drug-store brands.  When I splurge I use Guerlain or Buxom but I think I might prefer this 6 dollar tube to those 26-40 something dollar tubes... Jury is still out on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the gel formulas and find them superior to the old school creams that go on thick and clump.  The gel is nice and smooth and coats evenly.  Some complained about the brush but I rather liked it.  To each his (her) own.  One coat gives me a natural look and two coats give me a ton of length.  I hate false eyelashes and find this and the Buxom mascara to give me the most length and volume.  My natural eyelashes are blonde, thin, but they have a little length to them so for me, this product is great.  Since we all have different hair/lashes/features we might not have the same experience but so far, this is my favorite drug-store brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, removal isn&#x27;t as easy so use the right products. This might be where others have experienced breakage and loss of lashes. I use Philosophy&#x27;s Purity, warm water and an unscented baby wipe for sensitive skin for makeup removal.  I have ultra-sensitive skin and eyes and haven&#x27;t had issues so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Dior I experienced flaking - none of that with this mascara.  I apply in the morning and don&#x27;t need any touch-ups throughout the day.  I hesitate to give five stars because, while this works great, I know I am wearing it. The Rimmel London Lash Accelerator doesn&#x27;t give volume or length but it feels like I am not wearing anything.  I used this as a comparison because that mascara would be my go-to on days I don&#x27;t wear make-up but just want to throw on mascara and go.  Every other day I would grab the Maybelline Volume Express.  All-in-all, a solid 4 stars.  Maybe after a few more months I will revise to 5 stars but I want to wait and see if I experience any of the lash breakage others have experienced.  For less than 10 bucks it is totally worth it. Now, if I could just find an amazing eyeliner...e to 5 stars but I want to wait and see if I experience any of the lash breakage others have experienced.  For less than 10 bucks it is totally worth it. Now, if I could just find an amazing eyeliner...</li>
    <li> I wanted a mascara to add length and volume and after some research I decided on this one. I&#x27;m not sure what my expectations were for a $5 mascara that&#x27;s called Mega Plush but it worked OK. It&#x27;s isn&#x27;t a miracle mascara so forget that expectation but it did add some volume and length. It doesn&#x27;t clump and was easy to wash off with a make up wipe. I would have liked more volume and length so I probably wouldn&#x27;t order this again but it was worth a try and I will use the entire tube. I naturally have short lashes so for someone who has naturally long lashes, I could see this working very well for them. For short lashes I would suggest one to look elsewhere to get what they are looking for.</li>
    <li> This is a great inexpensive mascara. I use 1 to several layers to achieve the look I&#x27;m going for. I like how it doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes hard but still volumizes and lengthens nicely. I prefer this mascara over Maybelline&#x27;s Falsies.</li>
    <li> Not a fan. My eyelashes stick together in spiky clumps. Not enough separation for my liking. Several coats will give you a lot of volume but also left black marks under my eyes repeatedly... for a while. My eyelashes aren&#x27;t short, I was looking for more volume. I ended up looking like I had about 6 very thick, &amp;#34;plush&amp;#34; eyelashes on each eye. I only gave it as much as 3 stars because I have a friend who loves it. So I figure it&#x27;s not junk, just not for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to be negative and I&#x27;m usually not that picky with mascaras but this one was absolutely horrible. The wand was awkward to control due to the bend and it would end up making a big mess onto my eyelid. Not to mention it did almost nothing to my lashes except darken them slightly. If anything it weighed down my curl and defeated the whole purpose of a mascara. Save your money and do NOT buy this.</li>
    <li> I love maybelline. This mascara only further proved why I do. This time I got a washable one since I wear contacts and that&#x27;s a little better for me to get off my lashes at night and it works awesome. It stays put all day and comes off easy. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok doesn&#x27;t have a curve like the picture shows but still good.</li>
    <li> Pretty good mascara over all and not a bad price.  The wand is ok, but feels kinda cheap with the bristles, but it&#x27;s doable :)</li>
    <li> I love this one nothing is wrong everything is perfect. I love how my eyelashes look.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara! I love having dramatic lashes and this does the trick!  Amazon subscribe and save make this super affordable!</li>
    <li> The spring in the middle of the base of this wand (flexor brush) keeps you from getting a firm coat on your eyelashes.  When the description says &amp;#34;gently coats,&amp;#34; it really means it.  I definitely have to put on two applications to get the look that I want.  The mascara lasts and does not leave any black under my eyes throughout the day.  i will use this product until gone but I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have thin lashes that grow with gaps between them... which this mascara manages to fill in pretty well. The lashes don&#x27;t look longer, but it definitely looks like I have a lot of them, which is what I need. It&#x27;s a really nice mascara if you want to look natural but have twice as many lashes.</li>
    <li> it is ok, i was waiting a better mascara bat it is normal, volume is not the best but it is normal</li>
    <li> I like this mascara since it stays on and doesn&#x27;t bleed like some mascaras.  I only apply it once per day... I find that it doesn&#x27;t come off easy when I wash my face with Dove soap -- but a dab of coconut oil does the trick to get it off.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY love this mascara!!!! It makes my lashes so long and thick and doesn&#x27;t clump because of the new formula!!!</li>
    <li> I have mild trichotillomania, which is an obsessive compulsive disorder where I sometimes pull out my eyelashes.  I&#x27;m not consciously trying to look like a weirdo.  It always feels like I have a loose eyelash, so I&#x27;m constantly tugging on them, so they fall out more.  OK, enough of this therapy session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point is, as a result, my eyelashes are sparse and sometimes patchy. I got hooked on this mascara when I read that it was gel-based, instead of the usual waxy, stiff mascaras.  This really gives volume and length to your lashes, but with a weightless feel (so i don&#x27;t feel the need to pull on them as much).  It&#x27;s also VERY BUILDABLE.  You can add like 3 coats before your lashes start clumping. ab&lt;br /&gt;Oh and TIP:  I also like to use 1-2 coats of the regular formula, and a coat of the waterproof formula to top it off.  That way, it stays on like waterproof, but washes off like regular.  :)</li>
    <li> The best maybelline mascara I&#x27;ve found yet. I&#x27;m a huge fan of many types of maybelline products including foundation, finishing powder, concealer, and eye shadows!! I&#x27;ve used expensive brands in the past, even Merle Norman. Maybelline wins every time. This mascara does exactly what it&#x27;s called, creates plush like eyelashes. I barley have to use a eyelash curler! The mascara is not clumpy and the design of the brush is very user friendly. I especially love the silicone brush!</li>
    <li> The mascara is fine, but the springy applicator is quite annoying. It took me twice as long to apply because you can&#x27;t really &amp;#34;dig in&amp;#34; with the rubbery wand.</li>
    <li> As promised, this mascara has a Mega Plush brush that holds just the right amount of mascara! There isn&#x27;t so much that I get clumps (at all), and there isn&#x27;t so little that I need to put on 3 or 4 coats to see the mascara. Thanks to the flexible shaft that holds the brush, I can&#x27;t accidentally &amp;#34;scrape&amp;#34; off mascara at the tips of my lashes, so I get more length from this mascara than any other I&#x27;ve tried! How ingenious!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on a mission to find the best mascara available (keeping in mind everybody&#x27;s lashes are different with different needs), but I think this would work for anybody. Of all the mascaras I have, I always seem to reach for this one. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara I already have long lashes but when I apply this mascara it makes my lashes longer and thicker you girls should give it a try I bet you&#x27;ll like it as much as I do. :)</li>
    <li> I had big expectations for this mascara, but it failed me. First of all I didn&#x27;t get mega volume at all. And second I only got to use it a few times because the mascara became so thick and clumpy it was clumping to the brush and you couldn&#x27;t get the clumps off the brush so when you tried to apply the mascara you got clumps. I am not going to purchase a mascara that is only going to last a few days and then turn into a clumped thick mess. Big fail Maybelline, If you definitely want a Maybelline mascara then I think you would find better results with the Maybelline Colossal that one is good!</li>
    <li> Very good.  I like Maybelline&#x27;s New York Volume Express mascara, it wears well and stays on all day.  As I have short lashes, this product has done a great job of bringing them out and making them appear longer.  Very satisfied, will purchase again.</li>
