    <li> When I first got this product, I did my manicure as a lot of reviews suggested, gel/polish/gel/polish/top coat. It held up wonderfully. Then on my second manicure, the whole thing came off in giant chunks or peeled off my entire nail like it had never adheared. So right now, I dont know if it&#x27;s the product or &amp;#34;user error&amp;#34;. In going to try one more time and will amend my review from there.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it, it doesn&#x27;t help to protect my nails and last only one day or 2.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Helps harden nails as well.</li>
    <li> Found that it peeled off my nails in a couple of days.  Never had to worry about how I was going to remove it.</li>
    <li> Only makes polish last a couple days longer than usual... Not worth the effort</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Great product.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product!</li>
    <li> Great Product and kept my nail polish on a lot longer.</li>
    <li> Very good product, just like they say in nails tutorials. Excellent seller and super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product and I abdolutely love it! I am able to do my own gel nails now. I can even wear glitter polish and it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;bumpy&amp;#34; I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It extended my manicure for a week using regular nail polish.  Made my weak nails good and hard.  I will be buying more!!</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully.  My manicure lasted much longer when I used this product.  Easy to apply, make sure to do several light layers alternating between the gel and polish - letting each layer dry before applying the next.</li>
    <li> Dries fairly quickly. The nail polish started chipping in 5 days and I am yet to try Gelous with different brands of nail polish, but I am happy so far.</li>
    <li> Not Not very effective. I was a lot and it doesn&#x27;t last 3 days.</li>
    <li> Works great, dries fast!</li>
    <li> Not really a gel look save your money.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time a week ago, my manicure is still going strong! I am a stay at home mom so I do alot of cleaning a d dishes and it manages to last :)</li>
    <li> My daughter shared this product with me.  I can&#x27;t afford to go to a salon to get a gel manicure every three weeks.  While this doesn&#x27;t last as long as gels done at a salon, it does seem to help your home mani last longer than usual. Mine looked good for about 1 1/2 weeks.</li>
