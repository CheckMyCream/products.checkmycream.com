      <li>I will be surprised if it last 3 weeks.  </li>
      <li>The stylist agreed the hair was soft but was also alarmed at the shedding and number or red strings.</li>
      <li>Three days later I had the hair  professionally installed by a licensed cosmetologist.</li>
      <li>My understanding was that the hair could hold curls and after washing would return back to the natural wave pattern.</li>
      <li>It came much sooner then expected.</li>
      <li>I mean 2 bundle will do its job but for a full head 100 grams per bundle will not be enough.</li>

<li> so I was not sure what to expect .  </li>
<li> my hair people can hardly tell that it&#x27;s a sew</li>
<li> I am afraid to even finger comb it due to the shedding.</li>
<li> If you need a visual of the hair watch my youtube video review on the hair at: [...].</li>
<li> smell confused  </li>
<li> I was so skeptical when I received the hair</li>
<li> (Processed??)&lt;br /&gt;after careful review ,the cuticles are all over the place (HATE IT) that means TANGLE GALORE !</li>
<li> then it matted up and shedded like crazy .</li>
<li> It is day five and the hair continues to shed so badly.</li>
<li> worst hair ever .</li>
<li> This hair sheds terribly.  </li>
<li> I hate this hair!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> If you are looking for inexpensive, &amp;#34;Brazilian&amp;#34; hair then this is for you. If you can afford to spend a little more money I would suggest you choose something else. I was looking for something quick &amp; had just spent over $300 on hair and didn&#x27;t want to have to turn around and do it so soon again. Pros: the hair is natural looking and holds a curl. Cons: the hair sheds a lot, it has a lot of split ends, and it tangles. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> i got this hair and it was soft intil i put it in my hair then it matted up and shedded like crazy . worst hair ever .</li>
    <li> i waited a while to do a review in this product...&lt;br /&gt;so at first sight i was happy....&lt;br /&gt;first touch i was pleased..&lt;br /&gt;first smell confused  (Processed??)&lt;br /&gt;after careful review ,the cuticles are all over the place (HATE IT) that means TANGLE GALORE !&lt;br /&gt;I co washed it &amp; no color washed out ..&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned</li>
    <li> This hair is great! Does not have much shedding and it stays soft and does not tangle! Exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> This was my first online hair purchase so I was not sure what to expect .  I was very excited about the price and pleasantly surprised that I recived the hair so quickly.This company has great customer service!!</li>
    <li> I love my hair. When it first came it wasn&#x27;t shipped weirdly and didn&#x27;t smell. It has a few gray hairs in it but that just shows you how the hair is human. My mom sealed the weft with fray check. That has prevented some shedding. It sheds the same amount as my normal hair would. My hair does get a little tangled but that&#x27;s because I only  comb it once a day at night (to prevent a lot of hair loss). I have 18&#x27; which came from Wig Fashion INC and I&#x27;m loving it!! I strongly recommended buying this hair.( TIP: Braided it but at night to keep the wave definition) The only thing I haven&#x27;t done yet is straighten it or wash it. But other than that I have no problems with the hair. It blends very nicely with my hair people can hardly tell that it&#x27;s a sew in!I PERSONALLY THINK YOU SHOULD BUY THIS HAIR! What I have found out though is that different lengths come from different companies so you&#x27;ll never know what you get with that length. But if you want 18&#x27;, you should get it from here.</li>
    <li> Love this hair! It&#x27;s true to the length. My friends love it and would like to order through you as well</li>
    <li> The hair was great and of good quality. It came much sooner then expected. It was a great deal for what I paid for it and I wish the price hadn&#x27;t gone up so dramatically.</li>
    <li> I received 2 packs of this hair 7/24/2013 has promised by Amazon. It looked nice, but did not smell that good. I washed it and conditioned as recommended prior to installing the hair with a high quality shampoo and conditioner. I did not comb the hair while wet and only used vertical hand strokes while washing and rinsing it. There was also a lot of visible red strings in the hair and plenty of hair in the sink from washing it. I then allowed the hair to air dry. After it dried the hair was soft. Three days later I had the hair  professionally installed by a licensed cosmetologist. The stylist agreed the hair was soft but was also alarmed at the shedding and number or red strings. After installation the stylist attempted to curl it, but advised these curls were not holding and would not stay. She immediately stopped and just styled it as is. My understanding was that the hair could hold curls and after washing would return back to the natural wave pattern.It is day five and the hair continues to shed so badly. I am afraid to even finger comb it due to the shedding. There is no way this hair will last 6 months at the alarming rate it is shedding. I will be surprised if it last 3 weeks.  I should of listened to the other customer&#x27;s reviews. I only gave it one star because it would not let me post without clicking on a star. Also it did ship fast. So it does get one star for that! I hate this hair!</li>
    <li> hi, you said this hair is 100% remy human hair and it is not,i have a video combing the hair it tangles,i want the hair i ordered,send me the real remy i order ,or i would post it!</li>
    <li> I take lots of risks in life and one of them happen to be ordering hair on amazon. I was so skeptical when I received the hair but when I finally decided to make my u part wig, the hair omg I could have kick myself for not doing it sooner. The hair is beautifully,soft, not too much shines, tangle free, it doesn&#x27;t, shedd and matches well with relaxed hair. The only I recommend is buying 3 bundle for optimal fullness. I mean 2 bundle will do its job but for a full head 100 grams per bundle will not be enough.</li>
    <li> This hair sheds terribly.  When it was washed the dye was everywhere.  The color changed from a 1b to a 2.  It&#x27;s pretty when it is first attached.  The curls did not stay nor did the bounce back once it was wet.</li>
    <li> I order this hair a week before my birthday it arrive on-time.I was satisfied with the hair when I got it. My stylist really love the texture of the hair, I am able to curl the hair, and wet the hair.The hair is soft and manageable, with a lot of shedding and tangling if you dont braid it up at night.If you know how to take care of extensions then you will be find.I will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Did not like it waiting on my refund.!this hair wasn&#x27;t what I thought waiting on refund was color was off among other things. I&#x27;m waiting on my refund.I just want a refund.</li>
    <li> This is not virgin hair. It&#x27;s stringy and does not hold any curls. I will stick with the more expensive hair next time. I guess this is what you get when you spend $37.</li>
    <li> Like most of you I was scared to purchase the hair but base on the good review I click on the purchase button and a few weeks later, I am in love with this hair! I am so happy with this product, I purchase another bundle to add to my unite. If you need a visual of the hair watch my youtube video review on the hair at: [...].</li>
    <li> I used the hair for not more than a week. It knotted up and became extremely poofy, I am completely unsatisfied. Although the hair is a good price the quality is horrible. I rather pay more money than get the quality of hair I received.</li>
    <li> I bought this extra bundle to go along with three other bundles of the same and it matches perfectly nice wavy pattern good texture. I did cut my weft and didn&#x27;t seal it some expected a few shedding but I loves it!</li>
    <li> This particular brand of Virgin Brazilian hair is awesome! It never sheds, it is very soft and bouncy and never gets tangled. This hair blends wth natural or relaxed hair very well! I&#x27;ve had many people come up to me and ask \\&quot;Is that all of your hair\\&quot;? Its that good! I have ordered this hair two times the first time I got two bundles which were a 14in. and 16in, and those two bundles did the job!I realized that I wanted my hair to look a little fuller, and the second time I ordered one bundle of an 18in to make my hair look a little fuller. I love this hair and will continue to order from you in the future!</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair from Roger Rao and I am totally in love its soft and beautiful and when co washed looks great little bit of grey hair but that&#x27;s expected when u receive virgin hair I will order all my bundles from this seller.. I cant wait to ombre the tips. the curl pattern is beautiful hair was installed three days ago will do an update on the hair in a couple of weeks but I don&#x27;t think n e thing will change</li>
    <li> when I first got the hair it smelled funny but when I washed it, the smell came out and it curled back up after I had straighten it. although it don&#x27;t think I got the right measurement, I wanted an 18in but my hair was about a 16in maybe. pretty thick wefts as well. all in all,  its good for the price</li>
