      <li>The product was also used on hair and found it makes it smooth not sticky.</li>

      <li>and I felt clean after using it.</li>

      <li>The scent of this body was is light and invigorating and leaves my husband smelling fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>Since I love men&#x27;s shower products so much, I often hide them from my boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, this is a good body wash.</li>
      <li>With most dove products they are very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>This smell is great, very clean and crisp smelling with a slight cooling effect.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was super quick and the product exceeded my expectations.</li>
      <li>A good product, it lathers well, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out and has a manly scent.</li>
      <li>This has a nice scent, it lathers well, and rinses nicely without leaving my sensitive skin too dry.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, for under $7, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>but it is nice for women too, especially after exercising because it feels almost cooling.</li>
      <li>I also like the fresh scent.</li>
      <li>though moisturizing I feel that it really gives your skin that squeaky clean feeling.  </li>
      <li>The pump works very well, and it&#x27;s easy to control how much body wash you are getting.</li>
      <li>For that reason, I don&#x27;t find this product suitable for me to wash my entire body.  </li>
      <li>The pump is a nice touch, not something I&#x27;ve seen on many men&#x27;s body wash bottles, though it takes several pumps to get enough for a wash.</li>
      <li>This stuff is cheap, cheap, cheap to make - water, surfactant, petrolatum (yes, VASELINE), and some other stabilizers/colorants/fragrance.</li>
      <li>The product I like very much.</li>
      <li>This product is exactly what a man needs for his shower needs.</li>
      <li>Definitely give it 2 thumbs up :)</li>
      <li>The cooling effect is refreshing though short lived.</li>
      <li>I love spending 5 extra minutes in the shower now.</li>
      <li>He also used it to wash his hair in lieu of his regular shampoo and was satisfied with using it for that too.</li>
      <li>In terms of value, you&#x27;re definitely getting more bang for your buck with this jumbo sized Dove body wash bottle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the cooling effect which just last in the shower.  </li>
      <li>As a matter of fact, this has a cooling agent (it really does!</li>
      <li>No other product says &#x27;clean and fresh&#x27; as this one.</li>
      <li>Luckily for me I&#x27;ve got a ledge at a reasonable height level in my shower which makes this easy but other people might not be so lucky.</li>
      <li>My skin also felt clean, soft, and moisturized after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This cooling body wash leaves skin soft and clean.</li>
      <li>Therefore, I incorrectly assumed it was gentle and safe enough to use on my face.</li>
      <li>I think all large bottles should be required to have a pump like this product does.  </li>
      <li>tall shower niches so larger bottles fit easily, and they last longer.</li>
      <li>Love the big bottle with the pump action!</li>
      <li>How much moisture this adds to your skin I cannot</li>
      <li>This contains sulfates which are very drying -- which is why the petrolatum is added to counteract any dryness.</li>
      <li>I prefer a wash that does not sting and which I can gently use on my face as well as my body, but this is not one of them.</li>
      <li>It did make my hands feel clean and not dry, so this body wash is moisturizing and not drying.  </li>
      <li>Dove is my favorite soap and this is the natural next step.</li>
      <li>It is a nice, fresh scent that subtly lasts all day.</li>
      <li>The product does not seem to dry or cause skin to itch even during dry summer months which I consider good.</li>
      <li>This Dove Body Wash is not our favorite due to the lingering scent and lack of suds.  </li>
      <li>complaint aside, this gel has a great manly scent to it that is very fresh and not too harsh.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have somewhere in your shower to place this on, needing to press down and dispense from the top can become a bit of a nuisance.</li>
      <li>The fresh scent seems to last all day, although I work out in the evening and shower again after, so I can&#x27;t say for certain.</li>
      <li>tried using some on my hands to test it out, which several hours later I can still smell the scent, tho of course it&#x27;s not as strong as when I first washed my hands.  </li>
      <li>This is my new go-to body wash - I am highly recommending this product!</li>
      <li>No matter what they say on them (this one is micro moisture, others are extra fresh or extra clean, etc)</li>
      <li>The body wash soap for the price is okay and for regular use will last for couple of months.</li>
      <li>The scent is profoundly fresh that leaves a lasting effect on the skin.</li>
      <li>It really is extra fresh.</li>
      <li>This scent is pleasing, it is masculine but less cologne like and a bit more neutral.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product arrived as advertised</li>
    <li> ABOUT ME:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m one of those women who use and love men&#x27;s body wash. (I even wear Men&#x27;s Infinity perfume on occasion.) I often choose these over others for my shower such as Old Spice, Irish Spring Gear Body Wash, and some AXE fragrances (although AXE is usually my last choice due to the strong fragrance in their products). My most favorite men&#x27;s shower gels of all time were Glacier Bay, Woodland, Mountain Frost and Cool Spring from Bath and Body Works but the company discontinued them several years ago. Since I love men&#x27;s shower products so much, I often hide them from my boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE PRODUCT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this men&#x27;s product came up for review, I just had to try it. Since this is both a face and body wash, I used it in the shower on my entire body. It has a mediocre lather and does feel refreshing as a body wash. I also like the fresh scent. My skin also felt clean, soft, and moisturized after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wash is also touted as a face wash. Therefore, I incorrectly assumed it was gentle and safe enough to use on my face. However, it stung my face and eyes even though my eyes were closed. The product instructions say to keep away from the eyes but I never understood how to do that when washing the rest of my face. Since the cooling affect is achieved via the menthol ingredient in the soap, this is also what causes the sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased mint body washes in the past that have the same effect. I prefer a wash that does not sting and which I can gently use on my face as well as my body, but this is not one of them. It is because, besides a body wash, they market this as a face wash that I rate this two stars for the results I experienced. However for the body, I consider this a 4-star wash.</li>
    <li> This stuff is cheap, cheap, cheap to make - water, surfactant, petrolatum (yes, VASELINE), and some other stabilizers/colorants/fragrance. This contains sulfates which are very drying -- which is why the petrolatum is added to counteract any dryness. Petrolatum does not absorb into the skin (if you&#x27;ve ever put vaseline on your skin you&#x27;ll know)-- instead, it sits on top as an occlusive layer -- if you are acne-prone, or &amp;#34;bacne-prone&amp;#34;, this may exacerabate any pore cloggage if not rinsed well. The sad truth is, men often don&#x27;t care about ingredients in their body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is so synthetic and strong it smells like a laundry detergent. You&#x27;re better off using soap or a more natural body wash without clogging ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ingredients: Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Petrolatum, Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, Cocamide MEA, PPG-9, Menthol, Ammonium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Tetrasodium EDTA, Methylisothiazolinone, BHT, Blue 1, Red 33, Yellow 5</li>
    <li> This is a huge value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;The pump allows you to just leave it sitting on the shower shelf...no need to hold it or pick it up.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that my hubby and son weren&#x27;t too crazy about was its perfumed scent.  They said it seemed too &amp;#34;Axe Body Wash&amp;#34; cologne-type smelly.&lt;br /&gt;That is a matter of preference, if you ask me.  Anyway, for under $7, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed when I received this in the mail was that this is a big bottle of shower gel. If you&#x27;re used to using Axe products like I am, you&#x27;ll definitely notice the difference as Axe body gels come in 16 ounce bottles while this bottle is nearly 50% bigger. In terms of value, you&#x27;re definitely getting more bang for your buck with this jumbo sized Dove body wash bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next thing I noticed was the top-sided gel dispenser which is also different from what I&#x27;m used to with my Axe body wash where I can simply squeeze the body of the bottle to get the gel out. If you don&#x27;t have somewhere in your shower to place this on, needing to press down and dispense from the top can become a bit of a nuisance. Luckily for me I&#x27;ve got a ledge at a reasonable height level in my shower which makes this easy but other people might not be so lucky. With the bottle being so big, it is not easy to hold this bottle and dispense the gel at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That complaint aside, this gel has a great manly scent to it that is very fresh and not too harsh. It goes on easy and leaves me feeling fresh after using. If you can get past the wonky dispensing design, this is a great product to add to your shower gel mix.</li>
    <li> The pump is a nice touch, not something I&#x27;ve seen on many men&#x27;s body wash bottles, though it takes several pumps to get enough for a wash. The smell is masculine, but didn&#x27;t seem especially strong to me anyway. The sap lathers up fine and I felt clean after using it. I&#x27;m not sure, though, if I like quite enough to displace my favorite Nivea sensitive skin body wash.</li>
    <li> This cooling body wash leaves skin soft and clean. Although marketed to men, it is appropriate for either sex. The scent is clean, fresh and light. The bottle has a pump top dispense with ease. this is a low lather product so if you are expecting luxurious foam  you will be disappointed. The cooling effect is refreshing though short lived. It lasts in the shower, a bit of a refreshing wake up call but is gone once you towel off. It does rinse cleanly. This is a nice product for a thorough clean.</li>
    <li> Great working body wash that leaves skin moisturized and with a clean masculine scent. Probably prefer regular dove bar soap though.</li>
    <li> For some reason this Dove Men + Care Body Wash, Extra Fresh, it seems to be somewhat stronger in scent than the same product in soap form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using some on my hands to test it out, which several hours later I can still smell the scent, tho of course it&#x27;s not as strong as when I first washed my hands.  For that reason, I don&#x27;t find this product suitable for me to wash my entire body.  I think it would cause some problems with my asthma, which strong scents sometimes set it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also didn&#x27;t feel the cooling properties that this body wash is supposed to have.  It did make my hands feel clean and not dry, so this body wash is moisturizing and not drying.  How much moisture this adds to your skin I cannot say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I think I will just keep this body wash on my bathroom sink and use it to wash my hands.  I like the pump, which would make it easier to use in the shower.  I think all large bottles should be required to have a pump like this product does.  No one needs to be holding a heavy bottle in your shower where it can be slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love a stronger scent you may love this product!</li>
    <li> Some of the features are as follows:-&lt;br /&gt;1) It is made with micro moisture technology that hydrates the skin properly.&lt;br /&gt;2) It moisturizes the skin and removes dryness.&lt;br /&gt;3) It is made with cooling agent that refreshes the body.&lt;br /&gt;4) The fragrance is nice.&lt;br /&gt;5) It cleans well and rinses off easily.</li>
    <li> Dove Men + Care Body Wash reviewed here was tested for a week doing regular shower and find that it feels fresh and scent is not overwhelming. The product was also used on hair and found it makes it smooth not sticky. The body wash soap for the price is okay and for regular use will last for couple of months. The product does not seem to dry or cause skin to itch even during dry summer months which I consider good. The only downside of this product seems to be in the way it lathers. I generally do not use any bathing sponges so it may have contributed for less than satisfying lather experience otherwise the product is decent enough to give it 3 stars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this body wash. It really is extra fresh. At about $7 at the time of writing this review, this is a pretty good bargain. I have had this for a couple of weeks now, and I&#x27;ve been enjoying the results. It does get me very clean. The pump works very well, and it&#x27;s easy to control how much body wash you are getting. The fresh scent seems to last all day, although I work out in the evening and shower again after, so I can&#x27;t say for certain. Overall, this is a good body wash.</li>
    <li> This is the only body wash that my hubby likes. Love the big bottle with the pump action! He said since he started using this, his face and skin aren&#x27;t as dry as it used to be. Plus it smells amazing! Definitely give it 2 thumbs up :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Dove is my favorite soap and this is the natural next step. The scent is profoundly fresh that leaves a lasting effect on the skin. No other product says &#x27;clean and fresh&#x27; as this one.</li>
    <li> This has a nice scent, it lathers well, and rinses nicely without leaving my sensitive skin too dry.  It says that it is also face wash, but I found that it did dry out my face a bit.  As a body wash, great, face wash, not so much.</li>
    <li> Shipping was super quick and the product exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> A good product, it lathers well, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out and has a manly scent. My son is very picky and he likes this so it has to be good. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a woman because if the strong manly scent. It does dissipate after an hour or so.</li>
    <li> This is a thick rich product that my husband likes.  It has a slight mint smell so it doesn&#x27;t conflict with cologne or after shave after having bathed with body wash.  Nice lather that washes off easily.  He also used it to wash his hair in lieu of his regular shampoo and was satisfied with using it for that too.</li>
    <li> use it everyday, like the smell</li>
    <li> I frequently purchase Dove products and have used a couple other of the Dove Men + ones in the past. I&#x27;ve always been generally happy with all of them, and I&#x27;m happy this is another great product to add to the list! I have dry skin, and this works so well as a moisturizing body wash. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or irritate it. I can&#x27;t wait to be using it in the winter when my skin gets really dry, I know this will help! The smell is masculine and not overpowering. It is a nice, fresh scent that subtly lasts all day. My favorite part of this one is the cooling feature, which is a perfect wake-me-up when you&#x27;re showering in the morning before work. This is my new go-to body wash - I am highly recommending this product!</li>
    <li> I like Dove Men products.  This body wash smells great and makes me feel fresh and awake.  I like the big bottle.  We have 16&amp;#34; tall shower niches so larger bottles fit easily, and they last longer.</li>
    <li> Husband happy with the product!</li>
    <li> The scent of this body was is light and invigorating and leaves my husband smelling fresh and clean. It gives his skin a tingling clean feeling too. It lathers nicely and we love the pump dispenser. Nice body wash!</li>
    <li> This Dove Men&#x27;s Body and Face wash has a fresh, almost minty fragrance which lathers well on the skin and cleans very nicely. It may be a man&#x27;s fragrance but it is nice for women too, especially after exercising because it feels almost cooling. My husband likes it and has been using it in the shower. He claims that it doesn&#x27;t dry his skin like some of the other soaps and body washes do. He also likes the pump bottle because it&#x27;s convenient to use. I like the generous size, 23.5 ounces, because it means not having to remember to order it as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband also uses some of the Dove Men&#x27;s shampoos and skin moisturizers, so this fits in well with the others.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the Dove body wash/soap, and have tried a few different ones.  No matter what they say on them (this one is micro moisture, others are extra fresh or extra clean, etc) most of the time I find it&#x27;s the color and the scent that is most of the change.  This scent is pleasing, it is masculine but less cologne like and a bit more neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big change here is the bottle, getting a very nice pump, the bottle itself changed being quite wide at the bottom to give it a nice solid base so it doesn&#x27;t tip over when you&#x27;re trying to use the pump.  The standard size is 18oz, this is 23.5oz so you&#x27;re getting quite a bit more as well.</li>
    <li> Great smell good lather I like it</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t possible to buy it in Japan. It was bought through transmission traders. The product I like very much.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend. It smells really good and he likes it.</li>
    <li> This smell is great, very clean and crisp smelling with a slight cooling effect.  I love the cooling effect which just last in the shower.  With most dove products they are very moisturizing.  I feel like this one is a little different, though moisturizing I feel that it really gives your skin that squeaky clean feeling.  I would say that the lather is so-so, not as much as some of their other products however for a Man I think this would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Our family prefers Dove soap products over other brands. This Dove Body Wash is not our favorite due to the lingering scent and lack of suds.  I needed to reapply the body wash to the pouf to have enough soap later to make it through one shower.  It does rinse from your skin easily and for those that like the scent of their body wash to stay with them throughout the day, this is the body wash for you.  That&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m a fan of, especially as my husband and I are using the same body wash and neither of us want to smell like this all day.</li>
    <li> I purchased the extra large bottle because it is easier to use in the shower.</li>
    <li> You probably are already using Dove products, or had in the past. I actually remember not so long ago, about 10 years, when Dove was as obiquitous as dull, or just the okay way to go when it comes to shower time. 10 years have gone by, and Dove has evolve accordingly to the times. If you are reading this review, or looking into buying this product, it is because you may have seen it in the best top 10 men gel shower on many sites. I actually did, and became interested in this brand again.&lt;br /&gt;No need to look back, or elsewhere! This is it! This product is exactly what a man needs for his shower needs. Bear in mind this is extra fresh, which means it is scented, with a hint of mint, or actually, depending on your sensibility, probably too much. I like it though. And I do recommend this specially for after working out at the gym. It really cools me down. As a matter of fact, this has a cooling agent (it really does! They have even filed for a patent on this technology).&lt;br /&gt;I know a shower gel is a very personal think, and this may or may not work for you. It did wonders for me. I love spending 5 extra minutes in the shower now. Give it a try, it may work for you too, and you&#x27;ll be happy you bought it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s body wash and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
