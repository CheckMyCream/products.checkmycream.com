<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this lip product actually healed my lips!</li>
    <li> Helps heal cracked, dry lips and tastes great! I would recommend this product. It would make a great gift in the winter!</li>
    <li> Great lip balm and love the peppermint scent. It is convenient to use and keeps lips moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;This scent is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I decided to try Baby Lips after hearing about all the rage on youtube, blogs, etc. The truth is...there&#x27;s really nothing THAT special about it. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize lips for as long as it claim it does. I reapply often and it&#x27;s nowhere near as good as my favorite lip balms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of Sugar Rose Fresh lip balm and it&#x27;s 100X better than this but it&#x27;s also quite pricy so I&#x27;m giving this a bit more leverage due to it&#x27;s low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do like the smell of the peppermint (it&#x27;s not too overpowering and strong just a hint of peppermint) and this goes on clear so I like to use it under my lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth the money? Yes...Is it really a miraculous product? NO but it&#x27;s great if you are looking for an inexpensive alternative to some of the more pricy lip balms out there.</li>
    <li> I love baby lips so much, it keeps your lips so moisturized and has an amazing scent.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loves it !!</li>
    <li> I had been dying to try this lip product, so when I was given a gift card for a birthday present I decided to finally purchase it. Best decision I&#x27;ve made. It keeps your lips smooth and if you reapply it every few hours, it makes such a difference. No more chapped lips for me!</li>
    <li> I go through chap stick quickly because my lips are large and dry out very easily. Sun protection is a must on lips because certain glosses will amplify harsh UV rays-so any product that combines hydration and sun protection intrigues me. I purchased the menthol and orange varieties, neither of them had an over powering mint or orange smell/flavor (like lip smackers or certain Bath and Body Works products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, both varieties wore off very quickly and I found myself reaching for a more hydrating lip balm after three applications in one day. This is advertised as a lip balm-and not a gloss, but it is worth mentioning it adds very little to no shine or color. Additionally, I did not notice any odd taste coming rubbing off my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most likely not buy this product again-but it has potential if re-formulated slightly.</li>
    <li> I have used some of the other Baby Lip Balms and they kept my lips feeling smooth and moisturized.  I don&#x27;t know what is so different about this formula, but it had my lips feeling dry and chapped.... I am not a fan of this Peppermint balm.</li>
    <li> This product worked almost instantly, making my lips visibly beautiful and full with an amazing taste.  This is my favorite lip balm, and I LOVE it!! (:</li>
    <li> was a flavor I didn&#x27;t have and luv that it has sunscreen in it, not just a lip balm</li>
    <li> I enjoy the scent and it goes on well. But as far as doing anything differently than chapstick, I see no difference. For the price, I would probably stick to some nourishing chapstick. This does leave no color which is fine by me!</li>
    <li> This is a really great product and you can buy it cheaper on here that at the stores.</li>
    <li> Very smooth. Nice mint taste/smell - not overwhelming. Just wish it stayed on better. I bought several as stocking stuffers and one for myself. Would buy again if I don&#x27;t find one that stays on longer.</li>
    <li> Great! Moisturizing and shiny at a good price</li>
    <li> I was going to purchase this when I took a better look at the ingredients.  The two that popped out were Titanium Dioxide and Aluminum Hydroxide.  Titanium Dioxide has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a possible cause of cancer. Scientific evidence has shown that high concentrations of pigment-grade (powdered) and ultrafine titanium dioxide dust caused respiratory tract cancer in rats exposed by inhalation and intratracheal instillation*. The series of biological events or steps that produce the rat lung cancers (e.g. particle deposition, impaired lung clearance, cell injury, fibrosis, mutations and ultimately cancer) have also been seen in people working in dusty environments. Guess what else Titanium Dioxide is used in? Whitening Toothpaste!  Our doctor, naturopath and dentist have told us not to use anything with Titanium Dioxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aluminum hydroxide acts as an antacid and is most commonly used in the treatment of heartburn, gastritis, and peptic ulcer. This drug is also sometimes used to reduce absorption of phosphorus for people with kidney failure. It is toxic and even deadly. It damages all different types of tissues, and is slightly less toxic than lead or mercury. Other uses for aluminum hydroxide are the manufacturing of aluminosilicate glass, for waterproofing fabrics and in making fire clay, paper and printing inks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why either of these would be used in lip gloss is beyond me!  Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product and will be VERY watchful of the ingredient list on the lip gloss and makeup I purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> After about 3 weeks of use, my lips do feel softer! Peppermint smell is nice and not overwhelming. However, very liberal use feels goopy, so less is more!</li>
    <li> It is very moisturizing and it smells really good.... It doesn&#x27;t make my lips moist all day but it works like it said</li>
    <li> This is a great lip balm!!&lt;br /&gt;I rated it 5 stars because:&lt;br /&gt;- it goes on smoothly and thin&lt;br /&gt;- it has sunscreen!!&lt;br /&gt;- it smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;- I noticed the results , my lips were much softer after a week of usage :)</li>
    <li> This makes your lips crustier than they were to begin with. You might as well slather on vaseline at least its cheaper.</li>
    <li> I just got a tube of the peppermint yesterday, and it is gross!  I barely noticed any peppermint smell or feel.  This hydrated well enough it seemed, nice and light feel, but the taste and smell where pure &#x27;makeup&#x27;, so I was trying to get the stuff off of my lips as soon as I put it on.  Gross!  Don&#x27;t purchase this one if you like mint!</li>
    <li> It looked a little different than the picture shows, it has SPF in it, and so it smells and tastes like sunblock, more than it does of mint, which is something to get used to. However, it does moisturize your lips and makes them soft.</li>
    <li> Seems that I need to reapply frequently. And it isn&#x27;t very minty, and the little bit of mint there is isn&#x27;t delicious. It&#x27;s okay, but not as amazing as I thought it was going to be from the reviews I read. I do love the Cherry Me Baby Lips though.</li>
    <li> It smells good and taste good. Love how it makes my lips feel when I put it on. Moisturizes my lips!</li>
    <li> Very morsterizing,nice smell,and cute packeging.LOVELY!</li>
    <li> Of Course A Big &#x27; Yes &#x27; To BABY LIPS ... Love Its Long Lasting Moisture !!!  I Add 2 Drops Of The Doterra Essential Oil Of Peppermint To Mine, And Shake It A Few Times Before I Use It.  After 24 Hours The Oils Absorb Into The BABY LIPS Moisture Stick Inside.  The Next One I Buy, I Am Going To Add 1 Drop Of Peppermint Essential Oil And 1 Drop Of Marula Oil And I Drop Of Argan Oil MUAH &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, tastes goodish. the blue kind is better. way better than any of the eos chap sticks. One stick is enough, probably wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really use lip balm, gloss, lipstick, or any lip product. So when I bought this product it was really only for the SPF and the peppermint scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say this is anymore moisturizing than the chapstick you buy at the checkout line. It didn&#x27;t make my lips super soft, and it didn&#x27;t last hours or really anything special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has cute/durable packaging so that is also a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it four stars because it is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; plus the SPF.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! It leaves my lips feeling so good after every use. No more dry or cracked lips here!</li>
    <li> Ive been on the hunt for a lip balm that actually works for my weird lips (sometimes they&#x27;ll get red and crackely) and I found this and its perfect. I now own the rest of the line of baby lips.</li>
    <li> This lip balm heals your lips quickly! It hydrates and repairs and gives you flawless lips! I love the peppermint scent and it cools also. Its smooth and works amazingly well.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR $2.97  IT WAS A SUBSCRIPTION OFFER WHICH GAVE YOU THE OPTION TO CHOOSE: ONE TIME ONLY. AND I DID AND MAN I SHOULD HAVE RACKED UP! THE PRICE SURE HAS INCREASED IN JUST A MATTER OF DAYS! MY LIPS FEEL SO SOFT AND TINGLY WHICH I WAS HOPING FOR PEPPERMINT! BABY LIPS IS NO LIE BUY IT ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE THE KIND TO ALWAYS CHEW ON YOUR LIPS IT MAKES YOUR LIPS SMOOTH AND ONE SKIN AGAIN! IT IS BEST TO USE IT AT BED TIME BY THE TIME YOU WAKE UP YOUR LIPS ARE FANTASTIC AND I HAVE ONLY BEEN USING IT FOR 3 DAYS!</li>
    <li> It smells good I guess but other than that it really wasnt that great but I guess other people love it so you might as well try it.....</li>
    <li> I received my lip balm fairly quick and I was extremely satisfied! I love this lip balm because it is incredibly moisturizing and it has a hint of peppermint</li>
    <li> I dont get why more balm dont have spf in them that make perfect sense.&lt;br /&gt;have one in my carry on I use it a lot (six more on the way) a think this sort of product Is a must have for anyone, I dont have dry lips but the nice moisturising feel it gives is very nice and the extra protection is great (it&#x27;s really Important at any season, lips are very sensitive to Solar radiation).&lt;br /&gt;I wish they were sold on the drugstore here...</li>
    <li> I really like this product, but like some others have said you do have to reapply.  Although it is every few hours or so.  Feels really nice and moisturizes my lips very well.</li>
    <li> Love it, it is so smooth. It is very light weight. I love peppermint too and this is a good one.</li>
    <li> Love baby lips! Moisturizing. Soft.</li>
    <li> This product works well on me but the product does not last long on my lips. The peppermint scent is really quite weak.</li>
    <li> Works very well, love the peppermint and that it is colorless and has a SPF!!! It&#x27;s my kind of lip balm.</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balm brand!</li>
    <li> I love Baby Lips, but I cannot use this one because I am allergic to mint. It sucks. Baby Lips in general is a super light tint, and great for making your lip soft. The menthol in this will make your lips amazing, I just can&#x27;t use this one.</li>
    <li> The cooling mint might not be for everyone, but I like it. It&#x27;s not crazy mentholated like Blistex, but it&#x27;s nice and it&#x27;s definitely moisturizing. It was a great price and I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just got these recently and so far I love them. Peppermint is my favorite, and I always have menthol or minty lip balm around. This is nice and instantly moisturizing, it goes on like silk and feels great. The mint it nice and light, not too over powering, I just hope that it works to make my lips smoother over time.</li>
    <li> This lip balm smells good, and has adorable packaging! It smells a bit like peppermint tea, and I purchased the Peppermint and the Quenched flavor.  It makes my lips smooth and is a great balm.  I give it a thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This is the most moisturizing stuff around.  I LOVE IT!!! i put it on anytime during the day or night and my lips feel wonderful and moist</li>
    <li> Great quality. Love the smell and easy to carry. Thank you for the great product! Will come back again for sure</li>
    <li> This product drys my lips.</li>
    <li> it makes my lips so soft... overall it is good quality... except that i&#x27;m paranoid with all the chemicals on it... seems like the chemicals on it arent good for health... even ingesting it isnt good for health...</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY 15 YEAR OLD FAVORITE BRAND OF LIP BALM.. SHE WEARS IT EVERYDAY AND IT IS NEVER NOT ON HER PERSON</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t moisturize how i thought it would. It just sits on my lip and doesn&#x27;t really penetrate. if I haven&#x27;t used it for a day or two my lips start to crack up. Guess im just not born with it..or maybe its Maybelline.</li>
    <li> I really just got this to make my purchase 25.00 :) for the free shipping, but I like it as well as the Blistex version I buy at the store...will try the cherry next!</li>
    <li> poor quality. very hard to apply, texture is very dry too. too regret that I bought it.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves this lip balm and loved the price.  she uses it every day. it provides great moisture to the lips</li>
    <li> This product is twice the price in stores! I highly recommend it, especially for chapped or dry lips. No waxy or heavy feel.&lt;br /&gt;And at this price, get a few!&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY!</li>
    <li> This is nice, makes my lips free super soft.</li>
    <li> There is no lip balm that has ever worked as well for me as Baby Lips.</li>
    <li> It has improved my lips overall. Not sure it is the best thing out there, though. And the name is a little bit creepy to me as well. Peppermint is a good light flavor though.</li>
    <li> good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good</li>
    <li> Like it a lot, bought 3 more. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my lip balm of choice along with the Nivea line of lip balms. Very moisturizing. Lips feel protected and hydrated (quenched) not dry with a thick layer of wax on top like how some other lip balms feel. I also like the minty flavor and prefer mint balms to any other flavor. Feels fresh and helps with breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I peel off the hideous green lable on the outside whenever I get a new one. The case is green with clear cap after I remove the lable. That way even my husband will use it because it doesn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;maybelline&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;baby lips&amp;#34; anymore. It keeps our lips hydrated and healthy. I always have a couple around the house and in various bags. Can&#x27;t ask for more from a lip balm really.</li>
    <li> Basic chapstick/lip balm in trendy little tube. There&#x27;s nothing about this thats amazing or mind blowing, youd be better off using carmex, burts bees or chapstick even, if your lips are truly chapped. Itd probaly be cheaper too. Just wanted to test this out and move on w life. Did a bunch of 12 year olds write reviews for this product? I feel robbed I&#x27;m not raving about how wonderful of a product this should be. Item arrively in timely manner.</li>
    <li> Supposed to have peppermint flavor. Nope, didn&#x27;t. Actually felt stinging sensation on my lips. Ugh! I have other products from this line and they are fine, so it&#x27;s just this one I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t really liking baby lips, but now I&#x27;ve come to a conclusion that it does actually work, may not be feeling a difference but I see a difference... I think. Lol. right now, i;m using the crystal brand. plan on testing out the dr. rescue soon. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> This is just ok as for lip balm. I prefer Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s peppermint lip balm to this. I simply don&#x27;t like the way Baby Lips feels on my lips and the peppermint isn&#x27;t strong. I thought that there would be a little sheen or sparkle to this lip balm, as ads seem to indicate. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this brand, just my opinion that this product isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Great lip moisturizer. Wear it all the time.</li>
    <li> it makes my lips soft and it has a hint of peppermint so it is not too strong i love it</li>
    <li> It makes my lips soft with a little shine, it works instantly too! I have naturally big lips and they dry out quicker.</li>
    <li> I was a Burt&#x27;s addict, until this stuff came along.  I am very particular about what products I use, and I will spend the money to get the results I want.  It&#x27;s worth it to spend a couple more dollars to be truly satisfied with a quality product.  After using this for a week, it does what it claims.  My lips are much softer.  The flavor/scent is not overpowering at all.  I hope they never discontinue this product, it will be difficult to find a match.</li>
    <li> I was dying to try these Baby Lips products. They were on sale so I bought 2, this one and Peach Kiss. I was happy with it at first, but I noticed I had to reapply quite often. Then I noticed my lips starting to crack! With continued use, it made my lips MORE chapped. I&#x27;m very disappointed with it. I had high hopes. Lip balm isn&#x27;t supposed to CAUSE your lips to crack. Won&#x27;t be using it anymore.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT. You can feel the peppermint on your lips and it makes them so soft. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Has a lot of bad chemicals in it, but it does make your lips soft. I needed free super saver shipping so I ordered this. If you don&#x27;t care about weird chemicals I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love love love the baby lips line! This lip balm will make your lips so soft! Improves chapped lips almost instantly! If you want to spice it up, try the &#x27;peach kiss&#x27; color- I absolutely love it as well. Smooth feeling on lips, not sticky or thick.  Light and glossy. Try them all!!! Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price either.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite memories of Baby Lips was from the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s, when these were huge.  A big whopping tube of bubble-gum flavor (or whatever it was) floated my boat for a long time, and smelled great.  So disappointed in the size.  It used to be as thick around as the sunblock face tube that is sold for baby&#x27;s faces.  Dang.  As a gift for a new teen, along with other makeup items, this didn&#x27;t make the big bang effect I&#x27;d hoped.  The one thing I did like it that this one didn&#x27;t have color, which was better for a younger lady, and the sunblock.</li>
    <li> You must have this lip stick! The flavor is amazing! Everybody can use it, and it looks awesome with any skin color!</li>
    <li> I love this chap-stick, it is a great flavor and works perfectly for what I needed it for. The kids love it too!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the look and feel of this, it just doesnt really help chapped lips tat much...</li>
    <li> This is so much better than the ESOS ball lip balm that I bought, plus it acts as SPF 20! Great for summer or any season</li>
    <li> This sucked to say the least. When I chose the peppermint flavor i was expecting something similar to Burt&#x27;s beeswax flavor and this was nothing even remotely close to that. The Chapstick it&#x27;s self was greasy and I didn&#x27;t notice it doing anything more for my lips than any other Chapstick. Shipping was on time.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I know. It isn&#x27;t waxy at all but plenty of moisture. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for my daughter and she loves it.  The Peppermint flavor is one of her favorites.</li>
    <li> When applying the balm, it glides on well due to the \\&quot;greasiness\\&quot;, which I actually do not mind. It leaves a subtle gloss/shine on your lips and the flavor was not overwhelming. The thick tube and bright packaging is cute and great for purses (easy to locate/feel around for). I like the lip balm but would not pay this much for a glorified Chapstick, which also does the job at a lower price. The only reason I purchased this was because I needed a filler item and this was something I wanted to try.</li>
    <li> I love baby lips. This one is great because it dosent have a color really. It repairs chapped lips wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice, mild mint smell and makes your lips feel soft without any thick residue. However, I have to give it 2 stars because of the offensive sunscreen/chemical taste when you accidentally lick your lips. That is a deal breaker for me no matter how great the product is otherwise! I will stick with my Nivea and Bigelow!</li>
    <li> I am a lip balm freak, and I love trying all kinds of new lip stuff. This peppermint Baby lips smells great, and it does a great job keeping my lips soft.</li>
    <li> This lip balm has a very mild mint essence on your lip.  You can easily miss it.  However, the balm is very moisturizing.  I do like it and I also liked the price but I would like a little more mint essence and maybe a tiny flavor to go with it. Oh, almost forgot it  has SPF 20. Overall A good buy.</li>
    <li> The price its pretty good but I remember that when i bought it from the store (Target) It feel different, de mint flavor was stronger and last longer, so I have to apply it on my lips more often, this one its to light and Sometimes its make me think that they are not original :/ but Im not sure.</li>
    <li> Gives a great shine and isnt sticky feeling on your lips. Also is a great moisturizer. Can&#x27;t wait to try other flavors.</li>
    <li> It does exactly as it was supposed to. With in two days my lips were soft and very kissable.  The flavor wasn&#x27;t overpowering but very subtle and silky against my lips. I can&#x27;t wait to buy more.</li>
    <li> I have only seen this product through commercials. Occasionally I saw it in the makeup section but never actually bought it. I LOVE it! It feels amazing and keeps my lips nice and moist instead of chapped. I wear it over night and wake up and my lips feel awesome.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much that I&#x27;ve already bought more when I spot them at drugstores!  I never want to run out of this in case it gets discontinued.  I used to use Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm because I like minty balms and stay away from fruit flavors, but this has already replaced my Burt&#x27;s Bees.  This balm glides on smoothly while leaving a nice sheen with a light scent/taste - sometimes I feel like Burt&#x27;s Bees is TOO minty which gives me a waxy mint taste in my mouth.  Baby Lips isn&#x27;t sticky at all and my lips feel moisturized throughout the day as I reapply.</li>
    <li> i have had better luck with vaseline than this. it wasnt not moisturizing for me. i did like the peppermint scent. nice and subtle. but overall, not so great..</li>
    <li> This product truely makes my lips glow and shine! they feel so fresh whenever I use this balm, you are able to feel th peppermint and it keeps my lips moiturised for a couple of hours! I highly recommend this if you want shine aswell as soft moisutre! :D</li>
    <li> it is the best lips moisturizing lip balm i&#x27;ve ever used&lt;br /&gt;i think i;ve already ordered 10 pieces!&lt;br /&gt;everyone around me keeps asking me about it</li>
    <li> Love the hint of peppermint and made my lips very soft,  smells great, came quicker then what I thought it was going to be</li>
    <li> This product came very quick and nicely packaged. I have tried alot of diffrent lip balms but this works great it makes ur lips almost instantly soft, it also smells nice not to pepperminty but just enough i would recomend this product to anyone who wants soft lips also not a bad price:)</li>
    <li> the peppermint is great for winter</li>
    <li> Love it i get one every month and it has SPF in it it&#x27;s awesome i recommend this</li>
    <li> Love baby lips. Really does make lips soft. Has a mild scent, makes lips shiny like lip gloss but is smooth and not at all sticky.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Baby Lips, compared to the 3 baby lips I received for my birthday I had thought this would be my least fave. But, it is my absolute fave! Swipe the balm over each lip 3-4 times and you&#x27;re lips all of the sudden become cooled and minty &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> good product but it does not keep your lips moist long enough (only for a couple of mins), your lips will smell minty though</li>
    <li> My sister had wanted either Peppermint or Pink Punch and at first got Pink Punch, (read my reveiw on Pink Punch to find out what happened) but my mom gave her Peppermint instead. And yes, it DOES smell like peppermint candy. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This stuff feels so soft and smooth and it has spf! I love it and will be taking it to the beach with me all summer long!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear lipstick but like to keep my lips moisturized and looking good. I keep this in my purse and use it when I go out. It lasts for several hours and taste good too. I love the peppermint one, it goes on clear. I have this on my subscribe and save and get it monthly.</li>
    <li> I like the light peppermint scent. Also there is no color so it won&#x27;t rub off and stain anything. It actually improved the condition of my lips. Great alone or under lipstick.</li>
    <li> Unlike the EOS brand of lip balm, Baby lips (this one and the one in the blue container) go on smooth and slick. It gives moderate shine, but most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t have a tacky feel. I detest lip balms that feel tacky/sticky on my lips (that&#x27;s how the EOS brand is to me). Baby Lips get the job done. Beware though, using lots of lip balms gets you addicted (it&#x27;s weird, but true). Try not to apply 24/7.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite lip balm.  The peppermint is perfect but not overpowering and it&#x27;s super glossy while still moisturizing.</li>
    <li> The Peppermint Baby Lips are really soothing to my dry lips.  I highly recommend for anyone with dry chapped lips.  Feels nice and softens lips.</li>
    <li> This works much better than any chap stick that I&#x27;ve used.  My lips get dry very quickly and unlike other products that I&#x27;ve used I don&#x27;t need to apply this as frequently as I used to all the others.</li>
    <li> Maybe I just have a sensitivity to the ingredients in sunscreen, but immediately after putting this lip balm on, I get a taste in my mouth exactly like any sunscreen lotion.  Which is mad gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been a couple weeks of regular use and my lips have gone from \\&quot;fairly healthy\\&quot; to \\&quot;peeling, flaking and dry\\&quot; thanks to nearly exclusively being treated with this balm.</li>
    <li> I recommend this Lip Balm. It has great taste and its a perfect clear one with peppermint taste! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I give this product 5 stars because it exceeded all my expectations and the shipping was very fast, takes good care of the lips of sunlight and tastes very delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Le doy 5 estrellas porque este producto superó todas mis espectativas y el envío fué muy rápido, cuida muy bien los labios de los rayos del sol y tiene un sabor muy delicioso.</li>
    <li> I take this product with me everywhere as it is a nice makeup bag staple.  I don&#x27;t like to wear heavy makeup everyday and this allows me to have a nice moisturized polished look without being over the top.  The packaging is extremely cute and easy to handle.  The product glides on quite easily and looks very natural.  The only problem I have with it is that sometimes I like to add a bit of color to my lips for a night out but if I&#x27;ve been wearing the balm all day the two mixed together tend to get greasy and a bit flaky rolling off my lips.  A small dab of a napkin easily remedies the problem however.  Overall I would suggest that every woman have this in her makeup bag.  It smells great, and is by far better than the average lip balms.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at walmart after seeing the price on amazon. This product was NOT worth the $3 spent on it.Its more drying them my regular chap stick.The only good part is that it goes on smooth but you have to keep reapplying it because it doesn&#x27;t last.My lips crack after its gone and it also has a really bad taste.Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> i mean come on anyone who has tried or debated trying this balm should try it. The smoothness comfort and cooling makes it amazing and the look of the product is just as satisfying!</li>
    <li> I love the \\&quot;Baby Lips\\&quot; brand. Not sticky, colors (in the colored ones) are soft, but noticeable. Makes your lips soft and kissable, and the peppermint tingle is a fun sensation. With these and/or the EOS balms, you&#x27;re set!</li>
    <li> Super moisturizing without being sticky. Just a hint of peppermint so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you are rubbing toothpaste on your lips. Great price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay balm. It&#x27;s mostly like other balms I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-makes lips feel softer when applied, but as you start eating and drinking things, the softness goes away&lt;br /&gt;-smells nice&lt;br /&gt;-it melts like butter O.o lol :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-goes really quickly</li>
    <li> I made a gift basket of peppermint theme for my children&#x27;s teachers at Christmas.  It contained foot cream, body lotion, slippers, peppermint hot chocolate, peppermint dark chocolate bark, peppermint mocha and this lip balm in addition to a few other things and a gift card to starbucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received more specific thanks related to this lip balm and the dark chocolate peppermint bark that I made than any other item in the gift basket. The teachers all loved it and they liked that it did not have color so it did not interfere with their favorite lipstick.  They loved the smell and flavor.  They like how smooth it applied and liked that it was not too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 our of 10 teachers gave it 5 stars!  :)</li>
    <li> I really like this chap stick. It has a nice smell, doesn&#x27;t have any color to it and makes my lips look great.</li>
    <li> I am very picky about my lip balms because I want my lips soft, but also glossy. This does both. It makes my lips look spectacular and natural. I carry it around in my pocket and reapply every 2 hours or so. Very simple, but really works. It doesn&#x27;t make my lips all soft when it is not on, but that doesn&#x27;t matter to me. I like the soft glossy look when it is on. I like the clear form. (Peppermint or the quencher are great.)</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It goes one smoothly and makes my lips feel great.  The peppermint is not too strong, either.</li>
    <li> This was the first Baby Lips I bought. I immediately loved it and now I have two more. I keep this one in my school pencil case and I reapply it every few hours. It keeps my lips happy and feeling great! It has lasted me months and I am not even close to having to repurchase. I recommend!</li>
    <li> Every since I tried the Baby Lips lip balm, I was hooked, and for a price cheaper than in stores- I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
    <li> This lip balm does not make my lips feel moisturized. It does not last as long as it says and makes my lips feel dry within minutes of putting it on. The commercial for this product is very deceiving. I have the peach baby lips as well and that does pretty much the same thing as this one except it gives you a glittery nude look to your lips.  I don&#x27;t really recommend this product, or any of the other baby lips lip balms.</li>
    <li> Didnt work for my lips at all, nice smell though.</li>
    <li> this product it not as moisturizing as I would like but it&#x27;s not bad either. i like the smell and the packaging is super cute.</li>
    <li> i honestly love baby lips it is so moisturizing and looks like a lips gloss when on but isn&#x27;t so sticky and gross like it.</li>
    <li> I love this lip gloss, it is shiny without overdoing it and very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that it probably won&#x27;t last more than a few weeks, depending on how much you use it of course.&lt;br /&gt;But it is perfect to carry around for quick lip care.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this because I wanted to try a new chapstick. I usually use Nivea or Aquaphor. My lips were really chapped when I bought it, and I found it did not help to un-chap my lips. I had to apply frequently and my lips became dryer. However, I tried applying this chapstick to my lips when not chapped and it did work well to prevent my lips from becoming chapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product if you are trying to cure chapped lips. I would highly recommend aquaphor for that. But this is a good chapstick for maintaining already soft lips. However, there are cheaper products out there that do the same or even better. My favorite chapstick remains Nivea.</li>
    <li> Nice chap stick but I didn&#x27;t notice anything special about it. I&#x27;ll stick to burt&#x27;s bees.</li>
    <li> I loved these at first, and then they dried out and left my lips gunky. Not  a fan of baby lips anymore.</li>
    <li> Mmmmmm love the peppermint and love how it makes my lips feel!  An essential for me!</li>
    <li> this is the best chapstick/lip gloss you will ever buy. i only use baby lips. i used to use eos but this is so much bettern and lasts wayy longer</li>
    <li> Lost this one in a week ^_^, but I had several others.</li>
    <li> Love it!It&#x27;s so refreshing, love the cooling effect and moisturizes my lips.</li>
    <li> This lip balm overall is pretty good. NO - I have never tried Burt&#x27;s so I can&#x27;t compare those two in quality. But I have tried Nivea, Neutrogena Lip Balms, and a few other random ones, and I would say this one is the best by far. This glides on smoothly and is really buttery and soft, and makes my lips soft. For me, there is absolutely no tint whatsoever in it as the other Baby Lips should have - so this is ideal for a natural look or if you don&#x27;t want hot pink lips. One thing I don&#x27;t really like is the peppermint smell - this is probably just my personal opinion, because others seem to like it - for me I just find it a little gross. Again this may also be my misconception but it looked slightly bigger in the picture, like one of those humongous Burt&#x27;s chapsticks, but it isn&#x27;t. While this isn&#x27;t much of a problem for me I  just wanted to point it out. Yes it says 0.15 oz so my bad ;) Overall I would definitely buy more of these and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Within five minutes of putting this on, all I could taste was sunscreen. Otherwise liked the product, but the taste is absolutely disgusting. Will not be using.</li>
    <li> It might be different on other people&#x27;s lips, but on mine this Maybelline New York Baby Lips Peppermint-Flavored Moisturizing Lip Balm feels amazing and glides onto my mouth smoothly. It smells good and tingles the slightest bit when applied. Definitely worth my money. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I got this product and it is not minty at all. It does make your lips very soft but not enough  flovor in it its weak</li>
    <li> This is ok, nothing to get excited about. It&#x27;s just like any other lip balm on the shelf. I would prefer to just use my burt bees or something cheaper that does the same as this product probably better</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE!!! MUST HAVE!! If you love lip gloss as much as any girl then you MUST try baby lips!! It smells/tastes fantastic and it moisturizes your lips! Amazing!</li>
    <li> The smell of the product is approachable and the appearance of the lip balm is attractive, however, I reach for this product SO often that it makes me feel like the actual lip balm isn&#x27;t that great. I feel like it fades too quickly and I need to re-apply pretty often when compared to other lip balms.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this on my lips! I love the flavor and the way my lips looked after about two days of using this(:</li>
    <li> My maybelline babylips came on time and I love it! I use it everyday, I love the smell and the way it feels!</li>
    <li> This dries my lips out a little bit so I am not a huge fan.</li>
    <li> i got this in no time and i was a little nervous to get it at first but it is perfect. it smells great and it keeps my lips feeling fresh and moisturized all day</li>
</ol>
