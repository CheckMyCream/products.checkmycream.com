    <li> Both this and the Utopia Care Blackhead Blemish Remover work equally will.  I bought this for myself but couldn&#x27;t find it again, so I bought the Utopia Care Blackhead Blemish Remover for travel.  Both are great.</li>
    <li> Super gross but it really pops the pimples</li>
    <li> Good quality for price.</li>
    <li> This works great, and leaves no scaring. I had heard about them, but had never tried. For some reason, I developed a skin problem when I turned 60. This little instrument is worth its weight in gold. Make sure it is very clean or sterilized before you use it to cut down on infection. Wipe with alcohol between use on each spot.</li>
    <li> Good for black heads.</li>
    <li> The construction is solid and no sharp metals. It works great at extracting blackheads and zits. It can possibly last for years.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality tool, but find I need another type. Will keep, however. Not Seller&#x27;s fault.</li>
    <li> Just okay maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use it right but I can&#x27;t really get it to work, the medal is good quality though</li>
