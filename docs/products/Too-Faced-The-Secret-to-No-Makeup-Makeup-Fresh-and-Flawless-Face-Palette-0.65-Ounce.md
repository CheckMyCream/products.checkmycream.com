      <li>I love this product for when I am in a hurry or working long hours and don&#x27;t have time or feel like doing my makeup perfectly.</li>
      <li>This gives me a clean look and I feel more confident without makeup around my boyfriend.  </li>
      <li>I have never seen this palette sell for under thirty dollars, even with a very good sale, so if the price is too low and the seller isn&#x27;t licensed to sell Too Faced products, be cautious.</li>
      <li>It is a very useful palette, and you will love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I think it could have been a tad darker but other than that it was perfect.</li>

      <li>(And you can always turn it up with a bold eye shadow and liner.)</li>
      <li>i suppose it just doesn&#x27;t work super well on darker skinned girls.</li>
      <li>Works great and is really helpful and teaches you different ways to contour your face!</li>
      <li>First let me say I am a huge too faced fan.</li>
      <li>Very pretty on lips</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not exactly what expected as far as the &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; go. I&#x27;ve used much better concealers</li>
    <li> This is my favorite!  I have one of these at home, one at work, and I carry one with me...  absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this palete, but is to little for the price and  the look of no make up face, dont work only with this, you need other conceler to make it. Its to ligth.</li>
    <li> First let me say I am a huge too faced fan. Possibly the biggest. I own over $1,000 in too faced products. Maybe it&#x27;s me but this pallet was awful. Maybe the shades are wrong for me or maybe I can&#x27;t use liquid makeup correctly, but it looked Cakey and wet on my face and just horrible. Ended up using twice and giving away. Not for me.</li>
    <li> The concealers crease like crazy even if you use a setting powder over them :( love the blushes they stay on forever! But I feel like this really only works for fair skin tones because the bronzing powder hardly even shows up its more of a light glow</li>
    <li> I bought this just to have a little something for the days that I didn&#x27;t want to go full blown makeup-makeup. If you want a very natural look but don&#x27;t want to go bareface then this is perfect. It really gives you a nice dewy glow yet it keeps you natural. The colors are really soft and work for people that are in a profession that doesn&#x27;t allow lots of makeup.</li>
    <li> I really like this palette.  It comes with an instruction card for different looks...natural, day, and glamorous. I&#x27;ve played around with it and made some errors (had to wash it off), but all in all it&#x27;s very nice.  The cream blush goes a long way, so be careful not to put to much on.</li>
    <li> I love this palette. I feel very fresh and pretty without looking overdone.</li>
    <li> i suppose it just doesn&#x27;t work super well on darker skinned girls. i&#x27;m a medium to tan complexioned lady and the bronzer was more of a highlighter believe it or not. cute packaging, decent design though i wish they wouldn&#x27;t put creme and powder products in the same little case. everything just kinda gets everywhere and sticks the the creme blusher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;d personally just invest in separate products that may be of higher quality as well... it wasn&#x27;t the best, wasn&#x27;t the worst. i&#x27;ll probably pass mine off onto a lighter skin girlfriend of mine.</li>
    <li> This kit rocks!  My skin is fair and \\&quot;normal\\&quot;...not oily, not dry, with the occasional monster zip that crops up.  My skin is also pretty dull.  This kit, along with the handy three part tutorial on how to use the product, really brought a healthy glow to my face that wasn&#x27;t overly shimmery, too bronzed, or too pink.  (Tip: use the blush sparingly.  A little goes a long way.)  The end result looks really natural.  This kit does not come with any brushes, so at the very least, you&#x27;ll need a blush brush and a foundation brush.  Unfortunately, this kit probably wouldn&#x27;t work if your complexion is darker that fair/medium.</li>
    <li> Best palette ever for no makeup makeup :)</li>
    <li> Lose parts every time if open the box get stuck in th magnet .nit too happy about this palette  ,packing was ok  and on time</li>
    <li> I regularly use only two of the palette. The blush is too pink and I prefer a powder to a cream. I like the lightest highlighter- concealer and the bronzing veil. The quality is good.  It is inconvenient for me to get to a Sephora or other place where I could try before I buy, so I took a chance. Can&#x27;t blame the product for that.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Works great and is really helpful and teaches you different ways to contour your face! Definitly would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this compact, product gives skin a lovely radiance and intakes up little space in make up case...buy it!</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and the colors are perfect for me. The bronzer is my favorite because it is the first bronzer I&#x27;ve found that is light enough for my skin tone. It is a sheer bronze with a slight shimmer.The powder blush is a very pretty pink and gives a subtle, natural flush to my cheeks. I don&#x27;t use the concealer in this palette very often, but I like the luminizer for a little highlight. It is a very useful palette, and you will love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a word of caution: There are counterfeit versions of these palettes being sold online. The fakes are convincing and hard to spot unless you look very closely. I bought a fake (not from Amazon), before I bought a genuine one, and the only clue was that two words were misspelled on the back of the box the palette came in. So be careful because the counterfeit ones can contain lead and other contaminants. I have never seen this palette sell for under thirty dollars, even with a very good sale, so if the price is too low and the seller isn&#x27;t licensed to sell Too Faced products, be cautious.</li>
    <li> I just got this kit in, I LOVE it, I also love the natural palette by too faced as well. I am an olive skin and ordered this product and then saw in it person and I was scared that it would be to light and was more for fair skin tones. But blending is the key in this palette it goes great with my skin and really does look fresh and light. I will be using this and the other palette I ordered from now on</li>
    <li> This product was beautiful on.  I honestly cannot recommend it enough.  When I run out - I&#x27;ll be buying it again</li>
    <li> Bought this thinking it was the original. Packaging is flimsy. First and last time I will buy something like this online</li>
    <li> This is something I will ALWAYS have in my makeup kit. I use it every single day and it&#x27;s by far my favorite palette. Really good for the fair to medium-fair complexion. Love, love, love this palette!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good stuff but I really only ever use the bronzer. Good quality makeup and I would recommend it. Very light makeup not cakey and the give you a little booklet with makeup ideas and I really liked that.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and the colors in the palette still work well for me. They&#x27;re easy to apply and the three different tutorials are great. I don&#x27;t use it every day but for days I want a little kick to my appearance without heavy eye make up or lipstick this is great. I also love it for evening looks.</li>
    <li> My face has never looked better! It&#x27;s a wonderful product available at a lower price! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again</li>
    <li> I love this stuff~!  If I take my make up off I look blotchy and red in spots, dark circles, etc.  This gives me a clean look and I feel more confident without makeup around my boyfriend.  He doesn&#x27;t care, but I do!  This is great stuff - worth the money!</li>
    <li> I am super light with red hair. My pale skin is always a set back with makeup being too dark. This actually was too light for my skin. I think it could have been a tad darker but other than that it was perfect. Not going to knock stars for that since anyone with darker skin would have benifited from the lighter color. Easy to apply even with just the finger tips. Came through mail fast. Easy to follow instructions if you need them. I am able to use this alone or over a BB cream for a flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy instructions.&lt;br /&gt;- Fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;-Good price for quality.&lt;br /&gt;-Good product even for troubled skin. Has not caused breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;-Smooth application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Tad too light in color.</li>
    <li> I was really happy with this product. Some days when I&#x27;m in a hurry I grab this palette and throw on concealer and mineral veil then use the creme blush for cheeks and lips too. Very pretty on lips but dry so I use Chapstick over it. Then I finish with mascara :) overall great product and great to carry around in purse for touch ups!</li>
    <li> If this isn&#x27;t counterfeit, it&#x27;s the worst product Too Faced has ever made.  Based on the testers I&#x27;ve seen at Ulta, the real palette isn&#x27;t this flimsy and the formulas are actually pigmented and blendable instead of either rock hard powder or grease paint.  While the wording is accurate, the extremely low quality of the palette and contents have convinced me this is a fake.  The colors barely show up on my pale skin and have a short wear time, the concealer conceals nothing, and the lid is slightly offset so it doesn&#x27;t close firmly.</li>
    <li> I was afraid that it will be too dark or too light on my skin but it was just right! I have light medium skin tone. The case is appealing and opens with ease. There is even a small card that shows you how to do different looks! The cream brush is really creamy so a little bit of it goes a long way! Overall, love this product!</li>
    <li> This is great for on the go, can use to do your entire face if needed</li>
    <li> This product makes your skin look so naturally gorgeous. It&#x27;s my secret weapon. I got one for my sisters. It&#x27;s really appropriately named. It looks like your not wearing makeup.</li>
    <li> I saw this was on sale and since I love Two Faced cosmetics I decided to give it a try. I didn&#x27;t expect to be so pleasantly surprised with this compact. The blush is creamy, the concealer works all day and each product blends flawlessly to give me the \\&quot;no make up\\&quot; look. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. If I could take just one cosmetic item with me when I travel this would win hands down.</li>
    <li> Fabulous. I use it everyday</li>
    <li> I just wore this for the second day &amp; have never been so confident that I nailed the look. The instruction card simplifies &amp; reduces experimentation time, while product quality soars above competition, all wrapped up in a charming tin.  I&#x27;m in bed after a long day &amp; it still looks great.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have very sensitive skin and I have has no problems with this makeup. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Cute litttle compact. Nothing particularly transformative if you&#x27;ve been wearing makeup more than a few years. However, it is a nice compact to travel with and have in my purse. Colors are neutral are fairly universal. The powder blusher is heavily pigmented and one must use a light touch. My only problem is the darn thing won&#x27;t stay closed and requires a hair tie.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re easy to apply and the three different tutorials are great.</li>
    <li> If you have lovely, perfectly smooth skin with minimal pores, no wrinkles, and no crowâ€™s feet  I shall assume this product is just suited for you.  For the rest of us with all the aforementioned skin concerns this product is a waste of time and money.  I have been using makeup for over 30 years, and I am confident in saying I am quite adept at application.  With applying the product sparingly I looked like a clown with a caked on mess. My wrinkles and pores were severely enhanced by using this product.  At the same rate--it felt uncomfortable on my skin.  The best place for this compact is in the garbage.  Iâ€™ll stick to my lovely BB cream purchased in England and I look 100 times better with it....and much younger.</li>
    <li> love this compact!!!! colors are great for a summer look! Great size to put in my purse. A great buy!!!</li>
    <li> I love TOO FACED products and this is another product to add to my must haves! The colors are great for my skin tone and they blend very well. The concealer is very bendable and covers well and looks natural. The luminizer gives a nice &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34; look without being &amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34;! The bronzer and blush are not too dark, just enough to give you a natural glow My only concern was, when I got this product, the creme blush had condensation all over it. I was a little concerned that it was going to be old or ruined because of the water on it. But, I believe because it was cold when shipping that that is why there was condensation. With that said, the creme blush was fine and I have no issues with it. I love this product for when I am in a hurry or working long hours and don&#x27;t have time or feel like doing my makeup perfectly. I just throw some on this on my face and I look a million times better with little effort. Love this stuff. Def. a good buy!</li>
    <li> Great product! I have used many products over the years but this is by far one of my favorite make-up purchases ever!</li>
    <li> I Love this make up. Every discount store brand of makeup I have ever tried has made my face and eyes itchy. With this brand, I don&#x27;t have that I can wear it all day with no irritation. The coverage is fantastic, and it stays all day with very few touch ups. Worth the price for me.</li>
    <li> This arrived broken due  to poor packaging but was able to get some use of it, I just have to be very careful. I could tell this was authentic. I hate sellers that sell rip offs, so thank you for not deceiving me! Too faced makeup pallets are great. I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> I wish I discovered this years ago!!! It&#x27;s so perfect---especially on the job. I recommend this highly to all individuals that want a &amp;#34;fresh face&amp;#34; appearance. (And you can always turn it up with a bold eye shadow and liner.) The &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; cards are great! Love, love, love! One tip: Invest in a few nice application brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m to old, sent to my daughter. She likes it. Don&#x27;t no yet. Haven&#x27;t heard from heard yet. Good bye.</li>
    <li> Beautiful natural colors that last all day</li>
    <li> I have just received the too faced no makeup makeup palette today. I was very disappointed when I opened the package. Although the product was surrounded in bubble wrap, it seems that did not help much. A chunk of the bronzing veil came out and spilled into all the creamy-consistency makeup compartments. The cheap-looking sticker around the mirror is very crinkled and messy from some excess makeup. This product was simply just too expensive to come in this sort of condition. I&#x27;m happy with the makeup itself, but disappointed in the presentation of it. Specks of powder makeup are in all the compartments. Ps in the pic I have not touched it, except to brush off the powder on the black surrounding frame. Great product, and maybe this doesn&#x27;t happen to everyone and it just happened to me.</li>
    <li> Pricey but I like having all the colors in one palette. Very pretty!</li>
    <li> Most of this kit was nice and very neutral but the blush was a little too pink for my taste.</li>
    <li> This kit is okay. I keep it in my purse for a touch up but it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long. For the high price I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
