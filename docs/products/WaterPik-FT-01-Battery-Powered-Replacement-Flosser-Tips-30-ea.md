### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I was very happy to find the replacement tips.</li>
      <li>I have used these for years, as an excellent alternative to using string floss.</li>
      <li>These work great.</li>
      <li>Flosser tips are great.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so happy to bind them as they don&#x27;t seem to be&lt;br /&gt;available</li>
      <li>The water pik tips are good.  </li>
      <li>These fit perfectly</li>
      <li>Otherwise they&#x27;re really good.</li>
      <li>I am quite satisfied with the performance.  </li>
      <li>They are flossing more now.</li>
      <li>I have also ordered more as I bought a Flosser for my Granddaughters.  </li>
      <li>So glad I can still find these.</li>
      <li>Perhaps some sort of lid would keep them more secure in the dispenser.  </li>
      <li>And kind of fun, too.</li>
      <li>The WaterPik battery kit makes it easy.</li>
      <li>Quick and easy to use and replace.</li>
      <li>Was a great price on the replacement heads for this product and work really well with unit and will last for awhile.</li>
      <li>My dentist has always been pleased, if not surprised, with the outcome, versus most patients,  for years,.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fast, convenient, and comfortable.</li>
      <li>Item exactly as described and it was received quickly.  </li>
      <li>I am trying to keep caps that I have had for the last fifty years.  :)</li>
      <li>I think I even ordered flosser tips that were meant for a different model and I&#x27;ve found them easier to use and more durable than the ones I ought to have bought.</li>
      <li>Different than original</li>
      <li>I reuse them even they recommend using a new one each time (of course!)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not entirely sure they do as good a job as regular dental floss, but it&#x27;s a heck of a lot easier and faster to use an electric flosser than just dental floss.</li>
      <li>Love these little teeth pickers, sure expensive, but I keep in my car and floss on the way to work.</li>
      <li>I found both the company and the product exactly as advertized and extremely helpful!</li>
      <li>great product, I was afraid they had quit making them, but amazon scores again!  </li>
      <li>Little problem, tho, when there are just a few left in the pack, they tend to fall out easily.  </li>

<li> Anything that makes flossing even a little easier or faster is welcomed at my house.</li>
<li> However, the tips are not readily available for purchase, they have to be ordered online and shipping charges are applied which makes them costly for every day use.</li>
<li> Difficult to find in stores anymore.</li>
<li> Unless I hear a bad report from my hygienist, I&#x27;ll be using these from now on.</li>
<li> I hate flossing.</li>

    <li> Love these little teeth pickers, sure expensive, but I keep in my car and floss on the way to work. I reuse them even they recommend using a new one each time (of course!)</li>
    <li> cleans in between those cheeks</li>
    <li> So glad I can still find these. Difficult to find in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Just as I had expected and wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I would order again.</li>
    <li> Received order as described and in a timely manner. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find the replacement tips. I have also ordered more as I bought a Flosser for my Granddaughters.  They are flossing more now.</li>
    <li> I have used the WaterPik battery powered flosser for a couple of years.  I am quite satisfied with the performance.  However, the tips are not readily available for purchase, they have to be ordered online and shipping charges are applied which makes them costly for every day use. Four stars because I cannot purchase in drugstore locally and have to pay shipping.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as advertised and works well.</li>
    <li> great product, I was afraid they had quit making them, but amazon scores again!  Quick and easy to use and replace.</li>
    <li> Flosser tips are great.  Little problem, tho, when there are just a few left in the pack, they tend to fall out easily.  Perhaps some sort of lid would keep them more secure in the dispenser.  Otherwise they&#x27;re really good.</li>
    <li> The water pik tips are good.  My dentist is having me use them nightly along with a Spinbrush twice a day and flossing after every meal. I am trying to keep caps that I have had for the last fifty years.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t looked to see if you sell Spinbrush refills.</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described and it was received quickly.  Will use again.</li>
    <li> Must have with power handle</li>
    <li> I completely agree with a previous reviewer.&lt;br /&gt; I have used these for years, as an excellent alternative to using string floss. Fast, convenient, and comfortable. My dentist has always been pleased, if not surprised, with the outcome, versus most patients,  for years,.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it appears that they have changed the thickness or formulation of the plastic use for the tips, and the as they are now substantially less rigid  with the  results that they bend and become almost useless far more quicklly.. It&#x27;s disappointing to see such a formerly superior  product degenerate into such a poor and somewhat useless product, to save ...perhaps perhaps $100/ 1, 000,000 tips.</li>
