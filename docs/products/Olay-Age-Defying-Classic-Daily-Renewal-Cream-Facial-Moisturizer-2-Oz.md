<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it. came early and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
    <li> This Serum is a great one I am use every single day in the morning and in the night is a really special for our age.  Well I will say for all age is a lot better to start early to taking care to our skin.</li>
    <li> Makes my face smooth and soft!!</li>
    <li> I like this product as a day cream however it lack sun protection.  It is light and absorbs nicely, I like that but I feel it needs to add some SPF so next time I will try something else</li>
    <li> I like the way this cream goes on and makes my skin feel smooth. The smell is is betetr than other creams on the market.</li>
    <li> Another useless waste of money</li>
    <li> Need to find a sale and re purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice light cream but very hydrating. Especially like it during the humid summer months.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizing product at a super reasonable price. I always reorder as soon as I am out.</li>
    <li> I do this each morning and have noticed a change the past month!  Lines are not as noticeable:)</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I love it. It feels great on my skin, very lightweight, and smells great, although the smell is very faint. I can tell a difference already in the appearance of my skin. I have been using this product for three weeks, and I feel it is erasing my wrinkles and firming my skin. also, it does not cause acne or any other blemishes. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This product was alright. My aunt swears by it so I bought it to see but I wasn&#x27;t as impressed. The Nuetrogena Healthy Skin Wrinkle Cream works much better!</li>
    <li> Great day cream with serum; will buy again.</li>
    <li> The texture of this serum is more creamy then I expected. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I like the way this serum is absorbed so quickly and it leaves my face nice and soft. I have also noticed a more even skin tone. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use it in the morning - really hard to tell if it is helping - don&#x27;t know what my skin would look like without. hopefully it is helping me not to look any worse!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product. However I need to give it more time and see if it&#x27;s actually works. So far it made my skin smoother but I stil have the fine lines under my eyes</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It smells so fresh and clean.  I don&#x27;t put it on my eyes, as it says not to, so I use an eye cream along with it.  I will definitely get this again.</li>
    <li> I love this,  and use it daily!</li>
    <li> very good for summer day cream, not heavy and yet does the job</li>
    <li> Love this product! My skin loves it and my makeup goes on beautifully. So happy I was able to order it through Amazon - great price and great service. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s highly unusual (read: I never have) that I buy a beauty cream more than once. I just finished my second bottle, and I&#x27;m back for a third.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stats: sensitive, combination skin, hypothyroid, 45 years, female, active, outdoorsy, swimmer, hiker, equestrian, sun worshipper, water drinker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not irritate my skin, or cause breakouts. I&#x27;ve been using it for 1.5 years, but don&#x27;t use it during very cold winter weather. It isn&#x27;t enough moisturizer to handle my outdoor lifestyle in the freezing cold. I don&#x27;t hold that against it because not much does. I consider it a three season daily use item, with it being insufficient to combat the northeast winters of NY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a definite reduction in wrinkles (crows feet, marionette lines). I don&#x27;t have any deep lines, but the more shallow lines are much better after about 2 weeks daily use. My skin feels softer, more elastic, and has has a smoother texture. I get complimented frequently on how nice it looks. I notice if I don&#x27;t use it after almost a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is slightly viscous, and moves easily on the skin. The consistency is like that of hyaluronic acid, but with a touch of cream.  It isn&#x27;t watery, and is not nearly as heavy as something like cold cream. The color is off white with warm overtones (I don&#x27;t know why I thought I should write that, but there you have it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use two presses of the tube for my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightly fragranced, but not enough to offend my slightly sensitive nose. It&#x27;s not a natural smelling fragrance, though..not chemical, just lightly scented. I&#x27;m not the fragrance police type...just fussy about smelling too perfume-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this has performed as advertised for me, and I will continue to use it as long as it does. I have no expectations that it will stop doing so.</li>
    <li> I use the olay moisture cream along with this cream and I love the results.  The moisture cream hydrates my skin and this one fights wrinkles. Amazing results!!</li>
    <li> THE BEST MOISTURIZER FOR UNDER MAKE UP OR ALONE!!  :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never found a moisturizer that works perfectly for my skin, but this comes close.  It feels good going on my face and neck and does a good job.  It certainly doesn&#x27;t get rid of wrinkles, but I believe they are not popping up as frequently.  And it definitely was preventative for my neck wrinkles.  I am buying again.</li>
    <li> It last for a long time and feels devine.  My skin stays soft. I would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;great product.</li>
    <li> The scent is overpowering, I tried it once but I&#x27;m unable to use it again; pimples were on my face the following day, and it was itchy. I must hesitate to clarify that I&#x27;m sensitive to most scented facial products, and that really sucks, because most facial products are scented.  Needles to say, I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> Love this product I will def keep using this!</li>
    <li> Great serum and moustourizer, I have normal to dry skin and it worked great. Just a sgane that its a dat cream but it doesnt have SPF</li>
    <li> I like this serum the best over competitive brands.  Even tried shopping channel items for twice the price and 1/2 the quanity and they don&#x27;t measure up.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Most moisturizers make my face feel greasy and this one just makes it feel silky! Soaks in quickly but doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and I have really sensitive skin. I ordered this to try it after I got the pro-x scrubber and finally, in my 30s, feel like I have a grown up skin care regimen that&#x27;s really working for me.</li>
    <li> Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic seller.&lt;br /&gt;Everything is great!</li>
    <li> SO amazing... I was hesitant to buy this cause I hadn&#x27;t heard much about this but the reviews were good so i decided to try it and just like it says on the package it makes you look your best every day.. It fights wrinkles but the serum in it is the most perfect makeup base I have ever tried and I have tried SOOO many.. I love this stuff and will never be without it. My skin has become so much better and my makeup look great every day.. BIG difference I saw and it stays that way now for a month..</li>
    <li> will need at least a month more to see if there is a good improvment then i will have a better view</li>
    <li> This is pretty good stuff and much less expensive than the other things I&#x27;ve used.  Non greasy too.</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews for this product before purchasing.  Not only does this product make my skin feel silky and smell good, I have already started to see an improvement.  I love this product and highly recommend it.  You don&#x27;t have to spend an arm and leg to get results.</li>
    <li> Been using Oil of Olay since I was 18, am now 48, and started the age defying 2-1 about 6 months ago.  Wrinkles are being held at bay, firm skin.  Very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect day moisturizer for me. I&#x27;m 46 with combination sensitive skin. This isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts. Great under makeup.</li>
    <li> The fragrance makes my nose stuffy.</li>
    <li> Feels great on the face. Hope it has done its anti-wrinkle job, wish we were able to count our own wrinkles. :-)</li>
    <li> Was hesitant to buy this since I&#x27;m a cocoa brown skinned lady in my early 30&#x27;s and in the past when I&#x27;ve tried many of these wrinkle or anti-age creams, (preventative measures!), even when beginning with a washed face, using just a dab of this and thoroughly rubbing in, I somehow still after awhile end up looking like Casper the single and discouraged 30 something ghost. That or when I apply my foundation after allowing ample absorption and dry time for the cream, it seems to grab onto the cream and they both unite together to cause cream/foundation residue gunk like rollies to form all over my face, so I&#x27;d end up washing my face again and starting from scratch. So I started either applying just a few drops in the am, do nails or hair waiting for absorption, then foundation or applying this at night and resume regimen in the am and it&#x27;s a winner!</li>
    <li> Normally, I am a Lancôme user. I had heard good things about this product and decided to give it a try.  Well. 2 month later and I have to say that it is a &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; product if you are looking for a moisturizer. It is not an anti-wrinkle cream. When you apply it, it is light and refreshing. Your skin comes to life.  Your daily makeup goes on smoother and that is nice. There has been zero difference in fine lines.</li>
    <li> I love this product , this is my second bottle and will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> Olay has never disappointed.  I have tried all types of moisturizers that would also diminish blemish marks.  This works... noticeable difference within a week.</li>
    <li> I dont really use this everyday but it seems to do the job. I feel smooth and look younger. I like it</li>
    <li> I use this everyday…once in the morning after showering, and again at bedtime after washing my face. It does not cause any breakouts, and is not too heavy like some moisturizers can be. I have been using this now for almost 2 years, and although a little pricey, a bottle usually lasts me almost 6 months.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion. It&#x27;s not heavy at all, but it&#x27;s very moisturizing. It also doesn&#x27;t have SPF, which I like. Too many lotions have SPF, and I end up not being able to tan!</li>
    <li> I have under eye wrinkles due from sinus but haven&#x27;t used this long enough to see if it firms the under eye problems will continue to use. It smells good and only need a little I use this under make up and acts a little like a primer.</li>
    <li> I love this product! This is the best product, it makes your face feel so good, I even use it on my hands too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a product that made my face feel this good. I recommend this product to everybody!&lt;br /&gt;I always give this cream as a gift to my friends.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice.  Non greasy.  After using for several weeks, lines do not appear as deep.  Skin is smoother.  Will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I love Olay period but I really like this cream &amp; serum combo. It has a nice smell for one but the cream is very velvety and goes on so smoothly. I love the feel of it.</li>
    <li> I am 50 and you know as life is at 50 you should have some wrinkes on your face, but this cream , after using it everyday every morning makes you feel so good as good as you are, it makes you look as 40!!! so I really recomend it, the price is so good too, we women sometime deserve to give us a gift from us to us.</li>
    <li> My favorite face lotion</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for my mother. She absolutely loves it and she kept complaining when she ran out so I bought her another bottle of it. :) it gives just enough moisture. It isn&#x27;t heavy and it feels light and cool on your skin.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was ok.  I didn&#x27;t think it was any better than what I was using previously, but it had a lot of good reviews so thought I would give it a try. Maybe it works better on some than others.</li>
    <li> I can see a real difference when I use this. My skin is clearer and the tone is more even. It goes on very smooth and makes my skin feel silky. I wish it had sunscreen, but I just put some SPF 30 on top of it.</li>
    <li> I like the way this cream goes on smoothly.  That&#x27;s the serum part.  I don&#x27;t expect miracles from any cream but this one is pleasant and I like the application.</li>
    <li> When I bought this product I expected it to be more of wrinkle corrective product.  This product is really a combination of a moisturizer and a finishing cream which doesn&#x27;t actually correct wrinkles--it just helps to hide the appearance.  It does go on light weight and the texture it provides does allow for makeup to go on very smoothly.</li>
    <li> This cream/serum is so nice.  It glides on without using a lot and goes immediately into your skin without any greasy feeling.  I love it and continue to use it.  I am 74 and have sensitive skin and it does not irritate my skin at all which is saying something for the cold dry snowy smoggy environment I live in.</li>
    <li> I am 32 years old, I don&#x27;t have much experience with anti-wrinkle creams. I do have very sensitive skin, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it and in the three weeks I have used the product I have noticed my wrinkles have faded. I know they are there, but I don&#x27;t think they are as noticeable.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month now and like it very well.  It might not work quite as well as the more expensive products, but it comes close and the price is much better !!</li>
    <li> Product and packaging as expected.</li>
    <li> I really like how it feels on my face.  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Based on my observation, this is one of the best day creams, it is not greasy and it softens my skin and I can feel the tightening of my skin every time I use this. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This works well to help make the skin less wrinkled.  It puffs the skin up to lessen the wrinkles and gives it a nice smooth texture.</li>
    <li> Good but nothing special</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fine lotion, but doesn&#x27;t do much else. doesn&#x27;t reduce appearance of fine lines or wrinkles like it says but it felt like it was moisturizing. Has a pretty strong &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; smell that my wife liked. I won&#x27;t order it again, only because it didn&#x27;t do what i was hoping it would.</li>
    <li> have used this for years now and I don&#x27;t think will stop using it any time soon...</li>
    <li> Love this under my makeup.  Leaves my face so incredibly smooth</li>
    <li> Always get compliments for looking younger than my age, have been using this product for years!</li>
    <li> I have normal skin and this has been so wonderful to me. My sister has even asked me to get her some!! I&#x27;ve found it hard to find but thanks to Amazon it is just a click away!!!</li>
    <li> This olay age serum works well goods on non greasy.</li>
    <li> I liked the product, but it is scented and I am usually around two people who cannot tolerate scented cosmetics.  Thus, I only use it on the weekends.  If I purchase again, it will be an unscented cream.</li>
    <li> I like the way it makes my skin feel and after I apply it the fine lines are covered.</li>
    <li> awesome product.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Did not like it seen no difference</li>
    <li> I really like this! I have seen the commercials and the reviews so I thought I would give it a try. I was going to buy locally from a store but Amazon had the best price by at least a few dollars. I was already placing an order and since I have prime I figured why not! I will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> Trying this to overcome winter dry patches on my forehead this winter. Tried a different cosmetic treatment recently for temporary under eye puffiness, which did not work at all for me, but I have used OLAY products for years. The smell of this is very nice and I like the way it is easily absorbed into my skin. So far I&#x27;m trying this at night, waking up to less dry skin this winter will be nice. I appreciated the quick shipment (WAY TO GO AMAZON PRIME!) but also liked the much better price here at Amazon than the drug store. I only use Olay skin cream(s) now; I have tried a lot of beauty/cosmetics and Olay just does a great job for me. I feel pampered when I use this Anti-wrinkle cream and the feel-good factor is always ok with me.</li>
    <li> Sorta greasy and shiny, but does moisturize very well. Like that we can get it delivered on a recurring schedule.</li>
    <li> very easy to use, keeps your face moisturized during the day.  Used  for years.</li>
    <li> not sure about it yet</li>
    <li> Keeps my face feeling nice and smooth, less wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Used a month a no visual results, not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase again. For the reasonable price I didn&#x27;t expect expect a lot.</li>
    <li> I never go a day without using this stuff! It&#x27;s light but effective and works well under make up, nice scent as well.</li>
    <li> love this lotion. i can&#x27;t live without it. Its not greasy and keeps my face soft and hopefully line free. that ia yet to be told</li>
    <li> I use it previously  like it but could not find it in stores  Has a nice fragrance and goes on smoothly</li>
    <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I gave this another try, because part of the reason I originally quit using it was a suspicion that it was clogging my pores, in a way that wasn&#x27;t going away, like a zit would. I couldn&#x27;t prove it, after only a short time using it, so I just quit, and let it go. I decided that was a waste, so I tried it on the back of my wrinkly old hand, where I could see results, or  not, easily.  Unfortunately, I got two big zit like lumps on the back of my hand that I tried it on, the very next day, and they still haven&#x27;t gone down, and it&#x27;s been over a month!  That is too much of a coincidence to ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit, I do have sensitive skin, but I have never  used any product that caused permanent lumps/zits, and this is just too risky for me to use. I suggest, if you have sensitive skin, that you try it on your hand first, to see if it clogs your pores, before you lather it on  your face. None of the clogs on my face or hands seems to be going away, and it&#x27;s been a really long time since they came, and after only one use on my hand, it&#x27;s a pretty fast test to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;OK, so I&#x27;ve been using the \\&quot;Olay Age Defying Classic Daily Renewal Cream\\&quot; for a couple of years now, and while I LOVE the feel of my skin from using that, it&#x27;s done nothing for the wrinkles. This one specifically says \\&quot;Anti-Wrinkle Day Cream\\&quot;, instead of just \\&quot;Age Defying\\&quot; so I figured, what the heck, let&#x27;s try it. It was more expensive, so I thought maybe it would work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it, but I didn&#x27;t care for the slimy texture of it, and it didn&#x27;t go very far, either. I used it only on the wrinkles, rather than my whole face, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it makes my skin feel, but because it doesn&#x27;t rub in very well, and all my wrinkles are on the thinnest skin around my eyes, I felt like I was doing more harm than good, with all the rubbing and pulling, to get it rubbed in, so I quit using it after about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I can&#x27;t speak to the anti-wrinkle aspect of it after only a week, but I do love the \\&quot;Olay cream\\&quot; I&#x27;ve been using, so I&#x27;ll just live with the wrinkles, and keep my baby soft skin, instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may or may not help with wrinkles, but I just didn&#x27;t like using it. Nothing horrible, just prefer the cream, and this is pretty expensive, anyway.only a week, but I do love the \\&quot;Olay cream\\&quot; I&#x27;ve been using, so I&#x27;ll just live with the wrinkles, and keep my baby soft skin, instead.    This may or may not help with wrinkles, but I just didn&#x27;t like using it. Nothing horrible, just prefer the cream, and this is pretty expensive, anyway.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 6 months. I love the way it feels on face and keeps my makeup on. Does not leave skin shiny like other products I have tried. I use olay regenerist makeup and it seems to act as primer. What a bonus.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes my face very nicely. I have sensitive skin and it has not irritated it at all. Keeps my face glowing through out the day along with make up put on top of it.</li>
    <li> I was hard pressed to see any serious change.  Your age is your age.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, but I&#x27;ll be using as a hand cream.  The fragrance is too strong to use on my face and gives me a headache.</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and I love this as a moisturizer, especially under makeup. It is so silky, going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was buying this in the double pack at Sam&#x27;s, but then they didn&#x27;t have it last time I was there. This price was even better, and it came in a small box, not the horrid heavy cardboard and plastic packaging in the double pack at Sam&#x27;s that is nearly impossible to open without injury. I&#x27;ll buy it at Amazon from now on.</li>
    <li> Olay age Defying 2-in-1 anti-Wrinkle Day Cream is great.  I love the way it feels going on and I think it helps exfoliate my skin. Don&#x27;t know if my wrinkles are less, but I am not a youngster.</li>
    <li> This is  a nice combination of serum and moisturizer.  Light, but very effective. It does not have sunscreen in it, but otherwiise, it is a great product.</li>
    <li> It goes on very smooth. I use it under the foundation and I have notice smoother skin. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Olay is so good for me....it makes me look 74 and I am not 74 until November...good huh?  haha</li>
    <li> Makes a good base under foundation in the morning.  Helps skin feel firm.</li>
    <li> I use this on my neck. It is inexpensive and works well on this area. Keeps me from having chicken neck without the cost of some neck creams. I&#x27;m 51 and highly recomend this for the neck area.</li>
    <li> This is one awesome product,for sun damaged skin like mine.It really does what it says,moisturizes and it does smooth the fine lines to make a nice glow.I am a 49 yr old male and this olay product is incredible!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this with high hopes that it would stand up to my $60 cream, and it did. I actually noticed a change in my laugh lines, they were less noticeable - which is something that my expensive cream didn&#x27;t accomplish.  So, needless to say, that for the price, this cream is really great.  I use it every day now and it&#x27;s just great.  It does have a scent, which I personally love, but I guess for those who are sensitive that could be an issue.</li>
    <li> It has made the appearance of my skin look softer.</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff for my skin.</li>
    <li> My mom like it very much！Thank you！</li>
    <li> Olay Age Defying 2-In-1 Anti-Wrinkle Day Cream + Serum 1.7 Fl Oz  works well in smoothing my facial skin texture for optimal results when applying liquid makeup or mineral powder.</li>
    <li> This cream is great. Not greasy and absorbs quickly. Light, but does the job of a heavier moisturizer. I use it day and night. I saw immediate improvement within the first 2 weeks. It is one of the few face creams that does not make me oily or breakout. I paid under $9 and received it in 2 days. I received 2 bottles and realized the add actually said 2 bottles but I did not read clearly. I am glad now that 2 bottles came because this cream is AWESOME! I am not greasy and sweaty feeling, it has a very light clean scent, and absorbs immediately. A little goes a long way. The only reason I gave 4 stars as it does NOT have sunscreen. I live in AZ and my day cream must have a 70 SPF or higher, so I am forced to put sunscreen over this in the daytime. The company would be better served to offer the same cream for day with an added sunscreen. I will purchase again for night use, but will look around for another day moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.came fast.all good</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly, sinks in the skin, but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I use with my Clarisonic Opal device around my eyes as well as the rest of my face.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds at all different prices, I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Not greasy, great face cream. use it everyday.</li>
    <li> ... but I can&#x27;t honestly tell you if the stuff works (or maybe I can!) as my mother uses it and she&#x27;s 83 and looks 53... so maybe there&#x27;s something to it! I bought this for her Xmas and Birthday. (This is my wife posting as she used my account to order it). :-)</li>
    <li> I like it.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have tried probably ten expensive serums and eye and wrinkle creams. This is one of the best. Since I&#x27;ve started using it on the sun-damaged skin of my decollete area, I have seen an improvement in the skin&#x27;s texture and appearance. I kid you not and have no reason to exaggerate.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I have extremely sensitive and dry skin and this product does not irritate my skin unlike some others such as those which contain argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;Olay is a relatively expensive brand; however, there are numerous similar products which cost far more. Compared to those, I prefer this one.&lt;br /&gt;On a humorous note, I let my mother-in-law try it and she liked it so much she tried to swipe it...so I gave her a couple for Christmas.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great--I tried some my sister had left at our house and it took care of a dry and irritated patch of skin on my forehead (that I&#x27;ve had for about a year) in two days. Gone. Plus it does what it says--it makes you look like you on a good day, every day. Dewy skin, not greasy. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> This product does wonders to my face have been using it for a little over 2 years and i am 60yr but my friends always say i look at least  10 yrs younger thanks to using oil of olay lotion and now this olay age defying 2 in 1 anti wrinkle day cream n serum</li>
    <li> This is an easy to use, light weight product.  No residue.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps skin more firm, minimizes poors, and make a&lt;br /&gt;good base for make-up to follow.</li>
    <li> My husband has done a couple reviews on purchases on Amazon, but I personally never have. I wanted to save it for something really worth it. I FOUND THAT THING REALLY WORTH IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned 31 a couple of months ago and I started seeing scowl lines between my eyebrows and a few soft lines for crows feet. I am not vain, but I want to delay aging as long as I can. I am a mom of 3 girls (a 4.5 year old and twin 2.5 year olds) as well as work from home 55 hours a week. I don&#x27;t want to spend a bunch of money on something for myself (I prefer to spend them on good diapers or fun educational toys), but I needed SOMETHING to help with anti-aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Olay&#x27;s BB cream and while I loved the color, it made me breakout like a teenager. Out it went. I googled forever to find something affordable and worked. I wasn&#x27;t about to spend $40-$200 on something that *might* work or made me breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then... I found this $11 wonder. If it didn&#x27;t work, no big deal, at least I had a moisturizer that hopefully wouldn&#x27;t make me breakout. OHhhhh, but it not only made my skin SUPER SOFT and didn&#x27;t make me breakout, but it works AMAZIIIINNNNNNGGGGG!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. The two lines between my eyebrows are plumped up and GONE. I&#x27;ve had those lines for at least 3-4 years. The fine lines around my eyes are far less noticeable. I had a line under each of my eyes that I thought was from exhaustion or swollen from lack of water. NO, it was aging!!! The lines are almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is it does have fragrance, so if you have super sensitive skin, I wouldn&#x27;t get it. If you get it into your eyes, it does burn a bit from the chemicals and scent. It does tingle where you apply it the thickest. I use it as both a wrinkle treatment and as a regular moisturizer and put a thicker amount on the wrinkles and around my eyes to get more absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helped! I am buying this again as soon as I run out! :)</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  Keeps skin moist all day.&lt;br /&gt;Very light and just need to use a dab.  Good smell, but very light.&lt;br /&gt;Really makes a difference.  Use with the Night cream and you&lt;br /&gt;will see noticeable results FAST.  Will buy again !</li>
    <li> this makes my face so soft!</li>
    <li> Love it!  It feels great on your skin.  If you have ever used Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, it feels just like that. It feels velvety and soft.  Goes on VERY light.  NOT greasy at all.  It feels almost like powder.  Smells good too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that it doesn&#x27;t have a SPF.  But this serum is meant to be applied before your daily moisturizer, which I use one with a SPF.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy formula! I&#x27;ve been looking forever for a daytime anti-wrinkle cream and what I&#x27;ve tried so far would leave my face and neck feeling greasy and dirty. Olay 2-in-1 is great! It makes my face and neck feel smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> Goes on so smoothly. I can feel the moisturizer working all day. Too soon to say how the wrinkle part works, but, I trust Oil of Olay to do the work.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday on a clean face and neck. Soften skin, minimizes laugh lines around eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Olay products for many years. Have been satisfied with their products. Last about 2 months.</li>
    <li> this stuff smells nice, and seems like a quality product but def did not WOW me. The price could be a bit lower....</li>
    <li> I love this day cream.  This is now part of my daily routine.  This is one of those products I can&#x27;t live without.  I have been using this for about six months and use this in combination with another Olay day cream.  Very light and easy to apply makeup on top of.  This has defiantly improved my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Its a nice cream but I would have chose the other product by Olay the 7 something. Was a decent buy.</li>
    <li> This serum and day cream combo has a wonderfully light but emollient consistency with a slightly pearlized look and a fragrance that is reminiscent of the way the original Infinity serum smelled. If you like Olay products already, you know pretty much all you need to know. I am almost 50, have very slight wrinkles, some dryness in some areas of my face and I still get slightly oily in my T-zone. I like to use both serums and moisturizer every day. I&#x27;m not going to claim that this stuff changed my life, but I will say that I love the fragrance, the light consistency, the way it feels on my skin (never heavy) and the fact that it won&#x27;t react oddly with my foundation makeup (you know, the dreaded roly poly balls that sometimes happen when you pair certain types of products together) These qualities all make it a win for me.I don&#x27;t know if it will actually prevent or help wrinkles for you, but I think staying moisturized is key to making your skin look smoother!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: If you are not a fan of fragrance in your facial products, don&#x27;t order this. If you do like a pretty floral scent, this is lovely and fresh!</li>
    <li> This age defying 2 in 1 serum from olay was a disappointment. It did nothing to help with the lines in my soul patch area and my face. It smells really good and it does moisturize my skin but it doesn&#x27;t help the scars or lines on my face.</li>
    <li> And is well suited for products</li>
    <li> I was really stupid to put this around my eyes, the directions themselves say to avoid contact with your eyes! The reason why I did it was because this product really does make my skin feel more moisturized and healthier. That said, for my eyes it just caused a slightly stinging feeling and just didn’t feel right. I wish it did not have that feeling in and around my eyes because for the most part the product is good, it does not have a bad smell and it does not feel greasy when I use it. For my eyes I’ve been using [[ASIN:B00L3KEIZO this soothing eye cream]]. It is very mild and has eliminated some of the dark circles around my eyes. I’d say the combination of both products has made me pretty happy with my complexion over the past 5 or so months, and I will continue to buy them.</li>
    <li> I like this, I have been using it for under a year. It&#x27;s smooth and light and non greasy and works well through out the day.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to treat slight wrinkles above my eyebrows, but have not noticed any improvement. I will continue to use it in hopes that increasing the length of time it is used will help.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Sorry that they discontinued this product. Hope to buy more later when I run out.  Fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, makes my skin feel soft and smooth. the only thing that would make it better is if it was SPF as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this originally at Wal mart but they no longer carry...used once a day and swear it lasted over 6 months.  Love the feel of it, makes makeup glide on smoothly.</li>
    <li> love it, used it once and went back on line and purchased again. I love the way it makes my face feel so smooth and velvety and it has preformed as advertised too repairing and helping my skin.</li>
    <li> Great daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I originally bought as clearance item at Target, but fell in love with it and looked specifically for it online- something I never buy online!  Goes on so smoothly! It really feels great to put on my face and throat and my skin feels great.  very moist and full.</li>
    <li> After using this for about 2 or 3 months I have noticed a few of the fine lines around my mouth become a lot less noticeable. I will continue to use it. The nice thing is a small drop or two goes along way.</li>
    <li> Great product for everyday use. I have dry skin and use this in the morning under make up.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that was a little more moisturizing, but it seems to be good so far</li>
    <li> I am 39 and have never used facial creams before until lately I started noticing very fine wrinkles on my forehead and when I smile. Maybe I am not the best person to review these products because I have nothing to compare it with. I bought a Vitamin serum with 20% and it leaves my skin kind of tight and dry. I was already started to experience a lot of facial dry skin maybe because of the age. I love that this has a pump and it gives me a small amount without wasting any excess. I like that it does not leave my skin greasy and it gives it the moisture I am looking for before putting makeup on my face. I have not noticed any difference in 2 months of using it on wrinkles or anything. I think we have to be realistic of our problem with aging and that is that we loose bone and facial muscle and there is no way to reverse that. Once we have lost bone and muscle no magic cream will lift our face. I think all these creams work to keep our skin hydrated and maybe that way the process of aging can be slower. We can prevent more deep wrinkle lines to come out sooner but no reverse the ones we already have.</li>
    <li> i bought this product for my wife in england and she was very pleased  with it&lt;br /&gt;so i ordered it here in canada</li>
    <li> I originally got this at Costco, but of course when I went to get more, it&#x27;s not being stocked any longer...rather than drive all over the city, I ordered from Amazon...it came quickly, and well packaged. The product? I have older, oily, sensitive skin on my face, so need something light. The serum/day cream combo is just perfect for me, And as I don&#x27;t care for having a UV added to my face lotion for everyday use, that&#x27;s also a good thing. Now, if I can just find it when I need it again.....</li>
    <li> I have been using this particualar product for a year now, and I love it!  My skin feels soft and it is very easy to put make up on.  I have used other Olay products before and I am sticking with this one. Since I dont have wrinkles I can sincerely not tell if it diminishes wrinkles or not. What I can say is that my skin feels silky soft and looks healthy! I am very very happy with this product!</li>
