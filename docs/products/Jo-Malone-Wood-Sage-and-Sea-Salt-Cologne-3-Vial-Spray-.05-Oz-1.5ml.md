    <li> Glass tiny bottles. Just wish I could have purchased 1 bottle as a  sample</li>
    <li> smells awesome and less expensive than the larger bottle.</li>
    <li> Absolutely delightful scent. Note, though, that these are only the sample sizes. You&#x27;ll have to go to a very high-end store to buy the actual bottles--and they&#x27;re EXPENSIVE. I strongly suggest buying these little samples first before you spend $60 for 1 oz or $120 for 3.4 oz. I love it, but make sure you try it first.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to try out Jo Malone scents without spending big bucks on the full size.  This particular scent is quite unusual and very nice.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> very light, fragrance did not last more then an hour.</li>
    <li> Love the scent!  Clean, earthy.  Invokes memories of the Oregon coastline for me -- aromas of the forest and sea melded together.  Lovely!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is so rich. I love the tingle of citrus and salt mixed with the smoky woody sage note. It is easily a unisex fragrance and it stays true. I gave it 3 stars because it doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour or two. I found it stayed longest if I sprayed it onto my hair. I love the scent so it&#x27;s very disappointing that it fades so quickly. It&#x27;s way too pricy for me to consider investing in a whole bottle.</li>
    <li> Amazing smell. Very strong and lasting as well.</li>
    <li> What. A. Ripoff.  $15 for what is thrown in bag free of charge at Nordstrom&#x27; s.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know how to review this in terms of base notes.  it smells good.  woodsy, sexy.  i don&#x27;t think it has an old lady smell.  but this sample size is perfectly generous if you want to judge with your own nose.</li>
    <li> This is a nice scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last.  Very sorry, but not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Smells good but fragrance does not last long at all.  Wore off in about an hour.  Arrived in time in good condition.</li>
    <li> Item came 7 days before expected delivery date.... 3 nice sized sample spray vials.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is absolutely beautiful. It&#x27;s such an unique, somewhat odd, somewhat eerie, beautiful, outdoorsy, beachy, musty, smell.&lt;br /&gt;It has both feminine and masculine elements. I love this scent, and I am a male.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell right smelled  like it was  watered dwn maybe old I was very disappointed order shipped quick was the good thing but disappointing when I sprayed it .</li>

    <li> Love this Jo Malone Wood Sage &amp; Sea Salt Cologne! Having this sample of 3 allows me to decide if I want to purchase it in a larger size.</li>

    <li> smells amazing. very gender neutral scent. ordered these from a different seller and received junk. these are legit</li>
    <li> Way too much money for the small size of the samplers, I bought them because they looked bigger than a regular store sampler.</li>

    <li> A wonderful way to try a new product, without spending a fortune</li>

    <li> I like perfume,some of the Vials do not spray,  they need to be checked before shipping.</li>
