<li> I use a LOT of brushes and am always looking for new and different ones!!</li>
<li> On a scale of 1-10 I would rate this a 9 because I think the foundation side should be larger so it takes less time to apply.</li>
<li> I read the reviews and some people were having trouble with the concealer end of the brush falling off.</li>
<li> Received it and it&#x27;s broken.</li>

    <li> This brush arrived today! It said it would be here June 5, so it arrived early. I read the reviews and some people were having trouble with the concealer end of the brush falling off. I did not have that problem. It stayed on just fine:) On a scale of 1-10 I would rate this a 9 because I think the foundation side should be larger so it takes less time to apply.</li>
    <li> I like the brushes but the two brush heads immediately started falling off.</li>
    <li> Received it and it&#x27;s broken.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an eco tools reject. Works for me!</li>
    <li> ðŸ’›ðŸ’™ðŸ’œðŸ’šI love this product it&#x27;s really good for to apply concealer and foundation. I just order another one. The only think I didn&#x27;t like was that the the bottom came off when I got it . I thing the glue came off.ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€</li>
    <li> Great product. It blends my foundation really good.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush :)</li>
    <li> Quite a useful brush.</li>
    <li> perfect, as show in the picture</li>
    <li> Great Product. luv the convience of having a two in one brush. The bristles are super soft just like I like them to be and hairs do not fall out, I have not washed it yet but for this price, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for more, only issue was the time it took to get to me easy was about more than 2weeks.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush... So much better than sponges or using hands!</li>
    <li> Great deal and excellent quality for what I paid -- thanks!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted and it works great.  Maybe not the highest quality ever but it&#x27;s really good for what you pay.</li>
    <li> I am an independent distributor with SeneGence Cosmetics and skincare! I use a LOT of brushes and am always looking for new and different ones!! I came across these and decided to give it a shot!!  Can you say I am IN LOVE with them!!  I am fixing to make another order for more!!  They make GREAT gifts for my clients when they order/purchase eye colors!!  Yes, I would HIGHLY recommend them!!</li>
    <li> The large end is a great brush! But the small end came off on the first day I opened it! So I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
