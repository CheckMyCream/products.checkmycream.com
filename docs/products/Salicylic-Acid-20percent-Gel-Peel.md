<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like using Salicylic Acid twice a week on my face.  Gives my face a clean glow.  I wash my face and use a tone.  Let my face dry then apply the salicylic acid with a cotton ball to my face for only one minute.  I have sensitive skin.  Rinse off with very cool water for 1 minute.  I use witch hazel to make sure that the acid stops working or sometimes I take baking soda and water mixed together and place on my face like a mask for 1 minute.  Great for your face!</li>
    <li> I just got this stuff last week, the first time ive used this product it burns like crazy, feels like my face getting burn and hot, i can only stand for 2-3 minutes, but when i rinse my face with cold water burns is gone and my face looks clear ,cool, and fresh, i can see lots of peeling now, i still continue use this product and wants to find out the exact results, i will post again after cpls of weeks. thank you Skinlaboratory,by the way the reason i rate this 4 stars cause my skin is very sensitive and burns like hell when i use the product i only leave it for 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> I have suffered a lot from acne and had some hyperpigmentation spot from that so I needed this peel to work.  I used the 20% salycilic acid peel and I applied it once in two weeks,It was very hot after I feel the burn then I go rinse my face with cool water.  You dont want to go to sleep after applying it, You will have a crack face.  It dried my skin out then I notice that it starts to exfoliate the top layer of my skin very gently.  But I expected a miracle result, It did not have a magical effect at all and I dont want to damaged my good cells so I used it once every 2 weeks for 10 mins.  I spend about forty dollars for only a 3.4 OZ bottle.  Other than gel peel being to expensive.  I think it works good and I will give it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for about 2 weeks, but I couldn&#x27;t wait to post my review.  A friend and I are both doing peels about every 2 or 3 days.  I HAD deep cystic acne, and she HAD a ton of red surface bumps.  Although this stuff burns like crazy, you eventually develop a tolerance and can leave it on longer and longer.  After using it the first time, all of my acne bumps were \\&quot;frosted\\&quot; over, and my skin seemed super smooth.  I have really large pores on my nose and cheeks, and this stuff makes them appear so much smaller.  Also, my normally greasy skin has been manageable, and I&#x27;m no longer shiny half way through the day.  All of my pimples are clearing up, and the new ones that come in heal up after days, rather than weeks, and do not scar.  The scars I currently have are becoming less apparent, and more smooth.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after using this product for a few more weeks.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product to use very couple of weeks to stay-off acne. Very light peel, more light a good exfoliation. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I started using this product after spending over $900 (and nothing happened) for microdermabrasion plus acid peel and laser therapy (4x) for my acne prone sensitive skin.  At first, I could only tolerate 1 minute.  Now I am up to 10 minutes/ 1-2x per week.  One thing I learned from the dermatologist is to use a small fan during the peel.  It cools the burn so I can tolerate it longer.  If it burns unbearably with the fan, I suggest that you remove the product with a washcloth and water (mine is the upper lip area).  So far, I do see some smoothness in my forward, but my chin still has breakouts.  I don&#x27;t \\&quot;frost\\&quot; like I did with the other acid peel.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is less oily.  I&#x27;ve read somewhere that it takes skin 4 weeks to heal a pimple and I don&#x27;t know if I have the patience for that!  I will keep trying this product in hopes that my skin will improve.</li>
    <li> I have only used this 2 times but can already see an improvement.  It does burn and the 1st time I could only keep it on my face 2 minutes before I had to start rinsing.  The 2nd try I could leave it on 4 minutes.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This is an effective, helpful product for my skin problems. The four star rating, instead of 5, is because the product is not so much a gel. It runs somewhat which is a problem if you&#x27;re standing up in front of the bathroom mirror. This stuff is not ok to get in your eyes, nostrals, or mouth. A bit thicker would help.     I now keep several small, clean cloths at hand to stop any flow toward the wrong areas. It increases my stress.     Also, my skin alert system says this is not nice stuff. When my skin gets hysterical, I rinse it off. The instructions say to &#x27;rinse with copious amounts of water&#x27;. That is all more stess/distress than I expected from the manufacturer&#x27;s description.     I will continue to use this product. I&#x27;m used to looking a good ten years younger than I am. This product is the only thing that seems to have the potential to remove these growths completely. I have had them frozen by a dermatologist. Freezing didn&#x27;t remove the entire growth on the larger ones and the smaller ones that were frozen left big, discolored circles.     This product is effective, cost effective, and less painful than freezing by a doctor.     I&#x27;m 58 and have seboreic dermatitis. More specifically, I have tags on my neck and wartish type growths on my face and chest. My skin is exceptionally sensitive. No acne. I have excema. My skin tends to be dry and extremely sensitive.     My skin has forgotten how to exfoliate on it&#x27;s own. That is difficult if you have sensitive skin.     The Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel is removing the wartish type growths on my face and some lines and wrinkles. None of them are totally gone yet. There is a 70% decrease in the size of the growths. The deep wrinkles are about 35% less deep.  I&#x27;ve used it 3 times (once a week). I think it will remove all of these growths in time. I will update regarding my progress as time goes by.     Light a candle for peace  Bev</li>
    <li> This is the best exfoliant you can buy especially if you have oily/acne-prone skin. It doesn&#x27;t just leave your skin significantly polished and smooth, but it also treats pimples since salicylic acid has anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Just be careful not to leave the lotion on your skin for more than the prescribed time - 5 minutes. Also, it can cause nasty boils if it touches open wounds/minor cuts. Overall, I prefer this to any kind of cosmetic scrub or exfoliant (and i&#x27;ve tried many, including high end ones like estee lauder, clinians, philosophy and la prairie), and it&#x27;s great to use when my skin is particularly oily or congested.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about three months now and have seen good improvement in my acne blemishes. I suffered from deep cystic acne that left me with dark hyper-pigmented scars on my back. This product, along with exfoliation has helped to reduce the appearance. Probably after using the product for 6-8 months, they will be gone. It also helped to clear my acne dramatically. The active ingredient (Salicylic Acid) is the same ingredient used in many over the counter products like Neutrogena, Clearasil and Oxy, just in a higher concentration (20% Vs. 2%). This is my 6th bottle. Great product!</li>
    <li> I thought that this product was amazing. I have had acne since my teenage years and as an adult it is now even more frustrating. This product was amazing! It cleared up my skin really quickly and made it nice and smooth.    Be careful, because it can be really drying so I highly recommend a good moisturizer or night cream. Also, I found that it was better to use it every other month or so, just so the skin wouldn&#x27;t get to used to the product and start breaking out again.</li>
    <li> Very good product, as described. High quality and affordable price. A must for anyone concerned about skin care. I will consider other products from the same vendor.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face peel for 6 months and have found it very helpful for my long term acne.  I&#x27;ve tried many other acne treatments with only moderate results.  Now my face is blemish free.  I still have large pores and a few scars.  I was very surprised to find out that these treatments can cost up to $100/ session.  Initially when I applied this solution I could barely stand the sting for more than a minute at a time and for the first 3 weeks I had increased pimples.  Because I read these good reviews I stuck it out longer than I would have.  Now I&#x27;m able to leave the solution on for 10-15 minutes at a time with only mild stinging.  I rub jojoba oil in after rinsing my face with cool water and I have no skin peeling or irritation.  I was using this regieme every other day for months then I tried to use it once a week.  My blemishes returned within a month of this.  I&#x27;m now back using this every 2-3 days and my skin looks better than it has ever looked in my life.  I whole heartedly recommend this for the treatment of acne.</li>
    <li> Skin Lab always delivers above and beyond. As usual, the product arrived before the estimated delivery time and in excellent condition. I was pleased with the result produced by the peel. I use it in my private dermatology clinic and it is the most economical, concentrated and potent skin peel that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now. First of all, this is very painful to use on the entire face. It hurts like hell :(...Second, I would only recommend this for spot acne treatments. It works good on getting rid of acne and clogged pores. DO NOT use it on your entire face, you&#x27;ll be in sheit load of pain haha.</li>
    <li> JUST LIKE YOU, I HAD A NEVER-ENDING RASH ON MY FACE.  STARTED WITH ONE HIVE AND IT TURNED INTO CLUSTERS OF ACNE LIKE BUMPS. I WENT TO THE DOCTOR NUMEROUS TIMES, TRIED SO MANY OVER-THE-COUNTER TREATMENTS THAT I ALMOST WENT BROKE.  CURRENTLY, I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR 3 WEEKS, AND MY SKIN IS 90% CLEAR.  I AM FINALLY FREE FROM THIS NIGHTMARE OF A RASH.  GOOD LUCK. FYI KEEP AWAY FROM EYES, MOUTH, AND NOSTRILS.</li>
    <li> For me there never has been any product which, all by itself, has totally prevented break-outs.  But this salicylic acid peel definitely does help:  skin is somewhat smoother. I use several products so it is admittedly difficult to determine how much of the benefits are attributable to this product versus the others.  I started using this peel once a week for five minutes per the instructions but can see after a couple of sessions that I can leave it on longer (15+ minutes) and use it more frequently (my skin is not especially sensitive-- I have been using products like Tretinoin and Glycolic Acid lotion for years). This peel also improves the skin on the backs of my hands!  I will definitely purchase again when I use up my first bottle.</li>
    <li> This is another peel I use besides the Lactic one. This is a much gentler peel and used it a few times before going on the more agressive one. This is also a great product with little or no sting. I left it on for 7 minutes the first time with no discomfort. Always follow your peel with a PH balancer and a good moisture cream and use the moisture cream daily, at least once a day to prevent dryness. The results are worth the time you spend on yourself and your skin will love you for it. If I can do this at 71 and see the benefits, anyone can.</li>
    <li> I have been using this peel for about a little over a month, and cannot believe the remarkable results.  This last week I used it twice a week instead of once weekly, and I&#x27;m getting even faster results.  My rosacea has gone into remission and my pores are cleaning out, including several deep cysts that repeatedly got inflamed.  The seborrheic dermatitis around my nose, a common accompaniment to rosacea, has also disappeared.  My pores have gotten smaller, and my oil production is greatly reduced.  I have stopped one prescription acne medication already, thank goodness, and may be able to stop the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 59 and have suffered from rosacea for about 25 years, and this is the best condition my skin has ever been in.  It is soft and clear and the red is gone.  I can go without makeup if I want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with three minutes exposure and have worked up to eight minutes.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to try this - the instructions are clear and easy to understand.  I am hooked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s.  The Skin Laboratory shipped my bottle with a free gift - pretty nice!</li>
    <li> Ok, first I read all reviews on amazon before buying and I must say for acne, I don&#x27;t understand how people can post a review after just 2 or 3 days of use.  I have used this for over 1 year and at first I was very unsure it would work.  I actually stopped for a few weeks.  I have a ton of moderate to occasional severe acne for about 15 years now, yes the type where you hide for a few days, but after using this, I must say it is not a cure, but the best solution I have come across to keep your skin looking great!  Yes, I have tried a billion products.  There are two things that work on my white, male, oily skin.  This Salicylic acid and clean and cure&#x27;s benzoyl peroxide.  I use that cream every night, and I use this acid 2 times each week.  Yes, every 3-4 days I find is right on. At first I used it just once a week.  I had massive stinging, and it was very  very painful.  I frosted, etc.  When you are new, and have that much dead skin on your face, you should use very very little.  On day 3 after using this acid, you will have peeling going on.  When I first started, I used more then I should have hence the pain and frosting, to the point that 3 days later when I peeled, it was not good to see me in public even with lotion on.  I mean I was shedding like no tomorrow and red around my mouth.  I was losing so much skin it was not a good thing.  After applying this acid in smaller amounts each week for a few months, yes months, the pain went away, my skin shedded a ton of dead skin, and I could not believe how great my skin looked!  Did I still have acne.  Yes.  Was it visible, hardly.  Now if you do it and feel very little pain, you do not have moderate acne, most people have mild acne out there, so you will think it is not working.  Let me tell you, if you use this, and benzoyl peroxide like I do, you will clear up.  This acid needs time to get deep down to do it&#x27;s work every 3 days and the cream to help kill the stuff when you are not using the acid.  Now that I doone treatment every 3 days, I am and have been mostly clear of acne.  About 90-95 percent.  I feel and look awesome.  However, if I let it lapse even one week, I will start to get breakout acne again as all that dead skin is being piled up by the cream which alone can&#x27;t keep it at bay.  Without the cream, I break out some, this alone is not going to clear you 100 percent if it is active acne, but with help of the benzoyl peroxide, it is the perfect solution to freedom!  What I mean is no more glossing looking oily skin, you may now workout and sweat without worring you are going to break out massively due to your clogged pores.  You actually sweat because your pores are not clogged, and you don&#x27;t break out if you continue using this acid with peroxide.  Also, I have had tons of whiteheads on my back for many years until this acid and this has been slowly making them go away as it dissolves them a little each time I apply it.  I do not peel at all when I use it on my back because it is not active acne anymore, but just old dead acne whitehead bumps under a new layer of skin that won&#x27;t go away on it&#x27;s own since it is protected by the new skin.  This was the first place my acne started when I was 15.  It stopped breaking out at about age 25 on my back.  I am now 31 and my acne is just on my face now but still moderate if I leave it untreated.  The new skin on my back is not dead so it does not peel when I use it.  However the acid gets under and disolves the oil.  I just see shriking and smoothing skin appearing slowly as the whiteheads go bye bye.  I can finally take my shirt off without looking horrible.  It has taken months, but it is worth every penny this acid is worth!  Amazing product, best I have in my solution to fighting acne.  The less dead skin you have on your face when you use it, the less pain you will feel.  I do it every 3 days so I feel very little more like a itch for about 15 minutes then I wash it off and the pinkness of my face fades away by the 30 minute mark.  You must get this, forget reading the people that tried it once and stopped.  They didn&#x27;t give it time to work.  It needs time to exfoliate all the garbage on your skin which is plugging your pores.  That is why you break out.  Don&#x27;t give up!  Oh, and the shipper is awesome, super fast!</li>
    <li> Not really a gel, more liquid. Mild tingling as expected with an acid.  It is getting difficult to find Salicylic Acid in decent strengths OTC, so I made this choice. Directions are good.  I may mix it with aloe vera gel to make a gel for PM spot use.  Good product--be sure to follow directions, this is not like the OTC products. Price is not bad considering the cost of much more diluted products.</li>
    <li> This is my first week and I have a lot less oil and pimples. I was even complimented on how bright and clear my complexion looked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had chemical peels in the dermatologist&#x27;s office before. - Salicylic Acid 20% and 30%.  This peel from Skin Laboratory is pretty close to the 20% peel I had done by the Doctor.  I didn&#x27;t peel, which isn&#x27;t surprising since I barely peeled from a 30% peel.  It does get *hot* and a little stingy, but my skin looked nice and smooth afterwards.  I think it&#x27;s a nice alternative to the dermatologist and a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The first time I used it I only left it on for One Minute so i could see how my skin would respond. I was nervous about my skin peeling and looking scarey for work, but there was absolutely no irritation, and now I leave it on for a full 10 minutes, without any peeling. I notice great results in my skin texture and tone. It works well on blackheads, as well as past acne scars and discoloration. LOVE IT!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I&#x27;m a faithful user and re-orderer and I love that it&#x27;s in a large bottle for sure, I started using the 30ml bottles and will now stand by the 100ml for good! this percentage is good too, it made me peel a lot and really cleared up my skin well :)</li>
    <li> I really needed to get the appearance of my skin improved! I had innumerous old and new acne scars specially on my back. When I bought this product I thought it was gonna work overnight miracle, but it didn&#x27;t. My skin didn&#x27;t get worse at first like many say, but it did peel for days after like if I had been on the beach for a long time, and I was able to leave it on only for a few min. Now after 4 months treating with this product I can even leave it on my skin for hours, and guess the results i see now?  GREAT difference!!! Im so happy and thats why I decided to write a review to help others. My skin is sooo smooth and 90% clear of the old darker and newer red scars! I just love it! Thanks Skinlab!!!(go to their website!they have thousands of advices!)</li>
    <li> This product is very tricky to use. It seriously depends on your skin type. I have sensitive &amp; acne prone skin. It works to a certain degree, but it burns your skin sometimes, and drys your skin out bad. Please note that you can&#x27;t use this product often. So, the acne will return. Which, defeats the purpose. I recommend letting the professionals handle the facial peel only. If you don&#x27;t know what your doing your face will be so dry &amp; peeling which will give u wrinkles fast, cracked skin &amp; an uneven skin tone.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 items from Skin Laboratory: a) Lactic 35% &amp; Glycolic 25% Combination Acid Gel Peel, b) Glycolic Acid 35% Gel Peel, c) Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel.     I have used each peel for 4 weeks, rest 1 week in between, which is important to avoid sensitivity problem. The result from the combo is the worst. If you have acne, Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel works perfectly. It clears my occasional spots and whiteheads instantly. If you have uneven skin tone, large pores or fine lines, Glycolic Acid 35% Gel Peel brings about a much more dramatic and noticeable effect.      The only criticism is my skin is getting accustomed to this strength and I don&#x27;t see as much of that initial effect.</li>
    <li> I first received this as a sample with my purchase of the glycolic acid. I like this much better! After my sample bottle ran out I purchased the 100ml and I am SO glad I did! I have mild acne but it flares up every once in a while and this not only killed my flare ups but has kept any kind of pimple at bay. It is more than tolerable on my skin and has a nice minty clean feeling after I rinse it off. My skin has never glowed as much as it does now since I&#x27;ve been using this. No more special cleansers, just normal bar soap. I started off with once or twice a week and now I use it maybe 3 or 4 days a week. I am going to continue purchasing this.</li>
    <li> After wasting 15+ years of my life and tons of money at the Derm I have the clearest skin EVER! I love this product. I peel at night and follow with with cetaphil lotion &amp; cleanser when I get too dry, use Panoxyl bar soap and cheap 10% benzoyl peroxide cream from w@lm@rt in the a.m. and face and backne haver never been better. I just bought the lactic and glycolic and hope to add them to my routine for scarring. My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t have an even bigger bottle, I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I use this once every week or every two weeks and it keeps my face nice and smooth and helps clear acne. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this once a week for the past month and it&#x27;s working great. After each use my face is pealing for 1-3 days. So far so good...</li>
    <li> Hands down my favorite peel ever! My skin is like satin, I can&#x27;t stop touching it! I use it on my face and hands. I use a fan brush because everything else absorbs too much. My skin is incredible looking! even, bright, glowing, dewy, and gorgeous. highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Used this peel several times over about 2 months. It burned like hell! Had to use a fan when it was on my face for a few minutes to bear the burning. Took my breath away and burned more with using ice cold water to &amp;#34;wash it off&amp;#34;. Skin felt dry, tight and peeled after a few days. Was there any acne scar reduction? NO! A new fresh complexion? NO! Hell, was there even smaller pores? NO GIRL!! All it did was burn and peel my skin! The only upside to it, is that it didn&#x27;t leave any scars... And I think that was just the luck of the draw!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle.  Great to use every once in awhile for a deep pore cleansing.  Dissolves oil very quickly and effectively.  Lasts a long time.  I pour a little in my hands and apply directly to face.  Never counted but I&#x27;d guess I get 30-50 uses out of a 100ml bottle</li>
    <li> I use this gentle peel for clients suffering with rough skin and acne.  Dries up acne lesions and jump-starts new collagen growth</li>
    <li> This is the same solution that is administered by a nurse in a dermatologist&#x27;s office, only for $45 per treatment. I paid that price for this, which is enough for at least 30 more treatments. It says to use 2-3mL of solution per treatment but less than 2mL was enough to cover my face liberally when applying with a flat brush (I measured the amount ahead of time with a syringe and had some left over). Definitely worth the investment, especially if you have had it done in a doctor&#x27;s office before and know what to expect, how to apply and how often to use it safely.</li>
    <li> When I first bought this product I had horrible acne all over my face and back . Once I used this my skin changed dramatically after just a week . This stuff is golden! I recommend this to everyone . I occasionally break out around my monthly visits and I eat copious amounts of candy around then and once i put this on my face my acne vanishes</li>
    <li> Erases acne marks and improves skin tone. It doesn&#x27;t work on my skin every time but I keep it as part of my skin care and it prevents acne</li>
    <li> I have to preface this review with the fact that I use other skin care and health products namely Retin-A Micro, b-control, and a good moisturization regimen.  Also, I have sensitive and oily skin.  Moreover, I have medium-dark brown skin (for a color reference it would be Bare Escentual&#x27;s golden dark), so for those with skin like mine I know how important it is to hear from someone like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have not ever had a peel I would not recommend starting out with this.  The skin needs time to acclimate to salicylic acid like any strong acid.  However, for those who have been getting peels of %10 or more I would recommend using this peel.  Follow the directions precisely.  This skin laboratory peel does not self neutralize (like perfect peel, which is much like the professional peels), so you can time it to where your skin has more absorption. Basically, the longer you keep it on the more concentrated the peel gets (if you will).  It is good to use when you have a large (cystic) pimple.  It is also good for exfoliating the skin after using retin-a.  The best advice I can give for this product and any peel is moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.  Do not peel the dead skin because this can cause more scarring: put simply apply a good moisturizer.  This product of course will not give you dramatic results immediately.  It is an overtime product.  I highly recommend stepping up to 30% and then higher (for African descendant skin please do within reason).  I also recommend still using this once you have stepped up to help refresh the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is good for smoothing and tightening of the skin within three days, but again couple this with a good skin care regimen.  This peel alone will not help, but with other hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic products your skin will look nice!  Good luck and God Bless.</li>
    <li> This 20% salicylic acid peel works far better than any of its weaker friends could. It burns like crazy when you have it on, but as soon as you rinse it off you notice you skin looks fantastic and glowing.  You will notice it continuing to work all week as your pores become unclogged.   You only have to use it once a weak, which is great, and you use so little that this bottle will last forever.  Next to daily use of prescription strength retinol, this is the best thing i&#x27;ve ever tried for clearing up skin, and it doesn&#x27;t make your skin flake off in a noticeable and unwanted way.  I highly recommend it (but only if you can stand the discomfort of application for a few minutes a week) :-)</li>
    <li> I was swayed by the good reviews on this peel and I&#x27;ve not been disappointed. I have been using this product for over a year now, and when I consistently use it (on a weekly or biweekly basis), the results are fantastic! These are the things I notice:&lt;br /&gt;1. Noticeable improvement in breakouts&lt;br /&gt;2. My skin feels much smoother...when I skip a few weeks, I notice my face feels rougher.&lt;br /&gt;3. More even skin tone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you do the following:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Gently wipe your face with an rubbing alcohol wipe before hand (I noticed a difference when I started doing that)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Start out with just a couple of minutes, like the directions state, and work your way up. Otherwise, your peeling will be excessive!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Use a fan to blow on your face while you have the peel on. It really helps with the stinging!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Rinse rinse rinse with COLD water.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 15 year old son who has severe acne. We&#x27;ve tried antibiotics expensive prescription creams and gels and nothing was working. I bought this as a last resort kind of thing. We use it once a week for one and a half minutes. It&#x27;s been 4 weeks now and there is a HUGE difference in his acne. Every week it&#x27;s getting better and better. He said it stings a bit but he thinks its worth it so I started using it. I don&#x27;t have acne but I do have large pores and its actually shrinking them a little bit since I started once a week for 2 minutes and its giving me an even skin tone. I will continue to buy this for both my son and me.</li>
    <li> I have ordered from the 2 times and both times were very fast delivery and everything came packages well so no breakages!  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Thank you Amazon for allowing customers to purchase this item at a great shipping prices.  Thank you Skin Labories providing Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel, 100ml.  This is worth every penny.  I would suggest when using this product. Use with a cotton ball.  Use one cotton ball each time you apply it to your face.  You don&#x27;t want to contaminate your Salicylic Acid fluid and wonder if it does not work any more!  My skin is 90% better.  I use Witch Hazel as my cleaner/toner.  I use a little vitamin E oil.  Just a little don&#x27;t want to have a greasy face! When I have a spot coming on I put a a little clarasil cream in the palm of my hand and  mix a little yellow sulfur power I purchased at CVS. I apply to to spot/bump. Next morning my spot has shrunk or dried up. I use a timer each time I apply this.  I am leaving on 7 minutes with timer.  started leaving on from 2 minutes and now I leave on 7 minutes and then I wash off.  I am using this on my 14 year old girl.  Her skin is looking great.</li>
    <li> My initial order was lost in the mail...or stolen by my neighbors.  Seller worked with me and sent a replacement,  So far the product works great and they&#x27;ve earned a lot of customer loyalty.</li>
    <li> very happy with it, takes 3-4 days to peel though, maybe need stronger lol  ..has made a huge difference in my dark spots!!</li>
    <li> Because I have never used this product before, and only use sparingly as directed, I am unable to give a proper review. Only use approx 1 time per week, so  have not noticed results yet. I did have someone else comment that they noticed my skin looked smoother, so that is good.  I still haven&#x27;t really noticed myself.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I am in my early 20&#x27;s and have very sensitive caucasian skin. My skin is neither too oily nor too dry, though perhaps a bit more oily in some places than others. I have had moderate/occasionally severe acne since I was 18. I have never tried an exfoliation product of this potency ever before. I have used salicylic acid before, but only 2.5% or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the sheer number of positive product reviews, I thought this was going to be my acne cure. I used the product twice a week for the first week (Mondays and Fridays). My skin was dramatically better at the end of the first week, albeit a little dry. The second week I continued to apply it just twice a week, yet my acne appeared to be coming back. I was puzzled as to why it initially cleared my face and then subsequently failed to prevent future breakouts. During the third and fourth weeks, I started using the product once every other day, thinking that increasing the frequency of application would render it more effective. I was wrong, though. I started breaking out even more with inflamed, cystic zits that were painful to the touch. I was forced to go back to applying it once every 3-4 days midway through my fourth week. I was still not seeing noticeable improvements and abandoned this product after 5 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I could have given this product more time. However, it was giving me arguably worse acne than I had before starting the product so I figured there was no point to continuing. Also, I followed the instructions well and still did not see much improvement after 5 weeks. Per the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions, I gently washed my face with a mild cleanser (Neutrogena&#x27;s Fresh Foaming Cleanser) before applying the Salicylic Acid and used moisturizer (a small amount - a little more than the size of a green pea) at the end of my routine. I will admit that the only instruction I did not follow as well as I could have was to wash it off after just one minute duringthe first couple of uses. I left it on for 4, maybe 5 minutes and this irritated my face beyond belief. Yet, I was still breaking out even when I was leaving it on my skin for 2 minutes or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given my experience, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT for people with a skin composition similar to mine. Without exaggeration, I have NEVER had a harsher product on my skin. After completely abandoning this product, I have been using a vitamin b5 supplement after reading it about online. After a couple of weeks of use, I am already seeing noticeable improvements and I hope to see completely clear skin with consistent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask me any questions - thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-BlazersFan</li>
    <li> I bought this because the topical salicylic acid stuff didn&#x27;t seem to cut it for my acne. It&#x27;s pretty strong, the first time I tried it I only left it on for like a minute, cause it started to burn a little, but after washing it off I immediately noticed my skin was smoother. I think it&#x27;s helped with my acne, I didn&#x27;t get any leading up to being pms, which I almost always get at least one. The second time I used it I left it on a bit longer. The instructions are pretty good, and I would definitely suggest following them....and if you&#x27;ve only used OTC strength stuff before, make sure you build up gradually. Start with one minute, depneding on your skin&#x27;s sensetivity, and leave it on longer during subsequent times. Wash off immediately with cold water if you feel any painful burning....it should tingle, and maybe itch a bit, but burning is BAD!</li>
    <li> I only have a few pimples every now and then here and there.  However I have this one small pimple right in the center of my nose for over three years that does not disappear.  I thought this product might help but other than reducing the size of the pimple it did not do anything else for me.  I tried for other spot treatments and did not have a great result...  It was my fault for buying this size now that I don&#x27;t even use it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and have been using it for a couple of years. I have adult acne prone skin, been on Accutane 5 times (i know, too many!), antibiotics, etc, etc. I use Glytone exfoliating wash and toner, la mer lotion, and this as often as i can remember it (once per week to once per month...time eludes me easily!)&lt;br /&gt;I went to a plastic surgeons office that also has a skin care clinic and decided to try a \\&quot;real\\&quot; chemical peel. I didn&#x27;t peel much or see much result the first time, so i tried a second one that was stronger and added TCA and Lactic acid. They asked what i used at home and when i explained what it was the aesthetician was curious, and mentioned even though the % might say it was the same (at 20%), the pH likely wasn&#x27;t the same as a professional peel which would affect the results and how much it works. So i showed it to her on my iphone. Then she looked up the brand on her laptop and kept looking more confused. She finally said she didn&#x27;t think you could purchase this strong of a product as a non-professional and that the pH was at a good level. Let&#x27;s just say, I have since saved my $100+ dollars and get more regular peels at home! She even said that if i used this regularly, I would only need to come in a couple times per year to get the other acids (there was one she said no one can buy other than someone affiliated with a physician but i forgot what it was). Let&#x27;s just say I ma thrilled and happy with my home peels and don&#x27;t have an aesthetician any longer :)</li>
    <li> It seems this is not as powerful as some of the other ones I&#x27;ve ordered. I don&#x27;t know if it was the manufacturer or just a bad batch. It gave me lack luster results, and I expected more, since it was 20% compared to the 10% I used previously.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this!!!! I was suffering from sun/discoloration spots and skin blotchiness and overall dullness of complexion. I have used this a few times now (I am up to 5 minutes) . I have no negative side effects at all and my skin looks better than it has in a VERY LONG TIME. My sun spots are almost gone, my skin looks clear and bright. My Mother visited me today and she told me &amp;#34;WOW YOUR SKIN LOOKS GREAT!&amp;#34;. I have to admit it really does! I LOVE this stuff! I slather my face with Aloe and Vegetable Glycerin afterwards and I have had no peeling, no red marks or irritation. My skin is looking fabulous! Wish I would have found this years ago!</li>
    <li> I have experience with TCA peels (Blue peel) and retin A .5 and my skin takes it.  I recently got some cystic acne and stupidly picked and scarred.  I decided to give this a try and after a week of doing it every 2 days I see a fading of the scar, flattening of milia and other bumps plus very smooth skin.  The blackheads are gone but I have had very minimal peeling.  Probably because of my peel history. I want to emphasize that peeling may not be apparent to many but it is exfoliating.  I may go to 30% and do a Jessner in January just to even out. Need to wait and see how this product works out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product as it has made my skin very smooth and clear.  I think the scar will fade away with time and there may still be something to extract.  I did go to a esthetician and she did get a lot out but I still see something.  I am hoping this product will make that come out.  I am very patient about seeing results as I have been on Obagi for 10 years and love it.  But after a while, you need a little boost and this product definately delivers that way.  I think if you have virgin skin as far as peels, it will do wonders. For me, since I have peeled my face twice with TCA, the effects are a little milder than what I am used but still very positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update....Day 10.  I have used the peel now two more times for 5 and the last time 8 minutes and I am definately going to peel big time.  I am thrilled as I am getting better peeling than when I did a 15% Blue peel  All I did was shed and flake and there was not noticeable difference over $400 later!  I was so angry at the esthetician who assured me the result would be the same as the 30% Blue Peel if she did the 15% with more layers.  WRONG!  So, I just wanted to add that if you are used to getting peels...especially TCA, then your skin may take a bit longer to peel with the 20% SA.  I am Hispanic and my skin is thick and not really sensitive except for being prone to hyperpigmentation.  I can withstand quite a bit of acid of any kind.  I expect to peel tonight or tomorrow night for sure.  Have been using the jojoba oil to moisturize snd I highly recommend it.  Not greasy, absorbs quickly and no breakouts.</li>
    <li> didnt get to use the whole bottle</li>
    <li> Always does the job! Makes my skin feel softer and it even looks younger and healthier. I use this product once a week. Just follow the directions carefully and start out slow and build up the time. A little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product used for skin peeling and useful for Basal Cell Skin Cancer continued treatment as well.</li>
    <li> I got this product a month ago when I first used it i didn&#x27;t  feel a thing (yes I cleansed my skin with alcohol and dried my face) I was like am I really tolerable to pain or what lol so I tried it again the next day now I could really feel it burning but tolerable pain (left it for 5 min both of the peels) so I waited 4 days to see what happened (using neons poring heeling cream/ointment for post peel) but instead of clearing my acne it actually gave me more pimples I don&#x27;t know if that is how is supposed to work but it did kinda push some of the sebum out a bit so I&#x27;m a little skeptical</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would work just as good as the doctor&#x27;s office peels but it does not.  I was expecting the same results. I&#x27;ve had several peels in the past and I wanted to save some money so I ordered this.  I peeled for days and my skin looked fried.  I wasted my money.</li>

    <li> Reduces Acne By Next Day  for my teen. Proactiv wasn&#x27;t enough, but with this product, his acne was 80% better by the next day.  We now use it weekly on him and also spot treat any big ones in between treatments.  I use it weekly and my skin exfoiliates by 3rd day. After 3 weeks of treatment, my skin is smoothing and my poores seem to be diminishing. I will continue to use this product and now my 20 year old daughter is too.</li>
    <li> This is by far my most highly praised skincare regimen ever! I have oily skin mostly in my T-zone however i would breakout anywhere on my face. I had tried all lotions and what not for years. My skin is prone to acne since puberty and I could not control it. This was my last resort before seeing a dermatologist for a Rx.&lt;br /&gt;I always research before use/purchase and during use on all my products. I could not find anything that would help my acne Until....back in 2011 I found Skin Laboratory Acid Peels. I purchased this one which is Level 2 however the best for acne oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;It did take weeks and religious use however once my face cleared it stayed clear!!! Yes i do get the occasional ONE pimple once in a blue moon however thank God I since then feel I have control of my face.&lt;br /&gt;Once my face cleared up I purchased the Glycolic 50%. This I use on occasion. The SalicylicAcid is what I use religiously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skincare regimen: using Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel, 100ml (Professional)&lt;br /&gt;I started using it as it was instructed, every 2-3 days based on your tolerance. I built from 1 min to up to 10 mins (how long you leave on your skin). I couldnt tolerate over a 1 min the first time.&lt;br /&gt;My face started peeling and felt dry; this was my skin renewing cells. I used an SPF moisturizer as indicated for sun and moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Today I use weekly (on Sundays). If I ever miss my day i will do the next day and continue my usual weekly day I chose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is still oily, as this is genetic thing, however my face does not break out like before!!</li>
    <li> I often get acne under the skin which causes large red bumps that are extremely painful. These, then lead to scars and redness that do not go away. I found this online and gave it a try, and I am currently on my second bottle. The whole first bottle really hurt every time I applied. Because I do use harsh skin products, I thought I would be able to handle it, but please be aware of the intense stinging you will feel.Now that I am on the second bottle, I can keep the treatment on for a few minutes without discomfort.  I am happy with this product as it does make my face smoother and more bright but I am not sure it is helping the acne/red scars. I think it is a great boost to use every once in a while, when skin becomes dull. I usually use it during a time of a breakout to help refresh the whole face.</li>
