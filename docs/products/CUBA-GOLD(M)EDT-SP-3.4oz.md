<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Cheap but smells clean. Not a cheap after shave smell.</li>
    <li> Good Fragance! I liked it!</li>
    <li> Great service, great smell</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this product and it smells so good. This is his second bottle. He will continue to purchase this product whenever he runs out.</li>
    <li> Cuba Gold is undoubtedly one of the nicest men&#x27;s fragrances on the market. Very few seem to even know of its existence. I love the smaller bottles, the way they resemble glass cigars inside an aluminum cigar tube. But as much as I love this stuff, these 3.30 ounce bottles are a better deal. Stick with Cuba GOLD, and forget the other Cuba fragrances. Or, give them a try and see for yourself which is best. Mine arrived quickly and securely packaged.</li>
    <li> This is the first time that aquire this product. I&#x27;m very satified and will buy other for my brother&#x27;s birthday-</li>
    <li> Awesome  product will do buissness again soon</li>
    <li> Great scent that&#x27;s not too strong nor too sweet. It&#x27;s perfect during the spring and fall seasons. Try it.</li>
    <li> My favorite colonge. Always a pleasure.</li>
    <li> A Christmas present for my husband. I&#x27;m sure he will love it. It&#x27;s his favorite &amp; at a good price...thanks!</li>
    <li> great cologne, decent price, my only con would be that its a very light scent, but not completely a bad thing because to each his own, i prefer slightly stronger scents. scent lasted 4/5 hours on me.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, got it for christmas a few years ago and have been using it ever since. I&#x27;ve tried all the other cuba ones (got the gift pack) and the gold is best, by far. The only kind I like better is Burberry Touch, but at 35 for the same amount, I&#x27;d much rather stick with the Cuba Gold. Smells great, not overpowering and the smell stays for a very long time with only a spray or two.</li>
    <li> I got this today with some other cologne i ordered off of here and it was how do i say da bomb lol but it was really good really good smell strong start but a nice end to it this is a real mans cologne if u ask me will be getting some of this brand great stuff</li>
    <li> Its alright,pretty cheap,I splash it on if,I&#x27;m just would like to smell,&lt;br /&gt;something besides soap or dollar store imitations.</li>
    <li> fragancia agradable y duradera</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s favorite! And it also got here in time for Father&#x27;s Day! Worked out great for me!</li>
    <li> Quality product for a very reasonable price. Amazon is my go to.</li>
    <li> too strong. maybe for the older crowd.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for the fragrance, but that said... I am not out a lot of money, as this product is very modestly priced.</li>
    <li> What I find best about Cuba Gold is that once you put it on it is long lasting with a mild aroma that is not overbearing. A must buy. . .</li>
    <li> I believe this is one of the most underrated perfumes in the market right now. It deserve better ratings. I believe is a 5 star perfume if you look at the price. Thanks............</li>
    <li> Was skeptical at first but it smells great!!!! And it lasts pretty long as well. Recommend for any one that wants to smell good for a long period of time.</li>
    <li> This could be an everyday Cologne for me,, smells great and for the price, its all good..&lt;br /&gt;I always have at Least 3 Cuba styles Colognes on my list as I think they all smell great..</li>
    <li> excellent product, exactly to that indicated in the publication, the fragrance I love and recommend it for those loving strong odors. I recommend the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> FAST delivery! Love this cologne!</li>
    <li> I like not to strong .. works well casual..</li>
    <li> Fast shipping good product for the money</li>
    <li> This lotion is inexpensive and lasts, I really liked it, is a good buy, I recommend it. personally the fragrance is good.</li>
    <li> Great fragance that nobody else has a clue.  I like the way it smells and nobody has a clue what it is.  You don&#x27;t find this on any store.  The price is great too</li>
    <li> Ladies love the smell of this cologne the only cologne I buy lovely bottle and it lasts for a good amount of time</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery</li>
    <li> It does share a resemblance to Jean Paul Gaultier, I&#x27;ll admit. I can definitely tell the difference between the two, though. It&#x27;s not a terrible scent, definitely worth a buy if you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper alternative to JPG. For someone on a budget, can&#x27;t go too wrong with it.</li>
    <li> this is a gift.. love the fragment ..unusual bottle, well package</li>
    <li> Nice scent for fall. Projects nicely and has a smell that sticks around for quite a while. Can&#x27;t bash it because it was only $8. for a 3.3 fl oz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say that only certain people could pull off this cologne. As well as, it&#x27;s not very sweet. It&#x27;s very musky and older man smelly. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless you&#x27;re in your late adulthood.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; thing and this and received more compliments while wearing Cuba.  I love Le Male and Cuba Gold, but still don&#x27;t understand why nobody ever really complimented the le male.  They smell the same to me.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, Can&#x27;t wait to give it as a fathers day gift.</li>
    <li> my dad introduced me to this fragrance a few years ago and I love it. It&#x27;s a very masculine scent and all the ladies love it. I recommend not spraying too much because it can tend to be a bit strong!</li>
    <li> the scent doesn&#x27;t evolve or change much over time on my skin. Once you&#x27;ve sprayed it on your skin, that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll be smelling for the rest of it&#x27;s life.When I smell this on my skin, I picture vanilla, tobacco, and even mint. I can even get a little bit of that &#x27;toothpaste&#x27; scent from this.</li>
    <li> I got this cologne on a whim, because Ross and Marshall&#x27;s carry it for the same price or cheaper than on Amazon, and because of the good reviews.  The bottle and the spritzer are a very good quality and sprays with good coverage.  The scent lasts longer than some of my others, but may not get you through a full day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent though may not be for everyone.  The top notes have a fresh, linen type scent with some vanilla.  The vanilla settles in, with some (barely) cedar base notes, and becomes what some people may consider slightly feminine. One girl told me &amp;#34;you smell like a cookie... I would eat you.&amp;#34;  If that&#x27;s what you are looking for, the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Looked like the orange one on the screen image. ..Orange&#x3D;Excellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;everything was shipped pristine and we&#x27;ll packed but I&#x27;m feeling bitter:/</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this cologne.  My expectation was something along the lines of a tobacco like scent or at least with that as the base.  This is definitely not the case here.  It smells almost sweet.  From the bottle it smells citrusy, but on my clothing it smells like candy.  I won&#x27;t be buying this one ever again.  Not even sure what I&#x27;m going to do with this bottle.</li>
    <li> Great scent and a great price. My husband loves it and so do I.</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t last as long and it won&#x27;t project as far, but look at the price...it does smell good for what it is, but say you don&#x27;t like it, then and worst case scenario you can use it a car or bathroom sprayer...I probably won&#x27;t buy it again for myself as I do have Le Male&lt;br /&gt;( I just wanted to see how it compared to it ) but it does make a nice inexpensive gift</li>
    <li> I regularly purchase this cologne for my son often, he likes this particular scent .  So whenever he runs out of it I would reorder It for him.</li>
    <li> Great buy, delivery, find. For the price it&#x27;s a no brainer. Does mirror JPG Le Male but not as strong, tends to linger adequately all day.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Exactly what I was searching for. An aroma that stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, good smell and lastes for several hours....This is my 3rd bottle so that must mean something..Good deal for the price. I think you would be happy.</li>
    <li> Does it smell like Le Male? It absolutely does, albeit a bit softer and not so &amp;#34;In your face.&amp;#34; I have both and actually prefer Cuba Gold.</li>
    <li> My mid-twenty son loved this cologne, said he felt &amp;#34;grown up.&amp;#34; Even better his girlfriend (and I) love the fragrance. It is inexpensive and I&#x27;d suggest buying more. Found the Cuba Prestige at Ross Stores for same price, however I could not smell it since it was in a plastic container.</li>
    <li> Too strong and isn&#x27;t like the original one my uncle had that came in the gift set. This one seems to be some type of bootleg cologne.</li>
    <li> Nice, a lot like Le Male (which itself I find pretty damn light), shorter lasting and lighter yet, but you won&#x27;t mind using again and again. Actually for me it is better and more fulfilling than the promise of Le Male.&lt;br /&gt;But really scented like an after shave -- short lasting as said.&lt;br /&gt;Some may have said &#x27;synthetic&#x27; on this but not for me -- this is the BEST of the Cuba line for me. Get the big one, worth ever penny.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product many years ago and been complimented on its aroma.</li>
    <li> I am an olfactory dude and memory is triggered by scents.  This is not a long lasting scent but I wear it occasionally when I am out for a symphony or ballet with my wife.  It sort of goes well with her Opium.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this perfume for years, bat this big pack is quite easy to keep straight on bath shelves.</li>
    <li> Great smelling cologne love it</li>
    <li> I really like the smell. Its the best for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought it and instantly loved it. The cigar casing is quite nice and is pleasing to look at. This cologne has become my everyday every second scent. My wife literally told me she&#x27;s willing to buy me a life times supply as long as I don&#x27;t stop using it. Now seriously speaking, I am Cuban and this is not an authentic Cuban scent, there is no smoke scent in Cuban colognes, we use a more leathery scent rather then a smoke one. That aside this once didn&#x27;t have much of a smoke scent either as it was not very strong at all, and seemed to be the first scent to wear off. All considered the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: It usually lasts me 30 minutes as If I had just sprayed it. 2 hours where others can still smell it when they are around me. About 6 hours where I can still smell it when I&#x27;m trying to smell it. Aside from that for the price I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Its my favorite. I can&#x27;t wait to buy my next bottle.  I get a lot of compliments on it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This Cuba Gold is the best of their line. My husband has tried all of them and while I can&#x27;t take anyting way from the rest of the line, this one take the cake.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this cologne is a secret to most cologne heads.  Many will assume that it&#x27;s pure trash simply due to the price but it&#x27;s actually a pretty solid fragrance.  It&#x27;s not something that I would wear as my signature staple cologne but every now and then I do put it in the rotation.  For $10 you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I like it. Worth every single penny spent on it.Will add more review after finishing this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff. G</li>
    <li> este producto nunca me ha llegado he puesto varias reclamaciones y me dicen que el correo al que lo mando no es el correo adecuado asi que miren a ver como lo hacen y me envian el producto o el reembolso del dinero</li>
    <li> I purchased this on a humble and it was one of the best things I have done.&lt;br /&gt;It smells GREAT!!! MY LADY LOVES IT!!! So much so I bought another&lt;br /&gt;bottle for backup!</li>
    <li> Great Smelling, Affordable, and Last for a while. What more can you for? I mean you really get what you pay for when you order the Cuba.</li>
    <li> IF YOU WANT TO SAVE SOME MONEY AND LIKE JEAN PAUL BUT DONT WANT TO SPEND ALOT ON GETTING THAT PRETTY MALE PHYSIC BODY BOTTLE THEN TRY THIS SCENT I THINK YOU WILL BE HAPPY I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A FEW YEARS NOW!!!!!</li>
    <li> My husband has worn Cuba for many years, but we haven&#x27;t been able to find it in town for a long time. We ordered 4 bottles this time. They arrived in excellent condition and in a very timely manner. Love this product and the service. HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> excellent product very satisfied Cart</li>
    <li> Not bad but does not last long on the body.</li>
    <li> A powdery clean scent with a cool container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost a novelty but I do wear some mornings.</li>
    <li> This cologne is excellent. I had ordered it just to try it out. Now I am buying this because it is just simply great. The aroma last for a really long time upon spraying it on. Hope they continue to make this as good as it is.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for a friend who couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere nearby.  I have no idea how to describe what kind of frangrance it is, other than to say that I really like it.  He used to wear this fragrance by Gillette, whose name I can&#x27;t recall, but it had the word &amp;#34;storm&amp;#34; in it.  After he couldn&#x27;t get that anymore, he switched to this and I like it even better.  These are spray bottles, made to look like cigars and they actually have a quite a bit in them.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is basically Le Male except its lighter and not as harsh and it doesn&#x27;t gag everyone around you.  This would be a great scent for someone who likes to wear Le Male out to parties or clubbing but feels that it is too strong/harsh to wear as a signature fragrance.  And not to mention the best part? you can pick it up at pretty up any Ross or Marshalls for 7 bucks! It would even be a good deal at 40 bucks! Very cool cigar shaped bottle and out of all the bottle of cologne I own, this spritzer has got to be the highest quality I&#x27;ve seen, feels very expensive. To sum up, if you like le male or strong vanilla type scents, this would be a pretty safe blind buy, especially at the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent 100% Recommended</li>
    <li> If you want to smell like a girl and not like a man buy this cologne.  Way too fruity and sweet. Gave it as a yankee swap gift</li>
    <li> I bought this when it was being sold for $10, and I must say that it was a well spent $10. Like other reviewers have stated, it can be easy to assume that this cologne simply isn&#x27;t very good since it costs so little but the reality is the complete opposite. It smells great and always gets me compliments from the ladies and a few of my guy friends. Along with the great scent, the distinctive bottle design is sure to be a conversation starter. I would have given this cologne 5 stars were it not for the fact that it simply does not last as long as I wish it did, but besides that I&#x27;ve had no complaints about it.</li>
    <li> I really like this scent. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 10 years now but lately it&#x27;s been harder to find it where I live in NYC. I used to be able to find the 1.7oz bottle and it only cost me $5. Now I can barely find any so I checked online and found this 3.3oz for $8.89. Great price for a great product.</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne that I will wear and it is hard to find.  Great price for the large bottle.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite scent, and inexpensive!</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift for a guy. Nice product if you are on a budget. Packaging is pretty cool too.</li>
    <li> Not as manly as I thought it would be, kind of has a baby powder smell. When I first sprayed it I got a chemical smell but after time went on it got better. I love the bottle it looks nice next to my cigar collection.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best. Cheap, affordable, smells good, and great quantity. Been using this for the past few months and no complaints!</li>
    <li> i was told by some people that this smells great for younger men in high school and up but i personally hate this smell. unless you a large rugged man, you probably cant pull off this scent.</li>
    <li> Strong at first, but fades fast. The scent is among my favorites and should be for most men, but buy one of those refillable cologne bottles to have around to re charge up it up now and then. For the price, not bad, despite any negatives...especially since it smells so good.</li>
    <li> Great scent at a low price. This is my son&#x27;s absolute favorite scent</li>
    <li> My husband smells great with this cologne. It isn&#x27;t overpowering but manly enough to turn heads! Loving it! Size is great for the price.</li>
    <li> I found out that really don&#x27;t get along with things with Vetiver. That&#x27;s the &#x27;cigar smoke&#x27; element in Cuba Gold. Otherwise, it would have been very good. Someone&lt;br /&gt;else may love it.</li>
    <li> Decent fragrance with a decent price!</li>
    <li> GREAT SCENT, NOT TOO LIGHT AND CERTAINLY NOT TOO HEAVY, JUST RIGHT GREAT FOR WORK, CASUAL OR A NIGHT OUT.</li>
    <li> My husband smells soooo good.</li>
    <li> Cuba Gold by Cuba, 3.30 Ounce ----My everyday smell good when i go out....not to strong not to lite, just right</li>
    <li> A friend gave me Cuba Gold as a gift and it&#x27;s become my number one favorite.</li>
    <li> Great smell; my wife loves; but disappears in a few hours...</li>
    <li> Great item, on time thank you..my hubby love i</li>
    <li> I been using this for years I love it is worth it I get lots of compliments</li>
    <li> Smells great, I constantly rebuy this. My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Great Smell budget price, Amazon Amazon Amazon, never sees to amaze me ! Great smell cant beat the price buy it to try it, its only 6 dollars come on&#x27;</li>
    <li> I was afraid of this having an &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; smell and being more on the musky side but it wasn&#x27;t! It&#x27;s a classic scent, not overwhelming and awesome for the price. Still not as good as the Adidas that I had purchased with it, but the bottle is much cooler!</li>
    <li> I had to get a refill.</li>
    <li> This is best for the price. My wife also liked it.. And smell last for more than 8 hours. recommended</li>
    <li> i had everything I wanted for Christmas, but I had something I wanted for myself, had used this fragrance since few years and i love it, so that I found a super price I could not resist. Now my dad and brother want one for each of them, this belong to that kind of things that makes you very happy at a low cost.</li>
    <li> exelente producto lo recomiendo, compren con confianza que m m m m m m m m m m m m m</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite at a great price. Would definitly recommend to men &amp; women looking to buy for their men</li>
    <li> really smells awesome. I have research it online on the reviews and u cant go wrong with the price. thanks.</li>
    <li> I love it for day to day use.</li>
    <li> I got a 3.3 oz bottle for around $6 here on Amazon. I like it just as good as the other top of the line cologne except for an outrageously low price. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try for the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more to have in my car, etc. This was an impulse buy that was definitely one of my better purchases in a long time.</li>
    <li> This particular bottle of cologne I was unfamiliar with but actually smells a lot like the Jean Paul Gauttier cologne</li>
    <li> I like to wear less expensive colognes when I go to work (Dates are another matter). Just the same it has to smell nice and not have that awful chemical undertone so many cheap scents have. This one fills the bill nicely. It&#x27;s quite inexpensive, but I still get complements on the scent.</li>
    <li> Great value for a great price!</li>
    <li> This package is a big disappointing. It smells bad, the package was damaged and I saw that somebody had used it before. Don&#x27;t order it, very bad.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SMELL AND IT IS VERY CLOSE TO THE REAL ONE BY JEAN PAUL GAULTIER</li>
    <li> Love the smell of it. It comes across as a manly latin scent. Also, this size is much more affordable than actual stores. I&#x27;ve seen this size go for about $30 in the mall.</li>
    <li> Smells good!! But don&#x27;t last that long but for the price u can&#x27;t complain.I where this to work almost every day when I dont wanna use my spendier colognes.I will buy again when I run out</li>
    <li> Great price and on time delivery</li>
    <li> Smells so good I give it a 10 out of 10 for fragrance value and presentation</li>
    <li> This is the only scent I&#x27;ve ever bought twice, and that&#x27;s saying a lot.</li>
    <li> At such a cheap cost I wasn&#x27;t expecting much and this delivered. Think of the cheapest Dollar store cologne, downgrade it to buy one get two free and you have this awful smelling sewer water.</li>
    <li> This is my daily cologne. I used to buy it years ago for well over $60 a pop but here at Amazon is around $10 and is the 3 OZ one so it last a few months. Smells very light and masculine and lasts all day without being offensive to others.</li>
