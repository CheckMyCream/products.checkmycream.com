### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product, just as described.</li>
      <li>Wife uses this product and claims to be excellent.</li>
      <li>The over all quality of the device is really excellent.</li>
      <li>But it did a magnificent job on both underarm and leg hair removal.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s be perfectly clear--this device pulls hair out.  </li>
      <li>So you can see I&#x27;m probably not the best candidate for an epilator...</li>
      <li>The best part is that I can use it before a week-long trip and not worry about the hair growing out until I get home.</li>
      <li>Does a real good job.</li>
      <li>a great buy for this price!</li>
      <li>But all it gives me is 4-5 days at best, and I am not a hairy girl at all.  </li>
      <li>chose it because I felt that for the functionality that I required, this version had the best price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed with the closeness of the shave</li>
      <li>But this one is great!</li>
      <li>Best use is for legs.</li>
      <li>An awesome purchase.</li>
      <li>, she is very happy with it.</li>
      <li>would give it 5 stars if it performed perfectly, longer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>&#x3D;D</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still, I recomend it 100%, excellent product.</li>
      <li>I ended up just using it on my underarms, and I will use it on my legs if I feel very brave!</li>
      <li>The power cord models are the best ones to consider.</li>
      <li>Man, am I glad that I did!!!  </li>
      <li>Its very good.</li>

      <li>Shaver doesn&#x27;t seem like great, but the epilation part is awesome.</li>
      <li>would recommend that the hair be trimmed to the ideal length according to the instructions.  </li>
      <li>Turns out they are a great addition and excellent quality.</li>
      <li>I loved it!</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>

      <li>I would even be happy with 7-10 days.</li>
      <li>lol.  </li>

      <li>For myself, I found it was best to start with my forearms, work my way up the arm, and by the time I got to the underarm I had been able to get used to the pain.</li>
      <li>at own risk!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very nice and good shipping time&lt;</li>
      <li>Nice product, with nice features also the price was very good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now off to find a good bronzer...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wife uses this product and claims to be excellent. She replaced an older &amp;#34;Epilady&amp;#34; product and this works very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for two months, I liked this product in that it successfully plucked my hairs right out and made it easier with the neat little light and the soothing ice glove. the part that I wasn&#x27;t so frantic about was that it sort of doesn&#x27;t get the hair from the root a lot of the time. I tried a few different ways, speeds, etc. but I still had the issue with them just snapping off so that my legs didn&#x27;t exactly get smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I give it a 3&amp;1/2 (if I could) and maybe it will impress me more over time.</li>
    <li> Ok, this is my very first epilator and I did some research on the other Braun products before finally buying this one. The ice glove and the light are tiny details but very useful - only after using them did I realize how much I needed them. The product has two heads - a shaver head and a tweezer head - and this is just enough for me. I use the shaver head for my underams and the tweezer head for arms and legs. Using the tweezer head on ur underarms can feel like Chinese torture. I tried real hard to be composed while doing it and just gave up after a couple of tries. I have decent threshold for pain, but I could really not use this on my underarms - probably coz of the sensitive skin. Using the ice glove before and after using the epilator really helps, the first few minutes can be very painful but its just normal after that (Just like waxing). I&#x27;ve realized its effective to do it slowly while maintaining contact with the skin so that the massage heads can do their work! Overall an effective product, and though more painful than shaving...lasts longer because it pulls the hair from the roots!</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my mom. I have the silk epil 3, but this one has more tweezers and it has a shaving part, which is great as an additional part. Also, the light it has is useful.</li>
    <li> I just expected a whole lot more.    This is my first electric razor and I have wanted one of these epi things forever so when Vine offered it up, I jumped at the chance.  I have a high tolerance for pain and I wouldn&#x27;t say my first shave was painful, but I was a little surprised at how much this little baby stung!  It wasn&#x27;t pain exactly, but it wasn&#x27;t a pleasure cruise either.  The leg shaving stung enough to make it me too scared to try my underarms.  There is no way I am taking this device there or anywhere near my bikini area.    My other gripe is that I never got a clean shave.  After my first shave, I noticed a lot of missed spots so on all the shavings that followed I was really thorough.  I shaved an area, shaved that area again, changed the angle and shaved a couple more times just to be sure I got all the hair.  The trouble is I never managed to get all the hair.  I am not one of those women who have the black and picky leg hair.  I can forget to shave for days because the hair on my legs is soft and fine.  I think that may have been the problem with me not being able to get the clean shave, the hair would just lay down instead of plucked.       I did notice that my leg hair took longer growing back in using the Epilator than it normally would with a standard razor.  The bag is nice and the attachments and the instructions are handy and useful.  The ice glove was worthless, but makes a nice ice pack for boo boos. : )  Not the best product for my legs, but will come in handy for a few last minute touch ups when I am in a hurry!    Cherise Everhard, August 2011</li>
    <li> Back in my younger days I used one of those coiled horrors, the Epilady. It&#x27;s been many, many years since I&#x27;ve used that torture device and I didn&#x27;t even consider an epilator until this Braun model was available to me. I hate shaving. I like smooth legs. It seemed like a no-brainer to give the Silk-epil 5 a try. The technology must have gotten better, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, determined to use this properly in order to give a detailed review, I sat down to read the instructions. Ok, so this is more complicated than I anticipated. Don&#x27;t use the epilator around aerosol products or where oxygen is being administered. Check. Don&#x27;t let the epilator near your eyelashes (?) or the hair on your head. Simple enough. Hair is removed at the root. Ok. All methods of hair removal can lead to irritation. Got it. Epilate in the evening. Apply moisturizer afterwards. Skin must be dry and free of all grease or cream. Ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carefully following the remaining instructions, I prepared for my first use of this epilator. I used the cooling glove on a patch of skin prior to epilating. I applied the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the cooling glove to mask my sobs of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh my dear sweet...this thing flippin&#x27; hurts - like, makes all body orifices pucker up hurts. I won&#x27;t claim to be big and brave, but I have a decent tolerance for pain. I can&#x27;t imagine using this epilator other than for the most dire situations. Maybe under threat of torture? Or as a means of delivering torture?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I wanted to give an informed review, so I used this epilator on three different occasions, thinking that perhaps my sensitive skin would grow more accustomed to the treatment and/or I would become more proficient in its use. No luck. I have the same results each time despite following the instructions to the letter. It&#x27;s painful and my skin becomes irritated no matter what I do before, during, or after using the epilator. Plus, my legs are only somewhat smooth for 4-5 days at most and then I have stubble. I say \\&quot;somewhat smooth\\&quot; because even after going over my legs several times to pick up any missed spots, I still missed spots. Because this is no different than when I shave and because shaving doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin to this degree, I&#x27;ll stick with shaving. And bikini area? Are you effing kidding me???? Never. This is obviously not the product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a hit-or-miss product. If you&#x27;re buying it as a gift, make sure the recipient really wants it. If you&#x27;re buying it for yourself and you&#x27;ve never used an epilator before, think about it. You may be one of the lucky ones for whom this product works beautifully but you may end up in the fetal position on your bathroom floor, hoping for the comfort of a fifth of whatever whiskey is readily available.h\\&quot; because even after going over my legs several times to pick up any missed spots, I still missed spots.

    <li> Love this product. It is my first Braun epilator. I used another brand before. But this one is great! It doesn&#x27;t miss a single hair even if I move the epilator quickly. I don&#x27;t even need the glove cause the pain is not too bad. Highly recommend it, great product, amazing price, and super quick shipment! Thank you, amazon!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different hair removal products, including other epilators. None were satisfactory, but I decided to try once more, since I hate shaving my legs with a razor. I have had other Braun products in the past and loved them all, so after much comparison shopping, I bought this one. It actually works. The first time was a little painful, the second time not so much. I am waiting for my hair to grow out enough to use it a third time. So far, I get at least four weeks of smooth legs and another two to four of very short, soft stubble. I could probably use it oftener if smooth was all I care about, but I am just happy if my legs don&#x27;t look hairy when I bare them. I will never have to shave again. Hurrah!</li>
    <li> After dealing with unruly chin hair for the past few years and trying everything from laser hair removal to the spring thingy to good ol fashioned shaving I have found the Braun 5280 Epilator! Any woman who has a problem with unruly facial hair or for that matter unruly body hair this is for you. I&#x27;m not talking about the little bit of peach fuzz everyone has, I&#x27;m talking about the type of hair that makes you look like you have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by the end of the day. It&#x27;s downright embarrassing!     I researched for a few days and found that the Braun 5280 Epilator had some pretty good reviews. I went out today and bought this little guy at a local store just in case I wasn&#x27;t happy with how it worked so I could return it easier, I also had a 20% off coupon for the store making it even better! I now know and understand why it had such great reviews! After one time of using it I&#x27;m in love!! This thing is fast and very effective at getting the hairs. The little light helps a lot to see the little buggers and if you are used to plucking or waxing you can totally handle this. I barely felt it pulling them out and I have very little irritation.     I&#x27;m going to let my leg hair grow out and try it on them too! I would love to be able to go more than one day without shaving my   legs this summer! And yes, I said one day... gotta love having dark hair that insists on growing at a very rapid pace :)    I can&#x27;t say that I will be brave enough to try it on my armpits... I&#x27;m kinda a wimp and from what people said I think I will spare myself the pain of that. As for the bikini line... we&#x27;ll see how the legs go though this might be an area that I&#x27;m willing to survive a bit more pain just for the sake of swimming suits this summer ;) (I&#x27;ll let ya know how it goes as soon as I try it on other parts of my body)     I highly recommend this to all ladies who are sick and tired of being hairy!</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my wife, she used it ONE time and threw it away.The blades are very sharp (as expected) and not gentle at all with your skin.So this product will cut hair and skin instinctively. No wonder the box comes with a gel pad to calm :irritation\\&quot;, but this is more than irritation, my wife was actually bleeding. nothing major, but it did look bad, like a lot of blood dots.Of course she did not shave her entire leg, just a part of it but that was very painful and messy. DO NOT BUY IT.</li>
    <li> I bought this product, excited, to have it come but when I received it, I expected it to be able to use on all areas. Especially the armpits. But then it says you have to buy another attachment with it for that specific area. If I were you, I&#x27;d exit this page and head on over to the Emjoi soft caress cordless epilator. It&#x27;s cheaper, nicer and works just as well. It also does not need any attachments. Good luck!</li>
    <li> The Braun Silk Epil Epilator does it&#x27;s intended job well but not without the pain. I have used this product for a total of about 4 times till now. The first two times were the most painful since it was a learning experience for me as well. It removes hair effectively and has better hair growth than shaving. The hair are not thick when they grow back, and I have been able to go a week longer without epilation than with razor. This particular model is for dry use only, and the most comfortable area for epilation was the legs and arms for me. I tried the underarm area but the pain wasn&#x27;t worth it. As for the pain in general, it isn&#x27;t pain free which isn&#x27;t surprising if it&#x27;s pulling the hair deeper than a razor. I have gotten used to it but I still prefer waxing since it&#x27;s quicker. The Ice glove is a nice touch and helps in dimming the pain for sure. I would recommend this if you&#x27;re unhappy with the razor and don&#x27;t like getting waxing done either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every form of hair removal: waxing, tweezing, depilatory creams, and shaving. I used to get monthly Brazilians (full montay) until I moved and the price up here is double the price I used to pay, so ever since I moved, I&#x27;ve been exploring new options. I am soooo glad that my friend told me about epilating! I waited three days without shaving and then I ran to the store, got my Braun 5280, and I absolutely LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night I epilated both legs. Now remember, I get my whole vag waxed, so believe me when I tell you epliation hurts! (So does waxing and tweezing...) But when you run your fingers over your smooth skin you decide it&#x27;s totally worth the pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this over shaving because the smoothness will last longer. For me, sometimes after I shave I&#x27;m only perfectly smooth for one day and when I go on vacations or weekends over the bf&#x27;s house I don&#x27;t want to worry about shaving. Also, when the hair grows back it will be the soft, brand new baby hairs instead of blunt edged adult hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator doubles as an electric razor. It has a cord, which is better for me than the battery-operated ones. That way, when I&#x27;m in the mood to epilate (you totally have to be in the mood to rip your hair out) I can take all the time I need. This model is not made to operate in water. That sucks but I&#x27;d rather a corded model so I don&#x27;t have a choice. I honestly don&#x27;t see the need to spend more on the more expensive models when this does the trick! It has 40 tweezers, two speeds, a light, and it doubles as a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this epilator had a hard time plucking my coarse pubes but I&#x27;ve seen the wax strips after they pull the hair out from down there--those hairs run deeeep! I don&#x27;t know how deep is standard, but mine run a little over a quarter inch below the skin. :( Sucks. I am going to check out a smaller epilator for that area. I won&#x27;t be able to bare this one pulling out all that hair at once!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to at-home waxing, clean up is a breeze! The whole thing comes apart so just snap the pieces apart, rinse and you&#x27;re done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy hair removal!!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical as to the claim that this could lift and pull out very, very short hairs. Well, it really can and does so mostly with just one pass. Some may find it a nuisance to have to plug this in (not a rechargeable model), but these kinds of products last longer. As some other reviewers have said, you may think the little light is unnecessary until you use it for the first time. Would highly recommend this little epilator. While shaved hair starts to grow back after just a few days, these results should last for at least two weeks.</li>
    <li> I have used it twice on my legs and I like the fact that it does not hurt much like previously owned razors of this type.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, just as described. I bought this for my teen daughter and she is thrilled with it. The pink color is attractive, my daughter said it works great, she is very happy with it. I highly recommend. Well worth it, very happy!</li>
    <li> Initially I was fairly happy because I loved that I didn&#x27;t have to shave for a couple of weeks and I had FINALLY gotten rid of my awful razor burn in the bikini zone. Downside was that it took over two hours to finally remove all of the hair after going over, and over, and over the same areas again and again to get all of the hair out. I figured two hours was worth it for a few weeks of being pain-free from razor burn and not having to shave in the shower. Using it on my legs was pretty much painless as I have very fine hair. It was beyond excruciating to use on the bikini zone but I stuck it out. Then the hair grew back...holy in-grown hairs! Ok, made it through that and on to round two...not as painful as the first time. Over the course of a few months the in-grown hairs got worse...and worse...and worse. I still have horrible lesions and infected hair follicles. And it always took about two hours to complete an entire bikini/leg hair removal session, which is way too long! It never got all the hairs in one swipe so I constantly had to go over and over the same spots, turning it in all different directions just to finally get those last hairs out. So now it&#x27;s either awful razor burn 24/7 or infected in-grown hairs. Ugh. Trying to research electric razors to see if I have any better luck there. Either way, this thing is going in the trash.</li>
    <li> I was heartbroken when my old SilkEpil broke, but after trying this one, I could not believe how much the technology has improved!!! It gives perfect results in a fraction of the time and is not as painful as the last one. The ice pack with the little glove is great, I use it for epilation and to ice my shin splint, since the glove prevents my hand from freezing :)</li>
    <li> I will write this review under the assumption that you know what this product is doing to rid you of unwanted hair. This is my second Braun epilator and I decided to go with the same one (different color, newer model, but the only difference is that the new pink one comes with a cold glove while the old one does not).    I had one of these from late 2005 until spring 2011. I really, really didn&#x27;t want to have to buy a new one, but over time either the motor in my trusty blue epilator wore out, or enough hair got jammed in it to make the tweezers slow down. It was not comfortable.     I chose the Silk Epil5 for various reasons. I purchased it at BB&amp;B with a 20% off coupon, and the store only had the Silk Epil7 (for legs only) and the Silk Epil5 (with more doodads). I have researched many online and on Amazon and I decided \\&quot;if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it\\&quot; so I got the same model that I had before. This is one of the least expensive, most widely purchased, and most versatile of the epilators around.    Impressions:   1. The SmartLight is invaluable  2. Corded V Cordless: I&#x27;d rather be sitting away from all company when I am doing this anyway. Who needs cordless? That means less power to the motor.  3. While the brush is helpful, over time you may want to break out some needlenose tweezers to pull hair from around the gear mechanisms in both the device and the head.  4. I never understood what the \\&quot;massaging head\\&quot; was supposed to do, and it doesn&#x27;t feel good.  5 *****This epilator, like all others, will GRAB the skin in areas where skin is looser and more delicate. The result is a chewed-looking area that may bruise and will be apparent for a few days. Fortunately, these loose-skin areas are usually not viewed by the general public*****  6. One of the benefits of this model is the electric groomer/trimmer attachment  7. High speed works the fastest. It may take practice or a leather strap between your teeth if you have not epilated before, or if it has been a long time. For this reason, I recommend waxing first.        * In reference to waxing, for underarm and bikini areas, I highly recommend getting a professional wax at first. Then use the epilator as a follow-up. Starting out an epilator virgin with a full armpit will lead to blood and tears. Take my word for it.   8. This is not a wet/dry epilator. I never much wanted to do it in the shower anyway.   9. If you are prone to ingrown hairs, this will be great the first few times. However, with regular use, ingrown hairs will be more common. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be much consensus on getting rid of ingrown hairs. I will say that the PrinceReigns (sp?) ingrown hair gel did nothing for me and was a waste of $25.    Overall, this is a great product. I am glad that I decided to get another one exactly like my other. And should any of the accouterments break, the ones from my old epilator will work just as well.</li>
    <li> Great value per money.   Rotating cylinders put the hair in position for the blaze, thus getting to hair cheaper machines don&#x27;t.  Little pain, little time.</li>
    <li> I have been using epilators since 1994. This is my forth one and it is the most effective so far; effectiveness being gauged by efficiency of hair removal, how much is removed in one pass. The light makes overlooking hairs less likely.  I disagree with other reviewers who blame ingrown hairs on the machine itself. Some hairs grow almost parallel to the skin surface and these are more likely to become ingrown than the hairs that are perpendicular to the surface. The more effective epilators remove the root of the hair and so the hairs are more likely to become ingrown than if the epilator only brakes the hair off at the surface allowing the regrowth to follow the best route out. Ingrown hairs can be minimized by regularly exfoliating the shaved surface.</li>
    <li> No one I know has ever used an epilator twice. It crazy style hurts (and I have a high pain threshold). I get waxed just fine and this is no comparison.  Yow!  I tried with ice, I tried with Lidocaine. No dice. I&#x27;m sad. I would have loved to not have to make waxing appointments any more.</li>
    <li> I first bought the Silk Epil 3 which has 20 tweezers.  I figured for a couple dollars more, I should invest in the one with 40 tweezers like like this one (Silk Epil 5). The SE3 took a longer time to pull the hairs out.  I was skeptical at first because the Silk Epil 3 was corded which I liked because I can use it without worrying about the device dying on me.  However, after receiving the item and opening the box, I found it to be corded as well. The Silk Epil 5 also comes with other attachments that I love.  It has a special underarm cap, a trimmer cap (so that you can cut down the long hairs before epilation which makes a big difference in pain) and the best of all, a separate shaver head attachment (which will put my remington shaver to rest).    I once used an epilator about 10 years ago and I must say it was the most excruciating thing ever. This has come a long way.  The massagers on both ends are pointy which alleviate the pulling of the hairs.   As for pain, I am used to waxing my face, arms, legs, underarms, etc.  It is not pain free but its not excruciating.  I found cutting the hairs down or waxing helps the epilation process becuase it less hair to \\&quot;yank\\&quot;.  Hold your skin tight as well, it helps.  It also helps to read the little manual which also gives you tips on a less painful experience.  The light was more helpful than I thought.  It&#x27;s a Shaver, Trimmer and Epilator.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I actually have a lot less hair than most women to deal with, as I went through laser hair removal awhile back. But it&#x27;s not perfect. I get lots of stray hairs on my legs, and for some reason, it failed completely on my underarms. I never cared for shaving, my underarms tend to get cut in particular. So have been thinking of using an epilator for some time, this one fit the bill perfectly! I love the different heads for different areas, and different speeds which helps me get used to the pain, and adjust according to area and how much hair there is to remove. How great to again see those completely smooth legs with just a couple sessions with the Braun Silk. Very happy with this epilator, I can&#x27;t really think of anything to improve on. Some people may not tolerate the pain level, depending on their level of sensitivity, but compared to my experience with similar devices in the past I found this one top notch.</li>
    <li> Wanting longer-term results from hair removal than the stubbly results I get from shaving since we were going to Hawaii, and not having the ability or patience to grow out my body hair long enough for waxing, I started researching this hair removal method.  In my experience, I had never heard of anybody using this method....it seems like a method that was from the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s.  I decided to go for it.    Man, am I glad that I did!!!  When I first started on my lower legs, wow!  stingy pain!  shock!!!  But of course, remember that that area is sensitive.  Once I grit my teeth and beared it, I got through the ankles and moved up the leg. I dont know if I was numb to it by this time, but it was not so bad.  It is true, pulling the skin tight definitely helps.  The redness and irritation was gone within a few hours and the next day I could not see any irritation.      I bought another narrow epilator for my bikini and underarm areas.  This one is a bit big and it is difficult to get into the nooks and crannies of those areas.  I never had to shave any part of my body during Hawaii.  I had at least two weeks of comfortably not having to remove hair.  I figure this period might even get longer as I get the couple of different hair growth times removed.  I am addicted to this!  It is easy.  I told my neighbor and she has already purchased an epilator!  I am SOOOOO GLAD I made this purchase!  I cannot believe these aren&#x27;t more popular...or is this something women have and just dont talk about???  It has been years since I have had legs this smooth!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  This item had options that I didn&#x27;t think I would use.  (The trimmer and electric razor.)  Turns out they are a great addition and excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Since I was so sick and tired of having to pluck each strand of arm pit hair with tweezers, I decided to try this out. Thus, it is my first and only epilator. I&#x27;ve had it for quite a few months now, and I am very satisfied with its performance. The first time always hurts the most and feels the most awkward, but by the second time I used it, I got used to the pinching. It doesn&#x27;t remove all of your hair in one move, but it does do a really good job epilating once it has leverage (I haven&#x27;t experienced any \\&quot;half pulled\\&quot; hairs, which happens a lot when I tweeze by hand). I&#x27;m not an expert with this tool, but it helps me get the job done in 5 minutes or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love most about this epilator:&lt;br /&gt;+ plug in (battery operated ones are often too weak)&lt;br /&gt;+ the spikey head massages your skin, so after a few seconds, the stinging hurts less (if you want it done faster, then just use the other flat head)&lt;br /&gt;+ it has a shaver in case if your arm pit hair is too long&lt;br /&gt;+ it has two speed settings, where I prefer the slower setting&lt;br /&gt;+ it comes with a small brush so you can easily clean it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this is review is just based on epilating arm pits. I cannot speak for whether it&#x27;s good for your legs, but if you&#x27;re looking for something to deal with arm pit hair, this is a pretty affordable option. I have yet to find a reason to buy a more expensive epilator for my arm pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1/23/13:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for a while, and it still works perfectly fine. I finally had the courage to try this on my arms and legs, and I found that using the spikey massager head really reduces the pain by at least 50%, even if the instruction manual recommends using the Ice Glove and flat head instead. What helps is that I epilate immediately after a hot/warm shower. Also, the shaver head comes in really handy for the bikini line. If going bare isn&#x27;t your thing, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to simply shave with the grain. Overall, I will never need a razor or wax as long as I have this epilator. The Braun SE 5280 Silk Epil 5 Epilator has my highest recommendation.long as I have this epilator. The Braun SE 5280 Silk Epil 5 Epilator has my highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> I have used epilators for the past 7 years now and never want to go back to shaving. I started with a low end Emjoi one and it did a decent job until it quit, replaced it with the new (at the time) Emjoi Emagine big red epilator which did a fair job. The head was way too big and it was so loud and wide... just didn&#x27;t get into small areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just purchased this Braun epilator with my 20% off coupon at BB&amp;B which ended up being about the same price as here on amazon. I&#x27;ve only used it once but I have to say, \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;. It does a far superior job to the emjoi and it&#x27;s much quieter. It doesn&#x27;t rake along my shin bone as the emjoi did and it is less painful. I don&#x27;t bother with the ice glove or the massaging head (though it&#x27;s a nice idea for inexperienced epilators)... I didn&#x27;t think the light would be a major benefit but now I see that it really helps illuminate stray hairs. No, this epilator does not get every hair on the first pass, as others don&#x27;t either. But it did a magnificent job on both underarm and leg hair removal. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS My emjoi epilators died after 11 and 12 months each time but were only replaceable under warranty once. Much more expensive and a lousier job. BUY THIS ONE! Only gripe is the bright pink color...</li>
    <li> I gave this to my sister and then asked her for a review.  Here it goes...  Let&#x27;s be perfectly clear--this device pulls hair out.  If you are one with a low pain tolerance (you know who you are) then you will hate this device.  There is no such thing as gently pulling hair out. It hurts, and that&#x27;s all there is to it.  Now, if you are the kind of person who gets her legs waxed because you like the long-lasting smoothness more than you dislike the brief pain, then this epilator is worth a shot as it may save you many trips to the salon.  If, however, you are the sort who would never consider getting waxed, then you ought to just stick to shaving or using a chemical hair removal product like Nair.  Of course, if you have deep pockets, there&#x27;s always laser hair removal.  For the rest of us, pick long lasting smoothness, or little to no pain.</li>
    <li> This product works so well. I was pleasantly surprised. There is some pain involved but well worth it. Cut down on daily maintaince so have more time for other things.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I&#x27;ve had several Braun epil products and this is the first one I did not like. The design of the plug caused it to fall out during use. It was very frustrating. I returned it for a full refund</li>
    <li> I used Emjoi epilator for 2yrs before buying braun. This one is less painful than  emjoi. I dont know if anyone uses the iceglove, but i never had to use it.</li>
    <li> I have heard such horror stories about epilators that it was with great hesitation that I ordered and contemplated using the Braun SE 5280. It&#x27;s summer and I am sick of shaving my legs every couple of days, so I figured that I would give it a try to see if it would free me from razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun delivers great results, but it is rather painful for the first couple of minutes. I used the ice pack before even attempting to epilate my legs, but the pain was still very intense for the first few strokes. This pain was so bad that I was about to give up on continuing with this experiment, but then I noticed that I was getting great results. If you have ever had laser hair removal, this is about the same sensation. The technician who performed mine described this as being similiar to how it feels if you are snapped by a rubber band. So I toughed it out for a little longer and noticed that my pain was greatly diminished. It went from being shocking to tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, I have not been brave enough yet to try it on my underarms, but I have gotten beautiful results on my legs and arms. My skin is smooth and hairless and it only took a few minutes to completely remove the hair from both legs and arms. This is a wonderful product if you can get past the initial discomfort.</li>
    <li> I wanted to be fair so I gave this product several months before reviewing it. At first use, yes, epilation is the closest thing I&#x27;ve experienced to being tortured. I couldn&#x27;t continue after only doing a tiny patch. Since I couldn&#x27;t handle it I went to get waxed (legs, underarms, brazilian). After a few days I picked up the epilator. I was able to pick up any stray hairs missed from the waxing. Since this I had been able to bare the pain well enough, and it did seem to get easier to use each time. For myself, I found it was best to start with my forearms, work my way up the arm, and by the time I got to the underarm I had been able to get used to the pain. As for my legs, I found starting from the bottom and front of my legs was better as it seems the backs of my calves are much more sensitive, so I would slowly work my way up and around the leg. I was never able to complete my bikini area as it was way too painful and much less convenient than getting waxed. Torturing yourself is much worse and more difficult to do than having someone else work on you. Anyway, I&#x27;ve used this for about 6 months now, but I&#x27;ve noticed it becoming increasingly less effective. While it was taking more than 2 weeks for hair to grow back before, I was now seeing hair growth after a few days. I started paying more attention when I realized I was epilating twice a week. I think it started to cut hair from the surface rather than pluck them. I don&#x27;t see roots, but it still hurts as if its working properly, so its not really worth it for me to use anymore. Although I&#x27;ve become disappointed in this product, I won&#x27;t be giving up on epilators just yet. My sister was the one who suggested I get one, and she is using an alternate brand which apparently is highly recommended. In all fairness, for all the hair I was able to remove with this product, it ended up paying for itself because I would&#x27;ve spent more on waxing.</li>
    <li> I gave the Braun SE 5280 as a gift to my spouse. She tried it one time and never used it again. The fact that the hairs are literally being pulled out was a major turn off for her. It was much too painful for continued use. The directions were followed to the letter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess would be whether a person can tolerate the pain or not. I&#x27;ve never used any hair removal products (only the ones that add hair) and have to take her word for it.</li>
    <li> Maybe I have really angry pores, but for some reason it doesn&#x27;t pull all my hair on one pass on either setting and it hurts way too much for me to use. I took a shot of wild turkey to try and numb the pain but it&#x27;s pretty awful. I do have very sensitive skin and I attribute it to that. The ice glove is a little silly, it&#x27;s just a cold pack in a pocket. It&#x27;s not effective pain relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s easy to hold, easy to use, and the little light really does help find all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The technology has gotten better over the years, but for people with sensitive skin and sturdy hair it&#x27;s still not a particularly viable resource.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old Philips Norelco Satinelle Soft epilator I&#x27;d used for several years.  The Braun 5280 gets finer hairs than the old one did and leaves smoother skin behind.  In part, that might be due to the old one having lost some effectiveness after so much use. The Braun 5280 feels flimsier than the Philips Norelco Satinelle Soft.  The Braun 5280 seems cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t seem like it will hold up as well as it should.  That&#x27;s my only real complaint with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a built-in light, which is convenient &amp; helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s also a razor head/attachment included, which is so-so.  (The razor on the Philips was significantly better.)  I dropped the Braun 5280 razor head on the floor while taking it off the body a couple of days after I bought it.  The razor head broke into pieces.  It only fell a couple of feet.  The drop actually snapped part off the plastic mounting.  It is broken for good, not too surprising given the cheap feel of the plastic, but still annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*  Aside from the razor head, the epilator itself is working fine after a year or two of use.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this gadget. It sounded so great- a little machine to rip my hairs out by the roots? Sign me up! I have high pain tolerance.   It doesn&#x27;t hurt much on my legs, just feels prickly. Armpits and bikini line, yes, painful. I could live with the pain, but not the ingrown hairs. So I&#x27;ve only been using it on my legs.  But it takes so long! I have to go over my legs so many times to get all the hair. My legs never really feel smooth, and some hairs are always growing back in a few days. So I&#x27;ve pretty much gone back to shaving.  I&#x27;ve never used any other epilator so I can&#x27;t compare this one to others.</li>
    <li> This is not my first Epilator.  My first one was one of the Epilady \\&quot;coil\\&quot; ones when it was first introduced.  That one was touted as painless and yowsers, it made me switch right back to razors.  A little over 6 months ago, I got my hands on an Emjoi Optima (the yellow one) and while it hurt, it didn&#x27;t hurt as much as the original Epilady and well, it did an ok job.  Since trying the Silk Epil 5, I have retired my yellow Optima and I&#x27;m considering disposing off it completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Silk Epil 5 Epilator has 2 ridged rollers on both sides (the long way) of the tweezers.  The Optima only had one, in the middle.  The rollers are sometimes called a \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; action.  My experience is that with the Braun you get one massage, hair ripping out, another massage... You don&#x27;t actually feel any \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; but it kind of distracts your nerves for just a moment so the pain isn&#x27;t as much as something without a massaging roller or one in the middle which reads more like \\&quot;pain massage pain\\&quot;....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen the light!  The Braun Silk Epil 5 has a handy dandy little led light build right into it.  This really illuminates the skin well, so you can see every hair and you can run &#x27;em down until you are nice and smooth.  My bathroom doesn&#x27;t have the best lighting, and I had to go more by feel with my Optima, which usually meant (after holding the motorized contraption in my hand for a long time) I was missing large swaths of hair.  So the light is definitely a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Ice Glove\\&quot;....  I think the Ice Glove is a useful thing for numbing the skin but only slightly.  I got impatient, and didn&#x27;t much relish holding the glove over one part for x number of seconds and then doing just that little bit of hair removal.  I did find that slowly moving the ice glove ahead of the path of the Silk Epil 5 gave me enough extra relief, on top of the flanking \\&quot;rollers\\&quot;, to make the experience not perfectly painless (you are, any way you look at it, yanking hair out of your body), but to make it less of a dreaded task, which for me means that I will stay nice and smooth as a norm instead of scraggly and dreading my date with the epilator, which is why I started looking into these sort of devices to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ice Glove does feel nice for a quick rub down, after hair removal... I found that I removed hair, with the Ice Glove moving ahead of the Silk Epil 5 (firmly, helping the skin be the suggested \\&quot;tautness\\&quot;, and then slowly passed it over the area before moving onto the next one.  If you like the addition of cold, you could easily use a weightier pack for a few seconds of handsfree cooling instead of the tiny, light mitt, though it is nice not having to stop to reposition anything, as the mitt stays on my left hand while using the right to control the bright pink Silk Epil 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other positive I found, about this particular hair removal device, and this may just be a me-only thing, so your mileage may indeed vary.  I have been on treatments for RA for a long time, and since tapering down (partially) my prednisone, my skin marks and scars in a lovely deep shade of purple that doesn&#x27;t fade.  A cut while shaving results in a little purple line.  My other epilator left little purple dots/bruising (my RA treatment makes me bleed easily).  This one left two legs that were so smooth, and after a good night&#x27;s sleep, they weren&#x27;t irritated or spotty (except for previous marks- no new ones!  and I wore shorts for the first time in ages...  I&#x27;m now off to find a good bronzer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:  The Braun Silk Epil 5 is not cordless.  You cannot use it in the shower or bath.  I used a non-skid step stool to prop my foot up so easily access all parts of my leg, which made it more comfortable, as these gadgets are not just \\&quot;woosh woosh DONE!\\&quot;, you do have to move slowly and deliberately (and then you don&#x27;t have to repeat in 2 days!  Woohoo!).y), but to make it less of a dreaded task, which for me means that I will stay nice and smooth as a norm instead of scraggly and dreading my date with the epilator, which is why I started looking into these sort of devices to begin with.  The Ice Glove does feel nice for a quick rub down, after hair removal... I found that I removed hair, with the Ice Glove moving ahead of the Silk Epil 5 (firmly, helping the skin be the suggested \\&quot;tautness\\&quot;, and then slowly passed it over the area before moving onto the next one.  If you like the addition of cold, you could easily use a weightier pack for a few seconds of handsfree cooling instead of the tiny, light mitt, though it is nice not having to stop to reposition anything, as the mitt stays on my left hand while using the right to control the bright pink Silk Epil 5.    The other positive I found, about this particular hair removal device, and this may just be a me-only thing, so your mileage may indeed vary.  I have been on treatments for RA for a long time, and since tapering down (partially) my prednisone, my skin marks and scars in a lovely deep shade of purple that doesn&#x27;t fade.  A cut while shaving results in a little purple line.  My other epilator left little purple dots/bruising (my RA treatment makes me bleed easily).  This one left two legs that were so smooth, and after a good night&#x27;s sleep, they weren&#x27;t irritated or spotty (except for previous marks- no new ones!  and I wore shorts for the first time in ages...

    <li> I&#x27;d been using my trusted Remington epilator for years before I fried it by plugging it (WITH an adapter, mind you) into a socket in Asia, thereby requiring me to replace it. I bought this Braun model on eBay (brand new) for a bargain $40 including shipping.  The product is excellent and removes even very short hairs that my Remington missed. My legs feel a lot smoother after using the Braun. Pain/discomfort is about the same, even though the Braun supposedly has massaging heads or whatever. I like that the Braun model has two different speeds and a bunch of extra attachments included though I have yet to try any besides the \\&quot;efficiency\\&quot; head.   My only complaints would be that I wished there was a way to turn the light off as I don&#x27;t always want it on. It also feels more flimsy than the Remington, with some loose plastic pieces on the body. Not sure whether this is a reflection of the quality but I imagine if I ever dropped it, the plastic bits have a greater risk of cracking and whatnot.  Overall, very satisfied with the product!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for people who want to use with in the limited time...some times it takes more time if your body is oily or something like that...i loved it...thank you Braun</li>
    <li> After shaving and not shaving for years and having razor bumps and rashes I decided to start waxing no matter what the cost. After one $65 wax job that left many hairs behind and only lasted two weeks I was frustrated. I then decided to buy the wax and do it myself at home. While internet searching for the wax I stumbled upon all these different Epilators and I was so surprised because I didn&#x27;t even know they still made these. I remember the 80&#x27;s version and the torture they produced. After reading many reviews I decided to try this mid-priced Braun model and I was instantly happy. This machine works terrific! It picks up all my hairs and the pain is minimal and most importantly the pain is temporary getting less and less the more you use it. I took the other&#x27;s advice and had first waxed to get the first time hair removed for the first time and I think this is THE KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROCESS!!!!!!! I also shower just before and exfoliate regularly to minimize in-grown hairs. I have been using this little machine about once a week for 30 minutes and it has changed my life. I really love it and frankly, this is the first review I have ever been moved to write. The one down-size I can see it that your legs are never as smooth as with shaving to the touch, but you can&#x27;t see any hair and that is all I need. If you find the pain too much, stick it out, take it slow and do a little at a time. Once you pull the hairs out for the first time, the second time is not so painful and then the third time is even better. On most of my legs I don&#x27;t feel anything at all and I&#x27;ve been using this machine for about 3 months. I Don&#x27;t mind the noise and love the light. I can&#x27;t believe that more people don&#x27;t use these; they have come such a long way from their first models.</li>
    <li> I love this product I have owned two others in the past this one is the best so far. The attachments are a fantastic plus. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using an epilator for 10 years, the original kind with spiral coil and then upgrade to remington one, which recently died.&lt;br /&gt;I always just assumed using an epilator was supposed to hurt and I&#x27;ve had the same remington one for 9 years. I just bough this product and WOW!  I am in LOVE!  Who knew using an epilator could be so easy and painless! Complaining or giving poor rating for pain is stupid because it is an inherent part of ripping hair out by the root, but this product makes it as painless as possible! A+</li>
    <li> After reading all, and I do mean ALL, the epilator reviews I could find on Amazon, I was scared to death and almost didn&#x27;t buy one!  I&#x27;m a fair-skinned redhead who&#x27;s a real wuss when it comes to pain.  I mean, I have to ask my beautician to go real easy when she&#x27;s shampooing my hair because it hurts, ok?  When she waxes my eyebrows, I yelp, though I try hard not to.  So you can see I&#x27;m probably not the best candidate for an epilator...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my curiosity got the better of me, and I bought one.  I HAD to know why everybody was raving over these things if they&#x27;re so excruciatingly painful. I called up every ounce of courage I could muster, and holding the skin taut, touched the thing gingerly to my leg just above the knee.  I felt a slight stinging sensation, as though I was plucking my eyebrows. I moved the epilator around gently in a small area, exploring the level of pain to see if it would overwhelm me.  So far, so good...Then I ran my hand over the area: uuuum, smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tackled my lower leg next.  As I began each area, I felt a stinging sensation, not unlike shaving with a dull razor. The stinging subsided as I made several passes over the area.  \\&quot;Ah!\\&quot;, I realized, \\&quot;That&#x27;s how you know when you&#x27;re done in a spot: it stops hurting!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept going, branching out to try behind my knee, around the ankle area...  Kept expecting the pain to increase, but it never got above a level 3 or 4.  Then I got bold and worked my way to the upper inner thigh, closer to the bikini line.  Here things got a little more dicey, maybe a level 5 or 6.  But the beauty of this epilator is that YOU can control the intensity of the pain.  I found that if a certain area started getting too intense, I could just back off and do another pass over a nearby area to catch the smaller hairs I&#x27;d missed there, then sneak up on the more sensitive area.  I found that it helped mentally if I thought of the epilator as a sort of dull razor, rather than something that was ripping my leg hairs out by the roots.  This made a big difference for me and helped me tolerate the discomfort quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I found it hard to stop, once I&#x27;d got going! Took me awhile, but I did my entire left leg!  If it wasn&#x27;t so late at night, I&#x27;d have done the other leg, too.  Yes, I had quite a few tiny red spots on my skin when I finished, but I applied aloe vera gel with lidocaine and they faded away in half an hour with no stinging at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So--Is my leg perfectly smooth?  No, not like that satiny just-shaved feeling. But that never lasts more than a couple hours anyway, and this almost-as-good feeling should last for a week or two!  I&#x27;m totally sold on epilating, and  want to encourage anyone who&#x27;s curious but gun-shy about the pain that you just have to try it for yourself.  No one&#x27;s more shocked than this squeamish pale redhead that epilating could work for me. I&#x27;ll never go back to shaving!! Soooo glad I gave this a try!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hassle free system for hair removal.Its very less painful and fast.All the attachments are great and easy to use.I use it for my legs,underarms and underarms too.</li>
    <li> It is really fast, I don&#x27;t  waste time at all..Its easy with the light...its really easy actually ...I use both speed variations...Clean easy and fast...Comfortable....Quiet...Its very good. I had an old model before which I liked a lot too..It was Braun again but old model..well with this one I can tell the difference...time , effectiveness....It is a very very good choice..</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this epilator out because the hair on my legs grows so fast. I had never used or even heard of an epilator until I was offered this, so it took much trial and error for me to get it right. I wasn&#x27;t really sure how it operated and was a little freaked out by the look of the head on this thing...It resembled one of those self propelled lawn mower things that don&#x27;t have engines, but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all once I fired it up. I was still extremely careful around areas that have skin I was worried about catching, like a mole I have on my leg. I&#x27;ve always rather enjoyed the satisfaction I got from plucking my eyebrows with tweezers, so this was fun on a larger scale. It takes a while to get the job done, but with only having to do it once a week or so versus every other day and even every day in the summer, the time is really less when you add it all up. It wasn&#x27;t painful at all really to me to use this. It feels about like plucking your eyebrows, but you get use to it after a few times. I do have to shave the hard to reach places, but I use an electric razor, so it&#x27;s not that big of a deal. There&#x27;s no way for the larger head on this thing to get in every nook and cranny. I highly recommend this to anyone desiring to not have to deal with shaving your legs so often and anyone that can handle the feeling of having your hairs plucked. Once you get the hang of it and use to the uncomfortable feeling, you&#x27;ll be hooked. I&#x27;ll never go back to shaving.</li>
    <li> Next time I will get the Emjoi  carress , so when this dies , ,i will go back to the Emjoi carrass</li>
    <li> still have the hairs, although it does seem finer. had to buy another head which was very hard to find. doesn&#x27;t seem to be catching all the hairs.</li>
    <li> a great buy for this price! Works great as advertised and highly recommended! Used it for a year and is very reliable</li>
    <li> This product is value for money. It is worth its price.&lt;br /&gt;It does what is says on the site. I am happy with this purchase and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator after reading all those good reviews hoping it would buy me more \\&quot;hairless\\&quot; days than my razor usually gives. The description says the epilator promises up to 19 days of a smooth skin. I would even be happy with 7-10 days. But all it gives me is 4-5 days at best, and I am not a hairy girl at all.  When I use my razor I have to reshave every 2-3 days for a smooth skin, so the epilator buys me only 2-3 days more. Razor does not take much time to take care of my legs while epilator takes at least 20 minutes for the same purpose. It&#x27;s not painful though, but I am very resistant to pain. And the ice glove is absolutely useless to me. I find this product too expensive for the result it gives. I should have read negative reviews more thoroughly before buying it.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to point this out to everyone. What you&#x27;ll get doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture--it isn&#x27;t pink and has a completely different shape. If you do a search for the model number, you will see what this product looks like currently: white with red highlights, and more elongated. I have no idea whether it works as well as the old pink version (which, by the way, is no longer made). I sent mine back unopened, because I really don&#x27;t like the way it looks.</li>
    <li> While it has been mentioned before, epilating is not for those with a low threshold of pain. This was the first epilator I bought and I did so after being frustrated with how often I had to shave, not to mention how costly it was to keep buying new razor blades after one had dulled. It.is.painful. The epilator is literally a series of tweezers on a rotating cylinder that plucks the hair from the root. The box claims that it has, \\&quot;forty tweezer technology,\\&quot; for efficiency and two speed variables.    So far, I have used my epilator twice, once on my arms and twice on my legs. I had read previously that you might have to epilate large areas such as legs more often in the beginning as hair grows at different speeds and I found that to be true. Two weeks passed and I did a &#x27;touch up&#x27; on the small amounts of hair that had grown out, and to be honest, those small portions were not nearly as painful as the initial epilating. If one is able to make it through the initial epilation, doing small touch ups every couple of weeks is not nearly as time consuming nor painful.    The &#x27;smartlight&#x27; is very useful when trying to locate stray hairs and is constantly on while the epilator is plugged in (you&#x27;ve read that right, it is not cordless so plan on having to maneuver the epilator around the cord when changing angles). Another &#x27;con&#x27; I would highlight is the sound. It is quiet loud and not subtle in the least, plan on epilating with this in mind and try to make it as quick as possible, the epilator begins to get hot to the touch after about twenty minutes.      A word of caution though, at least in my experience, I would not use this product directly before going out wearing shorts/skirts/dresses. It did leave my legs a little red splotches that cleared up within an hour or two of using the product, so it wasn&#x27;t too long. But, if you&#x27;re about to rush out on a date or for a girls night out, I&#x27;d recommend simply whipping out your razors.     I am happy that I bought this epilator though. I had initially wanted to buy the [[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]], with all the positive reviews it had but the sellers on Amazon were charging twice what the product shows it retailing for. I bought this one based on a review that stated this was essentially the same epilator with little product change from the 5270 model, it just included an ice glove and was rather pink than blue. It is not a pleasant experience, but the results I&#x27;ve had are worth it and the fact that I no longer need to worry about constantly buying replacement razors is a welcome thought.</li>
    <li> I got nervous ordering this contraption.  I remember buying the Epilady in the late 80&#x27;s and turning around and returning it.  A friend of mine LOVED hers.  Me?  I considered it a torture tool.  It hurt like #*$&amp;#).  I went ahead and chose this item just in case things had changed in 2 decades.  They have.  While this item still pulls the hair it does so much more gently than the Epilady did.  You can still feel it but not like you used to many years ago.  I wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed with the closeness of the shave and I don&#x27;t see much success with using it under your arms.  That&#x27;s why I gave it a 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;d suggest this if you want to get a pretty close shave that lasts.</li>
    <li> As someone who has never used an epilator, I was interested to see how one works. I have used regular disposal razors with shaving cream. I was interested in something that would last a few days longer than regular shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this device is LOUD. I would not run it at night if you live in an apartment or townhouse. At first the pain was so strong I thought about stopping but after awhile you kind of get used to it. In your head you have to tell yourself it does not hurt that much and basically you sort of become numb to it. Getting both my legs took about 20 minutes so the time was a lot longer. Cleaning it up took about 5 total and about 5 prep so 30 minutes total. After using it for a few months, each time I have to say I did not see a difference in keeping the hair shorter for a longer time. It might have bought me half a day but that was about it. When you factor in the time it takes, to me it was not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will stick to my conventional razor and shaving cream. It is a lot faster and a lot less painful. Had the shaving results lasted twice as long it would have been worth it. However, for pretty much the same results and such a long time in using the device, it is not worth the pain.</li>
    <li> I am going to cut to the chase regarding this product. I agree with most all other reviews regarding all the attachments and how nice this product is. But for me the reason why I am writing this review which I don&#x27;t normally do is because of the technology difference in using 40 tweezers from the 20 tweezers that I have been used to from the previous model I&#x27;ve had for about 4 years. This newer model with 40 tweezers may not be any better in the noise department but the feel of using it (without any attachments) is much gentler that the previous model and much more of a joy to use. I know this sounds like a company review but sorry, there&#x27;s more to this model than the eyes can see.</li>
    <li> I just can say my life before and after this! Its a really good product for what i pay for it, and it just hurts the first times...</li>
    <li> A friend of mine told me about the SilkEpil and I thought, \\&quot;I have to get this!\\&quot; But after I read all the reviews before I purchased the epilator, I was really nervous. I bought it anyway. Well, the pain is not so bad...I&#x27;ve had worse. The ice pack really does help, though. If your contemplating to wing it without the ice, I suggest to definitely use it! My legs have been silky smooth for a week now and I&#x27;m really happy I don&#x27;t havta shave every other day!</li>
    <li> I have ordered to my wife and she loved it</li>
    <li> I loved it! Of course it will hurt, but the more u do it the more u get used to it. Very light and easy to use. Shaver doesn&#x27;t seem like great, but the epilation part is awesome.</li>
    <li> Great made and works correctly it&#x27;s very nice and good shipping time&lt;br /&gt;i love it and would like to buy more for it in the future</li>
    <li> I stopped using shavers &amp; began using only epilators for hair removal on my legs &amp; underarms way back before they added the vibration function to decrease the pain. (I utilized herbal pain medications &amp; Lamaze breathing techniques during epilation &amp; aloe gel afterward.) The pain slowly lessened over time, &amp; I haven&#x27;t considered it at all painful for over a decade. This year I have begun using it on the lower lady parts, removing all hair from the entire area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After many years use, each unit would begin to heat up during use, the motor would sound slower, &amp; it  would take longer to remove all hairs. Using a hot unit caused skin irritation &amp; slowed skin recovery, so at that point, I would buy a new Braun epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought this new Braun Silk Epil 5. Because there are major changes in this unit compared to my old one, I set it on the &amp;#34;extra gentle&amp;#34; setting &amp; left the massaging rollers head on it, expecting to switch quickly to the efficiency head once I knew I could trust how it would perform. Just minutes into the first use, something occurred that has never occurred. It grabbed my skin instead of the hairs! That really hurt &amp; left an ugly bruise. Now I am back to using my old Braun Silk Epil epilator (Eversoft 5316) , which, by the way, was able to pass right over the bruise without hurting me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit couldn&#x27;t go over healthy skin without being shockingly painful. My old Braun could go over damaged skin without hurting at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I bought it from Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. When I was trying to decide between sticking with the brand I have always used or switching to an epilator that I expected to be faster, but less gentle, they told me to just bring it back if I tried it &amp; didn&#x27;t like it, so I will get my money back, but need to buy another epilator soon to keep from having to use my old, hot, slow epilator on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Internet research has not been as helpful as usual for this purchase, so if any of you can recommend an epilator for use on delicate lady parts, please let me know. I&#x27;ve even considered buying a gentle unit for the Netherworld &amp; a faster unit for the legs if I have to.</li>
    <li> llegó en perfecto estado y rapidisimo!! se recomienda el producto me encanta! excelente proveedor muy buena compra! mejor imposible. &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> 2014 May&lt;br /&gt;Have had this just over a year. Works very well, however sounds like a mini lawnmower, but so do the other Braun I had before.</li>
    <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;The light helps better see small hairs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not so good:&lt;br /&gt;Noisy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;Lots of trouble with short hairs&lt;br /&gt;Often breaks hairs rather than pulling them out&lt;br /&gt;Always stuck to the cord&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first epilator, and so far I am happy. I know now what I would want for my next one, but it is a good starter.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for about a month, then it kind of loses efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an inherent flaw; I&#x27;ve owned 3 Brauns, and they all do this.&lt;br /&gt;The light is a very nice touch, it shows you where you&#x27;ve missed while you are epilating, instead of finding it later.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars if it performed perfectly, longer.&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s the trade off for dependability; my first Braun is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;(I bought this one because it has a lot more tweezers and wifey stole my second one and now uses it for herself)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a week, and it keeps the hair gone.&lt;br /&gt;It probably would stay gone a lot longer for a female.&lt;br /&gt;I used to have to shave twice a day because my hair regrows that fast, now it&#x27;s only once a week.&lt;br /&gt;Braun is excellent; very dependable, and their products just work.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed quite a bit less hair regrowth as well; it&#x27;s not growing back, so epilating is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Does a real good job. have been using it regularly for months now. it doesn&#x27;t get heated up even after running for an hour continuously. the tiny light really helps. It pains when you start using it, later the pain reduces. the hair on my leg doesnt grow back at least for 2 weeks, after using it regularly for 3 months now. definitely recommend people to buy it.</li>
    <li> This item gives a nice smooth shave and is easy to use once the epilator part is gotten used to. The included ice pack and glove are excellent additions and this is a much better product with longer lasting results than other items similar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been told I have a pretty impermeable pain tolerance.     As a three-year-old child, I was playing hide and seek and fell on a rusty knife that was sticking blade up from the ground. It went into the bone of my leg (i still have a huge scar!), I walked home and had my parents bandage it.     I&#x27;m not the kind of person who takes Tylenol for pain. I prefer to ride out the headaches rather than take Excedrin.     Furthermore, I don&#x27;t mind waxing or threading or plucking. I&#x27;ve attempted epilating before (with [[ASIN:B00440F3GS Philips Hp6378/10 Bikini Perfect Deluxe Trimmer, Opal / Aqua]].      Imagine my surprise when I was faced with Braun&#x27;s epilator. I have sensitive, very light skin. I have really dark black hair. It should be no problem to spot the hair and pluck it out. Except for the fact that the sheer process of pulling the hair follicle was also causing some of the skin to get pulled.     I could only do as much as about 2 inches by 2 inches before I had to stop.     I should mention that I was using the [[ASIN:B004QWVY8K Braun Silk Epil Pre-epilation Wipes, 16-Count]] and had placed the icepack glove that comes with the epilator on my leg for about 5 minutes prior to epilation.     Not only was it painful, but my skin looked like a lobster&#x27;s for about 1.5 hours after the epilation. I tried both settings and had the same result.     On the other hand, the hair that I managed to remove didn&#x27;t grow n for about three weeks, so that claim is legitimate.     My advice is to use this product only if you 1) like to hurt yourself; 2) don&#x27;t have any sensitives of the skin and feeling; 3) hate your skin more than your leg hair.    As for me, I&#x27;d rather shave every 2-3 days and nick myself every so often, than try this epilator again.</li>
    <li> The Braun Epilator leaves your skin smooth for about two weeks with no razor bumps. However, if you have a low threshold for pain, then you may want to consider using a razor or a depilatory cream. The epilator is essentially a set of 40 little tweezers so your hairs are being pulled out which results in some pain. The pain is comparable to tweezing your eyebrows. Some may find the epilator less painful than waxing. Everyone has a different pain tolerance so results may vary from person to person.  Use of the ice pack is recommended before using the system. However, while the ice pack does not seem to help prevent any pain the ice pack does seem to help with pain and swelling after using the epilator. If this is the first time you are using an epilator I recommend only working on a very small part of your leg to get an idea for your pain tolerance.  The dual massage system minimizes the pain and first time users should use the beginners cap. The pain is tolerable and in time you become more desensitized to the pain. With regular use the epilator becomes easier to use. The epilator is stylish, fits well in your hand, is easy to guide and very easy to clean. Buying the epilator is a good economic decision as you will save money on razor blades over time.  Also by using the epilator you do not expose yourself to chemicals used in depilatory creams. Using the Epilator does take a commitment as you have to build up your tolerance to the pain and some may find that using the epilator on areas where the skin is very thin is impossible.  The resulting smooth skin with no nicks or bumps may be worth the initial pain for many users.</li>
    <li> It works as how it is promised at its advertisement. I like it and recommend it to everyone who needs an epilator and shaver</li>
    <li> my wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;she is yet to have used the cold gel;&lt;br /&gt;she had an older braun, 3 series i think,  but this one she says it does a better job.</li>
    <li> Before I talk about the product, just a note that I am usually someone who does not shave my legs because the hair I do have on my legs are not very much at all. In the midst of my wedding planning, I could not find the ice glove so I went ahead and tackled my legs without it. First of all, I found that it was very important to trim the hair before attempting to use the epilator. I think this is why it wasn&#x27;t as painful as I expected it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trimming the hair, I went ahead and used the epilator and it was really quick and easy. It didn&#x27;t hurt me at all and could also be because my hair is thin and sparse. I felt little pinches or so here and there but it was more of what it would feel like tweezing eyebrows than anything too painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did not care for is that it seems the light is positioned poorly. The way you might naturally use any type of shaving system would block off the light so instead of the light shining on your leg, it was pretty much blocked off and I could not see things as clearly. Also, remember that this needs to be plugged in to work. I was hoping it would just have a charger and then you can take it off and use it but having the cord really makes it hard to guide the epilator successfully and limits where you can use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it did leave my legs smooth but I could have gotten the same result with a razor. It doesn&#x27;t really hurt that much and the results do last a little bit longer than it would if you were to use a razor. Still, I think it is a bit of a rip off in terms of the pricing of this item.</li>
    <li> Why I chose this product?  I am a South Asian woman and have been waxing for the last 15 years. Beauty parlors in my country offer waxing at a very reasonable price and even students can afford it. But after looking at the cost of waxing in the US I had to look for alternatives because I find waxing at home to be very messy. I tried shaving for 3 months but my skin became very rough and the hair visibly grew back in 2-3 days! My cousin recommended this epilator to me and after reading the reviews online, I purchased it from Amazon.  What I like about it  I have been using this for the last 6 months and am extremely happy with the results. the pain is bearable if you do 2 things. 1)have a hot shower before using the epilator 2) Ensure hair length is not more than 2 cms. I have been wearing my dresses more often these days because I always have clean legs!!  Light ingrown hair is still a problem. But I am not too bothered about that. I shared my excitement with my sis-in-law and my sister and both of them ordered one for themselves too!!  Why not 5 stars?  When my sister ordered this on amazon, the piece they sent didnt look like a new one. The box had a dent and we even found some hair near the tweezers!!It must&#x27;ve been a piece returned by someone. We could not return the piece on time because my sister was leaving the US and needed the epilator desperately. Maybe amazon would&#x27;ve given us a new piece on request, but why send a used one in the first place?</li>
    <li> Remove the shortest of hairs, is a good epilator machine you dont have to use it on the same zone several times to remove the hairs, just with one go it removes all, i recommend it, oh well my wife does not me!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been tweezing my lower leg and underarm for years.  I do it every 3 days or so to remove the hair growth that I can see clearly, so each tweezing session doesn&#x27;t involve removing much.  I realize that I&#x27;m missing much of the fine hair but figured that&#x27;s the best I could do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read up on the reviews on epilators and was reluctant to try because of all of the reviews that pointed to the pain experienced with epilators.  I&#x27;m a wimp when it comes to pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worked up the courage to try it out and was surprised that I hardly felt any discomfort and got all of the hair removed, including the fine hair that I had to ignore in the past.  I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation either.  I&#x27;m pretty sure my response to the epilator is a result of being used to tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that the hair be trimmed to the ideal length according to the instructions.  The longer the hair, the more it&#x27;s going to hurt when it&#x27;s pulled out.  I would also recommend those who are not used to tweezing do a small area at a time each day, so that you build up experience with what it feels like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, there&#x27;s no going back to tweezers.  Using the epilator is more effective.  Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to try.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want a typical shaver that just cut hair. This one quickly spins and essentially pulls the hair out. It hurts a little at first but I got use to it pretty quick. I did notice that the regrowth of my hair (I just use it for my legs) has really reduced compared to razor shaving or the traditional electric shaver. I am going to keep using and hope that my hair will eventually stop growing - if I am lucky! I have not used it on my underarms or bikini line area...at least yet.</li>
    <li> I love braun epilators. Ive had them before and bought them for my sisters as gifts before. I fibd epilating more convenient than waxing and more effective than shaving. Its not messy and results last up to 6 weeks. Im used to the pain, so I have no problem with it.</li>
    <li> This hurts like no other!!!! I&#x27;d rather just shave than be in so much pain!</li>
    <li> I love this, my first, epilator. The cord is long enough to be comfortably away from the wall and still reach all the needed areas. It&#x27;s a little loud, but not too bad. The results are more than worth any minor discomfort. Honestly, it was a little painful at first. Not nearly as bad as some of the reviews make it out to be, though. After using it just a few times the pain diminished, now that I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for a few months, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. The best part is that I can use it before a week-long trip and not worry about the hair growing out until I get home. When the hair does start to grow out, it is much thinner and softer than before I began epilating. I&#x27;ve recommended this thing to virtually everyone I know and will continue to do so. Braun is a name you can trust. The over all quality of the device is really excellent. It&#x27;s a good size and weight. A great model to get started on.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun Epilator that I bought some 10 years ago......this new model however is more noisy than the older model...How can Braun explain this...I would have expected a huge improvement 10 years later...Disappointed. It sounds like a mini chopper...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend to shave downstairs and it works great.  She can now have the bush she deserves..</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement to my very old Epilady and this model works fine and gets the hair easily and painlessly. I have not used all the various attachments but I do like the light.</li>
    <li> All good with this product but maybe I should have bought the rechargeable model.&lt;br /&gt;This light is a good attachment to this epilator!!!</li>
    <li> My friend already has the same one and I knew that I won&#x27;t regret it. It is great, very efficient.</li>
    <li> Nice product, with nice features also the price was very good. It also a carying bag which is very nice for transport</li>
    <li> my previous epilator was Braun and been using more than 10 years, but since the charger broke, so I look for a new one, and thought the new model will be better than those previous ones. It was not what i expected, did very roughly job, not very smooth to the skin, and very noisy too, but the price was acceptable.</li>
    <li> really nice one, light is super, works fantastic, i like it so much, I&#x27;d love to recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> I bought this because of good reviews. I had tried a few from friends, and knew it would be very painful. But I absolutely hated shaving, so I choose to give it a try. I started doing it with only two inch areas for a few days, so that I can gradually increase my tolerance to pain. Stretching and holding skin as tight as possible helps reduce the pain a little bit. I get lot of red bumps on my skin after epilating. I have to go over multiple times on the same area to take out all the hairs. I also had started getting lots of ingrown hair. It doesn&#x27;t remove short hairs.The hair grows back within a week for me. I don&#x27;t know if there is any better product than this. But I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again and try to search if I can find anything better.</li>
    <li> it is very painful i would not recommend the product. i am planning to return it. having a light in thw machine could be considered as the only advantage iof the product...</li>
    <li> it is a good product, it matches what I was looking for; it arrived few days before the scheduled time.</li>
    <li> Its a great tool for waxing hair off. I have been using it for a while now. No issues with it. Other than the pain lol. It does hurt at first to wax the hair off. It gets easier over time though. Once u uproot the hair enough times its almost like shaving only the results are better. It does take dedication. The power cord models are the best ones to consider.</li>
    <li> EDIT:  January 2014.  I&#x27;m editing this and docking it a star, because basically i&#x27;ve stopped using this product.&lt;br /&gt;What i found was that if i stopped using it for a while it was just really painful when i used it again.  Put that together with how noisy it is, and how long it takes to use, and i just didn&#x27;t WANT to use it any longer even though i had realtively decent results.  My other big problem was the number of ingrown hairs i ended up with because of the product.  i&#x27;m not sure if they were a result of the hairs that broke off or the new ones growing back in.  but when they would be ingrown and i would get them out i would have unsightly belmishes on my legs. no thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item last fall, naturally right around the time when it was getting colder and I wouldn&#x27;t be shaving as much.  Now it&#x27;s summer and i&#x27;m using it more.&lt;br /&gt;My previous experience with epilators was the old epilady back in the early 90&#x27;s.  I remember it not working particularly well. I was also a teenager and probably couldn&#x27;t take the pain.  I feel like this product works better.  and honestly doesn&#x27;t hurt as badly.&lt;br /&gt;Well.. after a while. The first time i used it it hurt a lot.  the next day i had small red spots all over my legs from minor inflammation in the skin from the hairs being pulled out.  So i wouldn&#x27;t grab this item, use it and think you&#x27;ll go strolling right out on the beach with smooth perfect legs.  Subsequent uses were not as painful.  and I didn&#x27;t have as many red spots.  However, if you go a couple months without using it or shaving for a little while it will definitely hurt again.  After shaving for a couple months I took a couple ibuprofen before using the epilator again.  this helped.&lt;br /&gt;One downside is that it seems to break off some of the hairs at the surface, making it no better than shaving on some parts of your leg.  it definitely yanks some out, but if it breaks the hair off too, you&#x27;ll find yourself needing to use the epilator again ina couple days.  Eventually you will be able to go a week or so without using it.&lt;br /&gt;While it does save you from the daily shaving routine, the epilator takes a while to do your legs.  i find it takes 20-30 min to do both of my legs making multiple slow passes over and over to catch any strays that were missed the first time.  i&#x27;m not sure it saves me any time really, but at least i don&#x27;t have to shave daily. and honestly i have never noticed my legs feeling amazingly smooth or anything.  i think they feel smoother with shaving.  it&#x27;s just a matter of convenience.</li>
    <li> About the dealer: I did not pay express delivery and the product arrived in 2.5 days! The product is legitimate, according to specifications and new. I will definitely order from them in the future.&lt;br /&gt;About the product: The product do as it says. The process is very painful the first time specially on armpits and bikini area, but you will see less hair growing and very thin so this makes the process less painful time after time. No more gray tone under-skin and my skin is very smooth.</li>
    <li> True to word, no holds barred this little machine is definately a dynamo! If you can&#x27;t handle a little pain then this is not for you however, it does exactly what the company says it does and it does it well! I get a little jumpy right before I put in on my skin everytime...LOL, but after I&#x27;ve started it really isn&#x27;t so bad (maybe it&#x27;s numbness) But I&#x27;ve noticed that the hairs that were plucked out don&#x27;t grow back anywhere near as fast as when I shave. The ice glove really came in handy the 1st few times that I used the Epilator, but a don&#x27;t really use it now. I&#x27;ve used both of the heads and they both work well and in my opinion the Braun SE 5280 Silk Epil 5 Epilator With Ice Glove, is definately worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely worth the price. I bought it to replace a cheaper model I got at a department store. I thought all epilators were basically the same, but I was wrong. This is WAY better. It removes shorter hair, does it quicker and it hurts less. Let me explain that last part: it is always going to be uncomfortable to pull hair out, but it is over with quickly. My old model left my skin sore afterward and I sometimes got red bumps. I haven&#x27;t seen that as much with this one. I think that&#x27;s because it is quicker and more powerful. It pulls the hair out the first time instead of tugging. It does a larger area at a time too. I thought some of the features seemed unneccessary, but I enjoy them now. The light is aimed perfectly so you can see strays you missed. I like the different heads. I found the \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; one to be irritating, but others might like it. My favorite is the \\&quot;efficiency\\&quot; head. I don&#x27;t use the ice glove. The discomfort doesn&#x27;t last long. I haven&#x27;t even used the trimming/shaver head yet. It is easy to clean. The only drawback is that I assumed it was rechargable. It isn&#x27;t. Higher-priced models might be, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> This is a product that I bought for my wife. This is the first time she using a epilator and it was quite interesting using it. She had some pain using this. But using this was simple and easy and the hair also goes away clean and clear. A good value for money.</li>
    <li> This was not as good as the one I bought 7 years ago. It left me stubbles which made my leg rough to touch. It also pinchs my armpit skin when applied underarm. Not very happy with this product at all.</li>
    <li> The light is really useful and it is powerful enough not to have to go over and over the same spot.</li>
    <li> Works as stated.  Like the light on it.  Have not even tried the Ice Glove.  Not as painful as I thought it might be for a first time user of an epilator.</li>
    <li> The description says something about removing hair quickly. well let me tell you, it is far from quick. Yes, it plucks the hair quickly, but you cannot go fast as you would with a typical razor. It misses hair so you have to go over the same spot quite a few times and if u have extremely long legs like mine, it is not fun. It took me an hour just to get half my calf (ONE calf) and i still didnt get all the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product and the spot where the hairs were plucked became red and irritated so i had red dots on my legs that looked like razor burn that lasted until the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the cooling ice pack is useless. The cold just makes the plucking hurt 10x worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a fair warning, if you cannot handle the pain of plucking your hair yourself (which is an individual hair at a time), this may not be for you b/c this is a few hairs being plucked after another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you have thick hair and roots, this will hurt realllly bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you have the time, the patience, tolerance for pain, and the will power, this product is one of the quickest ways to PLUCK your hair. B/c the hair takes awhile to grow back, the spots plucked will stay smooth for awhile (if you can get all the hair in that spot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get razor burn a lot, i suggest trying to exfoliate your skin for awhile before this product will really be efficient, b/c the layer of dead skin can make it hard to reach all the hairs</li>
    <li> I bought it for my souse couple of years ago and she is happy now.&lt;br /&gt;she recommends it.&lt;br /&gt;it worth the money you pay.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Can use it at any corner of my home. It has a small torch at the tip, helps me see the minute hair on my skin and helps me get rid of them. The ice hand glove i use after the hair removal reduces the redness. Apart from being a fabulous product it also looks girly, is handy, easy to carry while travelling and i love the color PINK :D&lt;br /&gt;its a must have.</li>
    <li> I like this item however I have not used it as much as I want to. It does cause some pain but I don&#x27;t have to shave as often. I hope that the hair will not come back after using it for awhile.</li>
    <li> Plan on returning the product. It is painful and leaves my arms and legs with several red bumps which last for days.</li>
    <li> Generally good. Sometimes pulls very small hairs. Sometimes just breaks them. My last one pulled more hair than this one breaks hair. The light doesn&#x27;t really help. Nice that it is also a trimmer. Can we make one that isn&#x27;t pink? Why does everything personal and electronic geared towards women need to look like a pastel sex toy?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairy 29 yr old mom. Thanks to my Italian heritage my hair is thick and dark. I can shave my legs in the morning, and have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by 5pm. This product is pretty idiot proof. Bare minimum assembly required. You simply plug it in, turn it on, and stop every once in a while to clean the hair out of the tweezers w/ the mini brush. FYI: Save the \\&quot;cooling mit\\&quot; for AFTER you do an area. I tried pre-cooling per the instructions, and it was comparable to being out in the cold, and having someone slap you. It hurts worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having delivered 4 children, I can say the pain is somewhere between \\&quot;someone please knock me out\\&quot; and waterboarding. I recommend having a glass of wine (or some valium) and doing it as fast as you can. And only stop if you fear you&#x27;re going to pass out. The lower legs &amp; arm pits are by far the most painful portions. Expect red bumps, a rash on your legs. It fades w/ in a day or two. My armpits bled, and were also numb for an hour. (That part&#x27;s NOT a joke.) I also shook for a good hour afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOES IT WORK?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why yes, yes it does. I&#x27;m 5 days shave free, and I can honestly say it does. The better news? I went over portions of my leg that I missed the 1st go around and it is not nearly as painful the 2nd go around. This could be due to damaged nerves from the pain, but whatever the reason, it wasn&#x27;t as bad. I will continue to use it, because I hate shaving, and don&#x27;t have the $ for laser hair on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, coming from someone who HAS done laser hair removal, let me assure you, that pain, compared to this, is like a day at the spa.</li>
    <li> First epilator ever, love it.</li>
    <li> I already wrote a review after purchasing this device last year but I can&#x27;t find it to update. So here is my update: I was first very pleased with this epilator. Then, I went back to waxing for the fall and the winter. Spring is here, so I decided to use it again: 2 things I don&#x27;t like and don&#x27;t understand:&lt;br /&gt;1. It takes forever: Hair won&#x27;t go unless I pass 3 or 4 times on it.&lt;br /&gt;2. It cuts most hairs instead of plucking them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t understand is that every summer when I go home in France, I use the exact same device that I bought some years ago there and it works 10 times better. No cutting hairs, lasts 2 to 3 weeks, and takes half the time. I don&#x27;t understand why the American one is so different. I know we don&#x27;t have the same voltage in France ( and that&#x27;s why I couldn&#x27;t use mine here and had to buy a new one, because even with an adapter it won&#x27;t work well), but this would seem like a minor fix for a company like Braun..! I simply don&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> i dont like it so far.. my hair is not fully getting uprooted even though i am doing it very slowly. and now i have a lot of ingrowns too. i am not sure what is the problem. the icepack is good, i used it the first time but not anymore.  i have grown resistance to the pain.</li>
    <li> Not really best for everyone. If you have a tendency of ingrown this is not the product for you, it will worsen your skin. My lower half legs did not have a single ingrown hair when I was waxing them, and now I have so many ingrown hair that I cannot use skirts/shorts comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also not quite fast a process, it takes me more time than waxing. It&#x27;s also painful. I used it 4-5 times and now have stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;There is a possibility that the other products of the same company with higher version may be better. But I would not recommend this particular version of product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Its a really nice upgraded epilator, with  cool design, but it does not pick up all the leg hair (or short hair at this point), you really need to press hard on skin to get every single hair over and over again. The top attachment does not help either. Overall, the product is OK.</li>
    <li> I selected the Braun Silk Epil 5 Epilator because I have had this product in the past.  There is a newer version of the  Epilator, but I prefer the older version because it has a wider head and body.  Most importantly the cord stays in the device while it is being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced great difficulty with the newer version of the Braun Epilator because the cord keeps falling out, and the Epilator stops working.  I have not had this problem with the Braun Epill 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived early, and everything was new and in good condition.  I recommend this device.</li>
    <li> I never use this type.  But OMG!  It&#x27;s really good.&lt;br /&gt;Not so pain, but skin turn to smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Braun is very nice product.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> Review by AE.&lt;br /&gt;I have at least Used epilators for 10 years. This one is much better than The Others I have used (classic and Epilady Epilady duet) Because is faster, a little less painful, and the light really Helps you out.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver Did convinces me, the hair Remains Above your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I already Used it in voltages of 110 and 220 and works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;The reviews I read said That it helps ingrown hairs With The. Did not work for me On this I have Used But it just for 2 months or so, maybe with More time ...&lt;br /&gt;The bikini area and underarm still to painfull for me, impossible to do it.&lt;br /&gt;Still, I recomend it 100%, excellent product.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. No more hairs for at least a week!It does hurt a bit but it is worth it. I usually listen to music while epilating so I can forget the pain. The problems are: 1. It is not water proof so you can&#x27;t take it under the shower. 2. You have to sit in a place where you can plug it in. Over all I am very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> This personal care product is definitely \\&quot;girlie\\&quot; looking--with its pink and purple accessories. It is kind of big--too wide to grasp easily in the palm of your hand. It had lots of little attachments--each for a different purpose. All of them are difficult to clean. The instructions consisted mainly of illustrations with very little explanation--not very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried the shaver, it worked so-so. But the hair-pulling attachment is just wicked. No wonder these people provide a little freezer bag to desensitize your skin before you use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the device came with a handy carry-all bag. But that&#x27;s about the only good thing I can say about it. There are much better products available for this purpose. I dare say a wax job would be less painful. Good luck!</li>
    <li> After shaving my legs for years, this was my first time using an epilator and it was pretty much what I expected.  Yes it hurt, but not unbearably and it gets better the more you use it.  I followed the advice of someone on the internet who said to use the epilator a couple of days after shaving, so that the hairs were short (longer equals more pain).  Exfoliating beforehand helps too.  I haven&#x27;t used the ice glove that comes in the pack, but I do use the &amp;#34;massaging cap&amp;#34; as I think it helps to minimize the pain (which really isn&#x27;t that bad).  The shaver head is also useful if you want to trim hairs down, or don&#x27;t have time to epilate (it takes a bit longer than shaving).  For the other newbies out there, the epilator doesn&#x27;t capture the (millions!) of hairs it pulls out, so make sure you use it somewhere where you can easily wipe away all the hair.  Luckily it comes with a handy little brush that makes cleaning the unit pretty easy.  And I would definitely recommend a unit like this with a light.  It shows you all the spots you missed so that you can go over them again.  The biggest drawback I find is that this is one noisy contraption!  And yes, there are the ingrown hairs but I can&#x27;t blame the epilator for those.  The bonus of having a week or two of hair-free legs means that I&#x27;m converted!</li>
    <li> This product works; however, it takes forever to get your legs done! I don&#x27;t have the patience or the pain tolerance for my legs...I ended up just using it on my underarms, and I will use it on my legs if I feel very brave!</li>
    <li> I was a first time user, so granted, I don&#x27;t have any others to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I have had it for 9 months now and used it countless times on my legs. It grabbed the thick black hairs with ease in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;9 months later and I find myself having to go over the same spot again and again to grab those same hairs. It doesn&#x27;t even try to pick up the thinner (finer) hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Purchase at own risk!</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m a first time epilator user.  And Secondly, you read it right, I am a man, guy, dude, etc. (I am pretty average as far as how hairy I am.)&lt;br /&gt;I HATE hair, but shaving constantly is such a pain, so I decided to try epilating.  I searched for days and read review after review and finally decided on the Braun 5280.  Braun seemed to have a very good track record with epilators and customer satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the epilator (yes I bought the pink one, I really didn&#x27;t care what color it was, I just wanted a quality product) I quickly opened it and began using it.  I&#x27;m assuming this is a guy reading this review, and the reason I am writing it is because there weren&#x27;t many guys writing reviews, and being a man I don&#x27;t feel it is necessary for me to read directions to anything.  I&#x27;ll figure it out, and I did. It really isn&#x27;t a difficult product to use.  Be warned now though, I would HIGHLY recommend either shaving first and then epilating when the hair starts to grow back OR use the hair trimmer that comes with this product.  It actually works quite well, and hey you bought it so might as well use the attachments.  It is A LOT easier and less painful if the hairs are shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I epilated everywhere, and when I say everywhere I mean EVERYWHERE between my neck and my thighs lol.  I bled a little bit, and for two reasons.  First, the only places I bled is where I didn&#x27;t trim the hair to make it shorter.  Second, I am on blood thinners, so obviously I bleed a bit easier than those not on blood thinners.  Bleeding was very very minimal and didn&#x27;t last, just figured I&#x27;d point it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how was it?  Well like other&#x27;s say, it hurts.  But the pain is well worth it to me.  I didn&#x27;t use ice or any type of pain killer.  To reduce pain, make sure you aren&#x27;t epilating long hairs (like I did at first) and do little strips at a time.  Other than that, just keep reminding yourself how awesome you are going to look when you&#x27;re done, that&#x27;swhat I did.  Honestly it hurt the most around my belly button.  Around the &#x27;twig n berries&#x27; it really wasn&#x27;t that bad.  It is very difficult to get some of the hair around there, and I am still not completely comfortable with myself doing all of it lol.  It isn&#x27;t that it can&#x27;t be done, because I started to epilate ON my &#x27;pride and joy&#x27; but I stopped because I was just nervous. I am just not comfortable enough yet with my epilating skills.  Next time.  Did the butt and in between too.  It really didn&#x27;t hurt, but it was very difficult to position myself in such a way I could get everything lol.  Also did the tops of my feet, that was easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day after I did have red bumps and I was pretty sore.  That was to be expected... After all I did just yank a ton of hairs out of my skin for the first time.  My chest, which didn&#x27;t hurt to epilate and the hairs weren&#x27;t long there, still has red bumps three days later... and they are pretty bad too.  A lot of the redness went down in the first two days, but for whatever reason my chest really is bad, not quite sure why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why only three stars...  Well epilating is definitely something I am going to continue to do, the pain is well worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;+ As far as the product, the attachments are all very good for the epilator.  I used all three, the trimmer, efficiencypro cap, and the regular cap with softlift tips.&lt;br /&gt;+ For the most part, it really did do a good job, especially the proefficiency cap.&lt;br /&gt;+ The light on it really does make a BIG difference.  You&#x27;d be amazed at how many more hairs you can see with it verses without it.&lt;br /&gt;-  Product is pretty noisy, but I really don&#x27;t care about that.&lt;br /&gt;- Firstly negative, they claim the softlift tips will lift hairs, even if they are laying down, and that is simply not true on many occasions.  I had to go over the same spot numerous times to get one hair sometimes because the epilator wouldn&#x27;t stand the hair up, and that really irritated me.&lt;br /&gt;-There were many occasions I had to epilate the same spot numerous times, even after feeling the epilator trying to pull the hairs out.  There is no reason an epilator should fail to pull a hair out if it grabs it, and I can CLEARLY feel it grabbing it.  This is by far the biggest minus. Again, I have nothing to compare it against, but if the epilator can grab the hair, it should be yanking it out.  Tightening the skin didn&#x27;t help either.  Has to be an engineering problem.&lt;br /&gt;- I really wasn&#x27;t crazy about the shape of the epilator.  It was just a weird shape for me when trying to epilate certain parts.&lt;br /&gt;- Lastly the caps really don&#x27;t feel like the attach securely to the epilator.  The overall quality of the product itself as far as how it was manufactured could definitely be better for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you there is no chance this product will receive 5 stars from me, because it simply isn&#x27;t a 5 star product.  Plain and simple, it really isn&#x27;t.  Maybe for just doing legs or flat areas, but they advertised it as legs and body, and I thoroughly tested it on my body and in tough places and it just isn&#x27;t a 5 star product. I will return in a week or two to give an update, because I&#x27;m assuming some of the problems were because I am a first time user.  But I used this thing in pretty much any situation and area you can, so it was definitely well tested.  All in all it got the job done, though it may have taken a little more time than I would have liked.  So I would still consider purchasing the product if you are looking for an epilator, though I have nothing to test it against.  If you have questions (as I did as a guy looking for an epilator), just comment and I&#x27;ll answer it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (After 3 weeks of use. I posted this as a comment, but I feel it describes my update well.)&lt;br /&gt;My experience has definitely improved, but there are a few flaws in the product that will not improve regardless of time. What I mean by that is this; as far as red bumps, bleeding, or irritation, that is all but completely nonexistent now. The reason is simple, you get better at epilating. It&#x27;s not like using an electric shaver, at least not for me. There are little things you can do to lessen irritation and make it less painful, for example making sure to keep the skin tight (whenever possible) while epilating. The things that will not improve is having to go over the same spot on occasion, and the design of the epilator. Honestly, I strongly feel a SMALLER epiltor would be MUCH better. You would be able to get in many &#x27;smaller&#x27; areas easier, and it would feel more comfortable in your hand. Plus, I highly recommend doing smaller areas at a time, so there really isn&#x27;t a need for a SUPER EPILATOR which features 96 rotating heads! WOOO! lol. For your legs or chest or stomach etc, maybe a bigger epilator would be more fitting for some. Being even in bigger areas, I would prefer a smaller one. Overall the product does what it should. If you decide on this one it will get the job done. But in my opinion, I feel there has to be a different one out there that is more proficient in getting the hairs out the FIRST time you pass, and has a better design. I would give the product 3 1/2 stars, but the design and proficiency of the product just are not good enough for BODY epilating - LIKE IT ADVERTISES!!</li>
    <li> I got this epilator as a replacement for one that was lost during moving. It has not disappointed and does the job as expected. I especially like the little light feature that helps you to see the fine hairs even in dim lighting.</li>
    <li> The Epilator, exceeded my expectations. An awesome purchase. Easy to use and easy to keep clean. Highly recommended to anyone looking for an easier way to maintain body hair.</li>
    <li> I have used epilady for a while... this SE 5280 Silk Epil does the work, and more as it has the light that really helps see the remaining hair.&lt;br /&gt;It does hurt the first couple times you use it, as it takes care of the stubbern hair. After that, hair grows thinner, and if you use it at least once a week, it does not hair that bad.  I even use this brand/model for my brazilian depilation... you want to have it professionally done (wax) first, then use Silk Epil to maintain, you will save so much money ($75+ per brazilian wax session - needed every 3 weeks)!!!!</li>
    <li> Gets the smaller hairs with ease. And the mechanism doesn&#x27;t pull at my skin with the hairs. The light is not that helpful for me and I wish there was an option to switch it off. But overall great investment. I wax and then maintain it for a long time with this epilator.</li>
    <li> A decent epilator, that has held up so far. Best use is for legs. Have found Braun&#x27;s heavier models better for underarms and bikini line.</li>
    <li> This is the ideal all in one groomer. Easy to use for first timers like myself! Made the hassles of shaving disappear. Legs, armpits &amp; such feel soooooooo much smoother &amp; cleaner!</li>
    <li> ...And that&#x27;s good.  I&#x27;m old enough to recall ladies&#x27; razors that really worked.  This Braun thing never did.  Before anyone buys an epilator, they should think about whether they have any tendency to develop \\&quot;pressure hives,\\&quot; or have ever had a problem with eyebrow plucking, etc.  If so, an epilator of this type is not for them.  I used only the razor feature of this \\&quot;silk epilator,\\&quot; and while it was not cheap, it always behaved like a cheap razor.  It rather self-destructed a couple of days ago, and now I&#x27;ll get something good.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and item is as described.  It removes all my hairs and grows back thinner and last about a week without using the epilator</li>
    <li> 1st use was torture. 2nd use I could tolerate, but still left many hairs behind. Forget the knees. No matter how u bend them, it will not remove the hairs. I HATE shaving, why I got the product. I was willing to go thru the pain of ripping out my hair. Epilating takes 3x longer than shaving, and I am not impressed with results.</li>
    <li> I really like my new silk epil!&lt;br /&gt;I chose it because I felt that for the functionality that I required, this version had the best price.&lt;br /&gt;The integrated light is extremely useful as most short hairs are really hard to spot. It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t hurt that much. I still get some ingrown hair afterwards but I&#x27;ve had that happen with waxing as well. I haven&#x27;t used the ice glove yet.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because for some reason I found it really hard to clean after usage. But other than that, I am very satisfied and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Will always have one of these in the house. Much better than the razors I was using. Arrived sooner that expected.</li>
    <li> 1. Doesn&#x27;t hurt at all on legs&lt;br /&gt;2. Hurts on underarms (but directly got used to the pain during 2nd use)&lt;br /&gt;3. After epilating, there will be red spots on skin, but will go away in 1-2 days&lt;br /&gt;4. Hair grows back finer&lt;br /&gt;5. Because hair is fine and short, it&#x27;s harder to epilate (so it&#x27;s not really as stated on packaging, in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;6. Skin stays hairless for a week (minimum)</li>
    <li> This is the third I buy (this one is actually for my daughter) My first one died after about 10-12 years of use. My second one is still working after 10 years and when it dies I will buy a new one.... that shows how much I would not EVER go back to razor blades!&lt;br /&gt;Silk Epil leaves your legs smooth for weeks, that&#x27;s the way to go!&lt;br /&gt;There are different types of silk Epil at different prices... If you are just interested in the epilator go with the green one SE 5180 which is cheaper.... if you want more out of it the pink one SE 5280 comes with 3 attachments which are the trimmer, the shaver and the ice glove. That&#x27;s the one I got, I think it&#x27;s worth the 10 extra bucks. (read their description before you buy because colors change over the years)&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend every woman having one of those... It does hurt the first few times you use it but it becomes painless and does such a better job than those blades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004QI8UJK Braun SE 5280 Silk Epil 5 Epilator With Ice Glove, Pink]]</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple months ago (at the time, it was cheaper at BB&amp;B with a 20% off coupon, though BB&amp;B&#x27;s website claimed they no longer carried it).  My first time, I did both legs (including the bikini line) and both arms (not underarms).  It took two hours, and I was biting my lip the whole time.  The ice glove didn&#x27;t help much, but it did help to take off the starter cap and just use the efficiency cap for everything.  For the next day or two, I had little bumps everywhere.  But, the hair was gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started epilating the aforementioned parts once a week.  For the second use, things didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much, and the bumps only lasted an hour.  By the third use, most areas stopped hurting completely.  This may be in part because I had sugar-waxed my arms a few times in the past, but they had completely grown out again.  At this point, I can get arms, legs, a little past the bikini line, and underarms done in one hour and ten minutes.  Compared to the ridiculous time it takes me to shave daily (20 minutes, blah!), this is actually time-saving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that this does not get my skin perfectly smooth.  If I rub against the growth of the hair, I still feel a few tiny hair ends which were too short to be caught.  But they don&#x27;t feel prickly anymore, and rubbing any other direction feels smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is such an improvement over shaving, which leaves me with horrible razorburn immediately, ingrown hairs because I can&#x27;t bear to scrub to exfoliate razorburned skin, and super-prickly legs immediately if I get goosebumps for a minute.  Also, with epilating I don&#x27;t get the ugly shadow of dark hair roots under pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hints:&lt;br /&gt;1) I think that epilating once a week really cuts down the pain level.  You are grabbing fewer hairs from each area, and your skin has less time to lose the tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;2) Exfoliate during every shower.  I also scrub my skin with a dry, rough washcloth right before epilating, which gets all the hairs to stand up nicely.  If you don&#x27;t exfoliate, you will get ingrown hairs.  I still get a few, but not many.  Also, moisturize after each shower.  If you don&#x27;t like scented stuff, a bottle of mineral oil (laxatives section of the pharmacy) will do the trick cheaply and without any odor.  Just rub a little on without toweling off first.&lt;br /&gt;3) This thing is noisy.  It is often compared to the sound of a lawnmower.  I listen to music on headphones while doing this, to pass the time, so it isn&#x27;t terribly loud.&lt;br /&gt;4) Go SLOWLY when epilating, or the hair is more likely to break.  This was an issue on my arms for a while, before I started actually following the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;5) Hold the epilator at the recommended 90-degree angle and don&#x27;t press it into your skin.  This really does make it more effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun epilators since atleast 10 years now and have never been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the ice glove yet but I doubt I ever will. It requires too much prior planning with the required cooling time.&lt;br /&gt;Wish this was a rechargeable epilator though. Hate that I have to plug it in for use. Makes it less convenient especially for travel.</li>
    <li> Everything it&#x27;s ok, usually I don&#x27;t complaint about the pain of using the epilator, but the ice glove really helps!. I definitively recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was hoping I&#x27;d find an alternative to shaving and waxing, but apparently I don&#x27;t have the melons for epilating. Being heavily tattooed, I have some experience with pain- but this is a whole different animal. I knew this was going to cause some pain going into it, but I can&#x27;t justify hours of pain for hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because it also had an electric razor head and I figured, worst case scenario, I&#x27;d just use that instead of the disposable razors I&#x27;ve gotten used to. WRONG! When the epilator portion was just too much for me (even using the ice glove before AND after) I tried the electric razor- and my boyfriend went into hysterics laughing at my frustration. I tried various directions, motions, angles, and, frankly, this was a total waste. It took three or four passes before it&#x27;d shave hair down, and I gave up after a half hour and less than a quarter of my leg was done.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this three stars because I know there&#x27;s women out there who dig the epilator bit, and I don&#x27;t want to discourage others from giving it a shot- maybe they&#x27;ll handle that pain better than me- but I wouldn&#x27;t put money into something like this again.</li>
    <li> Stop shaving and use this!! it&#x27;s painful at first, but you get use to it! No pain, no gain. Beauty hurts. Just get it already, your skin will thank you! say goodbye to shave bumps yuck. Smooth skin club!</li>
    <li> Good product but beware that it&#x27;s not cordless. I feel that at this price, this product should&#x27;ve been cordless. Bought another Braun model which is cordless for my wife.</li>
    <li> My leg hair has always caused trouble for me. I have very thick and dark leg hair where even if I shaved, it gave off this 5 o&#x27;clock shadow on my legs and people would ask me if I had shaved recently. It&#x27;s been a problem for me since elementary school and even today, has kept me from wearing shorts or dresses or skirts. I recently learned that epilators such as waxing would be a better help to me and even though waxing helped, I hated how I could only do it twice a month and had to wait for the hair to grow. Even then, some hairs wouldn&#x27;t budge no matter what. Therefore, I bought an epilator despite being intimated by the prices. There are so many epilators on here and so many mixed reviews but I ended up choosing this one. I thought the price was okay to where if I didn&#x27;t enjoy it, I wouldn&#x27;t feel too bad about wasting my money but spent enough to ensure it was decent. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times because I&#x27;m so busy in my life to take the time but I&#x27;m VERY satisfied with the results I get every time. It works every time. It&#x27;s made that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow MUCH LESS visible. If I were to use it daily or even three times a week, I would be wearing skirts in the winter! The only downsides to the product are that it&#x27;s loud although I hear it&#x27;s common with a lot of other epilators. Another is that if you have a lot of leg hair like I do, you have to clean it because sometimes too many hairs will get stuck. At the end, you have to clean up all the little hairs, unlike with other epilators, they have a little area that catches the hair. I didn&#x27;t get one of those because I was afraid it would cause it cause a malfunction. I don&#x27;t mind cleaning up. But all of these beat the upsides, which are having smooth, hair-free legs for much longer than shaving. You do have to go through a certain area a few times to get all the hairs, but that&#x27;s to be expected. Even if you didn&#x27;t get them all, you could redo it at any time. Another thing that is VERY important is that you have to exfoliate the area before and after using the epilator. I&#x27;ve gotten a few ingrown hairs that have caused me to break my skin to extract and have left a mark, so just be careful about that. As long as you exfoliate every day, and look over the area&#x27;s you epilate you should be fine. I&#x27;m happy I bought this and very much worth it&#x27;s price. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I just received this today and am very pleased with it. I opened this and used it as soon as it arrived at my home. It took me less than ten minutes to use it on my face, which was my main reason in purchasing this epilator. I am very pleased at the amount of time that it doesn&#x27;t take to rid my facial hair! The bellabe facial hair remover is nice, but takes too much time. This product is effective and convenient. My face is now smooth. Thank you, Braun company!</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator and I love it!  I am a frequent waxer and decided to go the epilator route to save some cash.  This does not disappoint.  I use it once a week on my legs and armpits.  Using an epilator can be painful, and I don&#x27;t think this one is any better or worse for the pain.  The light feature is a pleasant surprise.  I like that it is corded so I don&#x27;t have to worry about charging it.  Product works great for leg and armpits, but less well for bikini or upper lip.  I&#x27;ll likely stick to waxing those areas or purchase a smaller version.</li>
    <li> For the most part, the reviews for the Braun epilator were great so I went ahead and purchased it but I was disappointed. I&#x27;ve been using epilators for about 8 years so I was disappointed with the slow speed (even when I put it on the highest setting). The smartlight and the razor cap are really cool but for me, the speed setting is the most important factor. Looking back, I wish I would have spent an extra $25 on an epilator with dual opposed heads for more efficient epilating.</li>
    <li> So becauses of that i can say nothing about it! just know that the person liked it and was happy to gain it!</li>
    <li> It works.  It is not as painful as I would expect.  Much less than waxing and so much easier with no mixing,  melting and clean up.</li>
    <li> I bought this gift my wife. This came good packing with some useful accessories like ice glow .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it also has nice color to go with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife says it is better than previous braun model she had.</li>
    <li> Product came quickly and without any issues.  Do your homework on using this type of epilator.  Thought I had covered my bases, but found more info after I tried the epilator and was disappointed by the results.  Yes, there is pain for those asking this question.  It is a big help to take a bath before using epilator and it is also a good idea to use it as soon as you notice hair.  Couple of key things if you have course hair: hair tends to break off more than be pulled out, you end up with alot of ingrowns (missed this during homework) and exfolliate like crazy.  Products out there for ingrowns do help, but are expensive (can find homemade recipes for same online) Sometimes if you just use a good razor when you get too many ingrowns you can usually fix the issue.  Have yet to achieve the awesome smooth legs that are claimed by this manufacturer.  This could be the case for someone who has soft, barely noticable hair.  I&#x27;m sure with time I may get the desired results, but just so people know don&#x27;t expect great results immediately.  Pain and patience...</li>
    <li> i love this epilator!  It is very efficient, gets rid of every single hair.  My first braun silk epil lasted for 4 years with regular use on all areas.  when the motor finally gave out, i tried the \\&quot;emagine\\&quot; from emjoi, but it was not as good - it took three times as long to epilate and did not get rid of all hairs, plus it did not pull hair out with roots like the braun one does.  also, having the light in this model is very useful, because you won&#x27;t know how many hairs you are missing until you go outside in the natural light.  a word of warning - if you are a beginner, use the low setting on your silk epil, otherwise it will hurt.</li>
    <li> Very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Hair regrowth was sparse&lt;br /&gt;effect lasted longer than waxing&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Can use it anytime and carry when travelling</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews and read a lot about various methods of hair removal in order to decide which route I wanted to take. I now use a combination of the epilator (about once a month on my legs) and some of the razor/clipper attachments for other areas. I still shave my underarms though. I&#x27;m too sensitive still to use the epilator anywhere but my legs. People have said it gets easier, pain wise, every time you use it, which is true. But I haven&#x27;t been able to stand to use it on more than a couple of hairs before giving up and grabbing a razor. It&#x27;s really fantastic for legs though! I love how long it lasts and the hairs that grow back tend to be softer and easier to manage.</li>
    <li> works better than the other name brand i used to have i thougt the light would have little use, now i wonder what i did without it.  good price and shipped fast LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT</li>
