    <li> I wish I could buy these brushes separately as needed.  The set is great, but my toddler got a hold of my sponge and dropped it.  My paranoia forced me to bleach the sponge and of course, it disintegrated upon contact.  I had to buy the whole set, which I&#x27;m fine with, but when it&#x27;s time to replace the rest of the brushes, I will have to buy a whole new set because there will be no sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set is fine, but I still need a sponge by itself.  REALLY love the Sonic Derm though.  Good price, great cleaning and these attachments fit it perfectly.</li>
    <li> Works great has everything I need</li>
    <li> The exact brushes I needed for my skin cleansing system. Arrived promptly. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Excellent for keeping skin soft and smooth. It helps keep the face exfoliated without microderm abrasion. The pumice stone is nice for calluses.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Have used all the brushes and I can feel the difference!  Fully recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I have not received the Naturopathic Oat Facial Polish.  The Sonicderm cleansing system is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m truly enjoying the Sonic Derm SD-201BS. I can really see a big difference in my skin since using it. Money well spent....</li>
    <li> These are spares but I love the machine.  It cleans well and does not dry my face.  I&amp;#34;m using Cerave cleaner with the facial brush.</li>
    <li> i love my sonicderm cleansing system and was so thankful there&#x27;s replacement brush set!  These cleansing brushes are gentile and not abrasive for everyday use, especially for my type of skin.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have bought a couple of these little brushes.  This one will take daily use without wimping out.  I use it in the shower and am glad to have the alternate heads for body, feet.  I also have an Olay brush which I keep by the sink and use only on my face.  I like the Olay for my face better, actually, because it is not quite so vigorous.  The Olay might be a better brush for face only, someone who washes their face with a brush twice daily.  On the other hand, I like the SonicDerm because it is sturdy and has held up very well in the shower, multiple tasking.  So, together they serve their various purposes.  I&#x27;ve always been an &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34; person and now purchase less scrub than I once did.  These little brushes do a great job.</li>
    <li> I love that this item is waterproof.  The brushes are great, this was a good choice.</li>
    <li> It is everything you need to achieve nice skin.</li>
    <li> Brushes really scrub! Not for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> This brush works great! I bought one during my last deployment and it has lasted me since! I still use it! The only downside, is it&#x27;s a little rough on your face, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to someone with sensitive skin. Overall, great product for the price</li>
    <li> works perfectly with the&lt;br /&gt;SonicDerm system</li>
