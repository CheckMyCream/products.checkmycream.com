    <li> Bad quality. Zipper has broken off after few weeks. The plastic is tearing apart at the stiching places. Like the color and was very useful for me - to carry stuff for the shower at the gym. Just want it to be sturdier..</li>
    <li> I never understand why people complain about things like this being &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;. I mean, you literally paid a dollar and some change for it to ship to you for free from China, what exactly did you expect? I use this little bag to hold toiletries in the overnight bag I take to my boyfriend&#x27;s house. They aren&#x27;t waterproof or anything, the sides are mesh, so don&#x27;t use them to prevent leakage or anything. I especially like that you can select the color when usually it&#x27;s just a random selection on these things.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it as a cosmetic pouch. It looks so cheap. I use it, however, as a storage  bag for my pads, tampons and pantyliners,. and it works great.</li>
    <li> I purchased these bags at a great price, but they are not waterproof as the sides are open mesh material.  Things could leak out during travel, if used for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sizing is accurate (in cm).  These are not large bags!</li>
    <li> These did not look as pictured. They are very flimsy and the zipper doesn&#x27;t stay on track. They also are very soft and not firm looking. Very collapsible and not as taut like in the picture.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s thin plastic, and the zipper was busted but the kids can use it for playtime.I wouldn&#x27;t buy again though.</li>
    <li> A little thinner than I expected but I am using it for the side bags on the motorcycle I bought 2 more.</li>
    <li> I ordered two and after receiving those, I ordered 2 more.  These don&#x27;t cost much and they can be used for various purposes.  I used one to hold my Clarisonic, additional brush heads, and cleanser. Another for my cosmetic brushes, and another as a first aid kit.  I like that they are transparent and of different colors to quickly see what&#x27;s what.  Very handy, very versatile.</li>
    <li> Cute, little cosmetic bags. Nice color. Big enough for the weekend. Wish I had all the colors. Nice to fill and give as gifts.</li>
    <li> I felt these little bags were a good value for my money.  They are cute and useful.  Fairly fragile, so you wouldn&#x27;t want to use them hard, but they are more than adequate for storing things or putting small items in while traveling.  Were shipped promptly and arrived in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> Very cheap and very handy, esp for travel.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made.  Didn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> I dont understand why it took one month to deliver this product to me. If you have an urgent use, please look at the other replacement.</li>
    <li> Small, see-through and light weight makeup storage bag. Wonderful for traveling.</li>
    <li> cute and bigger then I expect served its purpose.</li>
    <li> holds alot of stuff but easy to rip</li>
    <li> I love it! Perfect bag for travel.</li>
    <li> Sturdier than I thought they&#x27;d be. And they&#x27;re really cute! I just wish I had received two in different colors (instead of both my bags being the same color).</li>
    <li> The bag I received was of good quality.  There is plenty of room to fit my supplies.  I am satisfied with the product and feel it was a good bargain.</li>
    <li> These are so great. I hand given one to my daughter-in-law, my best friend. I use mine for keeping all my cords for cell phone and iPad when I go places. The only compliant I have is by the picture you think your getting different colors. I didn&#x27;t realize till after I ordered that you have to select each color. That part was confusing to me. The work great.</li>
    <li> Bought one of each color these are so great for keeping bathroom items for each member of he house!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little thinner then exacted. But for the cost it will do what I need.</li>
