    <li> I like it, I am an African-American female, and I think this helps my textured hair a lot (4b-4c). I have notice my hair growing thicker. Ladies I just did the big chop after being 5 years natural (I did not trim, always trim). My hair looks as though it was never cut. I don&#x27;t know if this product is the only benefactor, because I use other products as well. But I know for certain it helps, I already have another order coming!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this supplement in the past due to hair loss and have had return to it again because I know it works!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hair Essentials for almost a year. It has worked wonders for me! I&#x27;ve tried Rogaine, Nioxin, Biotin... the list goes on and on. Be aware that you really need to give it a couple months. This product works from the inside out. People can tell a huge difference in my hair and my hair dresser recommends this product to others because of my success with it. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money compared to other products because it actually works!</li>
    <li> The product worked for my hair. My hair had started to thin and break off, but now after using the product for a year now, my hair is full, long and very little breakage.

    <li> I like this supplement because my hair does not fall off too much anymore.  I haven&#x27;t seen any new growth but I&#x27;m just happy of the partial result that I got from this product after a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I used the product alone consistently for over a year back in 2011 when my hair fell out after surgery in Oct 2010. I did not notice any new growth until after 3 months but I kept taking the product consistently and saw a lot of new growth. I had to get my hair cut because the ne growth made me look like I had a helmet head, but it did grow back. I underwent 2 more surgeries a year ago and my hair fell out again. I&#x27;m about to start the program again with hopes that it continues to do the job. But it worked for me, so I will continue to use it.</li>
