      <li>The hint of color is absolutely perfect.  </li>
      <li>this is perfect for you.</li>
      <li>But actually, it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
      <li>It works well and has a awesome color!</li>
      <li>So this seemed like the best thing for me.</li>
      <li>Not that impressed with it</li>
      <li>Best lip balm with color that can substitute for lipstick without drying out your lips.</li>
      <li>This tinted lip balm is perfect and the best of both worlds for her!  </li>
      <li>This product is the perfect shade for all skin types.</li>
      <li>I love it!!!</li>
      <li>This is a great product and at a really good price!</li>
      <li>Well, as a balm it is great.</li>
      <li>For me this is an all around win.</li>
      <li>I think their shimmer tinted lip balms are great.</li>
      <li>This color is very nice.  </li>
      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, I find this product moisturizing and it provides me with the perfect amount of color for the office.  </li>
      <li>Well this is like a lipstick , smells good and have good texture</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;ve always loved how moisturizing the Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms are, so I decided to give this a try when I saw it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite fair, but you might not be Celtic-vampire-pale like I am.</li>
      <li>I loved that stuff</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but I was put off by the  packaging.</li>
      <li>It works great for me, makes my lips feel nice and adds a fairly good amount of color.</li>
      <li>It looks great and works better than chapstick.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and pleasant as well as moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>Why spend $15 or more on Clinique when you can get this for around $5!  </li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>Its just a wonderful product, really!</li>
      <li>I liked that the Pomegranate formula seemed to add some color to my lips, and decided to give these a shot.  </li>
      <li>But to each her own.</li>
      <li>As for this seller - SHOP ELSEWHERE if you have concerns for your own safety.</li>
      <li>I got the ROSE tint, and it is so almost-not-there that you could give it to a 4-year-old girl</li>
      <li>and it feels so much better than lipstick.</li>
      <li>Since I have to add 7 more words, here they are.</li>
      <li>and it looked interesting, so</li>
      <li>and I am not a big fan of those option, but this formula is awesome!</li>
      <li>Like their nourishing balms, it makes my lips look and feel moist and conditioned without turning them into a shellacked and shiny flypaper trap that grabs stray hair and everything else, like so many lip glosses do.  </li>
      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
      <li>The light tint is a nice touch.</li>
      <li>They are smooth and give a nice color.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I love this product, glad I got a 2 pack.</li>
      <li>so I love it.</li>
      <li>I would like to believe it makes me look like I took more time than I did to put on any makeup.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s okay,</li>
      <li>It gives a great punch of color and really lasts then.</li>
      <li>This is all I use most days.</li>
      <li>This is nothing more than an overpriced drugstore brand now.</li>
      <li>This balm is ok.</li>
      <li>Love the color and consistency of this lip balm.</li>
      <li>It was so lightly colored that I honestly cannot tell there is any color in it once it is applied.</li>
      <li>I bought this Red Dahlia one since it best matched the color of my lips - just a bit deeper and redder.</li>
      <li>However Burt&#x27;s Bees is a bit more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I really love the flavor, too.</li>
      <li>favorite color for me; i&#x27;m  brown / grey haired with olive complexion and it fits perfectly with my coloring.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for a tween who wants some color but isn&#x27;t ready for lipstick.</li>
      <li>Love this light gloss hint of color.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to reapply.</li>
      <li>I would love to keep several of these around because I lose things like this easily and since they are pricier, it would be nice to be able to buy them in quantity.  </li>
      <li>The description of tinted lip balm is actually completely accurate.  </li>
      <li>My skin is a light peaches and cream color.</li>
      <li>I think it will be to light for you if you wear it alone.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a light to medium weight and needs to be reapplied.  </li>
      <li>I would have given it 3 stars for its smooth feel.  </li>
      <li>Instead, there&#x27;s this light, fruity wax flavor and no color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I enjoy these tinted lip balms from Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soothing and makes my lips smooth, but there&#x27;s no color at all.</li>
      <li>but I wear it to work and look great, plus my lips are totally healed in the space of a day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth, not sticky.  </li>
      <li>It seems like the kind that would melt super easily in a hot car.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It just became my new favorite lip balm!  </li>
      <li>It feels great - like a very silky lip balm, and makes my lips very soft.  </li>
      <li>First of all, let me say that I adore Burt&#x27;s Bees products and have many of them.</li>
      <li>Red Rose is better (brighter).</li>
      <li>For someone, like me, who doesn&#x27;t prefer to wear lipstick but knows they need some color on their lips, this is just right!</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not  stiff like the peppermint BB&#x27;s kind.</li>
      <li>I know because I recommend it to everyone and they all love it as much as I do.</li>
      <li>My preferences are cool colors, nothing with any hint of tan, brown, gold, etc.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a cool product</li>
      <li>Red Dahlia is an absolutely gorgeous color in the tube.</li>
      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s lip balms, and really like this product.  </li>
      <li>I love these so much</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a nice product for the woman who prefers a natural style, and a nice way to introduce girls to \\&quot;makeup\\&quot; without going straight to Tartville.who prefers a natural style, and a nice way to introduce girls to \\&quot;makeup\\&quot; without going straight to Tartville.</li>
      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees regular lip balm, so I figured I would really love it with a tint.</li>
      <li>Very pretty color.</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s the price to pay for something that&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
      <li>It looks like you are going to get a nice, fat lip balm when really it is just a normal Chapstick-sized tube.</li>
      <li>I do not wear a lot of make-up, so this product was great for a quick little pop of color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty chapstick!</li>
      <li>I am such a huge fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees, and have many of their products.</li>
      <li>I have olive skin, and it has enough pigment to provide a nice tint.  </li>
      <li>I bought three of these tinted balms -- red dahlia, rose and hibiscus.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind -- it has a fruity fragrance, no SPF, and you&#x27;ll need to keep applying it throughout the day if you want to keep your lips colorful.</li>
      <li>I love the natural finish this product leaves.</li>
      <li>This is a great dupe for clinique almost lipstick black honey!  </li>
      <li>So when I bought one of the line directly titled \\&quot;Tinted Lip Balm\\&quot;, I was very excited to try it.  </li>
      <li>The scent fades pretty quickly though</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Living in Arizona, air is very dry and lips need moisture year round, this is the only lip balm I tried that did not peel.</li>
    <li> This lip balm doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen in it so I wouldn&#x27;t wear it.  The colors are pretty but of no use to me in sunny California.</li>
    <li> Very misturising, made of natural materials, no yucky paraffine etc. I have pale lips and normally use sheer lipgloss/balm, but the Red Dahlia really gives no color at all. Has an artificial cherry flavor.  Not that impressed with it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who never wear lipstick and walk around with chapstick in my pocket. So I thought if I could add a little color to my lips and get the same chap free result...why not? It looks great and works better than chapstick. I now have burt&#x27;s bees in my front pocket. love it!</li>
    <li> I just found this product at the drug store. Being a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees policy on natural ingredients and NO animal testing, I had to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lips are always chapped and very hard to quench. This balm is SOOOooOOOoooo soothing! It lasts all day, AND the natural hint of color adds a healthy hue to my face (as I can&#x27;t stand to wear actual lipstick). It&#x27;s the best of all worlds:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not as crazy about lipstick as I used to be, and part of that is due to awesome lip balms like these. I bought three of these tinted balms -- red dahlia, rose and hibiscus. Oddly, the red dahlia looks darkest in the tube but is very sheer on me, (My lips are on the pale side) but the rose has a bit more pink punch and the hibiscus covers a bit more than that, but it&#x27;s a paler, more natural pink. They all apply well, feel soothing and moisturizing, and have decent staying power. Plus there&#x27;s no strong smell or flavor, which is a huge bonus with me. I have found, too, that if I want more impact, I apply Revlon&#x27;s lipstain in Gothic -- a strong, bright red as a base (on naked lips), let that dry, and apply these balms on top instead of the Revlon-supplied one. It gives a great punch of color and really lasts then. I may never buy lipstick again.</li>
    <li> I bought the rose-tinted lip balm. It&#x27;s a good product, but I was put off by the  packaging. It&#x27;s three times the size of the  actual tube of lip balm, which is quite small (smaller than Chapstick, for example.) I&#x27;m not sure why Burt&#x27;s Bees would do this, unless they want to mislead the consumer. Also, in these times, the manufacturer should be cutting down on packaging, not unnecessarily beefing it up.</li>
    <li> First, this is not a lipstick.  I don&#x27;t wear lipstick.  My lips are on the dry side and I&#x27;m usually blowing my nose (because I&#x27;m always cold) and the lipstick would wipe right off anyway.  But I always use lip balm.  Don&#x27;t need to look in the mirror to put it on and it moisturizes.  This product not only moisturizes but it adds a touch of tint so I think I look a little more put together.  It is not a substitute for lipstick but it gives your lips just a hint of color.  I would like to believe it makes me look like I took more time than I did to put on any makeup.  I found that it doesn&#x27;t stay on all that long, it&#x27;s a light to medium weight and needs to be reapplied.  Overall it&#x27;s a cool product and I like that it comes in a variety of colors.  I have tried the Red Dahlia, I have a tan complexion and it adds just enough color.  I look forward to trying other colors too.  And a note, I agree with another reviewer, I wish it had sunscreen in it.</li>
    <li> I love this sheer color. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips and also doesn&#x27;t taste bad. The color does wear off over a few hours, but since it&#x27;s fairly subtle that doesn&#x27;t matter that much - and it&#x27;s easy to reapply. It&#x27;s pretty chapstick!</li>
    <li> I enjoy these tinted lip balms from Burt&#x27;s Bees.  They are smooth and give a nice color.  This color is just not my favorite; it&#x27;s a bit dull.  Red Rose is better (brighter).</li>
    <li> This tinted lip balm is EXACTLY what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  It&#x27;s smooth, not sticky.  Very moisturizing.  I actually bought it the first time at an apothecary in Chicago where I could sample all the shades.  Red Dahlia looks like it would be dark, but actually it gives the perfect \\&quot;bitten lip\\&quot; shade.  For someone, like me, who doesn&#x27;t prefer to wear lipstick but knows they need some color on their lips, this is just right!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t please everyone when it comes to make-up. I use to work in the field selling it and putting it on people&#x27;e faces. Anyways, I really like this balm and especially the color. I have strawberry blonde hair, aqua colored eyes and irish/german skin. My skin is a light peaches and cream color. If you have light brown to blonde hair coloring I think you will love this product in red dahlia. If you have darker skin and/or hair I think it will be to light for you if you wear it alone. I wear this balm all the time and I work in a professional job now. If I want it darker I put a lip pencil under it(med dk red) or the Cover Girl lip stain in Bit of Brown. Its just a wonderful product, really!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup, and when I do, I like a natural, soft shade. I bought this Red Dahlia one since it best matched the color of my lips - just a bit deeper and redder. I&#x27;m blonde with blue eyes, but have an outdoorsy complexion since I&#x27;m a landscaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this lip balm didn&#x27;t perform well either as a lip balm or as a lip tint. It was so lightly colored that I honestly cannot tell there is any color in it once it is applied. I applied it on my hand to see, and even against my light skin, the color was barely there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had expected and hoped for the same signature lip balm I&#x27;ve come to love from Burt&#x27;s - the peppermint one that everyone loves. Instead, there&#x27;s this light, fruity wax flavor and no color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For six bucks, I&#x27;m really very disappointed. Obviously Loreal&#x27;s taken what was cool about Burt&#x27;s and ruined it. This is nothing more than an overpriced drugstore brand now.</li>
    <li> For at least a decade I&#x27;ve been a loyal fan of Clinique&#x27;s Almost Lipstick in Black Honey. It was expensive, and it dried out my lips, but I put up with both of those facts because the color was so amazingly perfect for my auburn hair and light complexion. However, I&#x27;ve always loved how moisturizing the Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms are, so I decided to give this a try when I saw it. To my delight, I found that the Red Dahlia is nearly identical in color payoff as my beloved Black Honey. Better yet, it&#x27;s cheaper, and it actually moisturizes rather than drying my lips. I do have to apply frequently, but that was just as true with the Clinque as well, so that part doesn&#x27;t bother me. For me this is an all around win.</li>
    <li> I do not wear a lot of make-up, so this product was great for a quick little pop of color.</li>
    <li> This is moisturizing, but there is surprisingly no or barely any colour at all. When i put it on my inner wrist nothing shows even though I am very pale. I guess i&#x27;ll use it as regular chapstick which is ridiculous for its high price. It definitely looks like it would have colour in the tube which is strange.</li>
    <li> I Really like the subtle color that it leaves on my lips. If you are looking for a lipstick to moisture your lips leaving a touch of color on it this is perfect for you.</li>
    <li> My lips have been so chapped the last few weeks that they were cracking and bleeding all the time. I bought this product yesterday at walgreens and after reapplying it every few hours it has totally fixed my problem. I love hte tint to it, its not really dark but thats the point its not lipstick its just supposed to be a little tinted. I think it loosk great, like my lips are naturally this really subtle pretty color. Its not for a night out on the town obviously but I wear it to work and look great, plus my lips are totally healed in the space of a day. I would totally recommend this!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for in terms of lip color. It looks very natural and subtle, but makes a difference on my lips so that they don&#x27;t look too pale. The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t really feel like my lips absorb any moisture from the balm. This is my first Burt&#x27;s Bees balm and I don&#x27;t know if this is universal, but I prefer my old Bigelow &amp; Co gloss for actual skin help. This one, while it feels good at first, tends to build up a funny residue on my lips and they get a little chapped anyway.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm with color that can substitute for lipstick without drying out your lips.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like giving negative reviews, but I wanted to give an honest opinion so that others looking for a little color on their lips don&#x27;t waste their money and end up disappointed.  The balm itself feels great on, but so do a number of other natural brands that cost less than half what this one does. I wanted to try it for the color aspect, but when I put it on, it was completely indistinguishable from a regular non-tinted lip balm. If it weren&#x27;t for the high price and promise of color (that let me down) I would have given it 3 stars for its smooth feel.  My opinion: don&#x27;t waste your money. But to each her own.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my wife, who likes to wear lip balm but doesn&#x27;t like that it has no color typically.  She likes to wear lipstick as well, but doesn&#x27;t wear too dark or too bright, and it doesn&#x27;t help when her lips are chapped.  This tinted lip balm is perfect and the best of both worlds for her!  It moisturizes AND offers a subtle tint for those who don&#x27;t want too much on their lips.</li>
    <li> I am such a huge fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees, and have many of their products. The color I wanted was only available in a two pack, so I went ahead and ordered it. Completely disappointed when only one delivered! Three small items were delivered in one of the fold-over boxes (that isn&#x27;t completely enclosed); that plus a hole in the bag the lip balm was packed in means that one lucky UPS delivery person has a lovely shade of lip balm. Not worth an hour on the phone with customer service to get $4 back, but I won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> I was BEYOND SHOCKED to discover that this product was shipped without a safety seal.  The cap was removable without breaking any plastic seal.  For all I know, it had been removed before the product reached me.  I have no evidence that the product was tampered with - but no proof that it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm itself, well, this is a commodity item available at local drug stores and who-knows-how-many other online venues.  The product itself is primo and I recommend it highly.  As for this seller - SHOP ELSEWHERE if you have concerns for your own safety.</li>
    <li> This product is the perfect shade for all skin types. I know because I recommend it to everyone and they all love it as much as I do. I get lots of compliments on the natural color and it feels so much better than lipstick. Perfect for a tween who wants some color but isn&#x27;t ready for lipstick.</li>
    <li> It is natural and healthy and the color makes you lip shine with a hint of color...perfect for daily day wear at work or otherwise.</li>
    <li> First of all, let me say that I adore Burt&#x27;s Bees products and have many of them. This is the first item I have not really cared for, because the color is almost nonexistent. I got the ROSE tint, and it is so almost-not-there that you could give it to a 4-year-old girl so she could play dress up! Strictly as a lip balm, it is as good as the rest of the Burt&#x27;s Bees line, but you might as well buy the non-colored version for less money. Also, I don&#x27;t understand the packaging? It looks like you are going to get a nice, fat lip balm when really it is just a normal Chapstick-sized tube. Why wrap it up like that when other balms in the line are just sold with a protective seal around the lid and no packaging?</li>
    <li> This color is very nice.  I have olive skin, and it has enough pigment to provide a nice tint.  I also like that the lip balm is very emollient and nourishing.  It is necessary to reapply every so often, though, just like other lip balms.</li>
    <li> Purchased as Christmas present for wife.  It is pretty much what you think it is - lip balm.  Apparently she really likes it... and you cannot beat this price.</li>
    <li> Love this light gloss hint of color.  Costs to much though. Wish they were less.  Fave lip gloss. Only a hint so don&#x27;t expect lipstick.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees. I think their shimmer tinted lip balms are great. So when I bought one of the line directly titled \\&quot;Tinted Lip Balm\\&quot;, I was very excited to try it.  Red Dahlia is an absolutely gorgeous color in the tube. It looks all dark and &#x27;bitten berry&#x27;. Unfortunately it is almost clear when you apply it.  Although my lips are very pigmented, even when I swatched this on my very pale hand, I had to swipe the lip balm four times for a hint of color to show.  The only reason that I gave this two stars was for the formula. It&#x27;s very smooth and pleasant as well as moisturizing.  But other than that this lip balm fails to do exactly what it claims, which is to provide color. So please don&#x27;t waste your time on this.</li>
    <li> Well this is like a lipstick , smells good and have good texture&lt;br /&gt;but the color is almost imperceptible , but is good quality product&lt;br /&gt;I give 4 stars because I think this have color but is too little&lt;br /&gt;come on time</li>
    <li> This is a great dupe for clinique almost lipstick black honey!  Why spend $15 or more on Clinique when you can get this for around $5!  This is my secret weapon.  I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, I find this product moisturizing and it provides me with the perfect amount of color for the office.  I bought Clinique black honey because I wanted to see what all the hype was about and I realized these 2 products are exactly the same!!!!  However Burt&#x27;s Bees is a bit more moisturizing. I love this product, glad I got a 2 pack. I will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> It keeps my lips from drying out and peeling so I love it. Since I have to add 7 more words, here they are.</li>
    <li> I like this product. The light tint is a nice touch. The color is subtle. I used to have chapped lips all the time, which were uncomfortable, but since using this regularly I don&#x27;t have that problem. Hooray!</li>
    <li> I had not used this brand before, but I am almost down to my last 1/8&amp;#34; of Bonne Bell LipLix in a grape color/flavor. I loved that stuff but alas, not made any longer in the color I love. So, searching here, I found various tints in the Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted lip balm, in what looked like a similar color in their stick form. I have to say the color isn&#x27;t as intense as my LipLix because it&#x27;s lighter and more subtle. That&#x27;s okay, I&#x27;m quite fair, but you might not be Celtic-vampire-pale like I am. My preferences are cool colors, nothing with any hint of tan, brown, gold, etc. So this seemed like the best thing for me. I think if you try it you might like it, and you can probably layer it to make the color a little darker if you wish. Keep in mind -- it has a fruity fragrance, no SPF, and you&#x27;ll need to keep applying it throughout the day if you want to keep your lips colorful. But that&#x27;s the price to pay for something that&#x27;s very pretty. What we ladies go through!</li>
    <li> Very pretty color. I wear this alone as well as over a day-long lip tint and it works well either way. I really love the flavor, too.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s lip balms, and really like this product.  I liked that the Pomegranate formula seemed to add some color to my lips, and decided to give these a shot.  The Red Dahlia is the only tinted one I&#x27;ve tried and I love it, but will probably try some other colors next time I see them on sale.  Red Dahlia is the darkest one they offer, and I definitely see a color boost after applying it.  It also leaves a faint but definite \\&quot;kiss\\&quot; mark on napkins and glasses, although it is easy to rub off of a cheek.  If you are used to lipstick or have a lot of color on your lips naturally, it&#x27;s probably not going to seem like much of a change to you, but I feel \\&quot;dressed\\&quot; when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like to wear makeup and find high gloss and shimmer to be very fake and noticeable, certainly on my face, so I love the natural finish this product leaves. Like their nourishing balms, it makes my lips look and feel moist and conditioned without turning them into a shellacked and shiny flypaper trap that grabs stray hair and everything else, like so many lip glosses do.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have an annoying mint smell/flavor, which I think the Burt&#x27;s shimmer lip balms and some of their regular balms do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish they would sell them in packs of three like they do some of their other balms, because I think a lot of the higher price comes with the special cardboard outer tube they package them in. These are the same size as a regular balm, which I love because I also don&#x27;t carry a purse and these tuck into a coat pocket easily and don&#x27;t take up a lot of room in the only bag I sometimes take with me, which is really just a netbook carrier and doesn&#x27;t have room for tons of vanity-cargo.  I would love to keep several of these around because I lose things like this easily and since they are pricier, it would be nice to be able to buy them in quantity.  Three on a card for 18.00, maybe, and save the fancy tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice product for the woman who prefers a natural style, and a nice way to introduce girls to \\&quot;makeup\\&quot; without going straight to Tartville.who prefers a natural style, and a nice way to introduce girls to \\&quot;makeup\\&quot; without going straight to Tartville.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees regular lip balm, so I figured I would really love it with a tint. Well, as a balm it is great. It&#x27;s soothing and makes my lips smooth, but there&#x27;s no color at all. It looks nice and dark in the tube, but there&#x27;s no color on my lips.  I even put some on a white tissue, and I could barely see it. I only paid this much for lip balm because I thought I was getting some color with the softening action.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I was a little concerned that this would be too dark for me - I usually go for very subtle \\&quot;nude\\&quot; tones in lip color.  But actually, it&#x27;s perfect.  It doesn&#x27;t go on dark at all, but very sheer, subtle, and just a hint of color.  The description of tinted lip balm is actually completely accurate.  It looks very dark in the tube, but it seems to be mostly lip balm with just a little tint.  It feels great - like a very silky lip balm, and makes my lips very soft.  The hint of color is absolutely perfect.  It just became my new favorite lip balm!  As an aside, the cardboard tube that it&#x27;s marketed in is a little misleading.  This item is the usual \\&quot;chapstick\\&quot; type size and shape that most lip balms are.</li>
    <li> This is all I use most days. Love the color and consistency of this lip balm. I use it interchangeably for what I used to use clear lip balm or actual lipstick. I love these so much I have them stashed everywhere - purse, car, coat pockets, etc. Great subscribe and save item!</li>
    <li> This balm is ok. I was disappointed as I thought it would be as large as the photo displays. The cover is just a huge card board paper and a tinny tiny balm inside. It&#x27;s soft on the lips and stays on for a while.</li>
    <li> Definitely thought the color would show more...oh well, it&#x27;s moisturizing.</li>
    <li> favorite color for me; i&#x27;m  brown / grey haired with olive complexion and it fits perfectly with my coloring.  it&#x27;s a keeper</li>
    <li> Ok, I wanted a chapstick with a TINY bit of color and this has a barely there look. As in you can barely tell a difference, it looks TOTALLY natural, only a little bit better :) Way less color than their lip shimmer and l like how it feels much better too.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, it makes the skin on my lips peeled. So I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and at a really good price! It is a lightweight, moisturizing balm with enough tint to add some nice, natural looking color. Burt&#x27;s Bees regular beeswax chap stick style balm can be really heavy and I am not a big fan of those option, but this formula is awesome!</li>
    <li> I just saw this at the store one day and it looked interesting, so I got the darkest one there- Red Dahlia. I really like it! It works great for me, makes my lips feel nice and adds a fairly good amount of color. The smell is a little weird, it smells like hummingbird food, so pretty much sugar and waxy smelly, haha...  The scent fades pretty quickly though so it&#x27;s not a big deal! The formula is a great thickness, it stays on for a long time as long as you don&#x27;t rub it off by eating but also doesn&#x27;t have that yucky too-thick plastic feel that some lipbalm s have. It&#x27;s just a flat color, no shimmer or sparkles, it leaves a faint shine that looks really nice and isn&#x27;t super obvious. It tends to glob off if you press it on too hard though, it&#x27;s not  stiff like the peppermint BB&#x27;s kind. It seems like the kind that would melt super easily in a hot car.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I definitely reccomend it! It works well and has a awesome color! :) If only it smelled a little better......</li>
