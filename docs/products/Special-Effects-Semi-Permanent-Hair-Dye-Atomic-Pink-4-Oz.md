      <li>This stuff is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>best hair dye you can get lasts a whole year</li>
      <li>Great customer service and quick receipt of product.</li>
      <li>It was easy to apply and was a good amount for the price.</li>
      <li>Loved hot bright</li>
      <li>I decided it was time to dye my hair bright colors again, and was so happy to find my old Special Effects Dye!</li>
      <li>if that makes any sense :3</li>
      <li>I mix it with aloe vera gel (when i do it with conditioner, the result is patchy) and let sit for an hour or more on bleached hair.</li>
      <li>Super vibrant, with awesome staying power!</li>
      <li>It takes forever to fade compared to Manic Panic, and I love that.</li>
      <li>Much better than manic panic.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I love their store in Sherman Oaks and anything you see online they will order for you in the store.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair interesting colors since I was a pre-teen.</li>
      <li>Will work, but there&#x27;s alot of dyes out there that are better.</li>
      <li>This hair dye turns your hair a beautiful bright almost magenta pink.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a great, vibrant color.</li>
      <li>The dye bled for a week or two after applying, but I was able to scrub it out of the bathtub fairly easily.</li>
      <li>The atomic Pink is great, lasts a while, dyes over orange hair that isn&#x27;t bleached perfectly, and it&#x27;s easy to get the color to be pastel pink instead of bright pink.&lt;br</li>
      <li>you want a pink dye that lasts, this one is perfect!</li>
      <li>so I get the perfect cotton candy pink in my hair without having to use tons.</li>
      <li>Best pink hair dye ever, &amp; trust me</li>
      <li>And it was easy to wipe off my forehead.</li>
      <li>Even though there&#x27;s a lot of color transfer and bleeding, it&#x27;s rare to see truly quality bright colors especially as vibrant and rich as Special Effects.  </li>
      <li>This is the best hair dye ive ever used it never leaves patches of color and makes my hair super neon pink.</li>
      <li>Ive tried other brands, but special effects always works the best for me.</li>
      <li>this dye is very very bright pink.</li>
      <li>i would greatly recomend this brand over others of similar aspect</li>
      <li>For an exotic color dye, it also has great staying power, it ends up being a cotton candy pink after some time.</li>
      <li>While I adore this brand, getting up and seeing pink on your nice sheets or on your new cute top isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant.  </li>
      <li>My hair has held the color for 8 months, and I only need to recolor the new growth, awesome stuff!</li>
      <li>Well worth the money!</li>
      <li>The color payout is wonderful, a deep, bright pink when first used.</li>
      <li>lucky enough to have pretty fair hair, so when it&#x27;s bleached it&#x27;s super light, which makes the color even more</li>
      <li>I have been in the salon business for a while now and NOTHING beats Special FX.</li>
      <li>Atomic Pink is also one of the best shades I have discovered as it is very intense and pretty.</li>
      <li>its stays bright the only reason why ive had to touch up the color is because of root growth.</li>
      <li>This is seriously the best hair dye I have ever used.</li>
      <li>All of their colors that I&#x27;ve tried are fantastic but this is by far my favorite shade.</li>
      <li>everyting quick after dying or it will stain the sink, bathtub, etc.</li>
      <li>it also does not wash out quickly.</li>
      <li>my package quickly and was the correct color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I LOVE this dye, and to be honest I&#x27;ve never used any color except for Atomic Pink, so</li>
      <li>it was a lighter pink that was still nice before I dyed it again!</li>
      <li>Special Effects has some of the most beautiful colors on the market, especially Atomic Pink.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>It smells great and does not damage my hair, plus the color in the bowl looks pretty much like what you get on your head; I&#x27;m definitely sold to this brand!</li>
      <li>This dye is a very bright beautiful pink, even if diluted (I used less than 1/4 of the bottle for my short hair, so it&#x27;s economical too!).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used more brands than I can name and pink is my favorite.</li>
      <li>For me personally I&#x27;d rather have my hair bright &amp; very pink for months &amp; do a bit more cleaning, rather than have my color fade after two weeks!</li>
      <li>I loved my pink hair, and if you&#x27;d like to be pink for a long time, this stuff is the best dye out there.</li>
      <li>It stayed bright pink in my hair for MONTHS!</li>
      <li>It did not bleed anywhere else (pillows, clothes) after the initial rinse though, so more points for Special effects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of different brands and colors, and I&#x27;ve found that Special Effects causes staining on pillows and clothes more than anything else.  </li>
      <li>right when they said it would.</li>
      <li>it was, how this color in particular glowed in UV light.</li>
      <li>First thing&#x27;s first, the dye was delivered extremely quick.</li>
      <li>this stuff works great and stays in for a long time as long as you use sulfate free shampoo.</li>
      <li>I loved having pink hair, it turned out a nice hot pink then when it faded after forever</li>
      <li>If you have orange hair instead of white, it will become more salmon coloured but still very pink, and not too bright.</li>
      <li>This is a gorgeous hot pink that stays bright and vibrant for way longer than any other dye I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Special Effects Atomic Pink is by far the best pink dye on the market.</li>
      <li>I even diluted it with conditioner and it came out super vibrant which isn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>At first the dye was an AMAZING raspberry-magenta color that practically glowed, and after a few washes it \\&quot;faded\\&quot; to a bright hot pink.</li>
      <li>I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
      <li>:Simply mix it with condition the color of the conditioner mix is just slightly darker than your ideal shade, and leave in hair for 1 hour.</li>
      <li>time, I&#x27;ll try Virgin Rose, I read that the magenta-purple fades to look like... Atomic Pink!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always favored SE and chose them each time I would go back to having pink hair (which has been probably 3 times now).  </li>
      <li>Every professional I have talked too has raved about this, so I finally bought a bottle, and OMG, it is amazing.</li>
      <li>Wonderful very little used and it stayed in my hair for a long time without fading!</li>
      <li>In the long run it&#x27;s a much better value than manic panic&#x27;s dye if you plan on having the color longer than a week.</li>
      <li>(i wash my hair every other day), I still have nice bubblegum pink hair :)</li>
      <li>6 weeks later my hair, while slightly faded, still looks great.</li>
      <li>Super bright pink that lasts forever and fades to a lighter pink.  </li>
      <li>Turned out a little darker than I thought it would (it turned out almost red) but still a great color.</li>
      <li>So it is ok it just lasts so long!!!</li>
      <li>Letting them color their hair was the highlight of getting ready to return to see their friends.</li>
      <li>but after 3 or so washes then it turned more pink.</li>

    <li> Beautiful dye! I used it over hair bleached to a somewhat brassy yellow blonde. At first the dye was an AMAZING raspberry-magenta color that practically glowed, and after a few washes it \\&quot;faded\\&quot; to a bright hot pink. The dye bled for a week or two after applying, but I was able to scrub it out of the bathtub fairly easily. Just make sure to wear dark shirts for the first few days and stick a towel over your pillowcase and you&#x27;ll be fine; it&#x27;s not as bad as some other \\&quot;unnatural\\&quot; dyes when it comes to bleeding.    This dye is absolutely amazing, but be warned, when people say this stuff lasts forever they aren&#x27;t kidding!! Three months after application I still had hot pink hair - it had faded a bit, but it still was very stubbornly pink. Eventually I needed to dye my hair back to a natural color. First, I tried fading it out by washing my hair very often with cleansing/dandruff shampoo and that literally did nothing to the color (but it did dry my hair out). I gave up on trying to fade it and decided to bleach out the Atomic Pink, but bleaching it just made it turn a bubblegum/cotton candy pink color. The effect was pretty, but seriously, this stuff might as well be labeled a permanent hair color! No complaints, though...I loved my pink hair, and if you&#x27;d like to be pink for a long time, this stuff is the best dye out there.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT hair dye! I have been in the salon business for a while now and NOTHING beats Special FX. I have used a wide variety of professional color lines that are so called \\&quot;Near permanent\\&quot;. I have never come across a pink that comes out so vivid and stays that way.</li>
    <li> efficient service. just what i ordered in perfect condition. lowest price. brand new. got here right when they said it would.</li>
    <li> After having pink hair for over 10 years now, I&#x27;ve tried them all. I still go back to ole Special Effects. I LOVE this dye, and to be honest I&#x27;ve never used any color except for Atomic Pink, so my review is based on that color only.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m lucky enough to have pretty fair hair, so when it&#x27;s bleached it&#x27;s super light, which makes the color even more vivid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think out of all the dyes I&#x27;ve tried, the fade factor is what keeps me coming back. Now, I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day so that of course helps as well. But DANG this stuff stays so bright and even!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is that unless you really, really rinse it out, it does bleed pretty easily. Be ready to use a a towel and pillowcase you don&#x27;t mind getting pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this dye!</li>
    <li> Special Effects has some of the most beautiful colors on the market, especially Atomic Pink.  I&#x27;ve always favored SE and chose them each time I would go back to having pink hair (which has been probably 3 times now).  I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of different brands and colors, and I&#x27;ve found that Special Effects causes staining on pillows and clothes more than anything else.  While I adore this brand, getting up and seeing pink on your nice sheets or on your new cute top isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant.  Even though there&#x27;s a lot of color transfer and bleeding, it&#x27;s rare to see truly quality bright colors especially as vibrant and rich as Special Effects.  It also has great staying power after quite a few washes due to such a high pigment concentration.  I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other extreme color products, but I&#x27;ve used &#x27;regular&#x27; hair coloring stuff, and this is WAY easier!  No stinging, rinses out with cold water, stays bright for 3-4 weeks.  (I can&#x27;t bring myself to wash my hair in COLD water every day, I&#x27;m sure it would last another week or two if I did).</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best hair dye I have ever used. It stayed bright pink in my hair for MONTHS! It was easy to apply and was a good amount for the price. If you are looking to go pink, this is seriously your only option! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Fatal Impact is great!  I love their store in Sherman Oaks and anything you see online they will order for you in the store.  I ordered the Special Effects Atomic Pink yesterday and it was at my house today!  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This hair dye turns your hair a beautiful bright almost magenta pink.  The dye is long lasting. The one set back to be prepared for is that for the first week or so it will stain both your skin and your bath tub when you wash your hair.</li>
    <li> Getting grandkids ready for school is hard enough. Letting them color their hair was the highlight of getting ready to return to see their friends. Two of their friends ordered as soon as they saw my family. Great customer service and quick receipt of product. Would order again.</li>
    <li> I used this stuff for years as a teenager. Loved hot bright it was, how this color in particular glowed in UV light. everything. I decided it was time to dye my hair bright colors again, and was so happy to find my old Special Effects Dye! I&#x27;ve used even professional level color, and nothing lasts as long as this does.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  It is still vibrant pink and I have washed my hair every day for the last month.  Love it</li>
    <li> Wonderful very little used and it stayed in my hair for a long time without fading! Well worth the money! Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Best pink hair dye ever, &amp; trust me I&#x27;ve tried them all! I&#x27;ve been bleaching my black hair, &amp; dying it crazy colors for years, &amp; this is the ONLY dye I&#x27;ll ever use! Only thing to be aware of is that your hair will stain everything, towels, pillow cases, hands, finger nails, skin, &amp; yes your bathtub. I wear gloves to wash my hair the first few days. For me personally I&#x27;d rather have my hair bright &amp; very pink for months &amp; do a bit more cleaning, rather than have my color fade after two weeks!</li>
    <li> Love this dye!! It takes forever to fade compared to Manic Panic, and I love that. I dilute the dye in conditioner so I get the perfect cotton candy pink in my hair without having to use tons. In the long run it&#x27;s a much better value than manic panic&#x27;s dye if you plan on having the color longer than a week.</li>
    <li> Super bright pink that lasts forever and fades to a lighter pink.  I loved having my hair this color and used to glow under blacklights.</li>
    <li> Stays better than any other.</li>
    <li> Got this for my fifteen year old daughter and she said it worked beautifully. Relatively inexpensive compared to the color the salon tried to push on her.</li>
    <li> Every professional I have talked too has raved about this, so I finally bought a bottle, and OMG, it is amazing. I bleached the top of my hair, and dyed the bottom layer black. Then I put Special Effects in Atomic Pink on the bleached part for two hours. It came out HOT HOT Pink. Like, Neon pink! It&#x27;s really bright, shinny, and didn&#x27;t make my hair feel more damaged. It has no smell to it whatsoever. And it was easy to wipe off my forehead. After 4 washes it stopped bleeding. I&#x27;m not sure how long it lasts on me since I just used it a week and a half ago, but so far it&#x27;s just as vibrant as it was the first day and I wash my hair every other day and use a lot of product every day and blow dry and flat iron my hair daily. It seems like it will stand up to the damage I do to it. Next time I&#x27;m going to go with cupcake pink or maybe even a color like virgin rose. This stuff is AMAZING.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dabbled with adding pink or purple to the ends of my hair for the past 1 1/2 years. Until trying this product I was using a different brand over my light brown hair. I decided to really commit to it this time so I had the under layer of my hair bleached and tried Special Effects Atomic Pink because the reviews said it lasts much longer than the others. Wow! It is bright and beautiful. I&#x27;m not quite 2 weeks into it so I can&#x27;t say how long it will last. However, I can say it started very bright and after 4 washings it&#x27;s still very pink, although I do see slight fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find it harder to apply than the product I had used previously, and it took much more of the product. Also, not being a professional colorist and coloring the back underside of my hair myself and with the help of my boyfriend, we didn&#x27;t get the color even so it is more intense on my left side than my right. When I touch it up I&#x27;ll try harder to get it even. I do love the color!</li>
    <li> best hair dye you can get lasts a whole year</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first... I uses it and it isn&#x27;t pink it is magenta but after 3 or so washes then it turned more pink. After 3 weeks it started to fade... So it is ok it just lasts so long!!!</li>
    <li> Atomic Pink and Cupcake Pink are probably my favorite pink dyes out on the market.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would let us know when they plan on producing their dyes again, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bleeds a bit, but a lot less than other dyes I&#x27;ve used (like MANIC PANIC, gross!)&lt;br /&gt;Colors tend to stay in your (bleached!) hair for quite some time and it fades into a pretty neon/pastel pink... if that makes any sense :3</li>
    <li> The atomic Pink is great, lasts a while, dyes over orange hair that isn&#x27;t bleached perfectly, and it&#x27;s easy to get the color to be pastel pink instead of bright pink.&lt;br /&gt;Pastel Pink:Simply mix it with condition the color of the conditioner mix is just slightly darker than your ideal shade, and leave in hair for 1 hour. If you have orange hair instead of white, it will become more salmon coloured but still very pink, and not too bright.</li>
    <li> Closest thing to permanent I&#x27;ve found. Turned out a little darker than I thought it would (it turned out almost red) but still a great color. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> First off if you want your hair to turn out this color it need to be a platinum or bleach blonde color BEFORE applying this to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Got my package quickly and was the correct color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait 2 weeks after it is blonde before adding it in so your hair has some time to recover and use lots of conditioner in between dying!&lt;br /&gt;If you want it to just have a pink tint you can add it to dark hair but don&#x27;t have brown/black hair and expect it to turn out bright!&lt;br /&gt;Use colder water if you want the color to last longer and stay brighter as warmer water and a ton of shampoo-ing will make it fade quickly D:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color last 2 months with very little fading! I loved having pink hair, it turned out a nice hot pink then when it faded after forever it was a lighter pink that was still nice before I dyed it again!</li>
    <li> Yes! Ive been using this brand of dye since I was a young teenager. Ive tried other brands, but special effects always works the best for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair interesting colors since I was a pre-teen. I&#x27;ve used more brands than I can name and pink is my favorite. This is a gorgeous hot pink that stays bright and vibrant for way longer than any other dye I&#x27;ve ever used. All of their colors that I&#x27;ve tried are fantastic but this is by far my favorite shade.</li>
    <li> this stuff works great and stays in for a long time as long as you use sulfate free shampoo. i would greatly recomend this brand over others of similar aspect</li>
    <li> it last longer and stays brighter... the only thing bad about it was that it dyed my tub pink after the first 2 or 3 washes... other then that. its stays bright the only reason why ive had to touch up the color is because of root growth.</li>
    <li> I love it! Came in about 3 days and dyed my hair immediately, looks awesome but havent tried out the UV light effect yet.</li>
    <li> Not a great dye. We were not satisfied with this product. Will work, but there&#x27;s alot of dyes out there that are better.</li>
    <li> This dye is a very bright beautiful pink, even if diluted (I used less than 1/4 of the bottle for my short hair, so it&#x27;s economical too!). I mix it with aloe vera gel (when i do it with conditioner, the result is patchy) and let sit for an hour or more on bleached hair. It smells great and does not damage my hair, plus the color in the bowl looks pretty much like what you get on your head; I&#x27;m definitely sold to this brand! For an exotic color dye, it also has great staying power, it ends up being a cotton candy pink after some time. To keep the color fresh, put some dye in your conditioner and let sit a few minutes in your hair everytime you shower. I also dry &#x27;shampoo&#x27; my hair with cornstarch once in a while instead of wetting it to prevent fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean everyting quick after dying or it will stain the sink, bathtub, etc. It did not bleed anywhere else (pillows, clothes) after the initial rinse though, so more points for Special effects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, I&#x27;ll try Virgin Rose, I read that the magenta-purple fades to look like... Atomic Pink!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Pink Haired Person for 15 years now, using every possible hot pink dye there is. Special Effects Atomic Pink is by far the best pink dye on the market. 6 weeks later my hair, while slightly faded, still looks great. (Well, minus the roots.) While it does bleed slightly with every wash, the staining is minimal. I&#x27;ve given up looking for a newer, better, brighter pink.</li>
    <li> this dye is very very bright pink. which was just what my daughters were looking for. it also does not wash out quickly.</li>
    <li> I used this on my natural blond hair (did NOT bleach prior to use). The color lasted much too long for my liking though. I just wanted to do something fun that I assumed would fade out after a few weeks. I ended up having to get my hair bleached twice because after two weeks, I still had highlighter pink streaks in my hair!&lt;br /&gt;If you want a pink dye that lasts, this one is perfect! The color payout is wonderful, a deep, bright pink when first used. It fades into a bright highlighter pink rather than some ugly orange/yellow color and I actually ended up preferring the color I got after it started to fade.</li>
    <li> Super vibrant, with awesome staying power! Much better than manic panic. My hair has held the color for 8 months, and I only need to recolor the new growth, awesome stuff!</li>
    <li> Special Effects remains in my hair longer than any other semi permanent colors out there. Atomic Pink is also one of the best shades I have discovered as it is very intense and pretty. As far as I am concerned any age group can use this product. If you are &#x27;slightly older&#x27; like myself it can be used in small amounts as a tint or contrast and if you are the young crowd than a bleach or toner prior to application will give a very radical and intense pretty color.</li>
    <li> When my aunt passed away from breast cancer last year I decided to dye my hair pink in memory of her. Special FX never lets me down. I mixed atomic pink with cupcake pink and put it on my bleach blonde hair and it has stayed vibrant pink for 2 months now despite fading a little (i wash my hair every other day), I still have nice bubblegum pink hair :)</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dye ive ever used it never leaves patches of color and makes my hair super neon pink. Definitely use this color if you want a neon pink</li>
    <li> First thing&#x27;s first, the dye was delivered extremely quick. That was both good and bad because I had just bleached my hair in preparation for this coming in another week so obviously now I had to try the dye out. User error aside, it&#x27;s a great, vibrant color. I even diluted it with conditioner and it came out super vibrant which isn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted (I was looking for pastel) but it&#x27;s a great color that&#x27;ll fade like a sunset so all in all, would recommend :)</li>
    <li> If your looking for really bright Pinky- PINK I would suggest the Virgin Rose, starts out a little purply but washes up to a vibrant pink.  Atomic Pink is way more RED to me.  Good if that it what you are going for.  Matter of taste.  But still the product itself stays in a LONG time, better than any other brand I have tried.  So if you are looking for a RED/Pink this would be the way to go.</li>
