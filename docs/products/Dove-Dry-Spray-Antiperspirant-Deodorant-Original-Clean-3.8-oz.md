### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome!</li>
      <li>Awesome product !</li>
      <li>good job Dove!</li>
      <li>This stuff is great.</li>
      <li>The design of the can is great-</li>
      <li>This stuff is great.</li>
      <li>Works really great, smells great and lasts a MINIMUM of 24 hours...</li>
      <li>Dove is a great buy</li>
      <li>But I feel it does a good job for 24 hours for me.</li>
      <li>so when he does, you know it is some good stuff!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells good.</li>
      <li>Also it&#x27;s good to consider stick deodorant can sometimes ruin your clothing, and I don&#x27;t feel this product would do that.</li>
      <li>Smells great and stays on all day, which I assume is what most people are looking for in a deodorant.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>This is Great Deoderant I have used Dove Invisible Slid for 6 or so years I recently started useing the spray and it&#x27;s just as great!</li>
      <li>I was expecting better.</li>
      <li>I love Dove products</li>
      <li>I really love it.</li>
      <li>and I know, you will love this.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I was wanting to try a spray deodorant for a while, and I am so glad that I found this.</li>
      <li>The baby powdery scent takes away from the freshness that I liked about the original.</li>
      <li>The container says it should be good for 48 hours but at first I didn&#x27;t trust it.</li>
      <li>It dries instantly, it lasts 48 hours, smells good and it moisturizes too!</li>
      <li>Some people have reported the smell is too strong.</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s nice and slim and looks pretty.</li>
      <li>This antiperspirant is so easy to use and so fresh !  </li>
      <li>Love the smell and it dries right away.  </li>
      <li>I usually have a huge problem with sweating, and this Antiperspirant works GREAT!!!  </li>
      <li>In terms of the smell, it was fine, but it smelled like a mixture of the original cool essentials deodorant stick and a lot of baby powder, which I&#x27;m not a fan of.</li>
      <li>This solves that problem, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll like it even better when it&#x27;s warmer outside</li>
      <li>But I love this over normal deodorant bc</li>
      <li>My new favorite deodorant.</li>
      <li>It keeps you smelling fresh all day</li>
      <li>Worth your money to buy</li>
      <li>O, yes, you are reading it right</li>
      <li>It goes on dry and it smells nice.</li>
      <li>so that was what I ordered first...</li>
      <li>As I feel more courageous, I try different parameters.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not slippery, and has a nice smooth surface, including the spray button which makes it less likely to fall out of your hand.</li>
      <li>I really do believe it&#x27;s been keeping me drier than my Dove stick deodorant, too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not one to buy more than one of each or even 2 different scents as I am on a fixed income and have to watch my pennies.</li>
      <li>I had received a free sample of Dove&#x27;s Men + Care Dry Spray Extra Fresh in the mail and my husband raved over this.</li>
      <li>but this is just good but not great.</li>
      <li>It was easy to apply, but it left a white powdery residue that got everywhere.</li>
      <li>, I ordered the Dove Dry Spray Antiperspirant, Cool Essentials for myself.</li>
      <li>Makes my underarms very soft, but does not help at &amp;#34;keeping me dry&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>But I can&#x27;t use it because spraying it releases so many small particles of fragrance and propellants that it sets off a trigger for my asthma.</li>
      <li>It is strong initially, but that only last for about 3 seconds.</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;m just waiting now for Dove to come out with a clear gel deodorant in this scent.</li>
      <li>Spray it too far and it gets on everything around your armpit.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll try the all natural varieties now.</li>
      <li>As the container is fairly large, it will be a while before I have to decide if I want to try a different scent or reorder this same one.</li>
      <li>Really does go on dry...</li>
      <li>It might be a little more pricey than some other deodorants but it lasts longer.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be purchasing this item again in the near future.</li>

<li> Not a huge deal but not exactly pleasant either.</li>
<li> Maybe I have weak hands (probably)</li>
<li> I also find that the sprayer itself is somewhat difficult to press, maybe because of arthritic fingers.</li>

<li> Sadly disappointed.</li>
<li> I prefer spray deodorant to sticks, but hate walking around flapping my arms until it dries.</li>

    <li> This stuff is great. I prefer spray deodorant to sticks, but hate walking around flapping my arms until it dries. This solves that problem, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll like it even better when it&#x27;s warmer outside and I&#x27;m not freezing my underarms putting it on.</li>
    <li> Ecellent experience... Thank&#x27;s...</li>
    <li> My fiance loves this deodorant.</li>
    <li> My new favorite deodorant. Dries in seconds and no deodorant marks on clothes.</li>
    <li> Smells great and stays on all day, which I assume is what most people are looking for in a deodorant.</li>
    <li> I heard about this awhile back when they were not available in the U.S. , when I heard Dove was releasing them in America I wanted to try them.  I love Dove products but this is just good but not great. I&#x27;m not sure about the 48 hour remarks since I reapply deodorant after I shower each day.  But I feel it does a good job for 24 hours for me. I will agree that the product goes on dry and I don&#x27;t feel dampness after spraying. But I think I will go back to the solid antiperspirant after this is empty.</li>
    <li> Really does go on dry...good job Dove!</li>
    <li> I was expecting better. In terms of the smell, it was fine, but it smelled like a mixture of the original cool essentials deodorant stick and a lot of baby powder, which I&#x27;m not a fan of. The baby powdery scent takes away from the freshness that I liked about the original. Secondly, the application of it left something to be desired. It was easy to apply, but it left a white powdery residue that got everywhere. Spray it too close, and it&#x27;s too concentrated. Spray it too far and it gets on everything around your armpit. I also found that it left residue on my clothes. I guess I&#x27;m just waiting now for Dove to come out with a clear gel deodorant in this scent.</li>
    <li> I was wanting to try a spray deodorant for a while, and I am so glad that I found this. I really love it. The design of the can is great- it&#x27;s not slippery, and has a nice smooth surface, including the spray button which makes it less likely to fall out of your hand. Plus it&#x27;s nice and slim and looks pretty. Some people have reported the smell is too strong. It is strong initially, but that only last for about 3 seconds. It does spray on wet but also dries in 3 seconds as well. I really do believe it&#x27;s been keeping me drier than my Dove stick deodorant, too. At this rate, I am considering switching over to this spray and not going back to stick deodorant at all. Also it&#x27;s good to consider stick deodorant can sometimes ruin your clothing, and I don&#x27;t feel this product would do that. Some people have also said that others can smell it around them, but I don&#x27;t smell it even after I put it on. I don&#x27;t care if I do because I don&#x27;t smell my BO either which i9s the point. I love it and I look forward to using it again!</li>
    <li> This is Great Deoderant I have used Dove Invisible Slid for 6 or so years I recently started useing the spray and it&#x27;s just as great!</li>
    <li> 1. It keeps you smelling fresh all day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Maybe I have weak hands (probably) but I have to use my thumb to make it spray and it&#x27;s not the easiest thing to do. They should take a note from spray-on sunscreen cans and make it easier to spray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Waking up on cold winter mornings and spraying this on your armpits makes you even colder. Not a huge deal but not exactly pleasant either.</li>
    <li> I had received a free sample of Dove&#x27;s Men + Care Dry Spray Extra Fresh in the mail and my husband raved over this. Now, you have to understand, he does not do that often; so when he does, you know it is some good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I ordered the Dove Dry Spray Antiperspirant, Cool Essentials for myself. Love it! It dries instantly, it lasts 48 hours, smells good and it moisturizes too! Awesome! It might be a little more pricey than some other deodorants but it lasts longer. Worth your money to buy and I know, you will love this.  Psst! Get some for your males too (well, the male version not this one).</li>
    <li> As it goes on dry and all the other products I used didn&#x27;t, it takes a little getting used to...how long should I spray my arm pits? If I don&#x27;t take a bath the next day, should I respray the next day anyway? I think the answers depend on you and your comfort zone. As I feel more courageous, I try different parameters. The container says it should be good for 48 hours but at first I didn&#x27;t trust it. Now I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the cucumber smell so that was what I ordered first...the one with the picture of a cucumber on it.  As the container is fairly large, it will be a while before I have to decide if I want to try a different scent or reorder this same one. I&#x27;m not one to buy more than one of each or even 2 different scents as I am on a fixed income and have to watch my pennies. O, yes, you are reading it right, I will be reordering the product.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is so overpowering that I had to remove it with alcohol wipes. I cannot comment on whether it will keep you dry for 2 days because I could not take the fragrance. I will have to try the unscented to see if it works.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve never been one to purchase a spray deodorant. I saw a commercial on TV for it and just had to try it out for myself. I absolutely love it! It goes on dry and it smells nice. I will definitely be purchasing this item again in the near future.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it dries right away.  I usually have a huge problem with sweating, and this Antiperspirant works GREAT!!!  I will definitely buy this again!  And it lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this because I don&#x27;t like sticky solids or messy roll ons. But I can&#x27;t use it because spraying it releases so many small particles of fragrance and propellants that it sets off a trigger for my asthma. I also find that the sprayer itself is somewhat difficult to press, maybe because of arthritic fingers. Sadly disappointed. I think I&#x27;ll try the all natural varieties now.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Makes my underarms very soft, but does not help at &amp;#34;keeping me dry&amp;#34;. Which I expected. I unfortunately just sweat too much. But I love this over normal deodorant bc it does not clump and you absolutely can&#x27;t see it on your armpits, and it doesn&#x27;t show on your dark clothes if you put your shirt on and accidentally rub your underarms like other deodorants do. Dove is a great buy</li>
    <li> This antiperspirant is so easy to use and so fresh !  Awesome product !</li>
    <li> Works really great, smells great and lasts a MINIMUM of 24 hours... Amazing product.,. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> Tired of white stains on your tshirts? This stuff is great. No more stains on shirts and it lasts a long time</li>
