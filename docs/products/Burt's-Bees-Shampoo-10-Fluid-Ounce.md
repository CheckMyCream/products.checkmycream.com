<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Received very quickly!!! Smells fresh and light. I have thin color treated hair. This shampoo gave my hair body without the harsh chemicals!</li>
    <li> Such a great smell and feel. A couple drops of Tea Tree Oil made it twice as nice.</li>
    <li> Works as it promises. Surprisingly effective. I rotate shampoos to avoid buildup, and every time I use this one people notice my hair is shinier. Never fails. Just ran out of my first bottle, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a sulfate free all natural shampoo for a while now.  This is the only one that truly does not strip your hair. Of course since my scalp is so used to over compensating for the natural oils on my scalp from using nasty hair destroying shampoos containing SLS or other nasty sulfates this means it&#x27;s probably going to take a while for my scalp to adapt to this shampoo, but it already looks a lot better, despite the late day greasy hair, and feels really soft. Many people are saying that they use this product, and their hair does not feel \\&quot;clean\\&quot; after their shower. That&#x27;s because your hair is now retaining its natural oils!  Give it a month and see how it goes. I&#x27;ll keep y&#x27;all updated on whether or not my hair improves in terms of greasiness.  It should get better in time.</li>
    <li> I am completely over the sulfate-ridden, petroleum byproduct shampoo crap.  I&#x27;ve used a variety of &#x27;natural&#x27; shampoos with varying degrees of success. I have very fine straight hair that tends to be oily when using mass-market shampoo, but actually becomes pretty evenly normal when I find the right stuff.  I thought I had found it in Burt&#x27;s Bees Super Shiny Mango Shampoo despite having some of the same adjustment issues others had with the heaviness. I eventually struck upon washing twice like others did also.  That is until my 2nd bottle.  I noticed right away that the bottle showed a .7% reduction in its &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ratio, which in the world of shampoo, since it is water based, is a significant difference.  Also, the word natural is one that does not have strict interpretations vis a vis the law since this is not a consumable product. Nevertheless, the fact that they changed the formula was also evident in the lather it produced.  It now is almost like the mass-market shampoos I hate so much for the way they strip my hair and leave my scalp feeling raped.  I guess they were responding to all the complaints from idiots that want all shampoo to be equally insulting to their hair.  Anyway, I&#x27;m going to go through this bottle and see if I can find a happy medium again. I&#x27;m not holding my breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The ingredient that is not in the 99.7% &#x27;natural&#x27; previous iteration is phenoxyethanol, which is a semi-toxic preservative/antibacterial. If ingested in large quantities it can be dangerous, and is an allergen for some. Listed as a potential neurotoxin. Go figure. I thought they added it to enhance the lather because the lather is definitely more apparent in the new one. Still not as good as the old stuff in my opinion.</li>
    <li> My husband finds this shampoo to be the best shampoo for his fine, flyaway 65yr. young hair...and his name isn&#x27;t Burt or Ernie!</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t greasy like everyone else said, but ruined mine from dryness and broken ends</li>
    <li> I was excited  to try this product  and it smells almost like a lemon scented  disinfectant. It did tamed my frizzy curls, but under the top layer of hair feels greasy more so then first washed. I&#x27;ll  continue  to use  maybe my hair needs time to adjust to a more natural shampoo.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and has a light, soft lather. Make my hair feel very silky</li>
    <li> Left hair feeling like it had a film on it. Weighs hair down and causes tangles.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, super fine blonde hair and I was looking to switch to something on the organic lines.  I bought the product from Whole Foods because it was on sale.  The first couple of times I tried it, it would leave my hair a bit course, but thicker feeling.  However, hours later, my hair would start becoming darkened in color and get all sweaty looking.  I thought maybe the trick was using a conditioner?  Nope.  Made it worse.  After being at Disneyland for an hour yesterday in the sunlight, my hair become wild looking, oily, and totally unmanageable.  It was so embarrassing that I ended up buying a hat to cover up the nastiness for the next 14 hours I was there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved the scent, but definitely not for thin, fine hair.</li>
    <li> Usually I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products but this one is really bad. It does not create a lather at all so I need to use 3-4 times the normal amount to be able to cover all of my hair. No matter how hard I try to wash it all out it still leaves a very greasy residue on my hair. This is an expensive shampoo for something that makes you feel like you didn&#x27;t wash your hair at all so save your money and buy something else.</li>
    <li> I am extremely allergic to sulfates and have a really hard time finding shampoo that isn&#x27;t harmful. I was really excited when I found this shampoo but am quite dissatisfied. It is really hard to distribute shampoo over entire head. It doesn&#x27;t lather much which is expected of natural shampoos but it also doesn&#x27;t spread well either. I even brought a brush into the shower to try to distribute it through my hair. There were still oily parts when I dried my hair.</li>
    <li> My wife likes to use Burt&#x27;s Bees goods.  She has been using the shampoo for a while now &amp; enjoys it.</li>
    <li> I was so surprised when I smelled this, It&#x27;s absolutely heavenly.</li>
    <li> I really miss the old formula of this shampoo. It takes twice and long and much more shampoo, water, and effort to get my hair clean. It&#x27;ll work, but it takes a lot of scrubbing that is damaging to my hair. I&#x27;ve had more fly aways and frizz since I started using it and I&#x27;ve kept my conditioner and hair drying routine the same. Oh well, its time to start trying other shampoos after having a favorite for years :(</li>
    <li> Great product to go with the mango conditioner.  My entire family uses this.  Good, clean product with a wonderful fresh scent.  Not harmful to the environment.  Get it via Subscribe &amp; Save, I believe as an add-on.  It is terrific!</li>
    <li> Having spent years on Hawaii, we really enjoyed this scent. The mango shampoo keeps our hair shiny and clean all day.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> The previous super shiny shampoo by Burts bees, grapefruit and sugar beet, worked beautifully!  It got my hair squeaky clean with two lathers, stayed clean longer, and was truly super shiny!  This &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; super shiny, takes 3 lathers (more shampoo needed), gets dirty quicker, and isn&#x27;t nearly as shiny.  Hair doesnt look, behave, or feel as good as their older version. It was a real disappointment.  I can only hope they bring back the older version.  They lost this Burts bees fan who fears this is the future of Burts Bees since being sold to the large conglomerate.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo after doing reviews on the best shampoo that was sulfate free and that could help strengthen my hair to grow it longer. I was so disappointed in this product.  The first time after using it with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Super Shiny Conditioner, I blow dried my hair and was under the impression that I did not fully wash out the conditioner. It took awhile to dry my hair and was very greasy.  The next time, I skipped the conditioner altogether and had the same issue.  My roots took forever to dry and had the feeling of a waxy build up.  I tried this shampoo two more times to give it the benefit of the doubt, made sure to rinse thoroughly, and still had the same issue.  My hair is on the thin side and there is no way I can continue using a product like this.</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with their soy and pomegranate shampoo, but this new formula is really terrible.  It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as their old formula and worst of all it doesn&#x27;t clean my hair.  My hair feels oily and nasty after using this.  Very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> Parent company Clorox does animal testing, especially in China where animal testing is required by law.</li>
    <li> as usual my favorite brand. Always deliver great results. Burt&#x27;s Bees never disappoint me.</li>
    <li> Great for gray hair. Super shiny, healthy, manageable. Doesn&#x27;t get much better than this!  Such a great find and such a great price!</li>
    <li> I have used Burt&#x27;s Bees for over 9 years.  I &#x27;m not sure what they have done to this shampoo but it left my hair VERY greasy.  It somehow felt dirtier AFTER washing than it did before washing.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.  I know some have suggested the greasiness is due to the switch from commercial to natural.  However, I&#x27;ve been using natural hair care since 2002, and nothing else.  As soon as I washed with a different all natural brand, no SLS, propylene glycol, no parabens, no fragrance, no phthalates, etc, my hair was back to normal after one wash.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and really like product.  It complements the shampoo.  Smells delicious and adds much body and shine.  I like them both.</li>
    <li> Bought for my son who is allergic to certain ingredients.  Was so hoping this would work for him.  It didn&#x27;t break him out but it did leave his hair somewhat greasy.  I like the Burt&#x27;s Bees products and hated this didn&#x27;t work.  Ended up going with clean and clear brand</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo as I love every other item I&#x27;ve purchased from Burt&#x27;s Bees. This shampoo left my hair very oily and limp less than 24 hours after washing it. I try to only wash my hair every other day, but it has not been possible since purchasing this shampoo, as I look like I have an oil slick on my head by day 2. Note, I have fine straight hair, so it could be that this is excellent for people with thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased hoping this would work out. The first was I couldn&#x27;t see any difference except my hair looked dirtier the next day. It looked greasy and I thought perhaps I should keep with it, to see how it goes.  After four washes my scalp broke out with a rash. It also caused excessive amounts of itchy scalp. I suggest everyone to be very careful. This product might work for some, but not for me.</li>
    <li> I wanted this shampoo to work. I agree with all the other posts this shampoo makes your hair fee waxier and moist. It feels gross. I&#x27;m disappointed I was really excited about this natural shampoo. Boo</li>
    <li> I ordered this with the matching conditioner and I don&#x27;t like it.  The smell and lather are ok but, I don&#x27;t like how it leaves my hair feeling heavy and with a coating on it.  I tried this because my hair dresser said that since I color my hair I should be using a sulfate free shampoo.  I will have to try another one because this one was not good.</li>
    <li> I am a newbie to sulfate free/all natural shampoo. I am late 40&#x27;s and finding my hair becoming thinner and dull, without the body and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course this type of shampoo doesn&#x27;t get all lathered up immediately...it&#x27;s not got the artificial/chemicals to make it to that!! But this shampoo is the best at what it CAN do which is cleanse amazingly...you have to do some of the elbow work and distribute it through your hair, and be a bit more patient as it gets worked in and does it&#x27;s thing...but it&#x27;s been 2 wks now and my hair is getting its strength and body back again and I am hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be trying the other flavors in rotation as I like to switch shampoo&#x27;s up regularly. I won&#x27;t be going back to sodium laurel sulfates...wish I knew then what I know now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps the conditioners are just as fantastic!!!! The trick is use the shampoo next to the scalp only and use the conditioner on the outside of your hair (don&#x27;t work in to the scalp unless you have dry scalp) and ends only.</li>
    <li> I liked this product as it was natural, however I felt my hair got oily too fast. The seller was excellent</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells great and it leaves my hair so soft.  The container easy stands upside down so you never have to shake it to get the last little bit out of the bottle.  As always, it has no petrochemicals and the container is completely recyclable!</li>
    <li> I so wanted this shampoo/conditioner to be \\&quot;the one,\\&quot; really! I was looking for something as natural as possible while cleaning and conditioning my hair well and leaving it as soft as it&#x27;s always been. After using it for nearly a week the top part of my scalp is so greasy and nasty and I would rather use Suave than use this for another day. After Day 4 I thought I just wasn&#x27;t rinsing it out well and gave myself a rinse like my hair hasn&#x27;t seen in a while! Still, no use. Whereas I used to love touching my hair, I&#x27;m now grossed out by how heavy and greasy it is on top. It&#x27;s not my hair and I don&#x27;t know what this shampoo/conditioner have done to it, but no more!</li>
    <li> I am so surprised to see less than positive reviews for this shampoo. I absolutely love it. I bought it because I have a keratin treatment on my hair, and I needed something sulfate free. I have been using it for several weeks. My hair is, indeed, super shiny, manageable, and very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I have thick, coarse, dry hair, and I wash it daily. This shampoo cleans without stripping, and doesn&#x27;t harm the keratin treatment. Because of the sulfate free thing, there is not a lot of lather, but I use about a quarter size amount for my not quite shoulder length hair. It feels very clean, and looks great.And the scent is amazing. My husband adores the way it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy to have found this terrific product.</li>
    <li> Love the Burts Bees products. Never disappointed!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good packaging and super shampoo! And I have no more dandruff on my head, it helps me to feel it fresh and smell tasty!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. Most shampoos are too harsh on my hair, and they make it dry and frizzy, but this one does neither. After using this shampoo, my hair feels soft and clean. To me, it smells like orange than mango, but I like the way it makes my hair feel and it still smells good, so that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo since I discovered it, and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Big supporter of Bert&#x27;s Bees products</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that this item was all natural which is why I purchased it only to read on the bottle after receiving it that it is only 99.7% natural. Now that I&#x27;m looking back at the item I do see it listed, but it seems that the impression was intentionally given.</li>
    <li> Good smell and natual,I like it very much.I have use a lot of things about this brand.I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> First time I used this product, I didn&#x27;t rinse my hair enough and it turned out greasy just like the reviews stated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time, I learned my lesson and rinsed my hair REALLY WELL and my hair looked beautiful!  Make sure you rinse it out really well and then you won&#x27;t get the greasy feel.  It&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and airy as other products, but for me that&#x27;s good as I don&#x27;t want dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super straight, sleek hair and it works for me.  I would buy it again and recommend it for other people with my hair type. Don&#x27;t know how it works on curly hairs though or hairs with more texture...</li>
    <li> Super clean look and feel with fabulous shine!! And knowing that it&#x27;s almost completely natural is a wonderful thing... Definitely will buy many more bottles!!</li>
    <li> I have medium length, very straight, fine, oily hair. After reading some other reviews, there are a few points I want to make. One, this shampoo is sulfate free. Sulfates in a shampoo are what makes it foamy or sudsy, and are also very bad for your hair. This shampoo is not supposed to suds up. Two, it is a natural shampoo, and is going to strip your hair of less oils than a traditional shampoo. Your hair is not going to have that &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; feeling most people are used to getting from traditional shampoos, which can be difficult to get used to, but is a good thing. And three, you really have to work the shampoo into your hair to get it to work. I have to flip my head upside down and massage the shampoo into my scalp to get it clean. If you do not massage it in, the shampoo will sit on the outer later of your hair and will not get your roots clean. With these things in mind, this shampoo is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two big down sides for me are the smell and the consistency. It smells very strongly of oranges, not mangoes (when going through the ingredients it says natural fragrance is added, I&#x27;m guessing just a generic citrus fragrance). And most disappointingly the bottle seems to consist of 1/3 or more of water. It&#x27;s a bummer that a product that is already expensive is so watered down. Although I&#x27;ve been happy with this shampoo, I will not be buying it again for that reason.</li>
    <li> I used to love Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo, and after a few years of trying different, less expensive products I thought it was time to return to it again. They must have changed their formula in my absence because this shampoo is pretty terrible. No matter what I did, it would leave a built-up, greasy residue on my hair. I would try using less, scrubbing more, rinsing longer, washing every other day, all to no avail. It makes me incredibly sad, because I&#x27;ve loved Burt&#x27;s Bees for such a long time and still have great success with many of their other products. Hopefully they will change the formula soon and maybe I&#x27;ll try again in a couple years.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, it smells awesome and makes your hair shine.  The bottle was a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Super Shiny Shampoo, Mango, with no sulfates, no fragrances, no parabens - my hair actually feels clean for a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Smells great but weighs down hair tremendously.  Every time I&#x27;ve used it my hair has looked flat and lank.  Do not plan on buying again.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this Shampoo/Conditioner combo. However, I was disappointed. It left my hair with a cakey sort of feel. I went back to what I had been using and my hair went back to shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo at a reasonable price. Yes you can get other generics cheaper but you don&#x27;t have to use much of this shampoo to soap up your hair and it doesn&#x27;t include silicone.</li>
    <li> Smells great at first but I did not like the way my hair smelled the next day. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this product and so does my hair! Combined with the conditioner, it leaves my hair so healthy looking! And it&#x27;s cruelty free!!</li>
    <li> My kids and i have allergies to sulfates so when we switched from you standard big box store shampoo we found this. I have used this shampoo daily for about a year or more and i love it. The shampoo cleans well and smells great however it doesn&#x27;t lather as well as standard shampoos because it doesn&#x27;t have floor cleaner and crazy stuff like that in it so that does take some getting used to. I usually use a face wash but when we are camping i use this shampoo to clean my face when taking a shower as its easier with limited water than using my face wash, it does a really good job cleaning my face without bothering my eyes or drying out my skin. I will continue to buy this shampoo as long as its available and have even suggested it to others that have skin sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Great balance for my hair...not too dry and doesn&#x27;t leave it too oily.  Smells like the creamy orangesicles (popsicles) from the 90&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I love BB&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners. I get keratin treatments in my hair and I find using this shampoo and conditioner helps extend the life of the treatments. Smells good, too!</li>
    <li> It smells good. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s they only reason it received two stars. My hair was left feeling very dry and not at all shiny.</li>
    <li> I received this shampoo in a grab bag and was worried after reading reviews. I thought I&#x27;d use it just once a week in rotation with other shampoos just to use it up. Well, it turns out that I love this shampoo and use it all the time. I have short, wavy, normal-to-dry hair that I wash every day or every other day. It smells great, does lather up somewhat, and doesn&#x27;t leave any noticeable residue on my hair. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with increased oiliness or buildup.</li>
    <li> Most shampoos leave my hair dry and brittle. This one makes my hair feel clean, yet not extremely stripped and \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; like some harsher shampoos do. It also has a very nice, natural-type scent that I really like. Will definitely purchase this product again in the future!</li>
    <li> I really like the smell and my hair feels great after washing with burts bees.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. Dried out my hair terribly due to the alcohol as a main ingredient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now, ever since I started breaking out in hives from other shampoos/conditioners, and I love it. A lot of the other, similar products that I&#x27;ve tried either smell horrible, completely dry out my hair, or cost a fortune. These are the complete opposite of each of those. Like many of the other reviewers, I did initially notice my hair feeling not greasy, but like it had oil on it, but I think my scalp adjusted to it, because it seemed to go away after a week or two of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I definitely recommend this product, I don&#x27;t recommend ordering it from Amazon. I decided to try ordering it from them for once for convenience, but the packaging it came in was horrible, making a huge gooey mess for me to clean up upon arrival. Definitely the last time I&#x27;ll be doing that.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite shampoo, seemed to strip too much oil from my hair</li>
    <li> I have used Burt&#x27;s Bees Super Shiny Shampoo for more than 10 years.  Over the years, and with acquisition of the original company, the shampoo has become so watered down that it is no longer effective.  I don&#x27;t want to have to use two handfuls of shampoo just to get a cleaning lather, which is now the case.  It is such a pity!</li>
    <li> My husband is loves Burt&#x27;s Bees products - so getting this was a natural win. He loves the product and I love his hair after using it!</li>
    <li> My hair feels delightful and I shampoo everyday.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that was getting really damaged from daily washing and blow drying.  It was getting very fly away and straw like.  After only one use, my hair looks and feels AMAZING.  I wash my hair every day and truly love this stuff.  I&#x27;m shocked at how much sulfates had damaged my hair and will never go back to regular shampoo.  This does not lather like you may be used too, but my hair feels clean and the mango smells delicious!  My hair is starting to look healthy and vibrant like when I was a child and I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, it leaves my hair shinny, and easy to manage. I have given it as gifts and the friends are extremely please with them.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been so greasy than after washing with this shampoo. I would love for Burt&#x27;s Bees to bring back the Grapefruit Sugar Beet shampoo. That was a great shampoo and I never had to switch it out for anything else. Now, I&#x27;ll have to find a new shampoo. I&#x27;m done with Burt&#x27;s. Unless, of course, they bring back the old shampoo.</li>
    <li> This left my hair so oily and nasty. My hair stylist had to strip all the waxy buildup with a clarifying shampoo. She said that it was the worst she&#x27;s ever seen, and I&#x27;ve only used this stuff a few times! It&#x27;s absolutely terrible for my hair (fine and thick) but perhaps it would be ok with drier hair? No clue but family member literally told me I needed to wash my hair the same day I had, it looked that bad. I couldn&#x27;t style it either, it was so sticky from the buildup my flat iron wouldn&#x27;t slide across my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this at all. :(</li>
    <li> I have curls after chemotherapy, and they are always frizzy. This shampoo has tamed them and they are soft and so pretty now. Plus it smells amazing! Great product.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair shiny! none of the industrial degreaser stuff!</li>
    <li> Ok so i wanted to go &amp;#34;Lo - poo&amp;#34; &amp; cut the chemicals because i have alopecia (aka my hair is falling out)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the idea of fully getting rid of it to begin with so i bought this. The transition period took about a month for me, for my hair to balance out &amp; get used to not being stripped every time i wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Can go 5 days between washing&lt;br /&gt;- Low in chemicals&lt;br /&gt;- Cheaper than other lo - poo shampos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves a weird residue of product even after washing out more than i usually would so my hair looks greasy. I know it&#x27;s not grease because it smells like the product, i will sometimes double wash when i realize there is left over residue, to sometimes it STILL be in my hair. SO this is weird &amp; i don&#x27;t know why it clings to your hair but sometimes it comes out. It has made me look at other options of course because i want clean healthy hair not greasy looking product laden hair. When it does wash out fully then yes my hair feels A LOT healthier &amp; i get so much less breakouts on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Have to stay in doors during the transition period (but that isn&#x27;t burts bees fault :) )</li>
    <li> Wow!  I have used Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm and love it, so had to try the&lt;br /&gt;shampoo.  It makes my hair shine and I love it too!!!!</li>
    <li> I rather a product where the fragrance isn&#x27;t so overwhelming.</li>
    <li> OK, first off I want to say that this shampoo smells AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a lot of people are giving this shampoo a bad review, because those are the people who wash their hair EVERY DAY , or EVERY OTHER day. Personally, I wash my hair with shampoo ONCE a week. To wash hair without over doing it, the shampoo should be used on the scalp ONLY....NOT on all the hair. And, because it is a sulfate-free shampoo, that means not many bubbles or much lather.  The conditioner is equally wonderful, and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s a sulfate-free product. I&#x27;m very surprised there are so many bad reviews.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather good , but that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t have toxic chemicals in it. The smell is amazing and it leaves my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> Love Burt Bees anything.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo as an alternative to products which still use animal testing. I actually picked it up at Target (not from Amazon!) along with the matching conditioner, and for about $6-8 each it seemed like a good deal compared to what I would spend on a bottle of shampoo from Aveda, Lush, or even Trader Joe&#x27;s. I gave it a shot for about 3 weeks. Some weeks, I wash my hair every day; other weeks, I can go 3-4 days before I need to rinse it. My hair is not exceptionally oily, thick, curly, or fine; it tends toward the finer side, but I have a *lot* of it. This shampoo was just AWFUL. At first, I thought I was maybe not rinsing the conditioner out of it all the way, but now, almost a month in, I realize it&#x27;s the shampoo which is leaving my hair coated in a heavy, greasy, waxy substance. It takes a LOT of effort to dry it, and even when it is &amp;#34;dry,&amp;#34; it feels and looks thick and oily. It&#x27;s not a good look. I hate to say it, but I&#x27;m going to toss this stuff in the garbage. Not even worth $6.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo on a whim at my grocery store because I was out of shampoo and resorting to using a vinegar rinse to clean my hair.  It is important to me to try to use haircare that is as good for me as possible, and this was the only sulfate-free poo that I could find at my store.  I&#x27;m addicted to reviews, so I was disappointed when Amazon and BB&#x27;s website both showed crappy reviews on this product.  I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t return it, because I now have \\&quot;hot girl\\&quot; hair (and it smells much better than my vinegar rinse!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will not give you volume, if you want that try a shampoo that advertises that it does.  I use this shampoo and conditioner as follows:  I first comb my hair with a wide-toothed comb before I get my hair wet.  I then wet my hair and take about 1-2 tbsp of shampoo and massage it into my scalp.  I do not shampoo any hair that is not next to the scalp.  This shampoo does NOT lather- it isn&#x27;t made with the harmful ingredients that cause your cheapo shampoo to do this.  I then take about 1-2 tbsp of conditioner and apply it to my hair starting below my ears and working it towards the ends.  I do not wash my hair every day- sometimes I am go 4 days without washing my hair and my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy or gross.  Usually when I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day it looks unkempt and I need to put it in a pony WITH a head band to look presentable.  With this shampoo I can rock many hairstyles without having to worry about third-day-without-washing flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that my hair is weighed down a bit (it has oil in it, it IS going to do this), but is not flat.  I can also run my fingers through my fine hair without encountering any tangles, which is something that I have never been able to do.  I remember as a kid being extremely jealous of girls that could put their hair up in pony tails without a brush, and now I can do the same thing.  Even my co-workers have noticed how much better my hair looks now, even when it&#x27;s up ina pony tail so my fabulous hair isn&#x27;t just a figment of my imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m thrilled with my purchase- I&#x27;ll update if I change my opinion since I&#x27;ve only been using this for about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Love this.  It lathers up just fine, folks with complaints must have very hard water.</li>
    <li> I love how this shampoo makes my hair look so shiny and healthy.  I do not believe that it is actually moisturizing my hair though.  That is the reason I dinged it one star.  My daughter who does not style her hair each day loves this shampoo and it works great for her.  I would recommend that you include a moisture conditioner if you use this shampoo long term.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for over a year and while I like their product, I dislike the price and the mandatory automatic ordering (if directly from Wen).  I recently purchased the Burt&#x27;s Bees Super Shiny Shampoo, Mango (10 Ounces) for use on my daughters’ hair which is down to the middle of her back.  My daughter gives it a 5-star rating!  The BB SS Mango smells nice, cleanses her hair well and is sulfate-free.  For a leave in conditioner, we found the Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Awapuhi Ginger and Honeysuckle Light Leave-in Cream (6 Ounce) works wonderfully.  It works well for detangling and conditioning and is very light on her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again for sure.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cruelty-free, natural shampoo that worked for my long, thick hair, and I wanted to love this one, but it&#x27;s awful. I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, more like every three or four days, and I&#x27;ve done the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; method off and on for about a year, so this isn&#x27;t a matter of oil overproduction or my scalp getting used to a natural shampoo. This shampoo leaves a waxy film on my hair. It&#x27;s so bad that the other day my husband touched my hair and then pulled away and made a face saying that it felt gross. He uses this shampoo as well and doesn&#x27;t care for it either. First I used both the shampoo and conditioner, then just the shampoo, but neither worked for me. Sadly, I will be throwing this away.</li>
    <li> Everyone has different hair texture, mine is corse, so if I wash with other type of shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried over the years, my hair would get very dry and unmanagable.  My hair normally would look at its best after three days, then I have to wash it again.  I sometimes prefer beauty over comfy so I let my hair go for couple more days, however, I&#x27;d have to endure itchiness, not to mention the uncleaness, so it&#x27;s very annoying.  This shampoo gives me what I want right after I wash it and I like the smell, so fruity.  I hope Amazon continue to sell this product,I noticed the price has gone up a little bit plus the shipping cost, not liking it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so terribly disappointed in this stuff.  It leaves an awful waxy/cakey residue in my hair whenever I use it.  When I run my fingers through my hair after it dries, they get sticky... regardless of how much I rinse.  It leaves my hair looking and feeling like straw.  I bought this shampoo two years ago and it was amazing, but I compared the new bottle I received to my old bottle and saw that they have changed the formula.  Also, note that the picture and the product description claim this product is 99.7% natural (which it used to be with the old formula), but the new bottle I received says it&#x27;s actually 99.0% natural.  I guess that .7% really makes a difference, because this new stuff is terrible.  So disappointing.  I don&#x27;t recommend this at all.  Time to find a new natural shampoo, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> This really does leave your hair extra shiny!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter after seeing a review for it in my Prevention magazine. It&#x27;s amazing on color treated hair! Her hair is literally &amp;#34;smooth as silk&amp;#34; with no greasy feeling to it. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. Makes my hair feel super soft and adds a great shine. Would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> It is only 10oz compared to 12oz in stores so it is misleading on the price verses oz&#x27;s</li>
    <li> This is a different product than what I had been using but it is every bit as moisturizing as the previous product.  I am very happy with Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> I love most Burt&#x27;s Bees products. This shampoo really works for my hair. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;Excellent shampoo</li>
    <li> For me, no matter how much I rinse my hair, I feel like this shampoo leaves a waxy/oily residue near the ends of my hair. My hair feels dirty even though I just washed it! I also don&#x27;t think it leaves my hair very shiny. This bottle has been living in my bathroom for a year now, and every now and then I grab it again to try to use it up and not waste it, but every time I&#x27;m horribly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I saw an article in Health magazine ... I think it was that one, anyway, it was dubbed as one of the best shampoos to buy for thin hair.  So I tried it, and low and behold, it is good.  Cleans the hair very well ... and I wash my hair everyday.  It doesn&#x27;t dry the hair out, but leaves it very clean and soft.</li>
    <li> This is a shampoo is a dry haired girl&#x27;s dream! I have course, dry hair with waves that I usually blow out straight. So, my already dry hair gets its fair share of abuse from the blowdryer heat. Yet, this awesome smelling shampoo leaves my hair feeling hydrated, shiny and silky. I have received some comments from friends since using this shampoo that my hair looks healthier and more shiny. I also have absolutely no experience with it leaving my hair feeling greasy or weighed down. And I only wash my hair about every 4 or 5 days but this shampoo manages to keep it silky every day between washings without me having to deal with that awful grimy and greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you buy this shampoo, you should know that Burt&#x27;s bees is a sulfate free shampoo so it won&#x27;t give you a huge lather when you massage it into your scalp. I think that a lot of people go wrong with this shampoo by using too much product because they are over compensating for the lack of lather, and as such, if they don&#x27;t rinse all of the product out it could result in very greasy hair. The key is to get used to the lack of lather in this shampoo and still be confident that your hair will come out clean even while using a small amount of shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to start with a small amount of shampoo and massage it really well into your entire scalp, then rinse it out thoroughly and you are good to go. Other people may choose to also work a bit of shampoo down to the tips of their hair as a second washing, but I never do. I just let the shampoo rinse down from my scalp and through my hair after I have scrubbed my scalp with the shampoo while I am rinsing the shampoo out. I find that this method still gets all of my hair clean without necessitating that I use too much product which could weigh down my hair. If you try this shampoo and feel that your hair is greasy, please try my method, again, focusing on using only a large dollop size portion of the shampoo, scrub entire scalp well (including the back of the scalp), rinse very well and if possible DO NOT do a second washing to get shampoo to the tips of the hair, as I believe that this is unnecessary and can just weigh down your hair. Then get out of the shower and let your hair air dry awhile before you blowdry. I hope that these suggestions will give you silky hair without that greasy feel, like it does for me!cluding the back of the scalp), rinse very well and if possible DO NOT do a second washing to get shampoo to the tips of the hair, as I believe that this is unnecessary and can just weigh down your hair. Then get out of the shower and let your hair air dry awhile before you blowdry. I hope that these suggestions will give you silky hair without that greasy feel, like it does for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees products for the past 5 years now, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem...until now. This new shampoo formula is terrible! After using this product, my hair was left greasy and dull. I have no idea why they changed formulas when the old one worked just fine. I use a different shampoo now.</li>
    <li> A waste of $9!  Horrible experience - left my hair gummy and greasy and heavy no matter how many times I rinsed it.  Took several washes with a clarifying shampoo to get it clean again.  Wish they had not changed their old formulas - this and the volumizing shampoo were both terrible.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a sulfate free shampoo that would also work well on my hair...this one does both.  It also smells great.</li>
    <li> I like that the ingredients are less damaging than conventional items and the scent is REALLY nice, but it doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling clean and I find that two applications are required per washing.  I have used other Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoos and will continue to do so - just not this one.</li>
    <li> Sodium Benzoate is not considered an organic ingredient and I am allergic to it.  I have been very disappointed to find this ingredient in many Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  It made my scalp break out.  I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, feels wonderful and does a great job!!</li>
    <li> My daughter has long curly and we needed something to tame its craziness. This product teamed with the conditioner does the trick. It calms her hair and leaves it smelling amazingly fresh and shiny. My daughter is happy because she gets to keep growing out here &amp;#34;Rapunzel&amp;#34; hair and she loves the way it leaves her hair smelling too.</li>
    <li> This is the first Burt&#x27;s Bees product I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I&#x27;m really happy with it.  I bought it because I was looking for a shampoo with fewer chemicals in it, but if anything my hair looks better than before.  It&#x27;s definitely shinier and soft.  The mango scent is really nice... it&#x27;s a tangy scent rather than a sweet one.  And the shampoo lathers very well.  I don&#x27;t miss the SLS to make suds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that my review is different from others who found that the shampoo made their hair greasy.  All I can say is that different hair types probably react differently.  You might want to try this and see if it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the BB SS Mango conditioner along with this, and I&#x27;m happy with that as well.</li>
    <li> This has to be the weirdest shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. How does it make my hair feel so greasy, yet make it so tangled at the same time? After shampooing my hair it feels almost waxy, and greasier than before I washed it. However, I still need to use conditioner or my hair is a huge tangly mess. I&#x27;ve used cheap off brand shampoo without conditioner that left my hair less tangled than this shampoo alone does.</li>
    <li> Hard to lather and hard to wash out. Just seemed to gunk up a bit on my scalp and leave residue.  Shame. Like the way it smells and that it&#x27;s 99% natural.</li>
    <li> Maybe it was my imagination but seems like I notice more bees around when I use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair that tends to be fluffy if not well managed, this shampoo will be your best friend. I usually struggle with a bunch of product to get my hair to form into ringlets and waves rather than being an Elvis like pompadour. Not with this shampoo, I just wash my hair let it dry and I&#x27;m done! My hair looks like I just stepped out of the salon, so easy!</li>
    <li> love it. smells so nice.</li>
    <li> I pasted the following in several reviews across several similar products, so I figured I&#x27;d go ahead and put it where more people can see it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing: The commercial shampoo industry creates demand by making products that strip the oil from your hair. Conditioner makes it softer and easier to manage, but it is not the sebum your scalp produces. Because it it stripped, your scalp eventually begins to produce more faster to compensate---necessitating more frequent washing (and trips to the store!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, your scalp does not automatically stop \\&quot;over\\&quot;producing sebum just because you decide to try a better regimen. It has to adapt to not being stripped, just like it initially had to adapt to being stripped. How long that takes depends upon your hair type, how often you strip it, and its overall level of damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a reason why the people in the reviews who wash their hair only one to two times per week, especially with nonstripping shampoos, have less greasy hair. Similarly, if you wash your hair closer to every day and you then -need- to as a result, it is going to be SUPER oily for a few weeks because the oil is building. That&#x27;s just the cost of messing up your scalp and getting it back to how it was. Of course, I can&#x27;t speak for any individual because a particular person might deviate from the norm for whatever reason(s), but that is how oil production in the scalp works. (And I&#x27;ll add that, for the very best results, you need to keep your nutrition up. Your body is not going to dedicate much to maintaining beautiful skin, hair, and nails if it has to dedicate almost all of its resources to keeping your major organs barely functioning.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest browsing through \\&quot;no (sham)poo\\&quot; websites to get advice about how people handle the oilyness. It&#x27;s doable. Although it usually doesn&#x27;t take this long, it very well could take six to eight weeks for your scalp to adapt; so if you&#x27;re willing to sacrifice for hair that is eventually much better than it is now(and for spending less money on haircare!), you&#x27;ll need some support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- UPDATE 5/1/13 ---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll add that this shampoo DOES lather, contrary to what other reviewers have claimed. Just not on the first go. It&#x27;s almost a rule that you need to wash your hair twice, especially with \\&quot;special\\&quot; shampoos (this isn&#x27;t one), to get the full effects because it&#x27;s tackling the dirt the first time. So this shampoo in particular and others like it WILL feel like you&#x27;re not washing with anything at first. Be sure to smother your hair with this stuff and massage it into your scalp. You don&#x27;t have to go crazy with rinsing this time. But put the shampoo in again afterward and it WILL lather and feel like you&#x27;re washing it with regular shampoo. Unless your other shampoos have a crazy amount of suds, I guess. But it will get a lather effect. I took pictures of my hair all sudzy from the SECOND wash with this shampoo to show you.* The first is the first wash, the second is the second wash, and the third is after conditioner. If the colors are throwing you, my hair is black in the back and a lighter brownish in the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this stuff cleans my hair without stripping it, but it does tangle it---just a little. I use [[ASIN:B008CC4HBG Herbal Essences Hello Hydration Moisturizing Hair Conditioner With Pump 33.8 Fl Oz]] and it instantly detangles. I recommend at least trying the BB (and HH!) if it sounds good to you. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I can&#x27;t upload pics directly into the review. Click on my profile images to see. Note that Amazon says that it can take up to 48 hours to upload, so it might not show up until 5/3/13.at is eventually much better than it is now(and for spending less money on haircare!), you&#x27;ll need some support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- UPDATE 5/1/13 ---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll add that this shampoo DOES lather, contrary to what other reviewers have claimed.

    <li> I love this product, natural and does well with color treated hair. Leave my hair smooth and soft. I will continue to buy it monthly!</li>
    <li> I picked this up on a whim at Target, then came home and read all the bad reviews. I almost took it back, but decided to give it one try anyway. Now three weeks in, my hair is like absolute silk. My hairdresser commented on how satiny it was, and demanded to know what I was using. When I told her it wasn&#x27;t some fancy salon brand, she was floored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did NOT have a bunch of greasy build up in the first few washes because frankly, I don&#x27;t use that much on my hair. Occasionally a little gel and I&#x27;m out the door. I am wondering if all the people with horrible experiences use a ton of product on their hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son also uses this, and he&#x27;s mixed race. It is wonderful for his hair, leaving his curls soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, we love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have thick hair and this leaves my hair soft without weighing it down. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this one.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife she likes it. I think her hair smells good other than that its shampoo and its expensive in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells amazing. I feel like I am in an orange orchard or something. I have an oily scalp but I use this shampoo every morning, just a dime-sized amount, and my scalp and hair are flake and residue free. It&#x27;s low-suds, too, so it won&#x27;t dry you out.</li>
    <li> I love this! It smells amazing without all the harsh perfumes that normally accompanying shampoos this fragrant and it really does put a beautiful shining in your hair.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on natural shampoos (including the home made stuff with baking soda and apple cider vinegar ).  Every where I read the same point was made - when going to natural shampoos (sulfate free, petrol free...etc) you have to let your scalp transition.  It&#x27;s used to having all the oils stripped and chemicals layered on it.  Your scalp will have to adjust and may over compensate by producing too much oil.  What I&#x27;ve read is the transition period can range from 2 weeks to several months.  I&#x27;m willing to give it time.  I love the way this product smells and I&#x27;m definitely loving how clean it is.  I have curly hair and for the first time ever my curls didn&#x27;t need a lot of product to keep it tamed.</li>
    <li> Smells great but after using my hair feels greasy and limp. After a week or so there was actually enough waxy like buildup I could scrape it off. I thought Burts should be similar to the Aveda I usually bit but it wasn&#x27;t worth the savings I&#x27;m going back to Aveda products.</li>
    <li> way too much came out - so it was difficult to rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;So be warned if you are used to thick/normal shampoos.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ready the other reviews so that I know this shampoo is horrible and it&#x27;s not something else I&#x27;m doing. I also really wanted to find chemical free natural shampoo but I guess I will go back to what I was using.</li>
    <li> This is undoubtedly the worst shampoo I have ever used.  I noticed that it was highly rated in several recent women&#x27;s magazines so I decided to get some.  The best thing I can say about it is that it smells good.  After 3 tries I can only describe my hair with that old term \\&quot;flyaway\\&quot; and it has no body whatsoever.  Absolutely nothing other than a generous amount of hairspray keeps it straight.  I generally don&#x27;t need to use conditioner but I found that I had to when using this shampoo.  It was a waste of money for me and I do not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I (middle-aged male) bought this because they stopped selling the grapefruit shampoo, which I really liked. It has a nice smell, lathers nicely, but just doesn&#x27;t leave my hair that clean.  I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> So I started using Burt&#x27;s Bees Shampoo in an attempt to find one that wouldn&#x27;t strip my henna hair color. While I loved the color, my hair was too oily to be using this product since it doesn&#x27;t strip oil. After three months I had to switch to something else.. Now, my husband on the other hand, has normal to dry hair and had been considering cutting it off because of how damaged it was. I told him to give this stuff a try and bought the conditioner and 2 minute conditioner hair treatment as well. His hair has done a BEAUTIFUL 180 and is so soft, shiny and smooth. I cannot fathom someone with dry or damaged hair not loving this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will agree with another reviewer, you&#x27;ll get a much better lather if you apply the shampoo, rinse slightly then add some more shampoo. Also, go ahead and shake the product well before use as it&#x27;s likely to have some of it settle. My husband is now a huge Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Shampoo fan!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this shampoo since I&#x27;ve thought about buying it for awhile.  It smells fantastic but didn&#x27;t get my hair totally clean so after a couple days my hair looked and felt greasy just after washing.  My hair is shoulder length and normal,  not dry or too oily to begin with and I&#x27;ve never colored my hair so it&#x27;s very healthy if that helps.  I&#x27;m very sorry this didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
    <li> I originally started buying Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoos because they do not contain the sulfates and other ingredients that supposedly make your hair fall out...but the bottom line is that they just make good products that are pleasing to use. Shampoo smells great and does the job...it&#x27;s a brand I trust!</li>
    <li> I am impressed that when I ran out of the conditioner, that I could use the shampoo and not have tangles!  I have thick curly hair.  I like it.  I did notice a very strong alcohol smell.  It has lots of alcohol in it.  I dont like that and alcohol really dries and permanently damages your hair.  Also, I am concerned about what is the unnatural ingredients, because it is 99. something % natural.  I know that Burt&#x27;s Bees toothpaste contains SACCHARINE!!!!!!!  So does most toothpaste and that is the very reason that I use Tom&#x27;s of Maine.  But with all of these &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products you really have to watch!!!!! Because they are not 100%!!!!  User beware!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Chemical free shampoo made the ends of my hair dry, but not as dry as some sulfate free shampoos do, even though sulfate free is good, my hair fell flat and felt dry after.</li>
    <li> This was a little watery for me. I loved the smell and it worked well but a lot of it slipped through my fingers its so liquid-y!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this shampoo. I like burts bees&#x27; other products, but this doesn&#x27;t cut it. Maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s supposed to make your hair &amp;#34;super shiny,&amp;#34; but all it did to mine was make it look greasy. It looked slightly more tolerable if it was blow dried and brushed out, but not for long.  And don&#x27;t even try using both the shampoo and conditioner if you plan on wearing your hair down, because it just makes it look worse. And this was consistent after about a month of using it - I know some natural shampoos take time for your hair to adjust, but after a month of using it, I finally switched. I just tried Yes To Carrots&#x27; natural shampoo and ta da! It looks and feels normal after the first wash. I should never have waited as long as I did to switch.</li>
    <li> I am sick and tired of using chemical based shampoos and over the years, they have damaged my hair more than actually nourishing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started using this and the hair loss dropped dramatically. I am very happy.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that it made my hair super shiny like the name but it does smell really nice and it works just as well as any non organic shampoo.</li>
    <li> It weighed down my hair and made it feel dirty.  After one use I donated it to a thrift store.</li>
    <li> Like others, I feel this product made my hair greasy- builds up worse each time.  It takes alot of product, doesn&#x27;t suds up.  Nothing good about it.</li>
    <li> Great lather, great scent!</li>
    <li> Great as always on hair!</li>
    <li> Moisturizes and cleans well.</li>
    <li> I had purchased the conditioner previously and thought it was okay, so I figured I&#x27;d give the shampoo a try.  BIG mistake!  My hair was less greasy before I washed it.  My hair was visibly greasy, had no shine whatsoever and clung to my head like a helmet.&lt;br /&gt;All other products from this brand I really do like so I was sad to come across one that was such an epic let down.</li>
    <li> Love the way my hair feels</li>
    <li> I did not get the greasy results others mention. I found that I do need to use enough to adequately cleanse my hair and scalp, or you can wash, rinse, repeat. It doesn&#x27;t have sulfates, so it&#x27;s not going to lather like other shampoos, but sulfates are what I&#x27;m trying to avoid! My hair feels soft and is clean and shiny every time I use it! I like the conditioner, too. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I gave this shampoo 2 stars only because it smells amazing, and has natural ingredients. I was so excited to see it was paraben and phalate free... I have been using this shampoo for 3 weeks straight. I could not understand what was happening to my hair..It progressively got worse... in the beginning, it was only a slight difference but after using it for over a week..It was like greasy, matted and unmanageable. I used it on my children too... And their hair was stringy and matted. I&#x27;m going to use the rest of this shampoo because it was $8.... But I will never buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used in my life. I tried it out because I wanted something all natural. The bottle itself doesn&#x27;t contain as much shampoo as others do, and it&#x27;s a bit more expensive than other shampoos. If you&#x27;re looking for bang for your buck, this might not be the product for you. I use it because it&#x27;s the best quality shampoo I can find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long brown hair, so it takes a lot for me to wash each time I use it. I&#x27;ve only been able to observe the results when I&#x27;ve had to go off it for whatever reason- usually because the store ran out. It&#x27;s pretty popular where I live. When I use traditional shampoos, even if they&#x27;re advertised to be all-natural, it just isn&#x27;t the same. My hair gets greasier faster. I feel like I have to shower twice a day. The clean that I get with Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo, regardless of what scent it has, leaves my hair feeling clean for days. If you&#x27;re out in the wilderness a lot, like I am, and you don&#x27;t have access to a shower, use this shampoo before you go. You won&#x27;t have to wash your hair (in most cases).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; product. It&#x27;s higher quality for higher price. I only use shampoo for my hair, and, for whatever reason, people always compliment me on how good my hair looks. Other people use straighteners or curlers or colors or conditioner or any kind of thing to make their hair look great. I only use shampoo, and I&#x27;m outperforming them, at least in their estimation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: this shampoo probably is not for people with short hair, unless you&#x27;re picky about what&#x27;s in it. You might feel like you&#x27;re not getting your money&#x27;s worth. Its value only becomes apparent when you see your hair positively shine once it dries out.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Products.  Their deodorant is excellent.</li>
    <li> I love these products.</li>
    <li> Thin shampoo- not quite gel like as I&#x27;m used to. Seems to do a good job but I was disappointed by the lack of mango scent- this just smells like citrus to me.</li>
    <li> Received product on time and was just as described. I love Burts Bees, so I was not disappointed! I ordered it along with another product, so shipping was free.</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo and works into an easy lather.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> I use this product paired with the conditioner and love it. Smells great and keeps my hair a lot healthier than the products with all the harmful chemicals. My hair is soft and shiny and no longer falling out! I will definitely continue to buy!</li>
    <li> Everyone who posted before is correct--this product really is the WORST!  Like others, after washing my hair and finding it terribly greasy, I checked to see if I&#x27;d accidentally washed with the conditioner, but I hadn&#x27;t.  This just doesn&#x27;t clean hair.  I gave it a go for three weeks to no avail.  My hair never &#x27;magically&#x27; changed like all the no shampoo people preach.  Very disappointed.  I&#x27;ll use it as a body wash now since I really don&#x27;t like to waste anything.</li>
    <li> I love the product but it busted open during shipping :( -- I lost some of it and it got all over other stuff.  Bummer</li>
    <li> I would have to agree with the other reviewers who said this product made their hair greasy. It&#x27;s absolutely awful and disappointing. My scalp itches and my hair feels like it hasn&#x27;t been washed in weeks. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks, but I will go back to Alba. Wish I could have my money back.</li>
    <li> I got the shampoo and conditioner and I hate both of them!  I usually love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but these leave my hair feeling greasy and dry at the same time (how?!)... it&#x27;s heavy and clumps instead of falling smoothly as it does with other brands.  I have normal hair, just past my shoulders and I wash it every day or every other day.  The only thing I can say for this is that while my hair feels gross and doesn&#x27;t look as nice as it does with other brands, it doesn&#x27;t actually look greasy or terrible.  Just not great.  Maybe I could adjust, b it it&#x27;s been two weeks and I still hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess maybe that&#x27;s the price of not having parabens?  Also, it doesn&#x27;t smell awesome or anything... more like Tang mix than mango.  So sad.</li>
    <li> I have been hunting for the perfect all-natural shampoo and conditioner combo for ages now, and am proud to say that I finally found it! Having recently made the switch from regular drugstore products to paraben-free, phthalate-free, sulfate-free, organic, etc. I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t find something that measured up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is delightful. As a woman with soft, straight hair, thin individual strands but A LOT of them, I needed a product that would smooth and moisturize my hair, rather than over-volumize and cause it to be dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is LOVELY. In my experience it DOES lather and is easy to use and wash out. I primarily use the shampoo on my scalp. The conditioner is moisturizing and I&#x27;ve noticed that I can let my hair air-dry without any fly-aways or frizz, no coarseness, no weird texture, no residue. And my hair is noticeably shinier than it has been with other products. It&#x27;s essentially perfect. I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> Made my head really oily. Don&#x27;t really make any suds. Don&#x27;t feel like it cleanses well.</li>
    <li> a) burt&#x27;s has signed the commitment not to use harmful ingredients; b) hair is soft, shiny, and manageable when using with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Too greasy for my hair.</li>
    <li> Great for shampoo but not if you&#x27;re coloring or highlighting.  It strips too much and I don&#x27;t care for the mango scent.</li>
    <li> Unlike others, this shampoo did not make my hair greasy.&lt;br /&gt;It smelled like Orange Clean. I should have known that it would be better for cleaning floors than hair. It made the texture of my hair like straw.&lt;br /&gt;Just one use after my last color treatment and my red hair is noticeably faded. Never using this again.</li>
    <li> Love the concentrated, luxurious lather. Just right amount of &amp;#34;balance&amp;#34; between cleansing and conditioning. I still use conditioner, but this shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip or coat hair. Mouth-watering mango scent. Burt&#x27;s Bees products are better than ever and this is one fine example. One of the greatest shampoos ever.</li>
