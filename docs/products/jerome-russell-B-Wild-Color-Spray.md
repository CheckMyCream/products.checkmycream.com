      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>Smell is very strong..</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Very easy to wash out&lt;br</li>
      <li>and that was without any touching or moving</li>
      <li>I used this to dye my beard white for Halloween, worked perfect.</li>
      <li>although I should&#x27;ve used (3)cans to achieve the perfect white (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Way better than waxy and chalky stuff..</li>
      <li>Did okay...</li>
      <li>Easy to wash out color</li>
      <li>The color easily wiped off and onto everything my hair touched.</li>
      <li>It covers thinning areas, it sprays easily and gives my hair the body that it needs.</li>
      <li>Color is bright and vibrant.</li>
      <li>It also washed out easily-</li>
      <li>So pigmented, actually smells kind of good.</li>
      <li>I used it on dark hair and was very impressed.</li>
      <li>It did work fine.  </li>
      <li>light-</li>
      <li>I will continue using and hopefully it will always be available to order.</li>
      <li>Worked great; we created a white stripe of hair for a skunk costume.</li>
      <li>Could have saved some money getting the cheap stuff that worked just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There was plenty of spray to do his whole head and more, and I wish I had sprayed more on to give him a whiter look.  </li>
      <li>One broke but overall color good</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of surprised none of the 1-star reviews</li>
      <li>I found Jerome Russell Siberian White without a doubt the best White Spray on the shelves.</li>
      <li>Great to cover dark hair</li>
      <li>It was very controlled and easy to manage.  </li>
      <li>so I imagine that if this was on your head it would flake off super fast.</li>
      <li>It was also pretty flaky immediately after drying.</li>
      <li>People saying it doesn&#x27;t stay are applying too much!</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>I need more than one can for my mohawk, but I guess it&#x27;s because my hair is long!</li>
      <li>washed out just fine and seemed to be equal in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Not as much coverage as i really needed.  </li>
      <li>try not to enhale too much of this pr</li>
      <li>We got a few good white blasts but overall mostly just air.</li>
      <li>give it 2 stars for the high cost.</li>
      <li>Whole bottle did not make my girls (5 year old) hair</li>
      <li>She needed grey/white hair to play an old person in a play, and it looked more grey than white, even using so much.</li>
      <li>but I got my bangs pretty white.</li>
      <li>you can get a little light headed</li>
      <li>Not crunchy or anything so far.</li>
      <li>it looked sort of coated but definitely still very gray.  </li>
      <li>the color was nowhere near the &amp;#34;vivid&amp;#34; color described in the description.</li>
      <li>Just be forewarned: it smells like old lady perfume.</li>
      <li>My husband&#x27;s hair is very short and we didn&#x27;t manage to color his whole head because no matter how hard and long I shook, the propellant always wanted to come out on its own.</li>
      <li>and I barely had to even use one can to cover all of my bangs.</li>
      <li>I used this for my 6 yr old in the white color.</li>
      <li>but we did need a double shampoo to get hair back to normal texture.</li>
      <li>Real pain in the arm (and other body parts),</li>
      <li>and you could barely tell my hair had any white color.</li>
      <li>Used almost the whole can for half his head, as that&#x27;s all he needed</li>
      <li>My hair is very dark and the white color stood out really well against it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product did not work.  The color came out in brief spurts of white.  We had to hold the can upside down to get the color to come out and there was only enough product to cover my 5 year olds hair once.  I usually get 2-3 uses out of the hair color I purchase from Target for $2.00.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My spray nozzle was broken. White hair color sprayed and leaked everywhere due to this everytime I used it so I had to throw it away. The color easily wiped off and onto everything my hair touched. It also made my hair stiff feeling.</li>
    <li> Needed to make my hair Whitish-Gray for my Beetlejuice Halloween costume and this made it happen!!&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick long hair thats pass my lower back and I used up (2)full cans.. although I should&#x27;ve used (3)cans to achieve the perfect white (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL!&lt;br /&gt;- Great to cover dark hair&lt;br /&gt;- Lasts all day but will slightly smear on hands when touched and on furniture/car headrests lol&lt;br /&gt;- Hair will become slightly stiff&lt;br /&gt;- Very easy to wash out&lt;br /&gt;- Smell is very strong.. you know this is chemicals when they attempt to masque a perfumey scent over it.. try not to enhale too much of this pr you can get a little light headed</li>
    <li> I got this to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair for Halloween and was deeply disappointed that a)the nozzle kept clogging up and b) the color was nowhere near the &amp;#34;vivid&amp;#34; color described in the description. I was recommended this brand by two friends who are professonal hair stylists, and I would like to know what went wrong because my results were nowhere near what I was expecting. Horrible product and next time I&#x27;ll just my money toward a wig.</li>
    <li> This took a couple coats to get my sons hair white, and then once it was white it dried and flaked off every where. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. BIG MESS and time consuming to was out of my child&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Did okay...Not enough to do your entire head but I got my bangs pretty white.</li>
    <li> Awesome. So pigmented, actually smells kind of good. Not crunchy or anything so far. A little chalky.</li>
    <li> Great color and coverage. Washes out easily enough. Just be forewarned: it smells like old lady perfume.</li>
    <li> I used the Siberian White color for a Bride of Frankenstein costume, to create the two stripes on the sides of my hair.  I was concerned that it was going to spray everywhere and create a dust cloud, as described in other comments, but it did not.  It was very controlled and easy to manage.  My hair is very dark and the white color stood out really well against it.  It stayed put and didn&#x27;t smear everywhere.  It also washed out easily- I only did one shampooing and it was out, with no evidence afterwards.  I will use this product again for future costumes!</li>
    <li> Color is bright and vibrant. Will be ordering the pink and purple soon.</li>
    <li> The can stopped spraying after just a few squirts of the color.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is terrible and the siberian white does not show up at all on dark hair.</li>
    <li> Works well&#x27;to tone down blondes to a beach babe light-</li>
    <li> Not as much coverage as i really needed.  Whole bottle did not make my girls (5 year old) hair white like &amp;#34;Elsa&amp;#34; but overall it did work and was white.</li>
    <li> I found Jerome Russell Siberian White without a doubt the best White Spray on the shelves. It covers thinning areas, it sprays easily and gives my hair the body that it needs. I will continue using and hopefully it will always be available to order.</li>
    <li> Terrible, I have blonde hair and you could barely tell my hair had any white color. Would not buy again!</li>
    <li> I used this to dye my beard white for Halloween, worked perfect.</li>
    <li> Bought this 3 weeks before halloween and then it didnt come til a week after halloween</li>
    <li> THIS WORKS SO WELL!! I actually like the scent (it&#x27;s a little coconutty!) and I barely had to even use one can to cover all of my bangs. People saying it doesn&#x27;t stay are applying too much! Follow the directions and it works like a charm. Feels nice, too! Not tacky and gross like other hair sprays. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son&#x27;s halloween costume.  It did work fine.  Used almost the whole can for half his head, as that&#x27;s all he needed colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When halloween rolled around I needed another can so I bought the $2.00 can at Wal-mart.  It worked just as well, seemed to go on &#x27;whiter&#x27; and I only had to use half the can.  Could have saved some money getting the cheap stuff that worked just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both washed out just fine and seemed to be equal in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 2 stars for the high cost.</li>
    <li> Worked great; we created a white stripe of hair for a skunk costume. Product is stinky, and will flake off after a bit. Plan on washing hair at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I used this for my 6 yr old in the white color. I used it on dark hair and was very impressed. The scent is like baby powder. Be careful not to get it on skin as it might get itchy or sting for a second. It did rub off on black clothing and is a sticky stiff texture but we got the look we wanted which was mad scientist. Easy to wash out color but we did need a double shampoo to get hair back to normal texture.</li>
    <li> I used this for a Christmas party when I sprayed my beard.  The color stayed pretty well, but it was difficult to wash out.  It stuck to my skin too much and was difficult to remove.  It was also pretty flaky immediately after drying.</li>
    <li> Item as described.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> it worked out perfect. My daughter dressed up like Albert Einstein and it was a hit. The powder substance can be messy... And it can fall off. We had to do a touch up in the middle of the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of surprised none of the 1-star reviews mention it running out of propellant, which is the problem we had. My husband&#x27;s hair is very short and we didn&#x27;t manage to color his whole head because no matter how hard and long I shook, the propellant always wanted to come out on its own. We got a few good white blasts but overall mostly just air. Real pain in the arm (and other body parts), not much payoff.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a Halloween costume, and it actually made my hair white.  Cans are small...I have short hair, and it took 2 cans.</li>
    <li> I ran 10 miles with this in my hair and it stayed in place the entire time! It rinsed out in one wash as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for use on S &amp; P hair hoping it would cover the dark areas so I could see how all over silver would look before taking the plunge with permanent color.  So I cut a swatch from the back, sprayed it and didn&#x27;t touch it.  When wet it looked sort of coated but definitely still very gray.  As it dried, it got a frosty matte look over gray but still not silvery. It&#x27;s hard to describe but it looked dusty on the surface but dark underneath.  So I sprayed it again and waited.  Still not really a noticeable difference.  When I checked it a couple of hours later, it looked just like it did before I even started and that was without any touching or moving so I imagine that if this was on your head it would flake off super fast.</li>
    <li> These are very small cans -- closer to a travel size than standard size.  My daughter has short hair (think Jamie Lee Curtis) and we used 2 1/2 cans and didn&#x27;t get it nearly as white as the picture shows.  The picture is completely false and deceiving.  She needed grey/white hair to play an old person in a play, and it looked more grey than white, even using so much.</li>
    <li> Way better than waxy and chalky stuff.. I love this! I have dark brown hair, natural, un-dyed at the moment. I need more than one can for my mohawk, but I guess it&#x27;s because my hair is long! Love this!</li>
    <li> One broke but overall color good</li>
    <li> It worked great for my daughter&#x27;s Halloween costume!</li>
    <li> I used this Siberian White colored hair spray for my son&#x27;s 8th grade biography day Albert Einstein costume.  It worked perfectly!  I had none of the problems other reviewers reported.  But as a precaution we sprayed this on his hair outside with a big robe on so it wouldn&#x27;t get on his clothes, and a towel held up around his neck and face just to keep it out of his eyes and off of his skin.  There was plenty of spray to do his whole head and more, and I wish I had sprayed more on to give him a whiter look.  I told him to be careful about accidentally wiping it off on things at school, but he didn&#x27;t report that that was an issue.</li>
