      <li>However, haven&#x27;t appreciated a significant whitening effect that I was hoping for.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year.  The cool mint flavor is rather refreshing and leaves a clean feeling.  However, haven&#x27;t appreciated a significant whitening effect that I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything on the market that works better for me and I have tried several and none have come close to giving me the kind of results I get from Opalescence.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste was purchased with Opalescence. I like the toothpaste, and how it helps maintain the whiteness, but it does cause sensitivity issues with my teeth. I&#x27;d rate it higher if i didn&#x27;t have the sensitivity issue.</li>
    <li> good stuff, little pricey</li>
    <li> It seems to work; however, it&#x27;s a very slow process.  I use it each night, but, in the morning, I combine it with regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> No excess fillers and doesn&#x27;t leave you with cotton mouth like the other brands (Crest, Colgate, Aqua-nasty).  It&#x27;s more money but aren&#x27;t you worth it?  Used Sensodyne for years (and quite like it).  This is better.  Try it.  Your mouth will thank you.</li>
    <li> this tooth paste works, definite noticeable difference within 2 weeks, love it. Constantly ordering more when i can,</li>
    <li> This toothpaste does a nice job.  It actually whitens your teeth.  I am very satisfied and will buy again.  I would recommend this,</li>
    <li> Buy this, it works...</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste.  It takes off the coffee stains.  My dentist turned me on to this toothpaste.  I get more for my money ordering it on the Amazon.com website.  Try it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I will buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> My new Dentist turned me on to this toothpaste and now I&#x27;m hooked. It makes my teeth feel so clean and keeps them looking white.</li>
    <li> Great tasting.  Leaves your mouth feeling fresh. Keeps teeth looking white and shiny on a daily basis without professional whitening!</li>
    <li> Perform as expected between whitening treatment.  Don&#x27;t have to whiten so much.  Will purchase this item again for future use.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste I have ever tried. My teeth have never felt smoother or cleaner. I will definitely purchase this toothpaste again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> It works and works well. My teeth are at least 5 shades whiter now and the toothpaste is minty without being sickenly sweet. As a coffee drinker it makes a huge difference. Exceeded my expectations. Works better than Crest White Strips without the fuss. I brush after every meal and find that the cost of this product is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> When you need to brighten up your smile this is the toothpaste to do it. If you have sensitive teeth like me be careful you only need a little at a time it will make the teeth to sensitive. I use it every other week because my teeth are very sensitive. This came with my teeth whitening kit from the dentist so I ordered it here, to expensive at the dentist office.</li>
    <li> nice packaging. looks neat. Will update after i used them up.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended it. Does a great job. I still use it and it works great. I&#x27;ll buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Love this tooth paste, really good and pretty strong. I am using it for about a year now and love it!</li>
    <li> I have a couple friends who have been using this for years and they have the whitest teeth ever. So I decided to give it a try. Great product. Leaves a very strong minty freshness on my breath, and I could definitely tell a difference in the color of my teeth after just 2 or 3 days. Makes me actually excited to brush, and I feel like my teeth are gradually getting whiter and whiter every day. 5 Stars.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothpaste because I drink a lot of coffee and this toothpaste does a great job in whitening the teeth. I have been using this toothpaste for a while and I&#x27;m happy with it. It has a good flavor to it and it just works, simple as that, I will continue to purchase this toothpaste in the near future. For those having doubts about using this toothpaste, just give it a try and it want disappoint, you will be glad that you made the purchase.</li>
    <li> Price was extremely competitive. Works well. Although best if you have dentist formed plastic teeth trays.</li>
    <li> Excellent companion product for Opalescence gel whitener.</li>
    <li> Love the taste, whiten my teeth.</li>
    <li> great product! recommended. good quality and design.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste and it really works.  It is fast working.</li>
    <li> Leaves your teeth eith that clean feeling like you just left the dentist office. Teeth are whiter too and I am a coffee drinker.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other whitening toothpaste and I feel this works best.  The plus side is that it that it has a fresh taste and makes your whole mouth feel clean!</li>
    <li> Excellent. Best used with opalescence tooth whitening kits. Only complaint is the paste isn&#x27;t the best tasting.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best whitening toothpaste. It also has a nice taste that is not overpowering. I will continue ordering from Amazon because of the great price and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> My teeth are pretty white (so much so my dentist asks me if I have them whitened) so not really looking for much, but man, does this toothpaste really deliver. I am not a huge coffee or soda drinker, and brush lots, but can&#x27;t even use those over the counter whitening strips-that&#x27;s why I am always looking for the next best toothpaste. Also, my best friend (male) who has pretty yellow teeth- says he really notices a difference- and so do I! Lastly- the cool mint flavor is more like wintergreen, still tasty. For the price, I think this product delivers and will buy again.</li>
    <li> thought i would never change my toothpaste until now .This stuff is great the whole family is now using it</li>
    <li> I Love this toothpaste--it helps to whiten my teeth and I love the taste.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had my teeth professionally cleaned at my dentist&#x27;s office 2 years ago and (on their suggestion) have been using this toothpaste ever since to keep my teeth as white as I can ... considering I&#x27;m 53 and drink coffee everyday. I think it works well.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this toothpaste after reading reviews about it. I&#x27;m absolutely disappointed! It didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth at all. In fact it made them look worse. It&#x27;s unbelievable. I&#x27;m ashamed to show my teeth! Now I must spend extra money to have them look decent again.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste ....</li>
    <li> My teeth look so white because of this paste and it tastes pretty good. I have gotten so many compliments at work. I will probably be trying some other opalescence products.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. You immediately see the difference after the first use. I love it. Its worthe the cost.</li>
    <li> They advertise the product as 2 packs of toothpaste, But I received only One. This is considered false advertisement and you need to stop. The only reason i gave it 3 stars is because i like the product, and it does whiten my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unhappy Customer</li>
    <li> Work great and a refreshing mint flavor..</li>
    <li> I use this toothpaste along side the whitening trays and I like it.</li>
    <li> I chose this toothpaste because of the whitening it promised.  I just rec&#x27;d it today so the rating of 5 stars I gave it has to do with the great mint smell it had. If for some reason it does not live up to the promise, I will re-evaluate it.</li>
    <li> Item received was as described, my teeth have increased in whiteness while using this toothpaste. Will continue to purchase, depending on the darkness of your teeth I would recommend purchasing the whitening kit as well.</li>
    <li> I love the taste, but not sure how long it takes before you see a difference in whitening my teeth.  I&#x27;ve been using for about two weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any difference yet.</li>
    <li> received very fast and a good product</li>
    <li> Works very well.  My dentist even says I don&#x27;t have the stains on my teeth that I used to have.</li>
    <li> Used product prior to ordering if used daily does whiten ur teeth. Gradually. Doesnt remove your enamel. Must contiue use gets better results.</li>
    <li> Works well for our entire family.</li>
    <li> I have used this for quite sometime, but I have developed dry mouth and eyes and I have to watch what I use for my tooth paste and mouth wash.  So I try to use it sparingly.  It does work, though. Very good product.</li>
    <li> I like the taste, and the price is not bad, overall very happy with it</li>
    <li> Product as described, came in a 2 pack as advertised. This is by far the best toothpaste I have ever used. Whitens better than any other product I have ever tried. Will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> My daughter is a dental hygienist and she introduced me to this.  It is a very mild mint flavor, great for sensitive gums.  It whitens like no other with regular use.  And it doesn&#x27;t have those little specs in it that are actually plastic.  This is all I will ever use!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I have been using this toothpaste about 3 times a week with my Braun Triumph electric toothbrush.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic whitening of my teeth but they may be a slight shade whiter than when I first started out.  I will continue using and see how things progress.s</li>
    <li> this tooth paste does not really do the job it claims to.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste!!!! It makes my teeth noticeably whiter after just one use, but what I love the most is its very mild flavor. Minty toothpastes make me gag, which makes me want to brush my teeth less. This one has a very mild mint flavor and feels very smooth on my teeth. It&#x27;s more like a thick gel than a paste.</li>
    <li> One of the best toothpaste that i will use it for long</li>
    <li> I just ordered this product less than a week ago and have not yet received it, but I wanted to write a quick review on the product itself.  If I have any troubles with the packaging, or timing of arrival i will add to this review when that time comes.&lt;br /&gt;I am a dental hygienist, and I use Opalescence 35% teeth whitener in the syringe on patience and use it myself as well, at home.  The kits of the syringes always come with a trial size of this toothpaste so I have always had tons stocked up.  The taste of this toothpaste does not compare to any other paste I&#x27;ve used.  It is the most fresh taste (I think it tastes identical to certs mints!).  The fresh feeling/taste is unbelievable! As far as whitening goes...toothpastes themselves do not really whiten your teeth so much...unless you just have surface stains (ie. coffee, wine..etc...like me!).  So, as far as a \\&quot;whitening toothepate\\&quot; this definitely takes the cake in that department! I HIGHLY recommend this toothpaste to ANYONE...whether you are looking to whiten or not! I cannot believe I&#x27;ve not thought to check Amazon for this product, as I order a ton from Amazon...roughly 1-5 items a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND, This is the best of the best!&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, if I have ANY problems with the seller or shipment, I will refer back to this review and add to it.  If you hear nothing more from me, assume everything was perfect :)</li>
