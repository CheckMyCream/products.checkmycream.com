<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Not so good.  Fell apart quickly.  Bought a Phillips to replace it and way happier.</li>
    <li> It works as described.</li>
    <li> After 1 month of use I must say it does a great job...holds charge well, shaves quietly and closely, and is easy to clean. I wish it came with a stand like my old one, but no big deal...!!!</li>
    <li> I should have read more about the features.  This model doesn&#x27;t allow you to run it while charging -- I got used to that feature with my old Remington (especially as the battery started to not hold a charge).  This doesn&#x27;t bother me yet since the battery lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband as a gift. He has always been a Norelco user and this was a new step for him. He likes it very much. Quick recharge. Light weight.</li>
    <li> Shaves well, and at a good price.</li>
    <li> Very good value.  bought this for my son and it seems to work as well as my $100.00 Norelco.</li>
    <li> My husband love it..great razor</li>
    <li> Bought this as it was cheaper than buying the replacement blades. Go figure.</li>
    <li> I expected more; it does the job, and is very light weight, but it is not nearly as good as the more expensive Remington&#x27;s. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great produce received fast with no problems!</li>
    <li> good price I gave these to my sons for Christmas and even my husband is enjoying them.</li>
    <li> Cuts great when it works but after about 3 days the on/off switch stopped working</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome! It feels amazing and does a great job ! I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> GREAT SHAVER FOR THE PRICE</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product because the batter charger was not with it and the grooming kit for it was not with it either and it was suppose to be free with it and after all that the batter was all most dead so how do I get those things now.  Please send me information on how I can get a charger for this Remington products R4 Lithium Power Series Rotary Shaver. It needs a charger and cleaning kit.   I want to be proud of my amazon orders, as soon as possible he can&#x27;t use a electric razor with out a charge.        Thank you,       Peggy Singletary</li>
    <li> I am not a long time electric shaver devotee, so my reviewing ability is limited to my own experience with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a blade for over 20 years and found what I like and what works for me with that approach.&lt;br /&gt;However, since shavers had undoubtedly improved in that time, I decided to give electrics a new try.&lt;br /&gt;I was most interested in the 3-head rotaries, and wanted a cordless with lithium battery and a rinse out ability.&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good with this razor. I used a pre-shave alcohol based product and gave it a whirl on  my 2-day beard. It worked smoothly and left no razor burn. In the past I had to shave every day with an electric, but only every other day with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;With this razor, I waited for the second day consistently for 2 weeks. On some days it was &amp;#34;necessary&amp;#34; to shave but I didn&#x27;t. I waited.&lt;br /&gt;The difference was in my attention to detail, not the shaver itself. If I was in a hurry, every day was needed. If I took my time, every other day was sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;Charging the razor is simple, though the plug in is awkward. The charge lasts more than two weeks, and the rinse out works easily.&lt;br /&gt;The razor has to lay on its side and won&#x27;t stand up.&lt;br /&gt;I then extended my experiment to other areas: I like to keep my underarms and nether regions shaved smooth also. Just don&#x27;t like the odor that accumulates with non shaving. For the nether area, it worked well, since I keep that pretty short always. It took a little practice, but that works well with no problems except being careful of the delicate nature of the shaving.&lt;br /&gt;My underarms I often let go a little and when I first used the razor there, it left some razor burns, but the hair was over half an inch long. I think the twisting rotary heads actually were pulling some of the hair out. It took a few days for this to settle down, but the next time I attempted it, the hair was about a fourth of an inch, and there were no razor burns, so again, my fault, or my learning and adapting to the tool.&lt;br /&gt;I think this could also be used to shave a person&#x27;s head, but with the same caveat as for underarms: be sure the hair is short to avoid any razor burns.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the razor performs well, is small and lightweight and works in numerous areas, though I think they intend for this to be only for the face.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably switch back and forth between electric and blade, but am now comfortable with this electric. Replacement heads can be ordered after a year of use, but I think I&#x27;ll re-evaluate at that time.my learning and adapting to the tool.&lt;br /&gt;I think this could also be used to shave a person&#x27;s head, but with the same caveat as for underarms: be sure the hair is short to avoid any razor burns.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the razor performs well, is small and lightweight and works in numerous areas, though I think they intend for this to be only for the face.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably switch back and forth between electric and blade, but am now comfortable with this electric.

    <li> good razor only gripe is it will not work unless unplugged to so have to unplug, use it, plug it back in, that stupid to make it that way. I just want one that will work while plugged in. either way, not a bad razor, just dumb functionality.</li>
    <li> works great and great value!!</li>
    <li> Works fine, holds charge for a long time... But the shave isn&#x27;t extremely close, a lot of stubble left behind. Also sometimes it feels like it is tugging on my facial hair.</li>
    <li> It is okay,but it isn&#x27;t my expect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been one week, shaver is not working anymore</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery.  Works well.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Razor very rough on skin. Unlike my other Remington Razor. Can&#x27;t return, distroyed box.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, but it&#x27;s doing the job I bought it for.</li>
    <li> I had an older model of shaver for which I couldn&#x27;t find replacement blades so I took a chance on this one.&lt;br /&gt;Now I regret spending a dime on it, it&#x27;s a piece of garbage and here is why. One of the major selling pitches all shaver manufacturers make is that their shaver (unlike all others, of course), has the unique advantage of hugging the contours of your face and is designed and engineered to provide ultra close shave at ultimate comfort possible......... blah, blah blah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It amounts to pivoting blades that flex in two directions which helps while shaving chin, the pivoting or floating head is feature that defeats the purpose of having pivoting blades because it feels like holding a squid by the tail while tentacles are slobbering all over your face and each has mind of its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &amp;#34;engineering marvel&amp;#34; that provides ultimate comfort is nothing but stupidity resulting from trying to invent something that has no practical purpose or function.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving head leans left and right, up and down and in every direction in between at even moderate pressure, this makes only the leading blade confirm to skin and the other two hover above the skin, uselessly spinning and waiting to be engaged with skin depending on next direction of movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for close shave, as explained above, any pressure on shaver to enhance skin contact and closer shave, results in out of control tilting of shaver&#x27;s head when pushed in any direction while pressing against the skin, making close shave impossible.&lt;br /&gt;The other factor in making close shave impossible with this and most if not all electric shavers is the fact that blade is separated from skin by foil or rotary blade housing, no matter what the thickness of it, it is there, the blade cannot get as close to skin as direct contact of conventional blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantage of electric shaver for me is in avoiding cuts, disadvantage,.......... overstated and deceptive claims resulting in collection of junk shavers that all do very much the same thing, partial job, leaving me with having to use both, conventional blades and electric shavers to get decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to engineers inventing these useless pieces of junk:&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE A HAND WITH WORKING WRIST, IT CAN MOVE SHAVER IN ANY AND ALL DIRECTIONS NEEDED TO COVER ALL ANGLES OF MY FACE.&lt;br /&gt;I ALSO HAVE A WORKING NECK, IT ALLOWS ME TO MOVE MY HEAD IN MANY DIRECTIONS AND ASSIST MY HAND IN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY IN FINDING ULTIMATE ANGLE FOR EFFICIENT SHAVING AND COMFORT IN THOSE TOUGH AREAS AROUND MY CHIN,.............

    <li> Great razor as all Remington shavers are.  Last year I thought I would try one of those expensive Braun self cleaning razors and while it did a great job at shaving, the trimmer on the back broke off.  I used Remington shavers since I was 19 and even six years through the military on multiple deployments (Two different razors over about 12 years).  I even had a little battery powered Remington shaver that I bought from the BX during tech school and I still have it--Though I don&#x27;t use it anymore.  In any case, I&#x27;m now in my mid 30s and I&#x27;m rather ashamed that I strayed from old faithful.  The brand that never let me down when it mattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note though.  This is my first rotary style electric shaver as I have been using the two foil style all these years.  I can&#x27;t seem to get as close a shave with the rotary as I did with my foil shavers.  Maybe I just have to get used to shaving with it but if I had to do it over again I would probably buy a Remington F5-5800.  It doesn&#x27;t really matter as much for me anymore because I&#x27;m not in the service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a great razor with Remington quality.  I&#x27;m sure I will get many years of use out of it.</li>
    <li> Shaver had to be returned because it would not charge at all, and thus would not run. Very disappointed since some of the Amazon&lt;br /&gt;reviews for this shaver were very positive.</li>
    <li> The blades on this model are not as sharp as other Remington shavers I&#x27;ve owned before this one.  The dullness causes it to pull on hairs.</li>
    <li> I  love it because it gives a close shave and does not cause your face to burn and super great for the price..</li>
    <li> Great seller all is ok!!!</li>
    <li> great shaver wonderful customer service.</li>
    <li> husband dropped it and now can&#x27;t get top to stay on, broken after 2 uses..</li>
    <li> When I originally bought this shaver at Walmart I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for 30 bucks, but all I wanted was a rechargeable full size shaver to keep in the glove box for those mornings when I have to race out the door with barely a shower. I must say after I tested it out the next day it exceeded every one of my expectations, it shaved close (smooth skin but not smooth for as long as my Norelco 7300), shaved even quicker than my Norelco, and it didn&#x27;t leave me with shaver burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I think the reason for this is that it only has openings for short stubble (and two tracks of openings at that) very much like the old Norelco Speed XL shavers. This seems to make it so I don&#x27;t have to move the shaver over the same spot as many times to get the short stubble to enter the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put it just shaves good quick, and most mornings I find myself reaching for this cheap Remington over my Norelco which costs $130 more.</li>
    <li> Good value for the price. The battery is outstanding! I shaved for 20 days after fully charging it. Then I could hear a slight decrease in motor speed at which time I charged it again. It took less than 6 hours to fully charge after using it for 20 days. My average daily shave duration is 1:45 minutes which equals 35 min overall shave time. I never got more than 9 days of run time on a charge on my 2 previous razors which was decent. It gives a typical close shave for an electric razor (not as close as a manual blade razor). I did not experience any pulling of hairs when I shave as some reviews state. However, I don&#x27;t have thick facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire head pivots (not each rotary blade) which I am not a big fan of. I would prefer this razor was slightly smaller for traveling but it is a standard size for most electric razors like this. It does not come with a blade cover or carrying sack like my other electric razors.</li>
    <li> My husband is so pleased with this shaver.I didn&#x27;t even realize it was washable. Great product.</li>
    <li> Works a lot better then I thought. Great price and works fine</li>
    <li> ladies, this works very well on female legs, too.  I am getting a lot of use out of this,  and I wish I would of ordered one, sooner.  Works quickly and smoothly.</li>
    <li> I give this Remington  a 3 star because it&#x27;s a very basic shaver. I mean it doesn&#x27;t even come with a blade or head cover Seriously? Another thing is the little brush that comes with every other razor to clean the whiskers from the inside of the razor OMG Remington you guys need to stop being so cheap.Not a bad razor for the money though I gotta say it cuts the toughest beard whiskers and my stubborn 5 o&#x27;clock shadow lol. Thanks Remington another fine product you guys put out just include all the other stuff I mentioned above and you&#x27;ll get 5 stars ok? Another thing is the Lithium-ion battery shoot the thing last all week at 10-15 mins a pop.</li>
    <li> Worked well for 7 months, but now no longer holds a charge and is useless.  Good price, but if you want something that lasts you may as well spend a little more on a better brand.</li>
    <li> This was given to me as a father&#x27;s day present and I like it the only complain is WHERE! is the clean brush . It could use one ..other then that is gives a close shave fast..</li>
    <li> It is easy to clean and easy to charge and it cuts the whiskers okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not as close as a razor so I still use razors but for any time I just need a fast shave that does the job then this sits ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life last several times if used a lot or last many days if not used very much, but it charges up in just 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works fine for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s made out of cheap plastic and it won&#x27;t run while charging... I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and it gets the job done but it takes longer than I thought it would. My last one I had (also by Remington) was about ten years old when the blades stopped cutting... Hopefully this one will last at least two years...</li>
    <li> Very easy, smooth cut.  Easy cleaning, much better than any electric I have had in the past.</li>
    <li> This razor has a couple of drawbacks&lt;br /&gt;1. The sideburn popup trimmer does not pop up far enough to allow you to &amp;#34;push&amp;#34; upward when using it. If you do, it will close on you.&lt;br /&gt;2. The charger has the transformer part plug into the wall, not built in like Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;3. The rotary blades are set in too far from the edge of the head so that you have to mush your nose in to get it to shave all the way to your nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took it back and got a Norelco which solves all these problems but does not have the charge indicator.</li>
    <li> Long, long, long battery life! Works great for me!</li>
    <li> Simple yet effective!</li>
    <li> good product for the price - got over a months worth of shaving on single charge - I use it to shave my head - no razor burn</li>
    <li> Great value and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> It is not a good cutting shaver. Motor seems to run too slow to cut well.</li>
    <li> I brought this product for my husband and he loves it.  Holds charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> I was very tired of using razors so i finally decided to invest in one of these, great for travel and shaving in a pinch as well as daily use. Battery lasts forever, and compared to similar products i&#x27;ve used, this is quieter, doesn&#x27;t tug as bad, shaves cleaner, and is just better in general. Very comfortable in the hand and on the face, worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I wrote today in spanish, and sorry. any whorse or bad whose, only this products is really bad, no shape no nothing, not working well, this is my first product buyed in amazon bad</li>
    <li> Not as good as others reviewed. I like Nolerco product better than Remington.</li>
    <li> I wanted a backup razor for the car and for 25 bucks this is just ok. I have used Norelco exclusively in the past and having used this it was a bit disappointing. It seems a bit underpowered so the blades pull at the hair and not cut it clean. If you have heavy facial hair this razor would not do. But if you have light facial hair this might be ok for 25 bucks. One thing i do like is the pop up trimmer is very good. I do use it as a backup but prefer my main norelco razor.</li>
    <li> Really nice shaver. Shapes to your face really well. Very easy to clean. Charge lasts a long time, due to Lithium battery. Great price for this type of shaver. Highly recommend. Very well priced and definitely worth it. Also...it doesn&#x27;t get very hot like some other shavers out there. I like the trim feature as well. Swe...eee......t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy with confidence!</li>
    <li> bought this for my uncle in a residential care home , he loves it !</li>
    <li> It works good and very light weight.</li>
    <li> The expense of shaving with today&#x27;s disposable razors/blades is crazy. Gave the Remington R4 Lithium rotary shaver a shot to be able to move away from constantly buying blades. The trimmer worked beautifully to remove a few days worth of stubble prior to using the rotary blades. I was amazed at the job this shaver did! It sounds cliche&#x27;d, but it really gave smooth, baby soft skin, with no stubble and no razor burn. I would have expected a little more of that at this price point, but was pleasantly surprised. Fantastic entry level rotary shaver.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver is better than most as shavers go. It leaves my husband&#x27;s skin smooth but obviously does not shave as closely as a manual razor. With that being said, it does not nick his skin or pull or pinch so that is always a plus. The biggest con to this razor is it does not come with a plastic cover for the shaver head so it is exposed and when traveling one has to be sure to pack it very carefully to ensure it does not get damaged.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes the Remington Cordless Rotary Shaver Model PR 1240 because he said it gives him a very close and comfortable shave.  The cut heads follow the contour of the face.  The rechargeable lithium battery provides 45 minutes of run time and charges in 4 hours.  An added feature for this model is that it rinses clean under the faucet.  I have used it to shave my legs and it is awesome, much better than using a razor blade which sometimes cuts my legs!  I highly recommend this shaver for men and women to shave with because it is more comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Great light duty razor with multiple functional uses. Its nice and simple to use, quiet and non-irritating. Also while your shaving it has an attachment that you can use to clean up other facial hair. And best of all clean up is easy, just clean it under the faucet.</li>
    <li> This classic Remington rotary shaver is affordable and gives a great close shave for the price.  Charges quickly and holds the charge far more than 45min.  It&#x27;s very light and very comfortable to use.  I do think it will be easier to use on light growth.  I think the only complaint in this house is the closeness of the shave.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for a month by now. So far the result is very good. It shaves clean and smoothly. A charge lasted almost three weeks so I am only on my second charge. I brought it with me for travel and it seemed to withstand shipping in checked-in luggage well. Comparing to the Norelco AT810 I previously had, I would not hesitate picking the Remington for lower price and very similar performance.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to be very sharp,i have another one that is a Remington about a year old and it cuts better than my new better? one</li>
    <li> gives an exceptionally close shave, and the rinse to clean design is great!</li>
    <li> Since (happily) I do not have enough facial hair to take the Remington R4 Lithium Power Series Rotary Shaver for a spin, I had my son test it.  He has vast quantities of facial hair which he re-arranges/re-grooms in various ways.  He also works with prosthetics for zombie parts, so he needs it for rather specialized jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What he found was that It&#x27;s good for:&lt;br /&gt;~trimming large swaths of your body&lt;br /&gt;~good for maintaining shaved arms and legs -- easier than taking a razor to those parts of your body&lt;br /&gt;~works well in combination with a standard clipper&lt;br /&gt;~good if you&#x27;re trying to maintain a clean-shaven appearance&lt;br /&gt;~if you have a clipper, razor, and this as a combo, it works well but it&#x27;s not great as a standalone&lt;br /&gt;~for the price, it&#x27;s pretty decent&lt;br /&gt;~though it is not so good with goatees and beards; the large triangular head makes it not so good for detail work BUT&lt;br /&gt;~the trimmer is good for detailing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It now has the zombie seal of approval.</li>
    <li> Not comfortable at all, pulls on wiskers no matter what you use.</li>
    <li> Five star for the price. The battery last a long time. The shave is close. My only complaint is: It is a little rough on the skin compared to some of my other razors. I like the close shave though, so it&#x27;s worth it. This is very good for the price!</li>
    <li> Holds a charge longer than any I have owned.  It gives me a good shave and I use the trimmer feature to take care of unwanted hair.  Good bargain.  I thought the price was too low for a quality shaver, but I was pleasantly surprised at the features and the ease of operation here.</li>
    <li> I usually sport a full beard, but occasionally need to embrace the clean face look.  I grew up with electric razors, so that’s what I prefer to use once the beard is gone, rather than a safety razor.  I’ve been using a 10+ year old Panasonic foil razor, but the battery is no longer holding a charge well, so it’s time for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my new Remington was charged up, I took it for a test drive.  The unit is light, and also very quiet, which is a big change from the Panasonic.  As long as you follow the directions and work it in circles, rather than trying to grind it into your face, it works fine.  For comparison, I spent 5 days shaving ½ of my face with my old Panasonic, and ½ with the new Remington.  I even skipped a day, to see if the extra stubble would present any challenges.  Surprisingly, the results were identical.  In terms of time required, effort required, and overall closeness of shave – both look and feel – I found no real difference.  The Remington gets the nod in cleanup though, since you can just rinse it under the faucet when you’re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only area where I prefer the foil Panasonic is when trimming near my beard.  The foil lets me get my neck cleaned off and work right up to the edge of the beard.  The Remington rotary will grab every beard hair it can get and rip them out, a distinctly unpleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have an electric razor you’re happy with, I can’t think of a good reason to upgrade to this unit.  But if you are due for a replacement, I can recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> The shaver exceeded my expectations by doing what the manufacturer claimed as to close comfortable shave and it was a snap to clean after.</li>
    <li> would NOT cut whiskers....useless</li>
    <li> With a 45 minute battery life it lasts until your next charge and it is cordless so you can take it in the shower with you or use it comfortably at the sink. It shaves smoothly and easily and it is lightweight so you can hold it firmly and move it to the contours of your face or body. My roommate tried this out and he liked it on his two day old growth as it removed it without irritation or nicks/cuts like his manual razor left behind.  I tried the razor on my legs using plenty of shaving cream and it worked quickly and I didn&#x27;t worry about cutting my kneecap skin open like I usually do with razors. With 33% more pivot this razor is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Razor holds a charge for a long time but it does not have much shaving power.  Anything  longer than a days growth it struggles.  I would not recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> does the job, but not as well as my Norelco</li>
    <li> does what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
    <li> Son said this is AWEOME!!!!! would definitely recommend to someone.</li>
    <li> this shaver works great for men or women.</li>
    <li> ...Failed after less than a month. Won&#x27;t turn on even after a full charge!</li>
    <li> It works in a pinch, but not as close as a blade razor.  Admittedly a great price and good for a quick clean up.</li>
    <li> Perfect, Did not hurt aging parents skin and was much appreciated. Easy to use!</li>
    <li> I tried it once...It barely cut and was pulling...I had to turn it off immediately.  Maybe I had a bad one, but whatever, it was returned.  I would not&lt;br /&gt;recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this. I had expected this to be used as a back up shaver but its now used every day on a heavy beard.&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts 2-3 weeks easily. Great shaver</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of the Norelco triple header so I tried this to see if it cleaned easier and it does. The flip top allows for easy cleaning and I even run the cutter heads under water without failure. It runs about 6-7 shaves and if you do too long it just stops. Lithium battery technology is superior to Ni-Cad primarily due to the electronic control of the charging circuit. Price is right.</li>
    <li> This is really a great shaver at this price point. Sure there are superior shavers out there if you want to spend 3-4x as much but for a budget shaver this thing really delivers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Battery life: The shaver is rechargeable and has a listed battery life of 45 minutes. I found this to be quite accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Performance: As far as electric shavers go, this one does a decent job. It doesn&#x27;t give as close of a shave as a manual razor but compared to other electric shavers I was pretty impressed with the closeness of the shave I got with it. I like the way the head flexes to adjust to contours. Shaving my jawline takes a few passes from different directions but this is par for the course for me with electric shavers so this did not surprise me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cleaning: I LOVE that I can rinse it under the faucet! This is the first electric I have owned with this feature and it makes clean-up so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this shaver. If you&#x27;re in the market for a budget shaver this one earns its keep among the options available at this price point. All in all a good product!</li>
    <li> This is one of Remington&#x27;s &#x27;Norelco&#x27; form shavers. It follows the Norelco form not only externally but in most operational aspects. A major difference from the Norelco&#x27;s in this price range is that in the Norelco&#x27;s, only the individual head carriers float to fit what&#x27;s been shaved. The Remington has a double action where both the head carriers and the entire head move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has the advantage of the shaver most closely following the to be shaved surface resulting in a very close shave. The downside is a bit of a disconcerting rattle from the shaving surface as you move it back and forth while shaving due to all the floating parts. This was bothersome at first but after a few days&#x27; shaving, I stopped noticing it to any significant degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One slight downside to this shaver is that if fully discharged, you cannot shave with it using the charger cord as with all Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used. However it only takes a five minute charge to bring a totally flat shaver up to be ready for one shave so that&#x27;s not much of a penalty. The package screams of its long battery life - one hour - which is a nice touch and one a traveler will welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good, solid choice in an inexpensive shaver that does the job at least as well as the competition. Tough to see how one can go wrong here if in the market for such a shaver.</li>
    <li> This was a great first shave gift for my son. It took months to get used to seeing his young, smooth face discolor above his lip to a dirty looking pre-moustache. There was just enough there to make him look like he needed to wash his face but I wanted him to make the decision when or if he would shave. I offered him the shaver (though his teenage sister wanted it for her legs) and - once I assured him that no it wouldn&#x27;t hurt - he took it. We were both thrilled with the results. His shiny clean baby face is back -- and he thought it was fun to shave. This product made for a very nice historical transition in this family.</li>
    <li> I like it, as I have an older Remington, but when I shave my neck it bites my skin and I get left with a rash.  The rest of my face comes out good. Also I miss the green lights that show how much battery is left. Thank you Kenneth J. Pina Sr.</li>
    <li> This product has been a great disappointment.  Couldn&#x27;t. Shave anything</li>
    <li> Nice product, good deliver and packing.</li>
    <li> My husband is really happy with this Remington shaver.  It comfortably gives a nice, close shave and moves really smoothly across his skin.  The pop up trimmer is a great feature, letting him be precise where he needs to be.  The battery holds a good charge, letting him get in a few thorough shaves before he needs to recharge.  It&#x27;s been a long time since my husband had a new electric shaver; I think his old one actually belonged to his father.  This Remington is quieter and much more comfortable.  He also likes the ease of cleaning it by simply rinsing it in the sink after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver also seems pretty durable.  My husband dropped it this morning and the top came apart.  Nothing broke and it went back together easily and still seems to work just as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Norelco/Philips rotary razor for decades, and I thought I would give the Remington Products R4 Lithium Power Series Rotary Shaver a try as well. I&#x27;m happy to report that it does a very good job at adjusting to the various angles and planes of the face without pulling at the hair follicles. It is a bit noisier than the recent Norelco models I&#x27;ve had, but it shares with them the convenience of being rinse-able under the faucet. After charging the second time, the Remington R4 was able to hold its charge for about 40-45 minutes. This of course depends on usage patterns and the thickness of the beard. My daughter wanted to try it on her legs, and reports that it also works well in that capacity. One consideration is that it is not meant to be used while plugged in, so you&#x27;d want to plan accordingly. Certainly for the price, this razor is a very good value.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver in November 2014 as a Christmas present for my son, he used it twice and the spring came out. Now its worthless.</li>
    <li> Very nice electric shaver.  It came fully charged, which makes it easy to use out-of-the-box.  It has a flippy-type beard trimmer, which is activated by the push of a button.  (This  is very convenient)  There is a power cord included, with an LED light indicating a full charge.  The box claims 45 minutes of run time, but mine far exceeds that (2 hours and still going).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver did NOT come with a small brush to help with cleaning, which I found a bit unusual, and would have been helpful.  However, the button to pop the rotary blades off of the motor was easy to find, and to use.)  An old toothbrush would do the trick, and there are cleaning kits available if this is an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three rotary blades are easily maneuverable to navigate the terrain of my face.  It tilts, and even sort of &amp;#34;compresses&amp;#34; (easier to show than to explain), but I&#x27;m convinced this will work on most faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally use electric shavers, but this is a nice unit that will live in my glove compartment for emergencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
    <li> not bad for this price</li>
    <li> Not really that good of a shaver</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first due to past performance issues with earlier electric shavers (particularly those designed for women), but was very pleasantly surprised by the results this inexpensive shaver gave.  Until now, I&#x27;ve been using a regular razor while in the shower in order to get a close shave on my legs, but no more.  If you&#x27;re like me and  want to save money wasted on water, shaving cream and disposable razors or cartridges and reduce this risk of skin breaks and infection, this is the way to go!  Pretty close shave without breaking the bank on a more expensive shaver, too! I would have given five stars were the shaver more modern-looking and more pleasing to the eye.</li>
    <li> .&lt;br /&gt;I like rotary shavers for their for quiet, close-enough shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This basic model has some minor annoyances, but it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar to [[ASIN:B006GQYSGO Norelco&#x27;s PT730]], but it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - $15 to $20 less expensive (usually)&lt;br /&gt; - No Protective cap included (really? to save 30 cents?)&lt;br /&gt; - Flipping the heads open is a bit more awkward&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both shave well, have 2 year warranty, pop-up trimmer, and wet-shave capability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rig up some kind of travel case that will protect the heads and prevent suitcase power-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried Remington&#x27;s Xr1350 (often $70) which has a fuel gauge, pivoting head assembly (not necessarily better), a smaller pop-up trimmer (which I prefer), harder-to-clean heads, and a charging stand (pluses and minuses). See my review of the Xr1350 for details -- http://www.amazon.com/review/R16CMS6Q6NCNSF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~ Comments &amp; questions welcome ~~~</li>
    <li> My husband and my son both tried this razor out. Neither had used an electric razor before, so they had the predictable initial reactions: the shave is not as close as with a safety razor. That said, they grew to love it. It&#x27;s cordless, with an impressive battery life from rechargable lithium batteries. It&#x27;s designed to move comfortably around chins and jawbones, and there is a trimmer for fine detail work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The maker recommends that you use this shaver daily for a month &amp;#34;to allow time for your hair and skin to become accustomed to the new shaving system,&amp;#34; which may sound humorous at first, but it definitely grew on my husband. It&#x27;s faster and more convenient than lathering up for a manual shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cordless and washable, so you might think it&#x27;s a good choice for camping, but the instructions say firmly not to use it outdoors, so keep this one at home.</li>
    <li> If you shave everyday then this razor might be OK for you; because a two day growth and you&#x27;ve got pulling and tearing. It feels like cheap plastic because it is cheap plastic.  It didn&#x27;t work on ladies legs which most electrics do. I would pass on this model; I do like Remington&#x27;s but I have found more consistanty with Norelco&#x27;s.  Husband liked it but he has minimal growth in a 24 hour period. It&#x27;s just not powerful enough to handle heavy growth or a multi-day stubble.</li>
    <li> I have switched between Norelco and Remington shavers on and off since I was a teen.  I used to think Norelco had the best rotary blades while Remington gave a closer shave with occasional razor burns.  But I hated cleaning the rotary blades.  This one is the best of both worlds.  It gives a great close shave, without the razor burn, and the blades have an easy clean design where you can simply rinse it clean under running water!  Wow.  My main complaint against rotary blades is gone.  And you can&#x27;t get razor burn with a rotary, though it will pull a bit if you neglect shaving for too many days as all rotary blades will do.  The charge holds for a few shaves before you need to charge it again.  I really like this shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, light handy shaver for quick uses.  Generally, the cut is not as sharp as I would like it, meaning you may need to go over it a couple of times.  And, you can also work on the back of the neck, and, of course the sideburn area.  It is easy to pop up, and a very convenient way to store this extra blade.  For cleaning, all you do is a simple rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For traveling, there is not a lid, so make sure it is dry.  Like any new razor, take the time to work with it. And, with the charge lasting up to 45 minutes, this is merely a portable razor, meaning you cannot use the electrical method.  You can use this in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, light, comfortable, adequate shave, easy to clean!  Rizzo</li>
    <li> A very nice shaver for the money the wife says, she&#x27;s hard to please so I&#x27;m very happy with her comments, She uses it to shave her chin. A good price too for this $34</li>
    <li> I have used rotary shavers for 20 plus years and Remington is by far superior to the Norelco product. I was recently given a $100 plus Norelco for my birthday hoping for better but nothing ever seems to beat the low cost Remington. Now keep in mind I am talking about the speed and quality of the shave not the build quality of the hardware. Thats one area that norelco might win but who cares, you can buy a new Remington that shaves better every year for less than Norelco replacement blades. when shopping for this type of shaver look to see that the cutting disks have all slots the more rows the better. Stay away from the pin hole disks if they cut at all they will increase the time of your shave.</li>
    <li> My husband is happy with it.  He is keeps his head clean, shaves it daily, we tend to go through a shaver every couple of years.  This one has a good battery life according to him.</li>
    <li> Taking some time to get used to as I&#x27;m used to a corded razor, but the features rock</li>
    <li> Very happy, great razor. Arrived on time, perfect condition.</li>
    <li> So to give perspective, I have thick facial hair. Not that it necessarily grows in thickly, but rather the hairs themselves are thick. For this reason, I haven&#x27;t tried to use an electric shaver in about ten years. Past experience has consisted of my hairs being pulled out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver impressed me and makes me believe that the technology has improved quite a bit the last decade, even trickling down to this low cost model. I still can&#x27;t go more than two days (maybe three, but that&#x27;s pushing it) or it pulls, but this is finally a convenient way to shave as long as I stay on top of it. Very happy with this shaver.</li>
    <li> Very smooth shaves. Great value.</li>
    <li> Thought this might be as good as my old Norelco, but I was wrong. Norelco is better, but Norelco costs are so high anymore !</li>
    <li> Needed a new razor and had good performance from Remington before.  This works very well.  Very well indeed.  The only concerns are  1) very little mass, very light and 2) Sounds wimpy.  Still very satisfied with the performance.  No regrets.Clse</li>
    <li> Nice price, works great!</li>
    <li> very poor performance, cheap look , waste of money</li>
    <li> I do not like the head design.  the work to clean the blades is too much. the norelco is better.</li>
    <li> A well designed product that fits my hand well. It provides a good shave, and holds a charge for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also own a similar Remington shaver, and have had good luck with it as well. In short, I offer it is a good line of products.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Dad who has Alzheimers.  He is able to use it at this time to shave himself</li>
    <li> Feels cheaply made&lt;br /&gt;doesnt cut stubble</li>
    <li> Great Razor, I get a real close shave from it and for the price its a really good buy.&lt;br /&gt;The pivoting heads work well and it will remove 1 to 2 days of stubble with no problems and no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I am a bit puzzled why some people are complaining that they cant shave away several weeks of beard with this Shaver!!&lt;br /&gt;With any electric or blade shaver it really only works if the hair is short a stubbly, once it gets too long and starts bending away you need to use a Beard and Mustache trimmer to get it down to 1-2mm in length and then use the electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the R4 I found that the batteries gave me plenty of time for a good shave and I really overall just liked the way it performed.  I figure at this price if I get a year out of it I will have saved myself a lot of money over using regular blades.</li>
    <li> great product just what my husband wanted, thanks</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Very close shave. Light weight. Holds charge for days.</li>
    <li> Really, really liked this electric shaver. Performs much better than more expensive ones I have previously own. I highly recommend it, and would purchase another one to have as a back up.</li>
    <li> Very good razor. If only the blades were titanium it would have been loved it rating.</li>
    <li> Got tired of expensive norelco replacement rotary cutters that cost more than this entire unit not lasting but three months before wearing hole in screen and locking up shaver - this unit has a much lighter feel to it but shaves just as well - as long as cutter/screens last more than three months all will be good</li>
    <li> A good razor at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> great price for a great razor! does what its supposed to! boyfriend loved it and he normally uses norcola ( or however you spell the more expensive one ) lol</li>
    <li> The great: shaver is good. Blades do a great job.Better shaving than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: battery life is as expected, 45 minutesof great performance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: pop up trimmer is useless.</li>
    <li> Shaves nicely and the price is right. I have owned several Norelco products and one previous Remmington. This model is vastly better than my older Remmington and better than the Norelco&#x27;s I have owned, though the Norelco shavers were at least purchased 5 to 10 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest motivation for me to try this Remmington was the price. You can purchase several before approaching the price of one Norelco.</li>
    <li> nothing to bad to say</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for... close shave...long battery life...easy to clean.</li>
    <li> The males in our family are extremely picky about razors.  This Remington razor is very nice, easy and comfortable to hold and provides a quick shave.  After the initial charge of 24 hours, the battery lasts for up to 50 minutes without having to recharge, which is a big plus.  Gives a close shave, although not as close as other razors they&#x27;ve used.  But adequate.  After shaving, the unit is easily cleaned by running it under the faucet, very easy.  Overall, a nice product, gets the job done, although not as completely as other brands tried.</li>
    <li> Battery on this thing lasts forever, used it for two weeks before it needed charged again...The head is no different then the cheaper models, it does the job just fine.. The battery life is the seller on this one, so if your looking for a razor that you dont need to charge all the time look no further...</li>
    <li> This actually works. I&#x27;ve bought several shavers for women and they wouldn&#x27;t cut hot butter.</li>
    <li> Excellent product very pleased and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Excellent product imo, works great and I&#x27;ve had many shavers, mostly Norelco and like this better, fast 2 day shipping, highly recommended product and seller.  (Just don&#x27;t drop it.  I broke a previous similar model one when the parts scattered after a drop.  I might buy a case for this one and will certainly be more careful).</li>
    <li> Love the product and will order again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> in my opinion the motor does not spin fast enough.If i havn&#x27;t shaved in two or three days it pulls my whiskers out by the root. my remington foil razor works much better.</li>
    <li> Remington used to make very good razors, but their quality and effectiveness has declined over the years.</li>
    <li> It sucks, it gets clogged easy, and the blades yank the hairs out versus cutting them. The trimmer can&#x27;t be washed with water and it gets clogged really fast. To be honest it doesn&#x27;t satisfy me, and when I went to the website, the 30 day money back guarantee link that is printed on the box doesn&#x27;t work! What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s favorite shaver that I&#x27;ve bought him so far.</li>
    <li> I was given this to test for my son for an honest review and he loves it. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Ok for legs, nothing else.  Pulled skin .</li>
    <li> Good shave.  Holds a charge a long time.</li>
    <li> Used this for a while now, it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my old Remington. Charges quick and cleans easy.</li>
    <li> Cuts well now after 2weeks of use there is a clicking sound coming from moror</li>
    <li> ESPERANDO POR COURRIER</li>
    <li> It does have a long battery, but once again, this household won&#x27;t be changing from hand razors to electric razors. It just doesn&#x27;t have a close enough shave, the hubby used it and could still feel the stubble. I used it and it actually caught my hairs and pulled them and gave me a rash, but this seems to me to be par for the course for electric razors so I can&#x27;t really fault this one over another.&lt;br /&gt; If you like electric razors, I think that this may be what it claims that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3, we&#x27;re just not electric shaver fans I guess.</li>
    <li> This thing works pretty well.  It gives a better shave than my old electric razor (just because that one is worn out, it worked as well when new).  My old Norelco has a slightly more solid feel but this Remington seems solid enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like:&lt;br /&gt;It works...hair removed from face...occasional slight chafing/razor burn for me but nothing to complain about&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts me a week or so of once daily use.  The little pop out trimmer on the back seems fine too.  I occasionally use it to clean up around my sideburn area if I have waited too long for a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislike:&lt;br /&gt;This model won&#x27;t shave when plugged in.  That means that when the batteries can&#x27;t hold a charge this thing is toast.  I used my old Norelco for years after the batteries couldn&#x27;t hold a charge long enough to get through a shave by plugging it in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the lights blink when the charge is getting low but I didn&#x27;t notice and had a dead shaver one morning.  Fortunately I still have my old shaver laying around so I plugged it in and got ready for work.  A beep or something noticeable would be nice (I am not real coherent in the morning).  My current strategy is to plug it in weekly on Sunday night to make sure it is ready for the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;It works, if the price is right and you are ok with my dislikes listed above then this thing should work for you</li>
    <li> My husband tried it and then I tried it as he wasn&#x27;t real thrilled with it.  He has an average beard and normally does not have a problem getting a close shave, but he did have with this Remington.  He had to go over certain areas more than once and in his world, that&#x27;s just a waste of time. That fact in itself made him just put it on the shelf for such time as he needs a shaver and there is nothing else readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my legs and I know this is for a man&#x27;s face and beard, etc., but most shavers will also work on a gal&#x27;s legs.  Not so much this Remington.  I had to go over and over areas and I could still see and feel stubble and my hair growth is not what it was when I was younger, so it&#x27;s not that big of a deal for me to shave my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be a great starter shaver or a shaver for someone with a light beard and not heavy growth.  It holds the charge well, but if most of that charge is used by going over and over an area to get a better and closer shave, then perhaps another shaver would be more appropriate.</li>
    <li> I have lupus and cannot use a regular blade shaver on my legs because of inflammation, so I am reviewing this from a female-standpoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this does indeed shave closely, and the charge is held long enough for me to do legs (that&#x27;s a lot longer than your face, guys) and gets the fine hairs (I have blonde leg hair) without catching or missing.  I like how the heads conform to my leg.  I have used more expensive shavers on my legs and find that this works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely does not have the look or feel of my boyfriend&#x27;s high-end razors, so if you&#x27;re looking for a $600 shaver in this, you&#x27;re going to be disappointed. There is no cleaning mechanism beyond rinsing in the sink.  It isn&#x27;t as precise.  But for the price, it&#x27;s a great deal, and keeps me from having hairy or rashy legs ;)</li>
    <li> Took a 10-day trip and did not charge it once, yet used it every day. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Compared to the old Remington this one does not measure up. Found it harder to shave since the entire top pivots not just each individual head. Is extremely light. Was allot more difficult to shave with than my old Remington. Just seemed cheep. Spend a little more, and jet something better built... Returned to Amazon to get something else...</li>
    <li> Bought them for grandsons for Christmas.  Sure they will like them.</li>
    <li> Works as good as my Norelco for a lot less money.</li>
    <li> It does a good job and it is a good price. Shipping was good and order process was painless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really owned a 100.00 electric shaver. I pay between 20.00 to 35.00 for an electric shaver. I can&#x27;t honestly compare this shaver with a hundred dollar one. All I know that this one shaves my face and sideburns real well. On this premis I am again a happy camper for the price I paid and the product I received. ......</li>
    <li> seems underpowered  still shaves very well</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had a razor that had a cord/was required to be plugged in, but this one, although being a Remington as well, just seems to underperform the other one in regards to a close shave. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the head or not, but I will definitely be buying a different shaver in the future.</li>
    <li> Never bought Remington cause I head Norelco was better and they are good, but Norelco has a short crappy battery life and the &amp;#34;water-proofing&amp;#34; seals and the soldered in battery making it a wasteful purchase.  So tried my Remington and on one charge with this lithium ion battery, it is still going strong weeks later and gives a nice close shave too.  The wobbly head moves around along with individual head movement, but seems to work just fine and glad I made the switch.  Lithium ion seems the way to go.  Will assess again later to determine longevity.</li>
