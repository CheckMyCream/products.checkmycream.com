      <li>It does a great job of smoothing you hair and bringing out its natural oils.  </li>
      <li>My hair is so silky smooth, and I have fallen in love</li>
      <li>Really feels good on the scalp and distributed the oil throughout the hair.</li>

      <li>Feels so good on my scalp, and really does the job detangling and promoting shine.</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great brush :)</li>
      <li>This brush has a good feel in your hand and works really well to distribute sebum, the nylon quills stimulate your scalp and help to smooth your hair.</li>
      <li>I just ordered two Spornettes own one already, this was my first Denman.</li>
      <li>My son&#x27;s fine hair collects food and grease (he&#x27;s a toddler)</li>
      <li>My fine hair appears to be fuller.</li>
      <li>cause I&#x27;m a huge greaseball)</li>
      <li>This is considered a grooming brush and it does smooth the hair.</li>
      <li>and when I want to smooth my edges this works wonders.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this brush.</li>
      <li>Detangles and smooth&#x27;s my hair with no damage.</li>
      <li>I mostly use it right before</li>
      <li>Disperses skin&#x27;s natural oils throughout coat, making it shiny and look very healthy.  </li>
      <li>Although I would prefer the Mason Pearson original, it&#x27;s price is forbidding.  </li>
      <li>The brush takes care of knots with minimal tears, smooths her hair to a high gloss and makes us both happy!  </li>
      <li>But that would be true of all bristle brushes.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t look like much, but it is hands down the BEST brush I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>and EVERYBODY said that it was a wonderful bristle brush to use on your hair &amp; that when brushing it really got to the scalp of your hair and distributed the oils down the strands of your hair.</li>
      <li>I trust the Denman quality so this is just a great as our other Denman brushes.</li>
      <li>its good to use a boar bristle brush after you wrap your hair with a comb or my 9 row Denman to lay it down more &amp; I came across this particular Denman bristle brush.</li>
      <li>The Denman Medium Natural Bristle Brush is like magic.</li>
      <li>Worth the $$</li>
      <li>I have a naturally rather itchy scalp and this brush is great at sating that urge without actually scratching my scalp with my nails.</li>
      <li>It is probably worth the $15-20 that you spend</li>
      <li>I made the right choice to purchase two of the brushes.  </li>
      <li>It is my absolute favorite and it was time to get a new one.  </li>
      <li>After a few passes with this brush, there is some static, but once I run my hand through my hair, the static dissipates.</li>
      <li>The boar bristles are great for moving your natural oils and sebum down the hair and overall is pretty nice for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on the hair, so</li>
      <li>This one works great for styling but should not be used directly on the scalp like the other one.</li>
      <li>I still have my GOODY brush that my mom use to use on my hair when I was a little girl at the age of 10 &amp; that brush still works really good on my hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this to replace a similar item but the bristles don&#x27;t really work for my curly hair, it seems.</li>
    <li> almost identical to my mason pearson</li>
    <li> This brush grabs the hair nicely and helps to straighten it .  I would recommend it.  Although I don&#x27;t love it</li>
    <li> Average brush.  Does not penetrate the scalp as well as I thought it would.  Creates a lot of static.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for years.  I&#x27;ve used others but always come back to this one.  It is my absolute favorite and it was time to get a new one.  It just fits perfectly in my hand and the bristles are just right.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It really does brush hair without breaking it!</li>
    <li> We have two of these in our house - one for my girls and one for me. Works best for us for detangling dry hair. We use a different Denman for wet hair styling. Love them! They hold up great.</li>
    <li> Wish I would have purchased sooner. Really feels good on the scalp and distributed the oil throughout the hair. Great produtct.</li>
    <li> Many people tak about the Mason Pearson brushes, which I have never tried, but always wanted one.  I thought nothing could compare.  This was an amazing surprise!  I have very thin and fine hair and my hair has been falling out a lot more lately.  This brush really has saved my sanity.  It massages my scalp nicely and leaves my hair feeling thicker and softer.  I do see if you have super thick hair, it maybe a little bit difficult to get through.  For me it&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I am a guy and my hair is absolutely ridiculous. Humidity makes it poof up and its natural waviness turns into chaos after sweat or a shower. The Denman Medium Natural Bristle Brush is like magic. It only takes two or three strokes and my hair is basically tamed. I have owned many brushes in the past and this is by far my favorite. I even had to buy my girlfriend one because she kept stealing mine.</li>
    <li> It looks made with too much plastic, it has not a good look, Denman could improve it. But the good thing is this brush works</li>
    <li> Much better than other brushes.  I have thick, slightly wavy, hair.  It does a great job with the shine.  However, be aware that when you have thick hair, it doesn&#x27;t go all the way to the scalp when you brush.  But that would be true of all bristle brushes.  I would recommend this brush over all other.  Denman does a good job.  The natural bristle makes all the difference.</li>
    <li> I needed a boar bristle brush to help spread the natural oils produced by the scalp and this brush did the trick. My hair is now softer and than before. The only thing is this brush is not meant to be used to get out tangles. I used a paddle brush first then this one and the combination of the two is perfect for my hair.</li>
    <li> Did not like sharp nylon quills, and returned one brush, but this is fine for me. I have straight hair, may not be good for curly.</li>
    <li> The brush is well made and constructed but the bristles are too harsh for anyone in my family to use or enjoy.</li>
    <li> I wish the bristles were a little harder, and that the plastic ones were a little longer. My daughter has a thick head of hair, and I sometimes feel this brush doesn&#x27;t reach all the way through to get all the knots in the middle. With a few extra passes, though, you get a beautiful shiny result, and it&#x27;s fairly gentle on the scalp and doesn&#x27;t pull too hard on knots.</li>
    <li> I read about this brand in a book as a cheaper alternative to more expensive options. I have thick hair and wasn&#x27;t sure how this would do, but I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest brush ever like some say.  It is probably worth the $15-20 that you spend but it is far from the higher dollar ones.</li>
    <li> Nice brush at a good price. Seems to treat my hair gently. Now looking for a round boar bristle brush at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great brush. I find that brushing with my head down. This brush has a good feel in your hand and works really well to distribute sebum, the nylon quills stimulate your scalp and help to smooth your hair. I am really into the boar bristle type brushes.  I just ordered two Spornettes own one already, this was my first Denman. It does not disappoint. Brushing my hair has become an almost nightly calming routine. So relaxing and beneficial with a boar bristle brush!! I want to buy a bunch of different ones to compare now.</li>
    <li> I have long hair that tangles easily. I keep this in my purse for grooming during the day, and I love it. Feels so good on my scalp, and really does the job detangling and promoting shine. LOVE.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to other bristle brushed for grooming short haired breeds of dogs.  Disperses skin&#x27;s natural oils throughout coat, making it shiny and look very healthy.  Got one for myself as an alternative to mason pearson&#x27;s insanely expensive boar bristle brush.  Like it, but will mainly use this brush for grooming dogs.</li>
    <li> Had to spend a lot of time like other reviews clipping the nylon parts (used a nail clippers), but after that its a good value overall.</li>
    <li> needs a few more brushes for my thick hair, but i do love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m natural, between 4b-4c hair type ---very kinky hair, this brush handles my hair well and when I want to smooth my edges this works wonders. Its not too hard or too soft, its right in between. Overall it&#x27;s a great brush :)</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product.  Although I would prefer the Mason Pearson original, it&#x27;s price is forbidding.  This is a rather good substitute.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like much, but it is hands down the BEST brush I have ever used.  I have very long, thick, but very very fine hair, and this brush gets through it and removes tangles without ripping it out of my head, or causing loads of breakage.  I&#x27;m baffled as to why every brush I find in most stores has plastic bristles with no give, when every time I try to use those, they rips my hair to pieces.  Now that I&#x27;ve used this, I don&#x27;t think I will ever use anything else.</li>
    <li> Works well on my daughters tangles, no tears</li>
    <li> I have a naturally rather itchy scalp and this brush is great at sating that urge without actually scratching my scalp with my nails. The boar bristles are great for moving your natural oils and sebum down the hair and overall is pretty nice for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However by the time I&#x27;m done brushing out my hair my scalp has had about all it can take of the bristles and I rather wish I had gotten the one without it. If you have a sensitive scalp this is not for you!</li>
    <li> Great hair brush, great price. I have fine hair, long, and a sensitive scalp but don&#x27;t find this uncomfortable to use. I love the feeling that it goes through my hair to the scalp. I don&#x27;t use it to detangle, as I use another brush for detangling.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I purchased this brush for my hair, it really feels good against my scalp. I still have my GOODY brush that my mom use to use on my hair when I was a little girl at the age of 10 &amp; that brush still works really good on my hair but it is a small one that is really good for my edges when I want to slick them down and put my hair in a bun or ponytail. However, I purchased the regular 9 row Denman brush that I would see in MANY of the YouTube videos from Sally&#x27;s when I was looking at brushes and I was happy that they had it, I needed a brush that didnt have those small ball things on the end of them but after awhile they came off and started SNAGGING my dang hair making it painful to use my brush so I needed to buy me a new one that was not a bristle brush and that&#x27;s how I got my current Denman 9 row brush. When I received that one I was so happy because it didn&#x27;t have those dang balls on them that would fall off after awhile when your not paying attention or noticing them. Anyways, I was online looking at other brushes with bristles because I wrap my hair at night and its good to use a boar bristle brush after you wrap your hair with a comb or my 9 row Denman to lay it down more &amp; I came across this particular Denman bristle brush. I saw EVERY review as a good one on here and another website and EVERYBODY said that it was a wonderful bristle brush to use on your hair &amp; that when brushing it really got to the scalp of your hair and distributed the oils down the strands of your hair. I thought that would be great because I am 100% natural with 4A hair and my hair is long dang near ARMPIT length so I choose this medium one instead of the large one since my hair is past my shoulders but not brastrap length as of yet. The seller has very fast shipping because I received it in my mailbox the very next day after ordering it here online and I don&#x27;t have Amazon Prime so I thought that was really good, soon as I opened it I brushed my hair back fixing the flyaways that my current ponytail had and it felt wonderful. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase and I love BOTH of my Denman Brushes, they were both around $15 but I have no problem paying that price for a brush that is going to work great on my beautiful hair strands.ays that my current ponytail had and it felt wonderful. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase and I love BOTH of my Denman Brushes, they were both around $15 but I have no problem paying that price for a brush that is going to work great on my beautiful hair strands.</li>
    <li> After seeing my mother&#x27;s Mason Pearson brush, I knew I wanted one. When I found out the price, I gave up... until I found this. It&#x27;s as close as you could ever wish to get, and it comes in at about a tenth of the cost.</li>
    <li> It does a great job of smoothing you hair and bringing out its natural oils.  The bristles are shorter so it doesn&#x27;t get all the way through thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush with little to no expectations, I really just wanted to improve my hair care regement. My hair is so silky smooth, and I have fallen in love</li>
    <li> I prefer the similar brush without the porcupine bristles.This one works great for styling but should not be used directly on the scalp like the other one. Great for extensions though. It detangles and smoothes without too much tension.</li>
    <li> Great product at less than half the price of local stores!</li>
    <li> This is the best brush for great lengths extensions. It is a lot cheaper than the GL brush also and just as nice.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush. Really like the texture and strength. Very good mixture of bristles.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my young daughter (6) who has very long fine hair and so many tangles.  Brushing her hair before was always an iffy proposition.  The brush takes care of knots with minimal tears, smooths her hair to a high gloss and makes us both happy!  It seems to be very high quality for the price, although the black plastic is a little flimsier than I would like.  The boar bristles are plentiful and seem to be firmly in place.  I have another high end English detangling brush that cost 7 times as much--I&#x27;ve had it for 11 years and I absolutely love it.  But for so much less, this really isn&#x27;t a bad comparison, so  I would definitely recommend this brush--oh, and it&#x27;s made in the U.K.!</li>
    <li> First bought this brush when traveling in Europe. I had forgotten my hairbrush and bought a Denman to make it through the trip. When the handle cracked recently, I went to the internet immediately to find a replacement. Nice brush, great value!</li>
    <li> I have coarse hair and have had trouble finding a brush that works my strands well. This brush does the trick.</li>
    <li> Perfect brush! Detangles and smooth&#x27;s my hair with no damage. Best brush I ever bought. I&#x27;ve been buying this brush for years and would never change.</li>
    <li> I had to smooth down the tips of the nylon and clip some extra long boars, but otherwise it&#x27;s a great brush.  My son&#x27;s fine hair collects food and grease (he&#x27;s a toddler) and this takes care of it without hurting him on the snags, and also makes my no-poo hair look great.</li>
    <li> This brush seems to work pretty good on my granddaugthers&#x27; hair.  They have 3 hair types, thick/long (a little below shoulder length ~ 9 yr old),  fine/long (middle of back ~ 8 yr old) and sorta thick/ long (middle of back ~ 3 yr old).  Works good on all three.  Gave it 4.0 rating because of some loose bristles.  Otherwise a 5 Star rating just because  it can brush my Sweeties&#x27;  hair.  A miraculous feat in itself!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this brush. The long nylon quills were startling in the beginning but now they are a pleasant massage everytime I brush my hair. It really does distribute oil very well. I used to wash my hair every other day (and definitely not getting away with it cause I&#x27;m a huge greaseball) but now I can wash my hair twice weekly and its not too shabby. I have thick, stick straight Asian hair and I don&#x27;t think that the plain natural bristle brush would have reached my scalp.</li>
    <li> Built to last as they say but the handle on the med is way too small. There is plenty of boar but the nylon is higher than the boar so does not penetrate thick hair and the handle made my hand VERY tired. Spornette Luxury is better for thick hair and feels nice brushing...but not built to last and made in china.</li>
    <li> I bought this with a black 7-row Denman because hair brushes at home are always lost. I trust the Denman quality so this is just a great as our other Denman brushes. Great for styling after showers.</li>
    <li> my hair isn&#x27;t that long yet, but I can imagine when it does, the handle may be a tad short.</li>
    <li> This is a quality hair brush and it really made my hair feel so soft and shine. I try many different bristle hair brushes but this one has the best results.</li>
    <li> I wanted a soft brush for my daughter but this one just brushes lightly over the top layer of hair, not good for overall brushing..She likes it cause it&#x27;s so soft but the brush leaves all the tangles underneath</li>
    <li> I bought this items based on other reviews. I have very long hair and the ends tend to dry out quickly, looking very damaged. This brush is great for distributing oil from my scalp all the way to my ends, keeping them moisturized and healthy. I mostly use it right before I shower. I couldn&#x27;t use it as an everyday brush, too frizzy for my thick long hair.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Product just as described</li>
    <li> From my research, this is considered one of the more highly regarded brushes by stylists (while also being affordable to non-professionals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I docked one star not for quality but for the fact that the nylon bristles used for extra control are uncomfortably stiff on my scalp. I really need to use a light touch to not feel like I&#x27;m cutting my head open. However, I&#x27;m used to fiber bristle brushes, so I am open to the idea that I just need to get accustomed to it.</li>
    <li> This is a solid brush. Works well on my thick hair. My mother tried it (she has thin hair) and disliked it because of the nylon bristles.</li>
    <li> Just like the Mason Pearson but cheaper! Worth the $$</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start with the basics because Amazon doesn&#x27;t have a complete description of this brush. First of all, this is the Denman D81M Medium Porcupine Brush. The dimensions of the brush are Length: 8.5&amp;#34;, Diameter: 2.35&amp;#34;. The brush is made out of a medium weight black plastic with a red rubber cushion base that holds both natural and nylon bristles. Denman&#x27;s website calls the natural bristles just that...&amp;#34;natural bristles&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t know if they are boar&#x27;s bristles or not. The feel like boar&#x27;s bristles but I haven&#x27;t found a description either on the brush packaging or the insert that says if they are or not. What you don&#x27;t see in the photograph is in the center of each cluster of natural bristles there is a &amp;#34;porcupine&amp;#34; nylon bristle that sticks up a quarter of an inch above the natural bristles.  That being said, this is the most important part of any hair product review: my hair is fine texture but very thick. It also has a recent keratin treatment on it. I wear it straight and it&#x27;s shoulder length. The nylon&amp;#34; porcupine&amp;#34; bristles just make it through my hair. Anyone with thicker, coarser or curlier hair probably won&#x27;t fare as well. People with thinner hair may be bothered by the nylon &amp;#34;porcupine&amp;#34; bristles that stick a quarter of an inch above the natural bristles. The nylon &amp;#34;porcupine&amp;#34; bristles can be easily trimmed with a pair of scissors to the natural bristle length if necessary. Since I have a keratin treatment on my hair, static is reduced drastically. After a few passes with this brush, there is some static, but once I run my hand through my hair, the static dissipates. This is considered a grooming brush and it does smooth the hair. It&#x27;s perfect for doing updos or styling your hair in a straight, sleek finish. To give an example, my hair was styled and set this morning with curls and a heavy amount of hairspray. I was able to brush the spray out this evening and wear my hair straight after a quick flat iron. This brush removed that heavy hairspray residue after a few passes. Since the natural bristles in this brush remove residue and help distribute the oils from your scalp throughout your hair, this is a brush you need to clean every other week depending on the oiliness of your hair. Cleaning consists of a mild soap and warm water. Personally I like to use a pea-sized dab of shampoo to clean my brushes. This is not a brush to you blow dry your hair with or use on wet hair. It&#x27;s strictly for dry hair and for smoothing. It&#x27;s very gentle on the hair, so if you have previous damage, this will not tear your hair out.rush removed that heavy hairspray residue after a few passes.

    <li> Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t buy something so mundane as a hair-brush online, but finding myself unable to locate a store that sells them, I resorted to an online purchase (no complaints here, as I buy many things online). The brush is a replacement for a decade-old one that became my favorite, but was falling apart due to old age. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, and look forward to another decade of enjoyable brushing!</li>
    <li> I made the right choice to purchase two of the brushes.  They are one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Nice little brush!!!  It really takes the excess hairspray out of my hair that a regular brush doesn&#x27;t!  I do wish it had more of a curve in the paddle so as to have better contact with the scalp  : )</li>
    <li> Love this brush!! My fine hair appears to be fuller. Even coworkers have commented on the fullness of my hair and have asked me if I&#x27;m wearing extensions.</li>
    <li> The quality of this brush is nice but it will not reach my scalp.  I have medium to thick wavy hair that is short and layered.  The bristles do not go thru all of my hair regardless of how firm I brush.</li>
