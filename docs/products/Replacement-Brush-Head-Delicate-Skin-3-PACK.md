      <li>The price is good, and the ship is fast.  </li>

      <li>Snaps in easily.</li>
      <li>and it works fine</li>
      <li>It works fine but the others do not turn.</li>
      <li>They fit the mia unit fine.</li>
      <li>and I can tell a HUGE difference.</li>
      <li>Great brushes that fit the same at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
      <li>Seems to fit and click on</li>
      <li>The brush head looks cheaply made and all 3 do not work on my Mia.</li>
      <li>skin care is the one thing I won&#x27;t go cheap on anymore.</li>
      <li>I bought these in order to avoid blowing $27 on one of  the original clarasonic brush head for my Mia 2, now I&#x27;m kind of wishing I would have just shelved out the money for the real thing.</li>
      <li>So much money saved!!!</li>
      <li>FAST Shipping!!!</li>
      <li>Bought these to replace original brush.  </li>
      <li>I recently bought my Clarisonic this Summer, and it came with the &amp;#34;Normal&amp;#34; heads, but I also got a &amp;#34;Deep Pore&amp;#34; one, and I LOVED the way the changed my skin.</li>
      <li>Glad I can spend less on these and still get good quality.</li>
      <li>These replacement brushes work very well and I am happy with the purchase especially seeing as they are a fraction of the brand name cost.  </li>
      <li>They showed up quickly and were everything I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>They do an adequate job</li>
      <li>A little easy to pop off but much better than struggling to get them off &amp; well worth the savings!!!</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!!</li>
      <li>* in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;wouldve been happier spending almost same amt on 1 Real, functional brush with full head Working parts</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it for the price.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used one brush, but it works great.  </li>
      <li>My item came on time and so far I love them.  </li>
      <li>Totally worth it.</li>
      <li>They are exactly as described and a fraction of the cost of just 1 Clarisonic replacement brush in the stores.  </li>
      <li>I do not recommend unless you&#x27;re willing to risk the money.</li>
      <li>Exactly like Clairisonic.  </li>
      <li>Pay the $$ for the real thing !</li>
      <li>The brush heads smell funny after about one week</li>
      <li>This was just as good as the more expensive ones.</li>
      <li>, when I got them in the mail, I was at first worried they wouldn&#x27;t fit my Mia 2, but they definitely do.</li>
      <li>but I can certainly tell the difference and how effectively it works on my skin because I don&#x27;t get that polished deep down clean fleeing on my face.</li>
      <li>These brush heads have very flimsy bristles, so they don&#x27;t transfer the Clarisonic&#x27;s vibration to my skin at all.</li>
      <li>These worked really well with my Clarisonic device.</li>
      <li>it was very god,on time,god product .</li>
      <li>They look just like the real deal.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>The bristles seem very synthetic and plastic feeling.</li>
      <li>Didnt fit the same in my Mia either.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than the official replacements.  </li>
      <li>I bought this extra set for my son as he has several acne issues on his face back and shoulders so all there in this combo pack is great idea.  </li>
      <li>These 3 brush heads &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; like the real thing, but they are not close.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend product!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfectly match my mia2, and a lot more cheaper than the original one. Love it! I have already reordered and recommended to my friends.</li>
    <li> Love them. A little easy to pop off but much better than struggling to get them off &amp; well worth the savings!!!</li>
    <li> To being with yeah I thought it was the same but after looking at them side by side these two are nothing alike. The one on the Mia is the orginal. The one in my hand is the generic. These two look, feel, cost, and act different on your skin. Didnt fit the same in my Mia either. The generic looked used when I got it. The Clarisonic brush may actually be used but at least the brush isnt fluffy!</li>
    <li> Great deal. Definitely fits my Clarasonic</li>
    <li> Love the brushes. They fit my Mia perfect. Glad I can spend less on these and still get good quality.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are absolutely awesome. I was very hesitant to buys these for my clarion ice Mia 2 because I was always told not to use generic brush heads with it. The problem was that one brush head was $30 and That is rediculas price to pay just to replace in another 30-90 days. Long story short, I didn&#x27;t have $30 this time and opted for these beauties. They look just like the real deal. I couldn&#x27;t even tell the difference when inspecting them side by side. I will buy these everything now!! So much money saved!!!</li>
    <li> did not get 3 different brush heads....got all of the same ones</li>
    <li> Just as good as the Clarisonic brand!</li>
    <li> Just as described! Fast delivery!!</li>
    <li> My item came on time and so far I love them.  The product fits perfect and works as expected.</li>
    <li> These replacement brushes work very well and I am happy with the purchase especially seeing as they are a fraction of the brand name cost.  One complaint - I don&#x27;t know which one is which - as there is nothing to identify them.  That doesn&#x27;t seem to matter for me, as I use this every day and a brush is a brush for me.  But I&#x27;m pleased with the product otherwise.</li>
    <li> Have purchased this brand before only in all normal brushes. Wanted the variety of different brushes w/o the cost of each individually from Clairsonic. Work great, fit perfect can&#x27;t see or feel any difference from the Mfgs brand. I&#x27;m impressed. Obvious repurchase for me.</li>
    <li> Great Product and Price!  FAST Shipping!!!</li>
    <li> The bristles seem very synthetic and plastic feeling. Feels like it is scratching my face when I use any one of them.</li>
    <li> Great bargain as opposed to buying the official brush heads! Works just as well as far as I can tell.</li>
    <li> These 3 brush heads &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; like the real thing, but they are not close. The brush head looks cheaply made and all 3 do not work on my Mia. They won&#x27;t spin or vibrate. I thought I was doing something wrong and I tried several times with all 3, just won&#x27;t work. There are gaps in the brushes and my original heads had tightly packed bristles.  I asked for a refund and they politely responded.</li>
    <li> I have used my Clarisonic for 2 years and have never changed the brush head-seemed to be working well. I bought the variety pack so I could try all 3 heads. I have only used the black, sensitive brush head so far and I can tell a HUGE difference. My skin is actually a little red from using it a few times. Definitely worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> This was just as good as the more expensive ones. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Personally I can&#x27;t tell a difference between this and the Clarisonic brand. That being said, save yourself some coin and go generic.</li>
    <li> These fit my Mia perfectly! They showed up quickly and were everything I was hoping for. Great service. Thank you.</li>
    <li> these brush heads are great. They are super soft and fit my mia 2 perfectly. Will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I bought these in order to avoid blowing $27 on one of  the original clarasonic brush head for my Mia 2, now I&#x27;m kind of wishing I would have just shelved out the money for the real thing. These brush heads aren&#x27;t awful but I can certainly tell the difference and how effectively it works on my skin because I don&#x27;t get that polished deep down clean fleeing on my face.Aside from that it seems that the outer rim of the brush head is a bit too snug on my Mia 2 and makes an awful loud noise when i turned it on almost like it was forcing the motor/vibration work harder so to avoid ruining it I just popped out he middle part and have just been using that and it works fine but like I said its NOT the same. I will continue using these brushes or at least the middle part until i&#x27;m done because I hate to waste money but once i&#x27;m done with this set I will bite the bullet gladly and just buy the original</li>
    <li> Seems to be the same quality as the original.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy again.  Save money and buy these.</li>
    <li> I mean, they look similar, and they fit just fine into my Mia 2, but nope, nope, and nope! The bristles are noticeably thinner and weaker. when you scrub your face, it almost burns because the fibers in the bristles prickle your skin in an uncomfortable way. Not worth the pain because in the end, the clean is nowhere near the originals!</li>
    <li> Bought these to replace original brush.  So far they are great, do not notice any difference.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and received only 2 of them! The normal and the deep pore varieties! how come?!?!</li>
    <li> so far it seems the same/very similar...</li>
    <li> have been using the clarisonic for about 6 months. obsessed with it. tried to save some money by ordering these knock offs. broke out like a teenager that same week. now back to the expensive brand name and skin is clear again. thumbs down.</li>
    <li> The brushes are wonderful for any type of skin.  I have sensitive skin but all of them are designed to be affective for any type of skin and any daily cleaning regimen.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are nothing like the brush head that came with my Clarisonic scrubber. These brush heads have very flimsy bristles, so they don&#x27;t transfer the Clarisonic&#x27;s vibration to my skin at all. Total waste of my money, will be buying the real thing next time.</li>
    <li> Received all three in the mail on time. However, only one of the three worked in my Mia 2... very disappointed with this purchase. I do not recommend unless you&#x27;re willing to risk the money.</li>
    <li> Great product exactly what my wife was looking for</li>
    <li> just as good as the name brand</li>
    <li> Work just like the expensive brand name replacements! I will definitely be ordering these in the future!</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly on my mia! Highly recommend product!</li>
    <li> I can not really say if I like this product or not. I purchased it with the hopes of getting a variety of facial cleaning option. The product description stated &amp;#34; Normal Generic Replacement Brush&amp;#34;, so with that description I thought it would fit my facial cleanser but it does not fit so I have an unusable product. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than the official replacements.  Would buy these again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed because the only one that worked was the sensitive skin one. It works fine but the others do not turn. I might try another brand.</li>
    <li> JUNK. Did not work at all</li>
    <li> Love them.  They are exactly as described and a fraction of the cost of just 1 Clarisonic replacement brush in the stores.  They get the job done.</li>
    <li> Great price for all three.</li>
    <li> These work great with my brush and the price is great.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 3 pack from USA Big Deals, fulfilled by Amazon. I am not sure why, but when I put one of the brush heads on my Clarisonic it simply would not &amp;#34;vibrate&amp;#34; like it normally does. I don&#x27;t think these brush heads click into the slots correctly. I suspected perhaps my Clarisonic was broken, but I had one more genuine replacement head left and as soon as I put that on it functioned as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only speak for the products coming from the seller I mentioned, so it&#x27;s possible other sellers are selling brush heads that work. I can confirm that the one from USA Big Deals definitely do not.</li>
    <li> There is definitely a difference between these brushes and the name brand brushes.  These are way too soft to have any cleansing effect.  Another problem is that the cellophane bag containing the brushes was torn open and one of the brushes was missing.  However, they were so inexpensive to begin with that it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble of returning them and having a new order sent to me.</li>
    <li> These brush heads fit the Mia 2 perfectly! The quality is just as good as Clairisonic, too! I&#x27;ll be coming here to buy my brush heads from now on.</li>
    <li> So much more affordable and they fit my clarisonic perfectly!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as good as the original. I love them. I can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Fits my clarisonic  Mia perfectly, same as an official clarisonic brush head minus the price tag!</li>
    <li> Exactly like Clairisonic.  Very impressed.</li>
    <li> I bought this extra set for my son as he has several acne issues on his face back and shoulders so all there in this combo pack is great idea.  They fit the mia unit fine.</li>
    <li> These work Just as well and feel no different from the original brush on my mia2. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> it was very god,on time,god product .</li>
    <li> I bought these replacement brushes and am very happy with my purchase.  So far I&#x27;ve only used one brush, but it works great.  Instead of buying just 1 clarisonic brush from their website, I was able to buy three.  Great value!</li>
    <li> Great price!!! Fast delivery.  Product looks great.  I have only used the &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; replacement brush head so far.  They honestly feel nicer than the name brand ones.  I would purchase them again.</li>
    <li> These worked really well with my Clarisonic device. I wanted a backup set of brushes and GreenInSync makes a set that are a terrific value for the price. They do a great job and I especially love the Deep Pore brush. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Perfect for the clarisonic mia.</li>
    <li> Snaps in easily. Good quality &amp; works just as well as name brand brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;Good savings as well. Meets expectations.</li>
    <li> Deep Pore Brush don&#x27;t rotate. is nowhere near the originals! Not worth the pain because in the end, the clean</li>
    <li> Used with Mia 1 on nonsensitive skin. Seems to fit and click on ok...&lt;br /&gt;1.  The &amp;#34;outer circle&amp;#34; of brush does not move at all, while inner brush does vibrate. Same problem on 2 of the 3pack, did not try the 3rd head. Waste of $15.&lt;br /&gt;2. Left my skin SO irritated, dry and cracked peeling. My skin hardly ever responds to anything, even micdermabrsn and glycolic peels dont make me red. The brush is too rough/harsh but *NOT* in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;wouldve been happier spending almost same amt on 1 Real, functional brush with full head Working parts</li>
    <li> Terrible. Only outer layer bristles rotate. The bristles are very soft and really do not do much. Pay the $$ for the real thing !</li>
    <li> The brush heads smell funny after about one week</li>
    <li> good product great price</li>
    <li> They fit my mia 2, but would be nice if you included instructions on which color is for what.  The price is good, and the ship is fast.  I&#x27;ll see in the next month if the quality exceeds the price.</li>
    <li> Great brushes that fit the same at a fraction of the cost.  I won&#x27;t buy the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; ever again.</li>
    <li> They do an adequate job and it&#x27;s a good way to save $$.</li>
    <li> I recently bought my Clarisonic this Summer, and it came with the &amp;#34;Normal&amp;#34; heads, but I also got a &amp;#34;Deep Pore&amp;#34; one, and I LOVED the way the changed my skin. I have acne prone skin that I have acne scars all over since Junior Year of high school (I&#x27;m currently a freshman in college). And the way it lightened my scars and cleared my skin was amazing. But, as a broke college kid does, I saw these generic ones. And, of course, I was like SCORE. Cause aint nobody got time to buy $25 dollars on ONE Clarisonic head, when that&#x27;s 6 different meals at Cookout.&lt;br /&gt;So, when I got them in the mail, I was at first worried they wouldn&#x27;t fit my Mia 2, but they definitely do. Perfectly. However...this is the downside to generic skin care products. I&#x27;ve currently used these for 7 months, and they DO NOT work as well as the name brand ones. I know, I know. Nobody likes to read reviews like this. But my skin care has been everything to be within the past year. And these just have a different texture than the $25 ones.. they&#x27;re just longer bristles, which I feel doesn&#x27;t give me a deep enough clean. I hate saying this, but I would encourage you to not buy these and just save up for a Clarisonic one.There&#x27;s a reason they&#x27;re priced so high..skin care is the one thing I won&#x27;t go cheap on anymore. P.S. I use either the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser or the Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser. Both great cleansers for sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> these are just as good as the name brand - don&#x27;t spend your money on those, but these and save a ton!!</li>
    <li> Not as good as the originals, but does the job for $4!</li>
