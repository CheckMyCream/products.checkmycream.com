      <li>I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
      <li>I used this kind,  then switched to Rapid Lash.</li>
      <li>I received this product at a promotional discount in exchange for honest and unbiased feedback.</li>
      <li>Nice job and</li>
      <li>I got this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion, and I’ve got to say… It’s okay.</li>
      <li>Great product, easy to use and got great results  in a short time.</li>
      <li>I have been using it in conjunction with Latisse thinking that it will work better until one day</li>
      <li>surprisingly pleased with how drastic the results were</li>
      <li>but it doesnt hurt your eyes and in about a  month you will be satisfied.</li>
      <li>The add for FEG sounded really convincing, so I thought I would give it a shot.</li>
      <li>I love this product and have noticeably longer and fuller lashes.</li>
      <li>I have never lost that many eyelashes like that.  </li>
      <li>The results are greater.</li>
      <li>Love</li>
      <li>It was ok.</li>
      <li>Yeah, pretty amazing!</li>
      <li>And anyone who is using this and thinks it is great...try Rapidlash, you will see a better result.</li>
      <li>and this was definitely the best!  </li>
      <li>I looked at the ingredient list, and unless they didn&#x27;t list the ingredient that causes lash growth because it is a proprietary substance, wasn&#x27;t sure what makes it work.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>So far so good though!</li>
      <li>So far, so good!</li>
      <li>I was also nervous that it would cause some irritation, because I do tend to have more sensitive skin, but I have experienced no irritation what-so-ever.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>However, I think more detailed instructions would be helpful.</li>
      <li>a very mild</li>
      <li>I just received this product and I am super excited to try it!</li>
      <li>Then I tried FEG and I have to say I have noticed a huge improvement with my eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>my eyelashes are long and beautiful.  </li>
      <li>have used other brands in the past, and I believe that this one works the best-- as good as the prescription $100 kind.</li>
      <li>The instructions were easy to follow kind of like applying liquid eye liner but with that being said the first night I put too much and it got into my eyes and</li>
      <li>my lashes were falling out more and more frequently.</li>
      <li>It takes several weeks to see results, but I am very pleased that the eyelash enhancer is so easy to apply, and does not cause the itching and irritation that I experienced with other products.</li>
      <li>This really works and it is safe to use...</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth yet, but again I just started using it, so I&#x27;m not shocked there.</li>
      <li>Love the results, tried other products and results are incomparable!!  </li>
      <li>they are over the top long and more than</li>
      <li>this stuff really works!!</li>
      <li>Recieved item on time, reasonably priced and securely packed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than two weeks so far.</li>
      <li>Then here I was a couple of years later getting ready to go on a vacation where I wanted to look really good.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work, but must say I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>so fun.</li>
      <li>so dont be discouraged if you dont see them right away.</li>
      <li>and hopefully it will all be positive!</li>
      <li>and she likes it very much.</li>
      <li>I have only used this product a couple of times and it is super easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Used exactly as directed.  </li>
      <li>I dont really write reviews but this stuff works!</li>
      <li>so word of advice &amp;#62;&amp;#62; less really is more, After the sting wore off it was fine</li>
      <li>really works!</li>
      <li>I tried many serums to grow the lashes back</li>
      <li>Really works!</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>After hearing so much about this products from friends, just had to try it!</li>
      <li>In fact, they were very nice when I was younger, but since you age and start to fall apart, there’s no way I could keep my super luscious, black eyelashes forever.</li>
      <li>I cannot emphasize enough that as consumers we need to be VERY concerned with products coming out of China and focus more on FDA approved products from the USA.</li>
      <li>Will buy as long as I can :)</li>
      <li>Have not noticed much difference but also have not used it consistently every night since it sometimes makes my eyes itch.</li>
      <li>so you do not get to much on your lash line that might run into your eyes.</li>
      <li>I use this more as repair for my lashes, not really for longer fuller lashes...</li>
      <li>and it really does seem to be making my eyelashes thicker as well as my eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really think this works that</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>But it seems like my eyelash is really stronger than before.</li>
      <li>I had gotten to where I really didn&#x27;t have any eyelashes to speak of, even to the point of</li>
      <li>This product really works, and I have used three bottles now.</li>
      <li>This eyelash enhancer serum is really working.</li>
      <li>so I sort of gave up hope of ever having real eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference.</li>
      <li>I now can&#x27;t wait to see them really grow even longer.</li>
      <li>However, you could try this product and it is much cheaper.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and will be a lifelong customer!</li>
      <li>I’ll try to be a little more careful, but I’ll be sure to update my review if that becomes the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ran across this FEG which costs about $20 less, but I saw a very noticeable difference within 4 weeks but even more after 6 weeks.  </li>
      <li>My lashes were no longer maintaining the new growth from before, but were reverting back to their original state, before ever using the product.  </li>
      <li>I would have liked to had the increased length with the added thickness, but at least one of the two is taking place, so I can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
      <li>I AM ONLY GIVING THIS PRODUCT A TWO STAR RATING BECAUSE IT WAS SHIPPED QUICKLY.</li>
      <li>I have been using the serum for a few weeks and so far I have seen some steady growth, I damaged my lashes by wearing fakes and was told that I had taking out some of my own lashes while taking out the fakes, which is the reason for me trying this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this because I ran out of Rapidlash. I have used it for about two weeks now and my eyelashes have just now started falling OUT!  2 days ago, 7 eyelashes fell out of my left eye and 4 out of my right eye.  Since then a couple here and there. And yes I counted them because I freaked out. Needless to say, I ordered another bottle of Rapidlash ASAP!  Stay away if you are thinking about switching to a cheaper brand. This sucks! I have never lost that many eyelashes like that.  I literally had to get my eyelash/eyebrow brush to get them all off. And anyone who is using this and thinks it is great...try Rapidlash, you will see a better result.</li>
    <li> What can I say, ladies, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying to both upper and lower and have seen a dramatic increase in my lashes, especially on the lower where my lashes were almost non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other brands in the past, and I believe that this one works the best-- as good as the prescription $100 kind.</li>
    <li> Have not noticed much difference but also have not used it consistently every night since it sometimes makes my eyes itch.</li>
    <li> It works 100%! I think I&#x27;ve been using it for two months now. I saw my eye lashes were glowing a little bit when I started to use for the first week.  Recently I haven&#x27;t used it for a week now, but today I looked into the mirror, I was super shocked to see my eyelashes... they are super duper long! Scary and amazing!</li>
    <li> It was ok. I used it every single night (except twice) for over 3 weeks and I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference. I will finish the bottle but don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was to leave feedback after receiving a code and my payment with amazon got screwy. So I have a friend who bought it and she likes it very much.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this enough to see if it really works or not yet.  However, I think more detailed instructions would be helpful.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  Give it a month or two. I had bald spots on my lashes, they were so short &amp; straight that when I got them tinted, you still couln&#x27;t see them.  Now, my lashes are really long and thick, darker and they curl.  It looks like I have mascara on when I have no makeup, so fun. It now takes me just a second to put on mascara, they hardly need it.  I even had to trim one!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have noticeably longer and fuller lashes. My hairdresser recommended this product when I asked how they got such long lashes!</li>
    <li> I have noticed no change in my lashes and I was hoping for some length/fullness with this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of products for eyelash growth.  I have no idea why I changed and tried this one.  It is terrible.  Does not work at all.</li>
    <li> After hearing so much about this products from friends, just had to try it! I&#x27;ve got to admit it&#x27;s surpassed even my expectations. This product works wonders!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum for a few weeks and so far I have seen some steady growth, I damaged my lashes by wearing fakes and was told that I had taking out some of my own lashes while taking out the fakes, which is the reason for me trying this product. I have seen my lashes growing back. I now can&#x27;t wait to see them really grow even longer.</li>
    <li> The only product that has worked on my eyelashes. Will buy as long as I can :)</li>
    <li> This product arrived ahead of schedule.  It takes several weeks to see results, but I am very pleased that the eyelash enhancer is so easy to apply, and does not cause the itching and irritation that I experienced with other products. So far, so good!</li>
    <li> This is a small bottle. I have used it 4 times at night and i can see a little bit of improvement</li>
    <li> I am into my second week and have not noticed any growth in my eyelashes. Will carry on, hopeful that I will get some results. Does sting if it gets into the eyes.</li>
    <li> For years I have been looking for something to make my eyelashes grow without using fake eylashes.&lt;br /&gt;And then I bought the FEG Enhancer. Problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly this product works amazingly well!👌🏽</li>
    <li> I am glad this product has worked for people, but alas it did not work for me.  I used it only on my right eyelash area for 8 weeks now and there has been NO new growth.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for almost a month. There is no apparent effect of longer. But it seems like my eyelash is really stronger than before.</li>
    <li> it works great!  my lashes are longer and fuller now.  definitely ordering a 2nd batch of 3.</li>
    <li> So far, My eyelashes are fuller, and growing at a steady pace. Have been using for a couple weeks, progress already. Will buy until I&#x27;ve achieved my results.</li>
    <li> I received your product on 11/13/14.  It is now 11/29/14 and there is barely anything left in the tube. I have tried several products to help my brows and lashes grow in thicker, and they are all the same....poor!!!  If I use it the way prescribed I get about 2-3 weeks out of it.  I have purchased more expensive products that claim they will last 2-3 MONTHS and in two weeks they are drying out already. I wouldn&#x27;t mind putting the money out if they lasted and did the job they promised.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Phyllis Batterman&lt;br /&gt;number1mommom3@verizon.net</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  I used this kind,  then switched to Rapid Lash. Rapid lash did not work and i lost all my long lashes,  so i ordered this again.  The only thing i noticed was that the second container of FEG i ordered did not seem to have as much product in it.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to apply,  but it seems my container is almost empty and i didn&#x27;t order it that long ago.</li>
    <li> my eyelashes have gotten so long with this stuff. i started off by using it every day and than sometimes i would forget to apply it every night so i would apply it whenever i remembered to do so. great stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;my sister started using it and is now starting to see results as well. it usually takes about 3-4 weeks to see results so dont be discouraged if you dont see them right away. my first tube lasted me for about 3-4 months, i have now ordered it for the second time</li>
    <li> I used this product for about six weeks and it really does seem to be making my eyelashes thicker as well as my eyebrows.  I didn&#x27;t want to post sooner until I gave it a chance to work.  It does seem to be working and I will continue to use it and update accordingly.  It takes some time to see results but it does produce results.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product and I got an extra one to give to my sister. It works amazingly well. I have a spot on my left eyelid where lashes don&#x27;t grow well so there was always this blank spot. Using this product has resolved that problem and I have long, full lashes. It also lasts months. I love it.</li>
    <li> I was using Latisse ($129.00) for about 4 months. The add for FEG sounded really convincing, so I thought I would give it a shot. I have been using it in conjunction with Latisse thinking that it will work better until one day I went on the trip and accidentally left Latisse at home. All I had with me was FEG. Well, the result I got from using it twice a day instead of once a day + Latisse was incredible. My lashes got longer and fuller within a week. I stopped using Latisse all together and switched to FEG. It really works!</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use and got great results  in a short time. Love it will continue to use it</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this product!  I can not believe how well it works....my eyelashes are long and beautiful.  I had issues with lashes falling out but with this product I look as if I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes.  I&#x27;ll never be without this!</li>
    <li> It was delivered as promised. The quality is great. The results are greater.</li>
    <li> This eyelash enhancer serum is really working. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month and I&#x27;m now starting to see my eyelashes growing. Yeah, pretty amazing! I do recommend this product and I will be ordering another one soon. Recieved item on time, reasonably priced and securely packed. Seller definitely gets a Five Star Rating👍🏼</li>
    <li> I am really disappointed with this product. I used it as indicated and only missed 1 day out of 2 months. Barely noticed any change other than my eyes got really swelling and hurt a lot for a few days at the beginning.  I will try a different product next time.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hoping to get my lashes to grow stronger and fuller.  I barely started using so I am hoping for great results.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m not seeing dramatic changes- I looked at the ingredient list, and unless they didn&#x27;t list the ingredient that causes lash growth because it is a proprietary substance, wasn&#x27;t sure what makes it work. I did see benzalkonium listed, which I have seen used as an anti-fungal agent for nails, as well as a skin cleansing wipe-like an alcohol pad. I would say the night and day lash activator I bought at Sephora (Cargo brand) had noticeable results on my lashes AND eyebrows after about 2 weeks. Not sure I would buy this product again- will see how things look after I&#x27;ve been using for a month.</li>
    <li> The product made my eyes red. I applied the product as directed at night. In the morning my eyes were red and puffy. I was embarrassed to go to work that morning. All day long my co-workers were asking me what is wrong with my eyes. It looked like I cried all night.&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t even have sensitive eyes and never had problems with my eyes til I bought FEG. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> The product is amazing!! I had to blog about it. http://isawiboughtibloggedit.blogspot.com/2014/10/2-years-later-and-with-no-eyelashes.html</li>
    <li> I just got the product and has only been using it for like a week. It seems like that i strengthens your lashes, because in the morning when i wake up, i don&#x27;t see lashes falling off anymore!</li>
    <li> I had an allergic reaction to this products.  My eyelids became swollen, red and itchy.  I would like a credit for the product, however, I cannot seem to contact the vendor.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the enhancer now for a couple of weeks and have already noticed that I have new lashes growing and starting to fill in. I have had no problems with it irritating my eyes along with the applicator is very thin so you do not get to much on your lash line that might run into your eyes. As soon as I have given this product a good chance to work I will submit a photo of my lashes.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Took a few week to start showing results after that my lashes are fuller and longer . Love putting on my mascara now!</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are short and my brows are thinning from over plucking. I&#x27;ve never tried wearing fake lashes or any eyelash serums before. I wanted to try a product that would make my lashes thick and longer and my brows fuller. I applied the Best Eyelash Growth Product and Eyebrow thickener to the base of my upper eyelashes every night before going to bed.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than two weeks so far. I can see an improvement already. My lashes are beginning to look fuller and a little longer. They definitely feel conditioned and look healthier. My brows have become fuller and don&#x27;t look so sparse. I expect over the next two weeks to see thicker and longer lashes and fuller brows. Unfortunately, like most eyelash serums, if I stop using this product my lashes will return back to normal. I received this product at a promotional discount in exchange for honest and unbiased feedback.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of week now. As of now, the condition of my eyelashes isn&#x27;t all that bad. In fact, they were very nice when I was younger, but since you age and start to fall apart, there’s no way I could keep my super luscious, black eyelashes forever. I got this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion, and I’ve got to say… It’s okay. I’ve been applying it to both my lower and upper lashes, and I’ve already seen some marginal grown for my lower lashes, but my upper lashes look the same. In fact, since the product drips in my eyes all the time, after it dries off, my eyes are slightly irritated to the point that I rub them. And I’ve been seeing some lash fall... Maybe it’s because I am rubbing them too hard, but if I continue to see lashes on my fingers after I rub them, I’m definitely going to stop using this product. I’ll try to be a little more careful, but I’ll be sure to update my review if that becomes the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 9/01&lt;br /&gt;So my lashes were falling out more and more frequently. When I stopped using this product, my lashes stopped falling out. So while it may work for some people, it just wasn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to apply. It&#x27;s basically like applying mascara, but you apply it on your closed lid at the base of your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;-Natural formula.&lt;br /&gt;-Has a very mild scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Eyelashes stop growing when you stop using the formula.&lt;br /&gt;-The product stings whenever it gets in your eyes. You’d think this wouldn’t be the case since it’s hard to avoid a few drips, but no. Stiiiings like the dickens.</li>
    <li> This product caused my eyes to burn and caused the skin on my eyelids to turn red and feel as if it is fried.  I threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> The product actually began to lengthen my eyelashes after 3weeks but my eyes were constantly bloodshot so I sadly discontinued use.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my eyelashes.  Your eyeballs will sting and burn if it gets in your eye.  Stick with Latisse.  Latisse works.</li>
    <li> Used exactly as directed.  No difference noted.</li>
    <li> Great results.  On my second tube and will keep on buying it.  Lashes are fuller and longer.  Much cheaper than the other expensive product.</li>
    <li> WOW!! this stuff really works!! I have been using it for about 2 weeks and my eyelashes are growing longer thicker and more keep growing!</li>
    <li> Really works! Only takes a few weeks to notice results. So happy to find something affordable that does the same thing as that very expensive brand!</li>
    <li> This product really works, and I have used three bottles now. However, when/if you stop using it for a period you will start loosing your lashes and your lashes get ugly...</li>
    <li> PEOPLE DID NOT KNOW I HAD LASHES UNTIL I USED THIS PRODUCT ...AWESOME THX</li>
    <li> It worked but as soon as I stopped using it, I lost the results.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and have had a bald patch on one of my eyelids for over a year.  I tried many serums to grow the lashes back and this was definitely the best!  After using this product for 2 weeks I noticed some new growth and now have my eyelashes back!  As a bonus, the rest of my lashes are longer and thicker than before.  I love this product and will be a lifelong customer!</li>
    <li> Love the results, tried other products and results are incomparable!!  Nice job and surprisingly pleased with how drastic the results were</li>
    <li> Been using for 4 weeks, no difference to my lashes whatsoever.</li>
    <li> noticed some difference</li>
    <li> I just received this product and I am super excited to try it! I wanted to leave a review that I can come back to and update as time goes on and hopefully it will all be positive! So far so good though! I have only used this product a couple of times and it is super easy to apply. The directions are short and to the point, so there is no guessing as to what to do. I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth yet, but again I just started using it, so I&#x27;m not shocked there. I was also nervous that it would cause some irritation, because I do tend to have more sensitive skin, but I have experienced no irritation what-so-ever.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to update as time goes on!&lt;br /&gt;Crossing my fingers!</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. First off I have to say I have very little in the eye lash department and I have always wanted to try a product like this. The instructions were easy to follow kind of like applying liquid eye liner but with that being said the first night I put too much and it got into my eyes and WOW it hurt..so word of advice &amp;#62;&amp;#62; less really is more, After the sting wore off it was fine I could feel that something was applied to my upper lid but nothing heavy or weighted down. By day two I did notice a slight more curl upward to my lashes nothing major but as mine are so thin any change I could notice..lol Anyway after a week I don&#x27;t; see any major changes but&lt;br /&gt;I will continue with it and update my review in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> was using different product will go back to it.</li>
    <li> I AM ONLY GIVING THIS PRODUCT A TWO STAR RATING BECAUSE IT WAS SHIPPED QUICKLY. I HAVE USED LATISSE FOR A FEW YEARS NOW BUT THOUGH I WOULD TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT WOULD PERHAPS SAVE  A FEW DOLLARS. BIG MISTAKE. FEG EYELASH ENHANCER DID CAUSE MY LASHES TO BECOME FULLER IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND PERHAPS A LITTLE LONGER, BY THE 3RD WEEK OF USE, I DEVELOPED A TERRIBLE EYE INFECTION &amp; STYE. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I DISCONTINUED USE RIGHT AWAY AND WENT BACK TO USING LATISSE AFTER THE INFECTION CLEARED. BUYERS BEWARE</li>
    <li> I use this more as repair for my lashes, not really for longer fuller lashes...because I wear eyelash extensions.&lt;br /&gt;What happens when you wear eyelash extensions is that your real eyelashes get weak and thin after long use.&lt;br /&gt;One of my eyelash technicians suggested I use a eyelash enhancer to keep my lashes strong.&lt;br /&gt;I was not sure about this product because I never heard of it and it was not expensive. I gave it a shot anyway and it actually worked.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely noticed more growth by the 2nd week. Not so much growth that they are bombshell lashes, but long enough for my eyes to notice. You need this even with eyelash extensions because if you have weak real lashes the fake lashes will not hold up right. I use this only about twice a weak when I have my eyelash extensions on because I don&#x27;t want them to grow too fast because extensions are attached to them. But during my &amp;#34;eyelash resting&amp;#34; periods which is about 2 months, I would use this product every night.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really think this works that well.  I only used one tube and did not see a difference.  It might work for someone else.  Or I am not patient enough.  I do use Latisse and it works great.  However, you could try this product and it is much cheaper.  Nice ingredients also.</li>
    <li> I have tried Rapid Lash with not much in the way of results.  Then I tried FEG and I have to say I have noticed a huge improvement with my eyelashes.  I had gotten to where I really didn&#x27;t have any eyelashes to speak of, even to the point of there was nothing to curl.  When I used Rapid Lash I saw small improvement so I sort of gave up hope of ever having real eyelashes.  Then here I was a couple of years later getting ready to go on a vacation where I wanted to look really good.  I ran across this FEG which costs about $20 less, but I saw a very noticeable difference within 4 weeks but even more after 6 weeks.  Family and friends noticed. It is wonderful to have eyelashes again.  I just ordered another tube in hopes that it will assist with my eyebrows where I have patches of balding.  I highly recommend this.  If you use as directed, every night, I would expect that you would have the same results.....</li>
    <li> really works! i had it twice and every time eyelashes are incredible!</li>
    <li> Have used it alittle over a week and an tell the difference.  Due to chemo and hair lost my lashes and eyebrows grew in sparse.  I am excited to see how this works long term.  As of now I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> As of 12/27/14, I am editing my review of this product.  My first experience with this product was positive, but when I then began using a new bottle of the same brand, the product irritated my eyes, made my eyelids feel droopy and tired and it basically stopped working.  My lashes were no longer maintaining the new growth from before, but were reverting back to their original state, before ever using the product.  Originally, I thought this product came from Brazil, but I then notice that the last bottle I bought came from China and at that point I became very skeptical.  I cannot emphasize enough that as consumers we need to be VERY concerned with products coming out of China and focus more on FDA approved products from the USA. Saving a couple of bucks is just not worth it when these fake products can potentially harm us.  IT SERIOUSLY IS NOT WORTH IT!!        This product is incredible!  I didn&#x27;t have high expectations, but was pleasantly surprised that this serum has in fact increased the length of my eyelashes.  Most of my lashes have increased in length by at least 33%, but some have definitely increased by 50%.  This is no exaggeration!  Oddly enough, one of my lower lashes has grown so ridiculously long that I had to remove it the first time, and it has since grown back again to an absurd length and this time I just cut it shorter.  Yet, it&#x27;s growing back at a rapid pace.  One thing I am a bit disappointed with is the thickness, which has not changed much at all.  I would have liked to had the increased length with the added thickness, but at least one of the two is taking place, so I can&#x27;t really complain.  All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It works very well. I used this for a couple of weeks and already have thicker and longer eyelashes</li>
    <li> I was not impressed..i guess everything is not for everyone. No improvement in eyelashes. Did look like a racoon after four weeks of using it once a day (dark circles around eyes)..waste of money.</li>
    <li> I dont really write reviews but this stuff works! my lashes were really thin and not that short&lt;br /&gt;but not long and bow they are over the top long and more than doubled in thickness looks like i have mascara on all the time. and i didnt even apply it every day cus i would forget but it doesnt hurt your eyes and in about a  month you will be satisfied. :) i sure am!!!</li>
    <li> does not work no results</li>
    <li> I have no idea if it worked.  But, it might have been this stuff that gave me a style. or the lash food. One of the 2 definitely.</li>
    <li> This really works and it is safe to use...</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this item as I have noticed my eyelashes were getting thinner and thinner. Wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work, but must say I am pleasantly surprised. I have actually noticed a difference in just a few days.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it works well or not. I will use it and let you know if I feel it works. I just know my eyes don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
</ol>
