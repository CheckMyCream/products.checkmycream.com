      <li>We are huge Star Wars fans in this house</li>
      <li>One out of the three didn&#x27;t light up and had to be thrown away.  </li>
      <li>The light flashes for a timer</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lights up, makes the light saber sound, and has fun Star Wars phrases.</li>
      <li>and she was super excited to brush her teeth with the darth vader version.</li>
      <li>It looks rather cheap and isn&#x27;t worth the money for your Star Wars fans.</li>
      <li>Really cool work</li>

      <li>Still worth buying.</li>
      <li>They work fine &amp; a decent size</li>
      <li>They are great toothbrushes, but super bummed that I received 1 green and 2 red.</li>
      <li>Very dissapointed</li>
      <li>He gets excited because he always gets to pick a different color.  </li>
      <li>They light up for 1 minute to show the kids how long they should brush for and it seems to be working</li>
      <li>So my older son has the one that works.</li>
      <li>We could never get my 4 year old nephew to brush his teeth before these.  </li>
      <li>We got this for our 3 yr old daughter so she can learn to brush her teeth longer.</li>
      <li>It is fun for her now to brush her teeth, especially when my husband turns off the lights and she brushes her teeth in the dark.</li>
      <li>My pack came with two red and one green which created a little tension for a minute but, after that was worked out my two boys, 5 and 9 love these.  </li>
      <li>He doesn&#x27;t brush as long as the light stays lit, but at least he is finally brushing his teeth.  </li>

<li> so kids know how long to brush their teeth.</li>
<li> Wish I could have gotten three different colors instead of just two of one and one other one.  </li>
<li> Blue one did work huge disappointment.</li>
<li> but I only received the red and green ones ......</li>
<li> but I saw the photo showing a Blue, Red &amp; Green tooth brush in the set.</li>
<li> This should be clearly mentioned at least.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, only the green toothbrush lit up.</li>
<li> Purchased a 3 pack (2 blue and 1 green).</li>
<li> For the money, I had expected what I ordered</li>
<li> Was too much trouble to sent back.</li>
<li> My kids were not very happy as each wanted a different one.</li>
<li> and he is seriously in the bathroom multiple times a day &amp;#34;light</li>
<li> Sent me three toothbrushes, but one was a duplicate, one of them had a button missing from the timer.</li>
<li> The gift arrived &amp; I got 2 Reds &amp; 1 Green.</li>
<li> They  are already using them everyday.</li>
<li> Unfortunate that my deliver of 3 had 2 similar colors.</li>
<li> Only negative that is a random sample.  </li>
<li> It used to be hard to get him to brush his teeth</li>
<li> I am not happy!</li>
<li> The picture shows all three and there is nothing in the description that said it would be random.</li>
<li> It was a disappointment to my friend.</li>

    <li> I brought the 3 tooth brush set for my friend who&#x27;s an Star Wars fan, I&#x27;m an Trekkie myself. They work fine &amp; a decent size but I saw the photo showing a Blue, Red &amp; Green tooth brush in the set. The gift arrived &amp; I got 2 Reds &amp; 1 Green. It was a disappointment to my friend. Depends on who&#x27;s side your on! Was too much trouble to sent back. Still worth buying.</li>
    <li> We got this for our 3 yr old daughter so she can learn to brush her teeth longer. We are huge Star Wars fans in this house and she was super excited to brush her teeth with the darth vader version. It is fun for her now to brush her teeth, especially when my husband turns off the lights and she brushes her teeth in the dark.</li>
    <li> Lights blink on and off... it&#x27;s not lit up the entire 1 minute but it&#x27;s blinking. Either way my boys loved it in their Christmas stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> Look great and light up! The light flashes for a timer so kids know how long to brush their teeth.</li>
    <li> Only negative that is a random sample.  Wish I could have gotten three different colors instead of just two of one and one other one.  My son would have really liked the darth maul one but just got yoda and two darth vadar.  I understood though before purchase, just wish they offered the ability to choose since they come in separate individually packaged containers anyways...</li>
    <li> We could never get my 4 year old nephew to brush his teeth before these.  He doesn&#x27;t brush as long as the light stays lit, but at least he is finally brushing his teeth.  He gets excited because he always gets to pick a different color.  Well worth the money.  I read some reviews that people were upset they didn&#x27;t get every color.  I can&#x27;t talk to that, because I received the 3 colors.</li>
    <li> Did not get 3 diff colors as shown</li>
    <li> Bought them for my grandsons. They  are already using them everyday.</li>
    <li> Sent me three toothbrushes, but one was a duplicate, one of them had a button missing from the timer. For the money, I had expected what I ordered</li>
    <li> Blue one did work huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> Items came with one red two blue toothbrushes</li>
    <li> They are great toothbrushes, but super bummed that I received 1 green and 2 red. No blue! The picture shows all three and there is nothing in the description that said it would be random. I am not happy! I have 3 boys and now I have to order a separate blue one from someone else so that we can distinguish between their toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> My pack came with two red and one green which created a little tension for a minute but, after that was worked out my two boys, 5 and 9 love these.  They light up for 1 minute to show the kids how long they should brush for and it seems to be working so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> One out of the three didn&#x27;t light up and had to be thrown away.  It looks rather cheap and isn&#x27;t worth the money for your Star Wars fans.</li>
    <li> Purchased a 3 pack (2 blue and 1 green). Unfortunately, only the green toothbrush lit up. So my older son has the one that works. The flashing feature doesn&#x27;t matter to my younger son for now.</li>
    <li> Really cool work well..my boys love them</li>
    <li> I thought we would get one of each but we didnt get the blue one. My kids were not very happy as each wanted a different one. This should be clearly mentioned at least.</li>
    <li> my kids love them.  only drawback is the timer is one minute instead of two.</li>
    <li> Perfect as advertised</li>
    <li> My 4-year-old son (sorta a Star Wars freak) is in love with this toothbrush. It used to be hard to get him to brush his teeth and he is seriously in the bathroom multiple times a day &amp;#34;light sabering the germs in my mouth.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lights up, makes the light saber sound, and has fun Star Wars phrases.</li>
    <li> Nice novelty. Received items safely and packed nicely. Unfortunate that my deliver of 3 had 2 similar colors. Still a nice gift.</li>
    <li> Two of the brushes did not work.</li>
    <li> I assumed in a pack of three Id get all colours and I got 3 red. Very dissapointed</li>
    <li> They are great gifts ... I am said because on the fotos they came in blue too but I only received the red and green ones ......</li>
