      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
      <li>Great for the purposes described.</li>
      <li>Good to have in the purse.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good size, it&#x27;s sturdy, and the cover flips over to protect it when not being used as a stand.  </li>
      <li>Good that it would stay at a good angle.  </li>
      <li>The mirror is of nice size and serve its purpose</li>
      <li>Hinges break very easily.</li>
      <li>The price was OK</li>
      <li>Recommend ok.</li>
      <li>but doesn&#x27;t bother me..feels like better quality.</li>
      <li>Bought this for an upcoming trip to make sure I have a mirror.</li>
      <li>Worked OK.  </li>
      <li>Cheap plastic , not for travel for sure .</li>
      <li>The hinges snap off way to easy.</li>
      <li>Compact and light to carry.</li>
      <li>Used to have one a wee bit bigger, but this is a good travel size and closes like a compact.</li>
      <li>good size for a small mirror and nice and slim for packing.  </li>
      <li>Fits great in travel case yet big enough to use for makeup.</li>
      <li>Could have been a tad higher magnification.</li>
      <li>This mirror arrived on time and is  exactly as shown.  </li>
      <li>This was the exact mirror I needed for traveling as most hotels do not have a way to see the back of my head when fixing my hair.  </li>

      <li>Nice mirror, but be very careful when handling.</li>
      <li>I always felt self conscious at work pulling out one of my wife&#x27;s old compacts, just so I could check for leftover lunch stuck in my teeth :)</li>

      <li>This is very slim and a quality mirror.</li>
      <li>Very flimsy and fragil.</li>
      <li>This is fine, small to pack, cheap to buy.  </li>
      <li>like that it folds flat for storage and then sits on its cover to set on a table for hands free use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold in one hand, while I put in a contact with the other.</li>
      <li>The plastic was clear, though.</li>
      <li>It was a lot harder than you would think to find a good quality glass mirror, that was small enough to pack away, and not overly girly.</li>
      <li>Not black like in the picture.</li>
      <li>The mirror side is heavy and the cover is super flimsy in comparison.</li>

<li> I have only had them for four months and the plastic surrounding the metal pins broke, making it impossible to close the mirror or stand it up on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic, being brittle and cheap, will not hold up to regular use.</li>

<li> Heavier than your average compact mirror</li>

<li> also well protected with the hard cover</li>
<li> There is a lot of stress put on the hinge mechanism and the poor quality plastic is too weak to handle</li>
<li> One of them has a broken hinge already.</li>
<li> It arrived broken.</li>
<li> The hinges are fairly vulnerable as the plastic lack flex; thus the hinges broke after continuous uses.</li>
<li> Poor quality, try something else!</li>

    <li> No complaints about this mirror. I keep it in my desk at work.</li>
    <li> good size for a small mirror and nice and slim for packing.  also well protected with the hard cover</li>
    <li> Update: I have now purchased a few of these and all have ended up with the same fate of the cover portion breaking off. The mirror side is heavy and the cover is super flimsy in comparison. ---- Good to have in the purse. Heavier than your average compact mirror but doesn&#x27;t bother me..feels like better quality. I think I&#x27;ll have this mirror for quite a while.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and design for applying makeup at my desk at work, without having to run to the women&#x27;s restroom.</li>
    <li> Needed a travel mirror to put my makeup on.  This is fine, small to pack, cheap to buy.  Recommend ok.</li>
    <li> Works well. Crystal clear.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it folds flat for storage and then sits on its cover to set on a table for hands free use.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these so that I could have one at home and one at work. One of them has a broken hinge already. I have only had them for four months and the plastic surrounding the metal pins broke, making it impossible to close the mirror or stand it up on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic, being brittle and cheap, will not hold up to regular use. There is a lot of stress put on the hinge mechanism and the poor quality plastic is too weak to handle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to replace the one that broke and I will definitely be looking for a different brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror to sit on my desk and be reflective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does both things perfectly. If I had a need for another one, I would certainly buy another.</li>
    <li> Very flimsy and fragil. Hinges break very easily. Cheap plastic , not for travel for sure . I would consider  a different brand. The price was OK</li>
    <li> This mirror arrived on time and is  exactly as shown.  After a couple of month (or less)  of just being in my purse, and an occasional use, I opened it up and it fell apart.  Everything that holds this mirror together is plastic which is why it doesn&#x27;t have a long life span.</li>
    <li> Great for the purposes described.</li>
    <li> Fits great in travel case yet big enough to use for makeup.</li>
    <li> It arrived broken. Poor quality, try something else!</li>
    <li> just what I expected.</li>
    <li> I needed something not too pricey without sacrificing quality.  This is heavy, but that&#x27;s a good thing for me. Feels solid and works just like I needed.  Mine came in a white/clear.</li>
    <li> This was the exact mirror I needed for traveling as most hotels do not have a way to see the back of my head when fixing my hair.  Compact and light to carry.</li>
    <li> Worked OK.  Good that it would stay at a good angle.  Could have been a tad higher magnification.</li>
    <li> I bought a similar mirror years ago at The Container Store. I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for one and FINALLY found it here!!! I can&#x27;t believe the price, I bought 5!! The plastic was clear, though. Not black like in the picture.</li>
    <li> Used to have one a wee bit bigger, but this is a good travel size and closes like a compact. Bought one for myself and spouse and think it will be a god choice.</li>
    <li> Way smaller than I expected</li>
    <li> It was a lot harder than you would think to find a good quality glass mirror, that was small enough to pack away, and not overly girly. I always felt self conscious at work pulling out one of my wife&#x27;s old compacts, just so I could check for leftover lunch stuck in my teeth :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good size, it&#x27;s sturdy, and the cover flips over to protect it when not being used as a stand.  And it is made of a quality glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, the one I got ended up being white, instead of the black/dark brown shown.  no biggie.</li>
    <li> The mirror was not the same color as pictured. The hinges are fairly vulnerable as the plastic lack flex; thus the hinges broke after continuous uses. The mirror is of nice size and serve its purpose but it wasn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror, but be very careful when handling. The hinges snap off way to easy. Had to glue back on.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size travel mirror for my purse.  It&#x27;s lightweight but bigger than a compact mirror that comes with my makeup.  I like the size a lot</li>
    <li> Bought this for an upcoming trip to make sure I have a mirror. This is very slim and a quality mirror. My only complaint is it&#x27;s a bit heavy.</li>
    <li> I use this mirror to put in my contacts.  It&#x27;s easy to hold in one hand, while I put in a contact with the other.</li>
    <li> Best travel mirror ever!</li>
