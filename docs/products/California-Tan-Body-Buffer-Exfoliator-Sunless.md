      <li>Make sure to rub product onto your skin in circles, as the directions say to do.</li>

      <li>Goes on really easy and smells fantastic.</li>

      <li>It smells amazing and it doesn&#x27;t smell like tanning lotion normally does.</li>
      <li>(a sweet, beachy scent)&lt;br /&gt;-dries quickly&lt;</li>
      <li>/&gt;-dries quickly-</li>
      <li>This product is amazing and gives you almost an instant tan.</li>
      <li>on light and dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;Has a light tint to it so that you can see where you are applying it&lt;br /&gt;Feels like a moisturizer when you apply it&lt;br /&gt;Color looks natural, not orange</li>
      <li>I liked the color it provided - worked very well in a week prior to my vacation.  </li>
      <li>In the very first application you really see the difference.</li>
      <li>Has a pleasant scent and kind of smells slightly like a tanning lotion (you&#x27;d use in a tanning bed) but is a lot nicer than other sunless tanning lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I really recommend this self tanner!</li>
      <li>It works more like a gradual tanner/ moisturizer than an instant self tanner.</li>
      <li>the first coat is the “guide” and that will wash off in the shower.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY self tanners because I try to avoid tanning beds, and this is probably the only one that hasn&#x27;t made me orangey.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In comparison to the California Tan spray tan that I used to use (pretty often)</li>
      <li>I really wish they made a version for the face !</li>
      <li>I have fair skin, blonde hair and blue eyes.</li>
      <li>so I see it as positive</li>
      <li>, I like this product much better (as long as I don&#x27;t need an immediate tan).</li>
      <li>Note: it smells great for awhile when first applied, but once the color develops it tends to have a slight strange almost food-like smell to it,</li>
      <li>Very high quality stuff.</li>
      <li>Really like this product</li>
      <li>You do have to wash your hands immediately after applying or else they turn orange FAST.</li>
      <li>I was very happly with this product.  </li>
      <li>has never looked to golden and natural.  </li>
      <li>but all in all, I really like it.</li>
      <li>The price was reasonable.</li>
      <li>I really feel like I&#x27;ve tried every self tanners on the market</li>
      <li>I went to a professional to spray tan me the next day (which cost me $50 more).</li>
      <li>And the color is rich and caramel, no orange or yellow tones.</li>
      <li>Looks very natural no nasty odor that other sunless tanning products give off.  </li>
      <li>The result was some decent color on my face.</li>
      <li>I use self tanners on a daily basis and continue to come back to this one :)</li>
      <li>The color is very natural!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>Stay clear!!</li>
      <li>This product gave me a much deeper but natural color</li>
      <li>/&gt;-Color develops better with time &amp; more applications (I apply it at night before I go to sleep, usually 3 days in a row and by the third day I look pretty tan &amp; usually lasts +/-</li>
      <li>The color looks natural.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-fades with a natural color</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;It fades naturally.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
      <li>/&gt;-looks natural (NOT</li>
      <li>use it three days in a row for a SUPER dark tan, but one application a week should be enough</li>
      <li>It barely changed to any color.</li>
      <li>This shipment (2 bottles) is about half the shade ( a lot lighter) than the first tube I received.  </li>
      <li>Mild odor, not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>Dries fast - not greasy as some other brands are.</li>
      <li>It makes so much less of a mess, comes out more even, and is much easier to apply in hard to reach places.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Good stuff!  But don&#x27;t get a pedicure before you go!  I liked the color it provided - worked very well in a week prior to my vacation.  Unfortunately when I got my pedicure I should have said don&#x27;t use the scrub and it removed almost all of my color - my mistake, not the products!  Would use again prior to vacation!</li>
    <li> I was very happly with this product.  I have used various tanning creams and towels.  This product gave me a much deeper but natural color and I did not have to use alot each time.  I followed it up with the California Tan Millionaire tan extender and my fake tan has never looked to golden and natural.  The best I have ever had!  The smell was very nice and the product was easy to apply and lasted well.  Defiantely order again</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Works great to give u a nice,  natural looking tan. Make sure to rub product onto your skin in circles, as the directions say to do. Do not rub up and down, it can cause streaking. This product makes a great gift too! I send it to all my sisters, my mother and my girlfriends, for their birthday or at Christmas, etc. And all of them are more than satisfied with receiving this gift more than once ;)</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff. I makes my spray tans last at least a week longer than normal....and it doesn&#x27;t streak AS LONG AS YOU RUB IT IN. Great color--I get tons of compliments on how tan I look (and I am very pale in real life!) and it never looks orange.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, gives an even tan and does not darken places like heels, moles, etc.  Lasts up to a week.  Great scent.</li>
    <li> I like this.....it does a great job.  I use it about once a week.  It arrived on time.  The price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! It looks great on your legs as if you have a natural tan.</li>
    <li> A friend who works at a tanning salon gave me this stuff as a gift. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect at first, but I love it! I&#x27;ve tried MANY self tanners because I try to avoid tanning beds, and this is probably the only one that hasn&#x27;t made me orangey. The color is very natural! Note: it smells great for awhile when first applied, but once the color develops it tends to have a slight strange almost food-like smell to it, only thing I don&#x27;t like about it. Everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different though, so this may not be the case for everyone. I really recommend this self tanner!</li>
    <li> Good product, very natural tan. But it smells awful when applicated 😳</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many self tanners.  I was recently going to get spray tans, but read that the fumes are harmful.  The tanning salon sells this stuff, so I decided to try it.  It&#x27;s the same brand that they use in their tanning machine.  I can honestly say that it&#x27;s the best self tanner I&#x27;ve used for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;Smells good&lt;br /&gt;Goes on light and dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;Has a light tint to it so that you can see where you are applying it&lt;br /&gt;Feels like a moisturizer when you apply it&lt;br /&gt;Color looks natural, not orange&lt;br /&gt;I use it three days in a row for a SUPER dark tan, but one application a week should be enough&lt;br /&gt;It fades naturally.  Other products come off patchy, making you look weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad that I found it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s my favorite.  I just ordered the #3 tan extender, but haven&#x27;t used it yet so I can&#x27;t review it, but I will as soon as I try it.</li>
    <li> Really like this product</li>
    <li> This tans well and doesn&#x27;t leave blotchy marks after it wears.  Very high quality stuff.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t last at all. Hard to even out when applied. Can&#x27;t tell where it is at. Took multiple applications to see results.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin, blue eyes and find this color to be perfect. However if you have more of an olive/tan complexion, this probably isn&#x27;t the best product for you.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-it doesn&#x27;t make a mess&lt;br /&gt;-smells great (a sweet, beachy scent)&lt;br /&gt;-dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;-looks natural (NOT an orange color)&lt;br /&gt;-is easy to apply evenly&lt;br /&gt;-buildable&lt;br /&gt;-fades with a natural color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-it goes on almost invisible so it&#x27;s hard to see if you missed a spot or put too much in one area&lt;br /&gt;-Color develops better with time &amp; more applications (I apply it at night before I go to sleep, usually 3 days in a row and by the third day I look pretty tan &amp; usually lasts +/- a week). Don&#x27;t expect this to be instant by any means.&lt;br /&gt;-dries quickly- I know, I put this in Pros also because I don&#x27;t want to have to stand around and wait for it to dry or worry about getting it on my clothes/towels so I see it as positive, the bad part about it drying fast is that your hands tend to turn out a weird color and it is very hard to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to the California Tan spray tan that I used to use (pretty often), I like this product much better (as long as I don&#x27;t need an immediate tan). It makes so much less of a mess, comes out more even, and is much easier to apply in hard to reach places. Also, this sunless lotion has never rubbed off on my clothes or sheets yet. The spray one used to get on my leather car seats, my shirts, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already purchased this a second time, and plan to buy it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I really feel like I&#x27;ve tried every self tanners on the market and I think this one is the best. The smell is good, doesn&#x27;t change throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t smell like self tanner. In the very first application you really see the difference. And the color is rich and caramel, no orange or yellow tones. The cream glides on the skin very easy which make it a quick application !&lt;br /&gt;BRAVO California tan !&lt;br /&gt;Now I really wish they made a version for the face !</li>
    <li> I have bought this product again and again... I use self tanners on a daily basis and continue to come back to this one :)</li>
    <li> no orange look. Very natural and price is good. Goes on really easy and smells fantastic. The spray is great too.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from seller &amp;#34;Jenny&#x27;s Best&amp;#34;. The first time I showered after using it once, it clumped off my skin in disgusting brown chunks. I got out of the shower and I could literally run my finger over my skin and brown slimy clumps continued to come off, taking my entire tan with it. I was splotchy, and 5+ different shades of brown and orange and beige. I was so embarrassed by my skin I went to a professional to spray tan me the next day (which cost me $50 more). She looked at the product and compared it to one she had on her shelf for sale. Hers was a totally different color, consistency, and smell. She said when products expire she can no longer sell them to the public so she brings them home to use herself, (she has some over a year expired she is still using, so if this products problem is being expired it is multiple years expired!!). I still am lightly splotchy in a few small areas, I will need another spray tan session to fix my skin completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY THE PRODUCT IS EITHER COMPLETELY FAKE, TAMPERED WITH, OR YEARS EXPIRED!!!</li>
    <li> I love this produce !!!!. Its the best one so for I use on my skin . The color is perfect the smell is wonderful  there is nothing I do not like about this self-tenner . Its Perfect !!!</li>
    <li> This self tanner is one of the best I&#x27;ve used. It smells amazing and it doesn&#x27;t smell like tanning lotion normally does. You do have to wash your hands immediately after applying or else they turn orange FAST.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something to replace my mystic tan lotion since they discontinued it. I have tried a lot of products and all of them have been washing off, even after double applications. That is, until I found California Tan. I had purchased this lotion at a salon before (different looking bottle then) but the results are about the same. I actually triple layered this last night on my face knowing the first coat is the “guide” and that will wash off in the shower. The result was some decent color on my face. I would have liked a touch darker but it was also the first application. I applied it a few hours before I went to bed, three times to my face. The smell is great and there is 0 nasty DHA smell which I think takes away from the end result a little bit but all in all, I really like it. So far, this is the best I’ve found in comparison to Mystic. I am ordering another bottle today as well as the bronzing powder. It’s a great find. Very happy</li>
    <li> Lotion is thick, but not greasy. Has a pleasant scent and kind of smells slightly like a tanning lotion (you&#x27;d use in a tanning bed) but is a lot nicer than other sunless tanning lotions I&#x27;ve used. Gives a light tan color, perfect for fair skin. If you have an olive skin tone or darker, I wouldn&#x27;t think this would be the one for you.</li>
    <li> It barely changed to any color. And it did have a odor. Not happy with it and will stick with the spray.</li>
    <li> This product is a piece of crap. Either its a fake or California tan products suck! Couldn&#x27;t recommend this piece of crap to anyone. Stay clear!!</li>
    <li> The smell of this self tanner in simply beautiful. However you need few applications to see some color. Also it takes a while for the product to absorb! It works more like a gradual tanner/ moisturizer than an instant self tanner.</li>
    <li> This shipment (2 bottles) is about half the shade ( a lot lighter) than the first tube I received.  These tubes don&#x27;t seem to be doing anything at all.  I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and gives you almost an instant tan. Only problem is it does streak if not applied generously.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Mild odor, not overwhelming.  Works well for me.</li>
    <li> Ordered this on a friends recommendation. Works great! No streaks or weird odor. As directions say, do wash hands with soap and warm water after applying as to avoid stained hands. Dries fast - not greasy as some other brands are. It lasts several days.  I will reorder when I run out - glad I found it.</li>
    <li> I normally go to a spray tan booth, and have never really liked sunless lotions. However, a tanning consultant recommended it for twhen I cant make it by the salon. I found it easy to apply, and blends well. Note- I have fair skin, blonde hair and blue eyes. The color looks natural.</li>
    <li> Looks very natural no nasty odor that other sunless tanning products give off.  Highly recommended</li>
