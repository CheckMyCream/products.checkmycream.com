<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> my son like it very much! Good!</li>
    <li> very suitable for my 3.5y boy.</li>
    <li> I put this item on a 6 month subscription and my kids are all set. I bought them one each of the base. Pivotal part of daily routines.</li>
    <li> nice , my child like it</li>
    <li> Perfect for the kids.</li>
    <li> very good！my daughter was very like it ！</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just overpriced. But I will bought them for my kids anyway.</li>
    <li> Not as large a brush as the one the kids sonicare came with but I actually like it better now bc it fits in my toddlers mouth easier</li>
    <li> A little bit too small</li>
    <li> These new heads don&#x27;t last at all. My youngest son has the last model from last year (the one with two divots) and it&#x27;s still looking good. My older son got these new ones and is already on his second after 3 months. The bristles bent out in less than 10 weeks and was terrible. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Soft and right size, great for kids 3+</li>
    <li> not the exact same but does the job just as good.  Made our brushes louder.</li>
    <li> Both heads were the smaller size. Worked well for our purposes.</li>
    <li> The real deal. Not some cheap imitation. Worth the money to keep your kiddos teeth clean.</li>
    <li> Standard replacement heads for our kids&#x27; toothbrushes.  Great quality as expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving 5 stars because of the product quality. I purchased the Philips Sonicare Children&#x27;s toothbrush with these for extra heads. My child is 7 and these heads are very small. I would say the are more for 2-5 year olds. If you are ordering for a child who has already started losing baby teeth, I would recommend a larger head size.</li>
    <li> it fits perfectly in my 4 and 6 year old boys&#x27; mouth.</li>
    <li> These are the exact same size heads that originally came with my son&#x27;s sonicare toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush. Both my kids (6 and 3) have been using them for years. I wish they were as easy to buy in-store as the adult replacement heads, but Amazon is great! Love Amazon too!</li>
    <li> Low point next time I go to two more than the! It&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
    <li> Works great! Fits the toothbrush without issue. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit the Kid&#x27;s brush. Too tight and now the tooth brush is broken (won&#x27;t vibrate) because the metal attachment piece got pulled out.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement brushes.</li>
    <li> these are the smaller brush heads for kids.  they are small, soft, and were not the same ones that came with the brushes.  that being said my kids like them and they seem to clean their teeth!</li>
    <li> For my daughter&#x27;s teeth the cost is worth it!</li>
    <li> These fit well and last a long time.  My kids teeth look great too.</li>
    <li> My seven year old uses his Sonicare for kids toothbrush daily.  Initially, I insisted he used Sonicare rather than a manual brush because of the timer, but now he grabs Sonicare by himself.  Originally toothbrush came with a larger brush head, so I bought these as a replacement as was recommended for his age.  They fit toothbrush as expected and work well, but they are smaller than a manual kids toothbrush, and, for a seven year old, a larger brushhead would be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the brush heads are way overpriced.  I would understand higher price of refills if the brush itself was cheap (kind of like it works with razors), but, in the case of this brush, both the brush and refiks are expensive.</li>
    <li> Works well as replacement head for Philip&#x27;s Sonicare Kids. Prior heads were red and yellow. These are great.</li>
    <li> This brush head is just the right size for a three year old, I would even recommend it for a two year old.</li>
    <li> Had to add this to my order of electrical toothbrushes, the originals that come with it are a bit larger for smaller kids, this are the right size. I have a 6 and 4 year old.</li>
    <li> Perfectly sized for my young children.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my children&#x27;s tooth brushes.  They are easy and convenient to be shipped to my home.  I recommend the tooth brushes and their refill tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Sorry, the address incorrectly, received no ~ but still will buy again!</li>
    <li> I wish they would go back to two colors. Having the same color with no other option is difficult for multiple kids (we were using the same toothbrush but changing out the head). I tried using a sharpie, but that washes off.</li>
    <li> This brush seems a little large for my small 5 year old&#x27;s mouth. I wish they offered two sizes to choose from like they used to when we originally purchased the brush.</li>
    <li> Very appropriate, the baby&#x27;s teeth brush e clean</li>
    <li> Only thing I wish was that there were other colors because then my kids could tell which toothbrush was theirs more easily. Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrushes.  We use them daily in our house. They last a long time and keep my kids teeth clean...what more can I ask for?  We also signed up for the Subscribe and Save feature, so we get them delivered every 3 months (which is how often most dentist recommend replacing a toothbrush) and save a little money by doing that as well with the discount.</li>
    <li> Works great and my 4 year old does an excellent job brushing with it!</li>
    <li> This size works great for my 2 year old&#x27;s smaller mouth.  She loves brushing her teeth now.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for the kids -- small for their small mouths, and shorter for their shorter arms. My kids love to brush with their Sonicare, and these replacement brushes fit their handle and work without problems. They are a little pricy but worth it to see the kids brush regularly and thoroughly. Happy dentist, happy family!</li>
    <li> Good toothbrushes but wish they had different colors.  We have a sonic are that the kids share, and it would be SO much better if you could order a pack of 2 with 2 different color brushes so you could tell the brushes apart. They do a good job cleaning, but are a bit pricey for the length of time they last.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewer, I did not receive what was pictured. I received two aqua colored brushes when I specifically wanted the red and blue ones. I have twins that share the same handle, so the same colored brush does not work! Very frustrating that they are not advertising what they are actually selling.</li>
    <li> Like other reviews, not as pictured.  Originally the blue head is small and the red is for an older child.  As pictured, I assumed that is what I would get.  I received two blues of the same size.  Had I received one of each size and color I would have given five stars.  The heads work great and are a good price.  I had my kids write something on their brush head so they would know which is theirs.</li>
    <li> I was a little weary with all the complaints that they weren&#x27;t getting the right kids size.  When these arrived I was pleasantly surprised they were the smaller heads, albeit this aqua color instead of the original red.  Fits fine, works fine, no complaints.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very soft for kids</li>
    <li> Bought these to have replacements for my daughters Philips Sonicare HX6311/07 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush for Kids . Not sure if it will fit or not. Have not been used yet. Will edit post when she does.</li>
    <li> perfect for the childs size sonicare I ordered for christmas.</li>
    <li> These are great! The perfect size toothbrush for my 5 year old and a great deal. Will definitely be purchasing more of these!</li>
    <li> Thank goodness I finally found a replacement head to use on my 7 year old!  The other replacements were too big and made brushing uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> As described. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Exactly what we needed. Perfect size for my 4 year old.</li>
    <li> These compact brush heads are great for my 8 year old.</li>
    <li> Pictured, these looked like full size brush heads, but they&#x27;r not, they are little heads.  The little heads where out faster.  The product is great - I&#x27;d actually buy the kids sonicare over the adult one, but just the picture was misleading here.</li>
    <li> Really sad this didn&#x27;t fit our handles even though it says it would.</li>
    <li> These toothbrush heads are perfect for my 3 and 6 year olds. Plus they fit on our Sonicare toothbrush, so technically there&#x27;s no need to buy the &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34; toothbrush base (although we bought one anyway).</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this toothbrush for my 4 year old----http://www.amazon.com/Philips-HX6311-07-Rechargeable-Toothbrush/dp/B00G5L867C/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1399668180&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;kids+sonic+toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brush head that came with the toothbrush was for an older child so went looking for the smaller brush head and was worried when I saw the reviews....I used subscribe and save and a coupon and paid $13, seemed like an extremely good value......they arrived today and are for sure the correct size. The product number on the box ( HX6032 ) matched the websites recommended size for my daughters age.&lt;br /&gt;Very Pleased. ---For those that get the wrong item, need to contact Amazon, they are very good about fixed any mistakes they may have made----</li>
    <li> My 4 year-old has been using one for the past few weeks, hasn&#x27;t had any complaints, bristles seem to be holding up well.</li>
    <li> Veery satisfied with these toothbrushes.  I only wish Philips would bring back another color choice for the families that have more than oner kid using it.</li>
    <li> Have found these twice now on Amazon at a really good price, and a coupon as well.  My daughter is not a good brusher, so the electric variety helps.  It can just get expensive.</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare HX6311/07 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush for Kids only comes with the larger size brush heads for bigger kids. I was glad I read the reviews which recommended purchasing these compact sized heads. These brush heads are much better suited for my six year old daughter.</li>
    <li> my son only used it for a week and the rubber on the back of the brush is already damage.  The first set that we purchase came with the brush also have the same damage after weeks of use, I thought it was because he bit on the brush every time he use it and that cause the rubber to rip.  After getting this 2nd set now, I know for sure it&#x27;s bad quality material on the bush head.  The amount of money this brand charge, you will think it works better than other brands out there, prove me wrong.  We are going back to the other brands, that cost less and don&#x27;t have this kind of issue.&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product - BUT ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS PRICING !  What next ?  $20 brush heads in 2 years ..?  I hope the Philips people are reading this - I&#x27;m certainly not spreading the word on this product.</li>
    <li> My kids are 8 and 5 years old and both of them love their Sonicare.  They are both up to the full 2 minutes of brushing on full speed and they don&#x27;t complain at all.  The quality of these toothbrushes seems quite good and I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great and good small size for little kids&#x27; mouths. Lasts a long time too.</li>
    <li> I was a little surprised by the smaller tooth brush head then before however still does a great job. Wish the 2 heads were different colors as before to tell them apart since we have 2 kids.</li>
    <li> These are high quality replacement heads for our Sonicare Kids toothbrush.  They are labeled a bit differently, but are identical to the size required for the 4-7 year olds.  Great price and super fast delivery!  Will purchase again :)</li>
    <li> the head is very small. I am afraid that why it is call &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great quality and fit perfectly. Great for three year old sized mouths.</li>
    <li> Works well for our toddler.</li>
    <li> Great and fast delivery! Product looked great!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find any age range description from this product. This is very confusing. Before, I bought the brush heads which are targeted for 4~7 and 7+, and they worked very well for my 7-year-old and 10-year-old. When I received this product yesterday, I was so disappointed, because they are too tiny and look to fit for two-year-old kids!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend using the Philips Sonicare electric tooth brush and replacement heads.  My son&#x27;s teeth and gums are much healthier now than with a manual tooth brush.</li>
    <li> My four year old is turning five in a few days.  He would just stick a toothbrush in his mouth before I got this.  Now, he loves the timer and the fact that he has a toothbrush similar to Mommy.  He enjoys using this but as one of the reviewers recommended, I got a smaller toothbrush head off the bat for him.</li>
    <li> These are great. My one and only complaint is that they come in the same color. I have two kids who are using them and they used to come in two different colors. Now with them being the same color I have to label them. Not a huge deal but a little inconvenient, hence the four stars instead of five.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price and good quality. My little one loves the vibrant colors also.  Best tooth brush for kids.</li>
    <li> A lot of people complain about how there is only one size for younger and older kids. I bought it anyway. My 3 year-old and 7 year-old use the same sized brush heads with no problems or discomfort.</li>
    <li> These are ultra compact vs. The other &amp;#34;for kids&amp;#34; size of sonicare heads (see picture, left is this product, right is the other size I had before)&lt;br /&gt;My kids are 6 &amp; 8 so I like the smaller size of this one.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE sonicare and love that my kids can use sonicare as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record we have the HX6330 model and these fit fine but I am pretty sure all of the kids models can use the same heads.</li>
    <li> These fit on the kids sonicare just right and they do the job.  Our 6 year old has nice shiny clean teeth.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected, but turned out nice. If you have children, don&#x27;t allow these replacement heads deter you from getting this brush. It is really good and my boys had pass marks from the dentists.</li>
    <li> while the brush heads I received are the kids compact ones... they are not as pictured. instead of one red and one blue they are both blue.. disappointed b/c I have two kids sharing the sonicare and the whole reason I ordered these was so we could tell whose brush was whose.&lt;br /&gt;really irritating that the seller can&#x27;t even be bothered to put up a CORRECT picture</li>
    <li> Believe it or not this is for my dog&#x27;s toothbrush. The kid&#x27;s size brush is perfect. He gets A+ from his dentist (he has congenitally bad teeth and she recommended the Sonicare with the child&#x27;s brush).</li>
    <li> these are almost adult-size. Not a good fit for small children&#x27;s mouths. I wish I could find the original size that comes with the Sonicare children&#x27;s toothbrush - those are wonderful!</li>
    <li> I purchased these to go with my daughter&#x27;s sonicare toothbrush. I replaced the old one with this, went to pull the protective cap off and the whole brush came off, breaking off the connector piece along with it. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to fix this and I&#x27;m really upset that now I have to buy a new sonicare toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Very fast, the United States to China four days, surprise, surprise!  It&#x27;s very cheap for the replacement, with a coupon.</li>
    <li> Picture shows one red and one blue. I received two blue brush heads. The reason I purchased this particular set is because I have two kids who share the Sonicare so having different colors is a must.</li>
    <li> There were two blue toothbrush heads, not one blue/one red. Descriptions and pictures should be accurate for this particular product.</li>
    <li> very useful. My son loves it very much, esp those stickers. Easy to use. Now I don&#x27;t worry about his teeth anymore.</li>
    <li> Does not work with my HX6377 brush, the brush head does not vibrate well when brushing.</li>
    <li> These are great and I&#x27;ve bought these before, but this order had like 4 or 5 strands of bristols that stuck out above the rest that hurt my son&#x27;s gums when brushing. I think it was just this pack of brush heads. Never had that happen before.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just fit to my child.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect size for my toddlers little mouth!</li>
    <li> Perfect heads and what you would expect. They are the size for 3-5 yr olds.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommends the smaller heads to help reduce the tendency to scrub your teeth. Sonicare is a great brush, and I would only use the original heads</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  My 5 year old loves it.  I wished it came in more colors.</li>
    <li> My son loved the toothbrush so we&#x27;re loving these as well!</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected</li>
    <li> I got the smaller sizes. Love having them for my little ones since the regular sizes are too huge and gag them.</li>
    <li> The replacement heads fit great buy I did notice (or my 8yr old grandson did) that the brush head was smaller than the original.  Still worked great though</li>
    <li> Pretty good.I love amazon.I love the freedom and democracy of the United States, I hate dictatorship of the Communist Party.</li>
    <li> Best prices I can find for Philips Sonicare are on Amazon.com.  I just hope the claims are true and our children&#x27;s teeth are better served using the Sonicare toothbrushes over traditional toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Great for the kids, but I&#x27;m disappointed that the package no longer has two different colored heads.  There used to be one red and one blue.  The current package only has two blue and no other way of marking or identifying which brush belongs to which kid</li>
    <li> Good price with code.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her Sonicare, and so does my wife (although I still prefer a manual toothbrush). We get both adult and kids brush heads on Subscribe and Save. Very high quality.</li>
    <li> This works even though I am an adult because the spaces between my teeth are so small</li>
    <li> There is a generic brush that costs half the price and works just as good.  I was also disappointed because I thought these brushes would be slightly bigger.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly &amp; was just what I needed!</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t include the color rings so you can&#x27;t give one to each kid and know which one is which.</li>
    <li> delivered fast, and quality is top notch. Worth every penny, Dont go cheap. The cheap ones do not last, and are soft</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush head but its pretty much the same as the other Sonicare heads. On the other hand i would recommend any Sonicare toothbrush to anyone. It cleans your teeth much better and is worth the extra price.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than what I could find at local stores and a few stores have stopped carrying them.  Amazon rarely disappoints.  Great to have extra on hand in case my son gets a cold or sore throat which necessitates changing the heads more often than normal.</li>
    <li> Love these for my electric toothbrush.  Good price here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> These say they are for ages 4-7, but after my son had cavities at 2, despite twice daily brushing, we wanted something more than his manual brush. He loves it and the dentist is happy with his teeth. The lower setting works great for him, and the size has not been an issue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having these delivered every 3months for almost 2 years. They have always been one red and one blue. The packaging is now different and they are both the same blue color. Very dissatisfied. How are my kids suppose to know which brush to use. Poor product.</li>
    <li> My 7 year old daughter has been using the Sonicare toothbrush since she was 4 years old, and she loves it!  My 4 year old son just received his Sonicare toothbrush a few months ago, and he&#x27;s loving his too.  I buy these replacement heads specifically for ages 4-7 because they are the perfect size for their little mouths.  Unfortunately, Sonicare has changed their packaging, so now, instead of getting two different colored replacement heads, you get two heads of the same light blue color.  It can be confusing for parents who have two or more kids, who either share a toothbrush (and just switch the heads) or who have identical Sonicares.  Fortunately, my daughter has the older Sonicare kids toothbrush, which is red, while my son has the newer one, which is a teal blue color, so they can easily tell their toothbrushes apart even though they both have the same colored head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length of the brush head from base to top is about 2 3/4 inches long and the head itself is just over .5 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once when I ran out of this size replacement heads I used the size up, (the one for ages 7-10) and immediately noticed the difference.  That size head is significantly longer (closer to the length of the replacement heads for adults) and is much harder for little ones to control.  As a matter of fact, my daughter did such a poor job of using the toothbrush with the longer head that my husband and I had to brush her teeth for her.  So, even though my daughter is now seven, I still buy this smaller size replace head for her, and I always make sure to have one on hand for whenever needed.  I buy them through Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save so I never run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend getting this size replacement brush head for any little ones who uses the Sonicare toothbrush.  FYI these replacement heads also fit, and work with, the adult toothbrush.  So, you could just buy the heads for your little one and use with your own Sonicare.....the kids&#x27; toothbrush is about the same length as the adult one, (the actual toothbrush not the head) only a bit chunkier so kids should be able to manipulate the adult Sonicare as easily as they would the kids.is about the same length as the adult one, (the actual toothbrush not the head) only a bit chunkier so kids should be able to manipulate the adult Sonicare as easily as they would the kids.</li>
    <li> These are the little ones for younger kids. If you bought the toothbrush that came with two different size heads, compact and regular, and they were red for compact and blue for regular, these are like the size of the red one. Perfect for my little guy, although he questioned the color. I was worried it would be too big or too little, but it was perfect. Easy change.</li>
    <li> Ordering again. Works well for our toddler who fell in love with our sonicare. He uses the compact head still.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my child, she brushes 10 minutes every night and keeps her smile white and cavity free!!! Love it</li>
    <li> I bought these for myself because I&#x27;m recovering from gum surgery and needed something very gentle to brush with.  I use them with the Sonicare HX6311/07 kids toothbrush.</li>
    <li> GREAT heads! Way smaller than the ones that came with my 7 year old daughters toothbrush which is way better for her little mouth. The originals were the same size as my adult sonicare.</li>
    <li> The child brush head is very good with a good</li>
    <li> The area between the replacement head and the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t seal perfectly so it creates an area were mold grows.  I now keep it apart and clean it with vinegar often.  Beware of this issue.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for! My youngest is so happy now it actually fits his mouth.</li>
    <li> Great product. These are the smaller heads for children around 3-6.</li>
    <li> These are the replacement heads that Sonicare customer service said that I needed.  They are very hard to get on and off, but they work great.</li>
    <li> Great Transactions. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! I haven&#x27;t been able to find the compact heads at any of the stores and the head that comes with the brush is a little too big for my 4 yr old&#x27;s mouth. These are the perfect size.</li>
    <li> The brushes are much smaller than the ones that came originally with the brush.</li>
    <li> These are smaller, compact heads. Good for small kids.</li>
    <li> good quality and good price</li>
    <li> A must for younger kids using a Sonicare, I think.  We started our 5yo with an adult head then switched when these arrived.  The compact head definitely made it much easier.  The rubber coating also makes it more comfortable when the back of the brush head bumps his teeth.</li>
    <li> Not a lot to say besides it&#x27;s exactly like the head that came with my toothbrush. I like it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush; it works!</li>
    <li> Bought these as a replacement for the kids sonicare. He&#x27;s only two but it was the only way to get him to let us brush his teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are slightly smaller than the standard brushes so it works great to get in there and clean his teeth.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly can&#x27;t beat the price fits adult tooth brush and kids</li>
    <li> the product is as described</li>
    <li> Good product, but they still gouge on pricing</li>
    <li> Brushes work great with toothbrush and kids love them. End results are always fantastic.</li>
    <li> Work great with no issue.</li>
    <li> I really like the Sonicare for kids toothbrush.  It does a great job of cleaning the teeth.  I don&#x27;t love how expensive the replacement heads are, but my dentist recommended the toothbrush so I guess I need to keep ordering the replacement heads.</li>
    <li> Very good from chinese man .</li>
    <li> have not used yet, but satisfied with the quality for a long time</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my young ones&#x27; mouths.</li>
    <li> These were a perfect fit for our kids  toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> great brush head for my son&#x27;s electric toothbrush. Not too bulky and not to flimsy, it covers what small mouth he has.</li>
    <li> These toothbrush heads are perfect!  They are even smaller than the original ones that were purchase initially on the toothbrush, and we are thrilled with the price and purchase!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!!  And so is the two-year-old!</li>
    <li> It is compatible with the adult version!</li>
    <li> for daughter, a little different from oens when I bpught it, but it is ok</li>
    <li> These are the small heads for small children not the medium size for 7 and up.</li>
    <li> Kids like them and we get good reviews from our dentist.  They seem to hold up for about two months.  My five year old really likes to chew on them so I don&#x27;t expect them to last the three months as advertised.</li>
    <li> These kids brushes are actually smaller than the ones that came with the original Philips Sonicare for Kids toothbrush. They have fewer bristle rows and has a shorter neck, as well. However, they are soft and made in USA. I am including a snapshot (the right side is the original, the left side is this order for your reference). Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrush heads. I have tried out the &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; brand and they just do not hold up at all. You aren&#x27;t saving any money when you have to change them out weekly! These hold up for the few months they need to... I have 4 kids with sonic kids toothbrushes (2 1/2-8)- so I have these on subscribe &amp; save to save the 15%!</li>
    <li> Works just as it should. I wish they would come in larger packs. I love how long the battery lasts between charges.</li>
    <li> fit well as replacement heads arrived quickly my children are now keenly cleaning to prevent needing fillings i will order again</li>
    <li> Product exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 3.5 years old Phillips sonic toothbrush.</li>
    <li> The compact size is small enough to comfortably brush my 2 year old&#x27;s teeth.</li>
    <li> Both heads are blue. Does not help when two kids use the same electric toothbrush with only the brush head to differentiate them</li>
    <li> For some reason unknown, the base of the bristle turns black very fast. Probably within a month of use. The adult version does not.</li>
    <li> Great price for refills  :)</li>
    <li> Great size for my little one&#x27;s mouth, she is almost 3. Not supposed to use the electronic brush till they are 4 years old. We just let he hold the brush without turning the switch on. She still loves her new tooth brush and I like that it gets her ready for the electronic brushing.</li>
    <li> this toothbrush is extremely soft!</li>
    <li> Item as described thank you!</li>
    <li> Fits onto the Kids Sonicare perfectly.  These are the age 4-7 brushes.</li>
    <li> Really works for an adult if you have gum problems.</li>
    <li> Makes brushing so easy for kids!</li>
    <li> better size than the one that comes with the toothbrush ( 6 years old boy )</li>
    <li> The price on these replacement heads is so high! As soon as possible I switched my son to the adult version--replacements aren&#x27;t nearly as expensive.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase as these heads fit my daughter&#x27;s Philips Sonicare HX 6311/07 toothbrush. I have actually found these heads to be better quality than the original one that came with my daughter&#x27;s 6311.  Because of that, and because the price was fair (especially when you use the Subscribe and Save feature), that is why I gave these 5 stars. They also seem slightly more durable than the previous ones, and fit my 4 year old&#x27;s mouth perfectly.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is comfortable.  I am an adult, but I have a very small mouth.  I have to use baby plates when the dentist takes an x-ray.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked at many brush heads and finally ended up buying premium brand name brushes. One brush head lasted 4 brushes and the other - 6. Bristles became uneven in length and stared to hurt my little one&#x27;s gums, so had to throw them into the garbage. At $18 for 2 brush heads, my expectation is they would last as advertised, but it isn&#x27;t the case. There are a lot of good reviews here, so I am assuming the issue is with this batch. Anyway, I am not buying them again - will be buying generic heads next time - can&#x27;t see them last less than these...</li>
    <li> These toothbrush heads are still great, it&#x27;s just a shame that they stopped selling them in packs with two different colors! We have a 5 and 6 year old who share the toothbrush base, and before we always got one toothbrush head in red and one in blue, so it was easy to tell which head went to each kid.  Not so much now.  I&#x27;ve tried writing initials on the head base but they always wash off.  Now it&#x27;s down to hoping they remember which one is theirs based on the side it&#x27;s on.  Not easy for that age.  Bring back different colored bases!!!!!</li>
    <li> perfect sized brush heads for our 2.5 year old.</li>
    <li> it,s good for my kid.</li>
    <li> I hate these don&#x27;t match the color of my son&#x27;t Sonicare. But they are best investment I can make to my son&#x27;t teeths.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement from Phillips. Soft bristles and small head which is good for the younger kids</li>
    <li> Couldnt find this size anywhere else and the kid clarisinic brush brings a brush head that is too big for my 8 and 6 year olds.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my 6 yr old and 4 yr old duaghters</li>
    <li> The item I ordered shows a compact kids&#x27; brush head - the small one, with no middle ridge. I received the larger one for older children. Since I still brush my 4 year old&#x27;s teeth for her with the Sonicare (she brushes herself with a non-electric toothbrush), I&#x27;m going to keep them because it&#x27;s not worth the trouble to return &amp; exchange. But -- the next time I want to purchase the small brush heads, I&#x27;ll just go to a big-box store, because Amazon apparently can&#x27;t keep it straight.</li>
