      <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>I found it gave me nice bold lines</li>
      <li>It glides on the eyelid very easily (be sure to pull your eyelid taught for best application), and it leaves a nice thick line that makes my eyes look like they &amp;#34;woke up&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>EASY..</li>
      <li>I would like to see a smaller version of this eyeliner to have more precision, but still happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply to just those areas where you need it.</li>
      <li>It blends easily for that &amp;#34;smokey eye&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>SO easy to apply, but it does smear (as others have said)</li>
      <li>on so smooth</li>
      <li>It is fairly inexpensive as far as makeup goes.</li>
      <li>The brown is just the right shade, it is super easy to apply and smudge to get a smoky look and it washes off easily.  </li>
      <li>:) I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, lasts a long time, and gives a nice defined look to my eyes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth giving it a try.</li>
      <li>but beware if you don&#x27;t have a steady hand or will be sweating it smudges easily.</li>
      <li>this is my favorite so far.</li>
      <li>It works great at concealing small balding patches by darkening the scalp in those areas so your remaining hair can cover it and</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and soft.</li>
      <li>just right , I will be buying more of these in the future, you cant go&lt;br /&gt;wrong</li>
      <li>I like the product very much and have used it for a couple of years.</li>
      <li>It does &amp;#34;smolder&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s not going stay put and look like it did when you first put it on.</li>
      <li>That being said it is still a good product for your arsenal but definitely not the same staying power as the gel liners.</li>
      <li>I like this eyeliner very much, just the right shade of brown to look natural.</li>
      <li>The color does not stay too much and the intensity is not too much either.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always appreciated the quality of L&#x27;Oreal products.  </li>
      <li>It arrived in a very speedy time also..</li>
      <li>VERY SOFT,GOES ON</li>
      <li>It does not stay put at all, and the nice look I had in the morning ends up looking really messy within an hour or so.  </li>
      <li>Have it black for a more intense look.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for everyone.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for all ages.</li>
      <li>I scoured reviews trying to find a good, if not great, new eyeliner to try and I came upon this one.</li>
      <li>Think I&#x27;ll stick with my liquid heli new.</li>
      <li>TOO!!A LITTLE DARKER THAN WHAT I EXPECTED, BUT STILL A NICE PRODUCT FOR EYES, THANKS</li>
      <li>Always creamy, doesn&#x27;t need to be sharpened often.&lt;br /&gt;Not too heavy or too light.</li>
      <li>You can then style your hair as you like using gel, pomade, hairspray, or just natural.</li>
      <li>If I am in a rush to head out the door (which, as a mom of a 3 yr old and 3 month old is pretty much daily), I can put on this eyeliner, a spot of blush, and lipstick/gloss, and feel presentable and perhaps even a little bit pretty.</li>
      <li>It glides on easily and doesn&#x27;t tug or pull the delicate eyelid skin or under eye area.  </li>
      <li>I have dry skin, this does not glide gently.</li>
      <li>Finally found a SOFT stick liner-hooray-in brown-double hooray!</li>
      <li>Hard to be accurate.</li>
      <li>On the other hand if you like lining your lovely lids with a thick ol&#x27; line of color then this IS the pencil for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
      <li>Just the right shade instead of black which looks harsh as you get older, stays on, no smudging.</li>

    <li> This eyeliner is so smooth, and the fact that it came with a sharpener is great!  What a great product.</li>
    <li> When I first apply this eyeliner I&#x27;m very happy with it.  The brown is just the right shade, it is super easy to apply and smudge to get a smoky look and it washes off easily.  But the problem is that every time I look in the mirror after I get started with my day, I have eyeliner all over my eye area.  It does not stay put at all, and the nice look I had in the morning ends up looking really messy within an hour or so.  I&#x27;m really disappointed because if it stayed in place it would be exactly what I want.</li>
    <li> I like this eyeliner very much, just the right shade of brown to look natural. It has staying power, so after you apply it, it stays where you put it on your eye. (at least it does on me) It blends easily for that &amp;#34;smokey eye&amp;#34; look. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always appreciated the quality of L&#x27;Oreal products.  The &amp;#34;smoldering&amp;#34; eyeliner lives up to that.  I like the product very much and have used it for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin, this does not glide gently. Think I&#x27;ll stick with my liquid heli new.</li>
    <li> The color does not stay too much and the intensity is not too much either.&lt;br /&gt;I think I prefer it in black.</li>
    <li> i love how it glides and it stays on for the rest of the day. this is my favorite so far. I hope there&#x27;s no issue when its time to sharpen it.</li>
    <li> Love i want mre, stays in all day. Would definitely recommend. 10☆s</li>
    <li> SO easy to apply, but it does smear (as others have said)</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner. Easy to apply and soft. Doesn&#x27;t pull eye skin and has a thicker tip which I love for better coverage. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this eye liner.  It does &amp;#34;smolder&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s not going stay put and look like it did when you first put it on.</li>
    <li> NICE LINER..VERY SOFT,GOES ON EASY..REALLY GREAT SHARPENER TOO!!A LITTLE DARKER THAN WHAT I EXPECTED, BUT STILL A NICE PRODUCT FOR EYES, THANKS</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many eyeliners over the years and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  It glides on easily and doesn&#x27;t tug or pull the delicate eyelid skin or under eye area.  Highly recommended for all ages.</li>
    <li> Alopecia sufferers or just having small balding patches? If you have hair-loss patches, this can be helpful as a concealer. It works great at concealing small balding patches by darkening the scalp in those areas so your remaining hair can cover it and the scalp not be noticeable. It&#x27;s easy to apply to just those areas where you need it. You can then style your hair as you like using gel, pomade, hairspray, or just natural. Doesn&#x27;t matter depending on your desired style. It&#x27;s not a miracle solution, but it may help just be enough to hide those patches. It&#x27;s worth giving it a try. Just be advised, that when you wash your hair, the dark color will wash out. It provides a temporary topical solution to conceal hair-loss.</li>
    <li> Just the right shade instead of black which looks harsh as you get older, stays on, no smudging. Staple for me.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous Smoldering Eyeliner is a good purchase for the money. It is fairly inexpensive as far as makeup goes. I found it gave me nice bold lines but beware if you don&#x27;t have a steady hand or will be sweating it smudges easily. That being said it is still a good product for your arsenal but definitely not the same staying power as the gel liners.</li>
    <li> If you are thinking:  &amp;#34;this just looks too fat for an eye pencil&amp;#34; then you would be correct. The line goes down way to thick. Don&#x27;t think pastey thick...like literally the line is fat. Hard to be accurate. On the other hand if you like lining your lovely lids with a thick ol&#x27; line of color then this IS the pencil for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great color just too fat.</li>
    <li> I use this pencil at the base of my lashes and it looks like I have such thick lashes.  Have it black for a more intense look.</li>
    <li> I really love using this eyeliner product. It is easy to use, lasts a long time, and gives a nice defined look to my eyes.</li>

    <li> Finally found a SOFT stick liner-hooray-in brown-double hooray!</li>
    <li> This pencil goes on smoothly and glides evenly creating a perfect line top and bottom.  The sharpener works well to keep a point and it doesn&#x27;t flake off.  I highly recommend it for everyone.</li>
    <li> this eyeliner is my routine make up using everyday.&lt;br /&gt;I have perchased it for more than 3 times. but price from amazon is cheaper than store ones</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, delightful product, great shipping and not melted when it arrived! Love the sharpener with it, that made my day!</li>
    <li> Creates nice line and easy to use compared to liquid eyeliner.  Have found that sharpener tends to wear out as you use up the pencil over several months.</li>
    <li> I love this liner pensil, just what I wanted and the eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;goes on so smooth just right , I will be buying more of these in the future, you cant go&lt;br /&gt;wrong with this item..It arrived in a very speedy time also..</li>
