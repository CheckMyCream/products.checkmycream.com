      <li>Fantastic product!</li>
      <li>really love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the greatest grooming product known to woman! My last one lasted over a year; that&#x27;s less than a dollar a month for effortlessly having perfectly trimmed pubes. I cannot sing this amazing too enough praises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do use it dry over the toilet though.</li>
    <li> Easiest, safest and comfortable way to keep the downtown tame without resorting to waxing or shaving or using scissors.</li>
    <li> I read in other comments that there were 3 razors in this set, even though the description says there is one. Love this razor, didn&#x27;t love the confusion over how many razors would actually be included (my package came with one)</li>
    <li> Got a sample in a pack of Venus razors. LOVE IT. It works like a charm to keep everything nice and trim and tidy. Haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement in stores (mine&#x27;s a year old, the blade still cuts great, but it&#x27;s been dropped too much and the head won&#x27;t stay on anymore), so came to Amazon. Yay!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much. Not a good product, but it&#x27;s not a bad one either. Just didn&#x27;t make much of a difference to me and I felt I was better off just using a normal razor.</li>
    <li> works great, cuts very short but doesn&#x27;t shave</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It&#x27;s so easy to use and convenient.  Please never stop selling this product, Amazon and Gillette!</li>
    <li> Not sure why local stores stop selling this. But it&#x27;s the quickest, less messy bikini shaver out there</li>
    <li> BUY IT. This thing is AMAZING. Works SO well.</li>
    <li> Love it! Trims is just right for me to feel like a woman, but not look like a hairy monkey. Just wish the blade was replaceable.</li>
    <li> kind of an odd product, didn&#x27;t work for me - couldn&#x27;t figure out the angling I guess</li>
    <li> This razor is great to avoid razor burn in sensitive areas! I have been trying to find refills for the head with no luck yet.</li>
    <li> Works well if you don&#x27;t want complete removal of your pubic hair.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting yourself.</li>
    <li> Great product. I am rating it a 3 bc it is really expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> Returning. The razor was open and had been put back together (very poorly) with packing tape.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  It was delivered on time and does exactly what is supposed to do which allow me to shave in a more safe way.</li>
    <li> Difficult to use; I tried it twice, then went back to my trimmer.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this trimmer. I&#x27;ve used it for years now but this is the first time I&#x27;ve found it on its own. I first found it in a large multi-pack of Venus Sensitive disposables from Costco, and later in a \\&quot;Bikini care\\&quot; set that included an Embrace razor and a moisturizer for $10 at Walmart. Well, I&#x27;m not gonna keep buying those kits, I don&#x27;t need more Venus OR Embrace razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this trimmer works very well for keeping my ladybits hair at bay. I cannot stand to shave down to the skin there; and I hate using my electric trimmer because it&#x27;s loud, inconvenient, and pinches and pulls at skin and hair. (Needless to say, scissors are not an option.) I will sometimes use a depilatory (Veet/Nair) to just get it all gone at once but I know that has to be racking up my risk of cancer percentage or something. This razor is well suited for ALL tight spaces (so long as skin is pulled taught) and has never pinched or cut me even though I have a lot of loose skin in that area -- though not as much as my boyfriend, who also uses this product! It&#x27;s the only thing I can get him to use to keep his trimmed as well! He doesn&#x27;t like the electric trimmer there either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price kinda stinks but the fact I&#x27;m purchasing here means it&#x27;s the cheapest I can find so far from a legit merchant. You should be able to get at least 2 for $5. If they would stop making so much of these things \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; we could all pay a lot less and make the planet a little happier too. In this particular case, though, I can see a safety issue with removable cartridges, should it accidentally pop off and get \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; somewhere. D:</li>
    <li> Worked ok, nothing spectacular.</li>
    <li> This thing works. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly because of the convenience and ease of use.  The blade is sharp but it&#x27;s nearly impossible to cut yourself because of the guide comb.  This can be a bit difficult to clean out, but it lasts a very long time before it needs replacement.</li>
    <li> This trimmer makes the process very easy.  An electrice razor is too heavy and combersome.  The Venus product is also easy to travel with!</li>
    <li> I love these razors for bikini shaving. I always purchased these in the past at Walmart or Target. For some reason I was unable to find them in the store - all gone and didn&#x27;t look like they would be restocking. Was happy to find them online - great price as well.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. it trimms the right length and there is no razor burns or bumps. very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This was my first time grooming down there and this works wonderfully! Keeps the hair really short but doesn&#x27;t cause itchiness. I highly recommend it. I&#x27;ve used mine 5 times and it still works like new.</li>
    <li> I love this bikini trimmer!  I wish this was easier to find for purchase.  Not to mention, why isn&#x27;t the head refillable?  I&#x27;m not the most planet consciences person but what a waste throwing away the entire product - that&#x27;s why I took off 1 star, not refillable and wasteful.  However, this is the best bikini trimmer I have used.</li>
    <li> I keep seeing these things for literally a dollar when combined with Amazon coupons.  Combined with the reviews, I thought trying one out was a no brainer.  However, I thought it may be useful to talk about why it didn&#x27;t work for me and why it might not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see trimming as an easier, less rash-inducing alternative to shaving - something that could be done at least weekly.  However, the results you can get with this trimmer are nowhere close to that.  Actually, I barely consider this a &#x27;trimmer&#x27; in the sense that I feel like I would have to have close to full hair growth (not what I&#x27;m going for at all) in order for this to actually trim anything - there is no mechanism to adjust the length you want your hair trimmed to, and the default it is set to is, well, very long.  If I let hair grow for a month and then tried to use this thing it might do something, but at that point, you&#x27;re getting results closer to those of scissors rather than a razor, even an electric razor, which doesn&#x27;t get as close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the head pivots upward and downward, which is actually a detriment.  The head is both large and really lightweight, so any directional change causes the head to pivot.  I feel like this makes it have inconsistent contact with the skin, thus reduced trimming ability.  I would&#x27;ve preferred a heavier, more compact head, like a higher-quality disposable razor cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually think this trimmer might be more useful to men, who may like to reduce their hair without having an obvious &#x27;trimmed&#x27; look.  I would imagine that it may also serve that purpose for underarms, but I&#x27;m not willing to test that myself.  The reviews don&#x27;t back me up on this, but I suspect that most women aiming to shorten their hair would like to shorten it more than this trimmer allows.</li>
    <li> The only thing I use! So much better than shaving all the way and getting razor burn! Keeps it very short!</li>
    <li> Why do they have this product on hold??? I have the other set that also comes with a razor and bikini cream for after shaving and there is nothing wrong with this trimmer. I liked it so much that my husband also wanted one... So when i saw this, I thought it was perfect as he doesn&#x27;t need all of that other stuff... It was on sale and had a coupon for a great deal and now i can&#x27;t buy it. I should have ordered it when i had the chance. That said, I have never actually seen this package in person... So i guess i can&#x27;t judge what the problem is with it...</li>
    <li> Once I tried this I was hooked.  They used to only come in a pack that included a non-disposable razor.  I would spend twice as much to buy them as a pack just to get this trimmer.  I&#x27;m so excited it comes seperatly now.</li>
    <li> The only trimmer I can find that I like.  I can find it in stores but it&#x27;s packaged with a razor and lotion which I don&#x27;t use necessarily.  Will continue to order these.</li>
    <li> I had been using electric wet/dry trimmers for my bikini area for years, but the cheap ones didn&#x27;t last long and the expensive ones were so involved.  This is simple, cheap, small, and really works well (and painlessly) in very sensitive areas.  The only complaint that some people might have is that you can not choose the length of the trim (it&#x27;s about 1/4 or 1/8 inch).</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the perfect pubic hair razor that will trim the area close but not bald.  No nubby bumps with this razor.  I stumbled upon it by accident and then could not find it again in stores until Amazon. I bought 6 on the spot!</li>
    <li> Single blade, easy to use, it does its job properly.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they had the trimmer blade sold separately, It&#x27;s such a waste to throw away the whole thing.</li>
    <li> Love it! And I can never find it in stores anymore. So glad I was able to find it here without buying 6 more razors with it</li>
    <li> It works great. I only wish that you only needed to replace the head. Instead you just throw the whole thing away, feels like kind do a waste. But as far as the work of the product it works great.</li>
    <li> I love this razor and will buy it again. I wish I could subscribe and save it.</li>
    <li> it makes my bikini area perfectly trimmed! no need for cuts of bloods !! I definetly reccomend it for women and men too acually!</li>
    <li> I first received one of these Bikini trimmers free with my Venus razor and though it was awesome! So when it got dull I searched for it on Amazon bought another one. While searching, I also saw the Noxzema Bikini Plus Shave and Trim -- so I bought a pack of those (3 pack) too!  Well, in comparison, the Venus trimmer is very large and therefore a little difficult to get into those tough to reach spots, if you know what I mean. It is also quite expensive for just one razor. I recommend the Noxzema!</li>
    <li> Sometimes I get lazy and don&#x27;t feel like shaving at all....which is really bad since I&#x27;m like really hairy in general and my hair grows super fast. So in the winter &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; tends to look like another person---which then requires scissors and several razors to fix. This was perfect because it took the place of the scissors plus I can totally see myself using this is the winter for &amp;#34;trimming&amp;#34; so that it doesn&#x27;t look like such a hot mess once summer hits and it&#x27;s time to go bald eagle....</li>
    <li> I love these! The only way they could improve this product is if they made it with replaceable heads.</li>
    <li> okay I have to be honest I don&#x27;t use it to trim my bikini area. I happen to use it to trim my underarms and it works amazing. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve waited so long to try out this product</li>
    <li> Get rid of your scissors.  This razor is all you need!  Highly recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to worry about nicking themselves while getting a nice, even trim.</li>
    <li> This popped up on sale once at Amazon and I had never heard of it but I do believe it works better than a razor around the bikini area for trimming rather than shaving.  It is designed differently than a razor and I do believe it is less likely to nick.</li>
    <li> So easy to use!  I love these!!  They last a long time and are easier to use than electric shavers.</li>
    <li> Best way to trim your bikini area. So easy and safe. Love this product! So happy I found it. Great buy!!</li>
    <li> Basically, it can get it VERY short, and works wonderfully. The issue is, if you get it down to the shortest it can go, you&#x27;re in for about a week of severe itching. I think if you were more careful not to get it quite so short it would be fine, but as it is, it&#x27;s been a week since I used it and I&#x27;m only just now comfortable and itch free. If you buy this, do not trim down too much!</li>
    <li> When I purchased this I got a great discount on it. I believe I spent less than $3 for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this trimmer. It is the only one I&#x27;ve tried so i don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. But so far I really like it. It&#x27;s gentle and I like how I can control how much i take off. I have to go over it a few times if I want a really close trim, but I don&#x27;t mind that. Although it works nicely, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth 8 bucks. Maybe $5 at the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can get another discount or coupon, I&#x27;d definitely get this again once I throw mine out. I&#x27;m hoping it will last me awhile though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine but this isn&#x27;t a great price for a single cheap plastic razor with a trimmer guard.</li>
    <li> Item trims the hair to a nice even length. I have to use it in multiple directions to get an even shave but with a little patience the results are what I expected. It trims the hair to the perfect length to then have a bikini wax. Waxing always hurts more when the hair is longer. If you have waited a little too long in between waxes, this is great to trim the overall length down prior to waxing.</li>
    <li> My new best beauty tool! Very easy to use and completely painless!</li>
    <li> It still irritated my skin a bit but then again I am like crazy sensitive: EVERYTHING seems to irritate my skin. This is probably great for a normal person though, so keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;No other probs</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for me. i wanted a clean shave (close to skin kind). i think this product only shorten hairs</li>
    <li> Really this should only be used if you&#x27;ve got LOTS of thick, coarse hair. If you&#x27;re looking for smooth sailing this is not the right product. I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the word TRIMMER enough. Will not do anything for hair under 3/4 to 1 inch in length.</li>
    <li> I tried the Gillette Venus Bikini Trimmer and just fell in love with the clean feeling it leaves me.  I tried Noxzema Bikini Plus Shave and Trim Disposable Shavers because it was so much cheaper and i thought i could save money but it really shaved me.  I did not leave the hairs just long enough so that you don&#x27;t get razor burn and you don&#x27;t get poked as they grow back in.  I ended up throwing away the Noxzema Bikini kit and re-ordering this one by Gillette.  I like the results so much that I use it year round not just in bikini season to keep that clean feeling.</li>
    <li> simple, cost effective, works great!</li>
    <li> This works great! I really like it. No burn or irritation, or anything like that. I always use it with shaving cream or gel. It is fantastic at getting the bulk of hair out of the way -- it&#x27;s nice on its own, trimmed, and it&#x27;s also nice in preparation for a shave. It makes the shave end up a lot more smoothly since there&#x27;s less hair to get out of the way. It&#x27;s not adjustable (there are no different lengths to trim), but depending upon the direction in which you use it, you can jerry-rig getting a little longer versus a little shorter length.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I don&#x27;t get why is it so hard to find at stores.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I wish they would make them as a cartridge that could be put on the razor handle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different devices that claim to do what the Bikini Trimmer does, and nothing gets the job done faster, easier and with a nice, even trim. Some reviews claim they wish it had a changeable head, but think about it...you don&#x27;t use it daily, like a razor, so I don&#x27;t mind buying a new one from time to time. The head swivels and is very easy to control and get whatever length you want. Very effective! I&#x27;ve been buying these for over a year and will continue to do so. Wish they sold them at my local store....makes me wonder if everyone around here is a little overgrown....</li>
    <li> I am totally sold on this trimmer. It makes it so easy to trim those hard to see areas without fear of razor cuts in unfortunate places.</li>
    <li> I love the fact it doesn&#x27;t trim to the skin like a razor.  I do not have any issues with razor bumps or being itchy which I had with a traditional razor.  Have fun trimming. :-)</li>
    <li> This will not give you a perfect trim by any means.  But if you&#x27;re like me and you just want to shorten that bush, then I think this is great.  It does the job, with a little help afterword from some scissors.  It is far from professional, but much less expensive.  And I&#x27;ve tried using only scissors and that just makes a big ole mess.  The Bikini Trimmer is a great alternative to using scissors as long as you&#x27;re okay with it not coming out perfectly even all around.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical at first. It&#x27;s a strange feeling when it cuts the hairs, but it works great. It was shorter than I thought it&#x27;d be but it wasn&#x27;t itchy and once I got over the surprise at its length I actually thought it was great.</li>
    <li> This is great to trim with! The blade is protected so you can&#x27;t cut or knock yourself! I added this on to my bimonthly subscribe and save, reduced price, and I don&#x27;t have to remember to buy it.</li>
    <li> No razor burn, no nicks and cuts and no scissors! This makes it so easy to keep everything trimmed, just don&#x27;t expect to be bare with it.</li>
    <li> Works well, I like it.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for me--maybe i got a defective one given other reviews seem positive, which was why I tried ordering it.</li>
    <li> Great product but all of the ones I ordered came opened.</li>
    <li> best ever, wish i could find it in stores. perfect amount of trim, looks professional if that&#x27;s the word for it :) haha!</li>
    <li> This thing is incredibly cheap feeling. I don&#x27;t like how it works or feels and will not be buying another one ever. I don&#x27;t trust it!</li>
    <li> I love this item. I bought it, taking a chance on it, and I love it. I wish that stores around me sold this instead of having to buy it online.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described - thanks for the simple buying experience.</li>
    <li> My favorite bikini trimmer by far! It is so comfortable and easy to use. No problems with snagging or pulling hairs or getting cuts of any kind. They trim close enough so the hair is nice and short, but does not trim too short to where you get that itchy feeling. The entire trimmer is disposable and you need a whole new trimmer to replace old/worn out one. It would be nice if these trimmers came with disposable heads like Venus razors do. But I still buy these regardless, they are the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is that I have a difficult time finding these, in stores or online. I hope Gillette doesn&#x27;t discontinue making these and produces more of them. I have no idea what I would do without these bikini trimmers. I can&#x27;t even remember what I used to use to trim bikini area prior to using these. LOL…they are that great!</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use in the shower. It trims well and contains the mess to your shower. The hair is short without being too short.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Problem is when the summer season is over, the stores in my area quit carrying them. They last longer than regular shavers because u don&#x27;t have to use them as often. I just need to replace mine because the head broke off. I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Keeps me groom and trim, love it.</li>
    <li> I used to use a Remington electric bikini trimmer and it was horrible -- I would always wind up taking off the guard and I would terrify myself every time I would use it, plus I hated cleaning it.  I love the venus because it is disposable and works perfectly for just trimming.  LOVE it.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool for a quick trim and shave in those more discrete areas needed. You can get a few uses out of it too!</li>
    <li> Great little bikini trimmer that&#x27;s easy to use but it rusted pretty fast. I also wish it had replaceable heads. Its pretty hard to find in stores as well and kind of expensive for how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> For the price this was OK, but really a razor is better</li>
    <li> I had never used one of these before, and was surprised that what I had ordered was not a regular razor :)  After I got over my initial shock of the combed teeth on the razor, I decided to give it a whirl.  It was actually pretty useful and very easy to use.  I liked it so much that I ordered some more bikini trimmers, but this time in the Noxema brand.  Those were much smaller and I was wishing I had stuck to the Gillette brand.  Will definitely be ordering more of this brand next time!!!</li>
    <li> I need to buy another one of these! Theyre great and you don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting yourself.</li>
    <li> love this thing it really does what it says it does however I would suggest you use some kind of shaving cream with it its hard when just using it plain in the shower with water to glide against the skin easily.</li>
    <li> Wow- such a simple idea but it&#x27;s awesome.  Highly suggested.</li>
    <li> The trimmer razor arrived out of the packaging. I spent $15 (razor plus shipping) and can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
    <li> Am I using this wrong? lol&lt;br /&gt;It couldnt pick up any of my hairs!!&lt;br /&gt;I feel like in order for this to work you have to have a full grown weeded bush for the blade to even catch.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just at a loss as to how this got such great reviews..?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too bad no one else carries this. I believe I got one as a gift with purchase from Costco, but they don&#x27;t have it alone.</li>
    <li> I freaking love this thing.  The first time I got one of these &amp;#34;bikini trimmers&amp;#34; was as a freebie in a pack of disposable Venus razors.  I thought it looked weird and didn&#x27;t touch it for a while.  I hate shaving my pubic hair all the way off because getting razor burn anywhere near your genitals is not cute and it can be painful.  Waxing them all off is incredibly painful and a burden on your wallet.  I tried Nair on my legs once and the burning that came with it was so awful I don&#x27;t even want to imagine what it would be like anywhere near my &amp;#34;bikini&amp;#34; region.  So that means the options are definitely limited if I don&#x27;t want to be walking around with a mega bush.  Before I used this fancy little trimmer, I would use scissors and hack away, and that would end up looking so bad that I would end up shaving with the grain for minimal razor burn.  Then I got these totally by accident and I would never go back. This trimmer grooms your pubes to a perfect, even length.  I used my first one for about a year until the teeth started falling out and then the head kept popping off and made it impossible to continue using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that these are nearly impossible to find in stores, and when you can find them, it&#x27;s usually in some kind of package deal.  Venus should sell just the replacement heads to be more environmentally conscious.  Also, this isn&#x27;t for a smooth shave like you would expect of a Venus Razor, it&#x27;s called a trimmer because that&#x27;s what it does.  If you want your genitals to be completely bare, then this is not the product for you.  If you are looking for prim and proper pubes, definitely buy this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, small, no need of batteries, doesn&#x27;t need to be charged.&lt;br /&gt;Great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect! :)</li>
    <li> Who knew? I don&#x27;t have teen girls to talk to so don&#x27;t know how long these have been around. Just stumbled across it. Works perfectly. No need to be nervous.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much. Better off with an electric trimmer. Keep in mind that you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this, but not sure if I&#x27;d buy it again. Yes, it does the job for the most part, but it gets difficult to adequately trim some of my female anatomy &amp;#34;curves&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ll just leave it at that. It doesn&#x27;t leave any razor burn and it doesn&#x27;t hurt - awesome. I think an improvement would be to include multiple razor guards instead of a &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; type.</li>
    <li> The actual trimmer works well, and is easy to grip in the shower, but it trims a bit too close for my liking. It trims the hair to ~1/4&amp;#34; long, which was a bit shorter than I was hoping for. But, if that&#x27;s the kind of results you want, then it works great!</li>
    <li> wish these came in bulk pack (all bikini razors) not as a combo bulk pack with regular razors</li>
    <li> This is a brilliant idea! What the heck took so long for somebody to invent this? Let me just say...I kind of can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing a review about a lady-parts-groomer. anyway&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works like the electric trimmers that guys sometimes use on their beards...but of course, this isn&#x27;t electric. But it has the blade and the guards. The head is also flexible, much like the typical Venus razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You wouldn&#x27;t use this for going all the way smooth, if ya know what I mean! Ah! it&#x27;s a trimmer, so you&#x27;d use it to prune the bushes if they&#x27;ve gotten out of control. it will trim pretty short. You can work in between and get it on those tricky parts too. Ah! Afterward it looks pretty neat, as in, well groomed, but there will still be hair there. I guess at that point it depends on your personal preference. I suppose you could leave it as-is or you could proceed to remove the short hairs by way of whatever method you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this for anybody that&#x27;s about to do any grooming down there, especially if you haven&#x27;t been keeping up with it. It makes it so much easier to get a wax or a shave or whatever if the hair has been trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasted for several uses as well. really love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(there&#x27;s an option on here to add a photo! lol)</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time.. and I am quiet happy with it ... it does the job pretty good... would def recommend it ..</li>
    <li> Got this cuz I wanted to remove hair in dorm shower without making noise with my electric trimmer from schick, however, compared to that one, this really didn&#x27;t do much, left hair longer than I like</li>
    <li> One of the best solutions to trimming hair in delicate areas that I&#x27;ve found. The protective comb keeps it from nicking skin in places you don&#x27;t want nicks. Good for men, too.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. What can you say without getting kind of awkward. Use it and you should be pleased.</li>
    <li> I always buy these in bulk because they&#x27;re so hard to find by themselves without having to buy the razor as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are easy to use and safe. The plastic combs prevents you from cutting yourself, and I think you&#x27;d have to be trying really hard to actually hurt yourself with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t give a bare skin shave but a very close-to-skin trim. You don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream or anything. Just comb through the hairs while in the shower, and you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> What can I say, this keeps the weeds trimmed and easily too.  Works well, but hard to find other than Amazon, and should be easily made into replaceable cartridges.  What gives, Gillette?</li>
    <li> I was so glad that I found this on here but once i received it in the mail i was a bit skeptical as to how close the shave would be. But once I used it, I was very happy with the results. The shave is very close to the skin. Usually I&#x27;m in the shower for a long time shaving. With this bikini trimmer I cut at least 15 minutes from my shower time. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This works really well. I got the first one as a special with their other razor. Then I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores for some reason so ordered a bunch here. They seem to last a long time. I would definitely recommend this product. You won&#x27;t hurt yourself or have horrible stubble. Like someone else said, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s about time&amp;#34;. Thanks Gillette.</li>
    <li> So I usually use an electric trimmer. However I am 9 months pregnant and don&#x27;t have the best view of my bikini area at the moment. I was able to use this one handed and got a great close trim with no cuts or nics.  After trying this I will definitely be ditching my old electric trimmer for good.  Too bad they don&#x27;t sell replacement blades.</li>
    <li> I love this thing! I&#x27;m almost 7 months pregnant and I can&#x27;t see anything down below at all. This has been a life saver. I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting myself up to shave and it looks neat and evenly trimmed.</li>
    <li> Very easy and convenient to use.  What can I say.  It trimmed my private hair very nicely to the length I want.</li>
    <li> The only problem with this product is that it&#x27;s really hard to find in stores. I love this trimmer. It lasts a long time. It&#x27;s easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t cut the hair too short and it&#x27;s easy to maneuver around in that area. It&#x27;s a must need tool to have around for someone who doesn&#x27;t like to get rid of all the hair in the bikini zone.</li>
    <li> It seriously makes life a whole lot easier, I just wish it was available with a replaceable head or more easily found @ my local drug stores.</li>
    <li> Way better than electric!</li>
    <li> This is one of those &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t live without items&amp;#34;, but I can&#x27;t find it in ANY stores.  Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Works well over easy-to-trim regions, but an electric trimmer is much safer/more exact when covering the delicate and curvy areas.</li>
    <li> they are ok but i don&#x27;t really care for them.  it works good on my little yorkie and shih tzu tho ..</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without one.</li>
    <li> I was looking for this item at my local drugstore but they do not carry it. What I like about it is that I do not need to use shave cream or lotion. Just jump in the shower with running water and start using! I am so glad to have found it here on Amazon. It does not nick/cut the skin and leaves the hairs very short. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a great idea, but it rusted pretty fast in the shower. Before it rusted it worked great, but just use scissors.</li>
    <li> Awesome :) did what&#x27;s expected and keeps you happy!</li>
    <li> it works fine and i got it for $0.75 with a coupon</li>
    <li> Does what it says - BUT the trim as not as close as I thought it would be. This definitely helps with ingrowns.</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing this little gadget. It does what it needs to. Too bad it can&#x27;t be purchased in stores. Thank goodness for Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use, and does what it says it will!</li>
    <li> I love love love these trimmers!! Really thin things out if you catch my drift. Lol</li>
</ol>
