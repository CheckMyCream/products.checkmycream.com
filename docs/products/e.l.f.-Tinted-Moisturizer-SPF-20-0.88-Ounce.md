    <li> It&#x27;s is kind of thick and I found it off in color. I like the Mac tinted moisturizer much better!</li>
    <li> I moved to Alaska last year and the dry weather made me change my whole beauty routine. I found this little gem and fell in love. It gives just the right amount of moisture and gives great coverage! I&#x27;m also prone to acne and since using this product my skin has cleared right up!</li>
    <li> I really like this tinted moisturizer.  It is a little heavier than I am used to using but once it is on I don&#x27;t notice.  I was worried about the size but a little goes a long way so it hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  Overall a great product that I use every day.  My husband says it doesn&#x27;t look like I am wearing makeup but my skin looks smoother and more even.</li>
    <li> Great if you want sheer coverage and a little bit of sunscreen!</li>
    <li> It has hardly any coverage, watery and oily. Definitely get what you pay for. Oh well, better luck next time.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping. Would recommend product and seller</li>
    <li> So smooth!  It is light, easy to apply, and does not rub off on clothing. This was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> This is great! First of all, it was suposed to come on June 7th and it arrived May 28th!So I was very pleased about that. For the actual product, when I first got it it didn&#x27;t seem as if the tupe was completely full. I saw gaps. And theres not much, or even no coverage. But it doesn&#x27;t break me out, and I don&#x27;t need alot of coverage at all. So this product works great for me, it really depends on your skin type. The colour was perfect for me. The packaging was very very nice. I deffinately reccomend this. :)</li>
    <li> Quite greasy and the color I bought (nude) turned out strange and orange-ish on my skin. I am quite fair, however, so it is possible that I bought the wrong shade. The texture was still off, however.</li>
    <li> I love the nude color. I am pale right now in the winter and this works perfectly for my olive toned skin. I only wish it was a bit thicker. I like to use tinted moisturizer in place of foundation. I will have to give elf&#x27;s foundation a try next.</li>
    <li> I really like this tinted moisturizer. It moisturizes without leaving too much shine, but it does leave some glow. I use a transparent loose powder under my eyes and eye lids to prevent product from collecting in my creases and fine lines. Great price, i will be re ordering.</li>
    <li> I think I must have gotten an old container of product.  It dries out on my skin almost immediately after application....certainly does not &amp;#34;act&amp;#34; like a moisturizer.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best one I ever had and I would keep get it for me love it makes my skin feel good it doesn&#x27;t look bad on me to</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to this brand of cosmetics and it did catch my attention because of the natural ingredients &amp; sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;For summer I always look for tinted moisturizers with sun screen that aren&#x27;t too thick or make me feel like I&#x27;ve caked spackle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This tinted moisturizer is at first a little weird feeling, by being sticky, and runny. It goes on smoothly and dried quickly without problems. I use a natural loose powder from Aubrey to set the foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would say this is great compared to the most expensive, and the least expensive of all moisturizing foundations. It does not irritate my sensitive skin, covers just enough ( I use a green colored correcter and concealer) doesn&#x27;t run or come off in the heat we have locally.&lt;br /&gt;I like the beige color because I have such light skin with gold tones, because it doesn&#x27;t make me look like a zombie. The nude is also a great neutral color with gold tones that looks natural with my skin tone. I guess you really have to just play around with colors to see which will work just right for you.&lt;br /&gt;I do have very light skin so beige or nude work for me, because I&#x27;m fair complected not ivory pale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall I am very happy with my purchase and did order the nude, because the local store here only had beige. I also have the concealer, and ordered the primer to try as well. I love the concealer, because it is creamy, light &amp; works great to add a little extra brightness under my eye area.</li>
    <li> Elf products are wonderful and this is no exception. It provides light, all-day coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday.  Love that it has spf in it and that I can just put it on and go.  The cost doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
    <li> I was looking for some type of tinted moisturizer, and went through dozens of reviews and site searches trying to find the perfect match. I did not want to spend a ton of money either - and I wanted something that was eco-friendly or that at least did not test on animals. After all of the searching - this was the choice. But was it going to work well?&lt;br /&gt;YES, yes it does. It gives great coverage without looking like you have anything on. It is light weight and feels good on your skin. I will definitely buy this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> very good coverage for every day wear. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I really like the color on my skin. The coverage is not that good, but absolutely awesome because it&#x27;s tinted moisturizer not a foundation.&lt;br /&gt;perfect for going to the grocery and things like that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll repurchase it again :0</li>
    <li> Got here on time was happy wit the way it was shipped loved the color n my face feels a lot better will reorder again</li>
    <li> This blends in very well with skin; however, there is a lot less than appears.</li>
    <li> Product used for concealer under my make-up.</li>
    <li> I got this because I wanted to see if it could be a cheaper alternative to my Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer. (Which I love, but at $43 for a tube, it&#x27;s pricier.) The ELF tinted moisturizer feels very chalky and not easily blendable compared to the Laura Mercier formula. It wasn&#x27;t awful, so if you cannot afford a high end brand it&#x27;s acceptable, but it&#x27;s not a dupe formula-wise. If you&#x27;re used to high-end products, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
