### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best floss on the market!</li>
      <li>Not too puffy, not too waxy, wonderful powder leaves</li>
      <li>It is the best!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s minty, superb at cleaning, and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t break off inbetween my too close teeth, it tastes great and it is easy to grip.</li>
      <li>there used to be a Reach floss like this that was braided which i liked.</li>
      <li>These are BY FAR the two best floss products in Reach&#x27;s line-up yet they seem to have abandoned both.  </li>
      <li>I have five more floss containers to go.  </li>
      <li>I had always flossed, but just changed to a better floss.</li>
      <li>Then again, most floss works.</li>
      <li>I like this product even better.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Give it a try, I&#x27;m sure sold.</li>
      <li>after being in love with expanding floss.</li>
      <li>and I fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>It cleans so well and the best part is that it is not elastic and keeps my mirror relatively spotless!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite floss.  </li>
      <li>Deep Clean Dental Floss is great.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;My absolute favorite floss.</li>
      <li>OK, it works very well.</li>
      <li>Not only is a great flosser but the mint flavor really leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>It does a great job picking up every little thing between your teeth.</li>
      <li>I was not a daily floss kind of person until I discovered this</li>
      <li>Along with feeding three finicky cats that get me up way too early for civilized living, that&#x27;s aggravation I don&#x27;t need to begin the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does leave my mouth with a fresh, clean taste and finds food particles that no other floss can find.</li>
      <li>B0055OLRWG Reach Total Care floss with Listerine Fresh Flavors, 30 Yard (Pack of 3)]] is significantly better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I should have read more carefully -</li>
      <li>This floss really cleans my teeth.</li>
      <li>And it flosses really well.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay together when you tug on it, so some of it collects under the hole where it comes out of, creating much resistance when pulling the floss out of the container: the spool and floss roll catapults out of</li>
      <li>My teeth are very close together.</li>
      <li>While it may deep clean, in my hands (and between my teeth)</li>
      <li>this \\&quot;texturized\\&quot; REACH DEEP CLEAN FLOSS</li>
      <li>Guess old dogs can learn new tricks as I am now flossing in a whole new way and with this floss, it really seems to help.</li>
      <li>This is the new version.</li>
      <li>This is my husband&#x27;s all-time favorite dental floss, and I can only assume that many other people like it, too; because when I try to buy it in a brick-and-mortar store, anyplace that normally does carry it (which are few and far between) cannot keep it in stock</li>
      <li>Deep Clean is definitely the answer to anyone who&#x27;s been looking for a replacement for their Cleanpaste.</li>
      <li>I bought the six-pack Reach Deep Clean Floss and regret the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic spool, hole and metal cutter is one piece, and the shell/case is the second</li>
      <li>It is a bit thicker and can be a tight fit with crowded teeth.</li>
      <li>I thought that this would be a truly abrasive floss, useful for occasional use for removing tartar (the hard stuff), not plaque (the easy to remove stuff).  </li>
      <li>B0070TZCMA Reach Deep Clean Floss, Icy Mint, 50 Yard</li>
      <li>This floss is hard to find and a little weird at first, but is the best floss out there for controlling plaque.</li>
      <li>or it is at least becoming scarce, so this is about the only way to find it.</li>
      <li>apparently this was not it.</li>
      <li>I had been unable to find this floss for the past year in my local supermarket&#x27;s and am so happy to have found it through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>floss line is made up of many thin, threads loosely wound together.  </li>

<li> It does not shred at all, at least for me, but my dentist showed me a new way to floss.</li>
<li> After another day of using the DEEP CLEAN FLOSS, I&#x27;m reducing my rating from two stars to one as I&#x27;m now convinced this is absolutely the worst floss I&#x27;ve ever encountered due to its propensity to shred.</li>

<li> It has enough texture that it actually removes the junk other floss tends to leave behind.</li>
<li> It really doesn&#x27;t do much of anything at all, except be somewhat annoying to use.  </li>
<li> Love the floss; hate the seller.  </li>
<li> It removes food stuck between my teeth, even the ones that are tightly spaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It would shred every time I tried to use it and the little shreds would get stuck  between my teeth.</li>
<li> A little steep.</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t waste the floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Unfortunately it looks like maybe they&#x27;ve stopped making this floss, just as they stopped making Cleanpaste.  </li>
<li> I have a difficult time finding it in the stores, but it is the sample given to me each time I have my teeth cleaned by my dental hygenist.  </li>
<li> This is a minty, waxed, floss--not a replacement or equivalent for cleanpaste, which I used to get on Amazon without fail, even when others didn&#x27;t carry it.</li>
<li> but this stuff is awful enough</li>
<li> bad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My coworker introduced me to this floss when we were traveling and I fell in love with it. I have yet to find it in any grocery or department store I visit! It does a great job picking up every little thing between your teeth. I just wish that I could find it in person because I bet it would be cheaper than than the $7 price tag on amazon.</li>
    <li> Over priced sent it back 1 pack for $19.99 instead of 5.</li>
    <li> I bought the six-pack Reach Deep Clean Floss and regret the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic spool, hole and metal cutter is one piece, and the shell/case is the second piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floss line is made up of many thin, threads loosely wound together.  It doesn&#x27;t stay together when you tug on it, so some of it collects under the hole where it comes out of, creating much resistance when pulling the floss out of the container: the spool and floss roll catapults out of the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Case and spool never stays together once this happens.  I had to duct tape the two pieces together so I don&#x27;t waste the floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad I have five more floss containers to go.  The floss itself seems decent if the container was not so poorly made.  It removes food stuck between my teeth, even the ones that are tightly spaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Love the floss; hate the seller.  $23.00 for ONE 50 yard container of floss.  What a fool I was.  Don&#x27;t make the same mistake with this seller.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t break off inbetween my too close teeth, it tastes great and it is easy to grip. Give it a try, I&#x27;m sure sold.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it looks like maybe they&#x27;ve stopped making this floss, just as they stopped making Cleanpaste.  These are BY FAR the two best floss products in Reach&#x27;s line-up yet they seem to have abandoned both.  I don&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> I had been unable to find this floss for the past year in my local supermarket&#x27;s and am so happy to have found it through Amazon.  It is the best!  It cleans so well and the best part is that it is not elastic and keeps my mirror relatively spotless!</li>
    <li> I purchased the [[ASIN:B0070TZCMA Reach Deep Clean Floss, Icy Mint, 50 Yard (Pack of 3)]] after being in love with expanding floss. I like this product even better. It does leave my mouth with a fresh, clean taste and finds food particles that no other floss can find. My teeth are very close together. It does not shred at all, at least for me, but my dentist showed me a new way to floss. Guess old dogs can learn new tricks as I am now flossing in a whole new way and with this floss, it really seems to help.</li>
    <li> Never thought I would be writing a review about dental floss but this stuff is awful enough i felt compelled.  I bought a six pack and threw it away.  It would shred every time I tried to use it and the little shreds would get stuck  between my teeth.</li>
    <li> And it flosses really well. I don&#x27;t know how to rate floss other than to say it works. Then again, most floss works. OK, it works very well.</li>
    <li> I have never written a dental floss review but I must say this Reach Deep Clean Dental Floss is great.  Not only is a great flosser but the mint flavor really leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> This floss is hard to find and a little weird at first, but is the best floss out there for controlling plaque.</li>
    <li> While it may deep clean, in my hands (and between my teeth) this \\&quot;texturized\\&quot; REACH DEEP CLEAN FLOSS is prone to shredding into a puffy tangles of microfilaments, some of which get stuck between the teeth and are a nuisance to remove. Along with feeding three finicky cats that get me up way too early for civilized living, that&#x27;s aggravation I don&#x27;t need to begin the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The [[ASIN:B0055OLRWG Reach Total Care floss with Listerine Fresh Flavors, 30 Yard (Pack of 3)]] is significantly better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. 4/14/13 After another day of using the DEEP CLEAN FLOSS, I&#x27;m reducing my rating from two stars to one as I&#x27;m now convinced this is absolutely the worst floss I&#x27;ve ever encountered due to its propensity to shred.</li>
    <li> This texturized floss actually cleans my teeth.  I have a difficult time finding it in the stores, but it is the sample given to me each time I have my teeth cleaned by my dental hygenist.  Other types just glide over the teeth without scraping off anything.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s all-time favorite dental floss, and I can only assume that many other people like it, too; because when I try to buy it in a brick-and-mortar store, anyplace that normally does carry it (which are few and far between) cannot keep it in stock and I can never find it!</li>
    <li> What?  No CleanPaste?  I don&#x27;t like wax?  J&amp;J, please bring back CleanPaste!</li>
    <li> This floss really cleans my teeth. It has enough texture that it actually removes the junk other floss tends to leave behind. It is a bit thicker and can be a tight fit with crowded teeth. My dentist could actually tell a difference and asked if I had recently started flossing. I had always flossed, but just changed to a better floss.</li>
    <li> Not too puffy, not too waxy, wonderful powder leaves teeth minty fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a woven floss, and you can shred if you let plaque build up.  If you do shred it, maybe it is time to get your teeth cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My absolute favorite floss.</li>
    <li> it separates into individual strands when I floss. the label said texturized. there used to be a Reach floss like this that was braided which i liked. apparently this was not it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe they have gotten rid of the cleanpaste floss and this is what they offer now. Definitely not even a little bit the same. This is a minty, waxed, floss--not a replacement or equivalent for cleanpaste, which I used to get on Amazon without fail, even when others didn&#x27;t carry it.</li>
    <li> I had to search for this floss once Johnson and Johnson discontinued their &amp;#34;toothpaste&amp;#34; infused floss. This is the new version. I love it. I was not a daily floss kind of person until I discovered this and now I cannot be without it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite floss.  It seems J&amp;J is no longer making it or it is at least becoming scarce, so this is about the only way to find it.</li>
    <li> I thought that this would be a truly abrasive floss, useful for occasional use for removing tartar (the hard stuff), not plaque (the easy to remove stuff).  It really doesn&#x27;t do much of anything at all, except be somewhat annoying to use.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for deep cleaning at all.</li>
    <li> The floss was what I was looking for.  I should have read more carefully - the charge is for one package of floss for $19.99.  A little steep. I thought was for 1 case, not one unit.</li>
    <li> Best floss on the market! I was a devoted Cleanpaste user until J&amp;J decided to stop it&#x27;s manufacturing. Deep Clean is definitely the answer to anyone who&#x27;s been looking for a replacement for their Cleanpaste. It&#x27;s minty, superb at cleaning, and easy to use.</li>
