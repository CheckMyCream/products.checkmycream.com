      <li>This is the first time I have used this coverage concealer</li>

      <li>Most of all it does NOT cover under eye dark pigmentation.</li>
      <li>I am older so have lots of issues with which to deal, but this shade did not do it for me.  </li>
      <li>it is not thick and does not stand out showing your have covered up something unbecoming.</li>
      <li>This concealer works great under my eyes, however, it is extremely creamy so it can get a little streaky if not blended well enough or too much</li>
      <li>I live in Florida and got the \\&quot;Tan\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy this brand new and in a lighter shade.  </li>
      <li>It stays on longer than most not sure I would say it is waterproof</li>
      <li>This cream is so easy to blend &amp; goes a long long way.</li>
      <li>It seems a little yellowy, perhaps better for Asian skin as It&#x27;s</li>
      <li>However, as the top negative review says: I agree with it all.  </li>

<li> A little goes a long long way, this tube will last me forever!</li>
<li> I use it all over my face and the tan is really a med beige.its a little thick</li>
<li> I have very dark under eye circles and ive been trying several concealers other than bobby brown than i always return to</li>
<li> If your circles are really dark this might not work</li>
<li> The color was not indicated in the description, so the Tan is too dark for me.  </li>
<li> Still searching for something less drastic than cosmetic surgery!</li>
<li> I use just a little dot to cover both eyes!</li>
<li> the product is also thinner in conistance in compariosn with the one I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
<li> It works no better than cheaper drugstore brands and appears cakey underneath my eyes.  </li>
<li> It is sticky and made my under eyes look awful.</li>
<li> This concealer is awful.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried every under eye concealer I could find. A friend recommended this. Works great. Does need to be set with powder. A light tap or dusting does the trick.</li>
    <li> It has more of a dramatic effect on my skin than the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; tone, and probably better suited for winter when it comes to my skin. Anyway, it&#x27;s also easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes (which are very sensitive), and is easy to get off with a wet wipe.</li>
    <li> You only need a TINY dab and the coverage is amazing!  Stays on all day unless you rub your eyes a lot.  Blends perfectly into other makeup.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Although I knew the Bye Bye concealer did not come in a box, I didn&#x27;t know it wouldn&#x27;t be sealed either.  I feel as if it might have been sampled, but no big deal.  The color was not indicated in the description, so the Tan is too dark for me.  Again, my fault for purchasing without knowing the shade.  Now on to the concealer.  It works no better than cheaper drugstore brands and appears cakey underneath my eyes.  I am older so have lots of issues with which to deal, but this shade did not do it for me.  The shipping was fast as is everything I buy from Amazon.  I probably won&#x27;t buy this brand new and in a lighter shade.  Still searching for something less drastic than cosmetic surgery!</li>
    <li> Second time I buy this and it works perfect for under eyes circles</li>
    <li> For me it is the best eye concealer I ever had. I love it, I highly recommend it .</li>
    <li> This concealer works great under my eyes, however, it is extremely creamy so it can get a little streaky if not blended well enough or too much product is used. I use just a little dot to cover both eyes! It will certainly last a while!</li>
    <li> best there is I am a makeup junkie you wont find better then this I use it all over my face and the tan is really a med beige.its a little thick you don&#x27;t need much I mix it with my cream and it will make you look flawless I wont be without it .</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
    <li> love love love this concealer and it also brightens my face!</li>
    <li> Good enough concealor, not as good as the hype. Absolutely does settle in fine lines</li>
    <li> Great coverage , very affordable!</li>
    <li> Great item at a great price!</li>
    <li> If your circles are really dark this might not work</li>
    <li> This concealer is awful. It is sticky and made my under eyes look awful. When you apply this, it is so greasy and slides like Vaseline. Another product that does not do what it states.</li>
    <li> I have very dark under eye circles and ive been trying several concealers other than bobby brown than i always return to but some times it tends to crease and it need to be set with powder,,tell i tried this amazing Bye Bye under eye its really very light weight and dont beed to be set with powder and guess what no creasing and my wrinkles look smoother..</li>
    <li> Good coverage, but I wish they had more color selections.</li>
    <li> Been using for years and this is the best undereye concealer I&#x27;ve used.  Even more grateful the tan works perfectly on my olive skin!</li>
    <li> the presentation I received isn&#x27;t the same as in the picture. the product is also thinner in conistance in compariosn with the one I&#x27;ve bought in the past. I had no use for it.</li>
    <li> PROVIDE VERY GOOD COVERAGE</li>
    <li> Stays put, strong pigmentation that blends well! A little goes a long long way, this tube will last me forever!</li>
    <li> Without question the most important piece of make up in my bag. This cream is so easy to blend &amp; goes a long long way.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used this coverage concealer but I love it, goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t show up like some do it is not thick and does not stand out showing your have covered up something unbecoming. It stays on longer than most not sure I would say it is waterproof but it does stay longer than most.</li>
    <li> I live in Florida and got the \\&quot;Tan\\&quot;.  It seems a little yellowy, perhaps better for Asian skin as It&#x27;s website says 70% of people are medium.  I prefer a concealer that matches my tan skin. The Tan does. A shade lighter will always \\&quot;brighten\\&quot; under eyes but will look like I&#x27;m wearing make-up.  However, as the top negative review says: I agree with it all.  Most of all it does NOT cover under eye dark pigmentation.</li>
