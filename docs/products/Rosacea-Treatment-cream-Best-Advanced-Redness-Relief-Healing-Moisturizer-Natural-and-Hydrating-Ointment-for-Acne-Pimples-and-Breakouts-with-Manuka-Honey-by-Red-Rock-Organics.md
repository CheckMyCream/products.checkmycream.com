### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>you for a wonderful, organic product and your wonderful customer service!  </li>
      <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried for Rosacea.  </li>
      <li>Smell isn&#x27;t the greatest but doesn&#x27;t stink up the face after it&#x27;s applied.</li>
      <li>This combination of genetics, and super-sensitive skin puts a person at the greatest risk for Rosacea.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am now a &#x27;lifer&#x27; and would recommend this product to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;I am a redhead with very fair skin</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great cream - multi uses for many purposes!</li>
      <li>feels good on my face</li>
      <li>good decision!&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product as a smooth texture and works great.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s absolutely amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice texture of lotion, so I might&#x27;ve given it 2 stars for that, but the sketchy review padding put me off.</li>
      <li>Best face creme ever by far.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok as a cream, but it could be better.</li>
      <li>Did I mention I love this stuff?</li>
      <li>It sure didn&#x27;t change anything for me.</li>
      <li>it works wonderfully for me, and I do understand that everyone is different.</li>
      <li>how many of the five star reviews said &amp;</li>
      <li>love Manuka Honey and know of the many benefits it has...</li>
      <li>so much more.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed my tone more even.  </li>
      <li>I do not like using chemicals (prescription meds) unless I have to and more and more</li>
      <li>I was given a prescription gel that does a pretty good job of getting rid of the redness</li>
      <li>Skin feels really smooth, love the silky feel of the lotion.</li>
      <li>I was apologized to and was told that I would receive the Rosacea Cream free of charge as well as an upgrade from the 2 oz.</li>
      <li>What used to take weeks to heal is now quickly gone within 4 days.  </li>
      <li>This is exactly what my face needed!</li>
      <li>/&gt;By day three, the redness had reduced by 50%, and the bumpiness had also greatly diminished.&lt;br /&gt;Now, at day 6, the redness is very slight, and the bumpiness is 95% gone!</li>
      <li>#34;I received this free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review,&amp;#34; but I figured that must be how new products or vendors build up some reviews for their product when they first list them.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s largely up to me to find the right treatment.  </li>
      <li>After using  Red Rock Rosacea Cream For over two years, I am still in love with this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s what attracted me to this product in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
      <li>But by and large this product is working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>New staple in my cabinet!!</li>
      <li>(thanks pops for that Irish/English touch you added - I don&#x27;t think a drop of my mom&#x27;s olive complexion reached my DNA.)</li>
      <li>I really like about this</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m beyond excited about my results from using this facial creme.</li>
      <li>My skin is still a bit dry so in the morning I might follow up with a light moisturizer and at night I follow up with coconut oil or a heavier moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I rely on Amazon ratings in determining nearly everything I buy, so I&#x27;m really disapointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After having such a lackluster experience with this product, however, I decided to do a little more investigating, and clicked on the names of several of the reviewers who had traded a free product for an &amp;#34;unbiased&amp;#34; review.</li>
      <li>always keep the product on hand, and have discovered a new use for it...</li>
      <li>and that is something I have to live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve experienced rough scaly skin, dry skin, red itchy bumps, red itchy skin without the bumps or dryness...  </li>
      <li>I have mild to moderate rosacea and was excited to have found a product that was affordable and would tame the redness.</li>
      <li>But I would say my face is easily 75-85% better; less hyper pigmentation, almost no itching, almost no itchy red bumps (1 every few days vs. 4-5</li>
      <li>My skin is 95 % clear, with no bumps, and I do not need to use any cover-up powder on my face.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Exceptional Customer Service is alive and well!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It takes the itch and intense red color out.  </li>

      <li>I have acne plus redness and this has completely controlled it</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream 1-2x a day, along with the Rosacea face cleanser by the same company, for a little over a month, and have seen zero change in the condition of my skin.</li>
<li> It is the crushed up lava rock in it.</li>
<li> Like if you wet a rock then smelled it, this smells a bit like that.</li>
<li> It just has a wet rock smell to it.</li>
<li> She then uses it twice a day for the next few days as the rosacea dies down and her skin dries out and the cream continues to heal and soothe.  </li>

<li> and it looked like it was making things worse.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is exactly what my face needed! I&#x27;m beyond excited about my results from using this facial creme. I&#x27;ve been having read dry skin on my face for a few years now but lately it got unbearable. I went to the Dr. and he said I had rosacea. I was given a prescription gel that does a pretty good job of getting rid of the redness but it dries out my already very dry facial skin. If I didn&#x27;t use the prescription gel my face was horribly red and if I use the gel then my face is horribly dry and flakey. every other lotion I tried either left my face greasy or burned my rashy face or both. This creme is the miracle lotion I&#x27;ve been looking for. it&#x27;s absolutely amazing. Soothes my face. Keeps me moisturized all day long. Not greasy at all. Best face creme ever by far.</li>
    <li> Did nothing. Used it for one week and it looked like it was making things worse.</li>
    <li> I still am not entirely sure if I have Rosacea, or what.  I&#x27;ve experienced rough scaly skin, dry skin, red itchy bumps, red itchy skin without the bumps or dryness...  I&#x27;ve seen three dermatologists who&#x27;ve all shrugged and prescribed steroid cream and antibiotics.  For those of you who don&#x27;t know steroids create a condition where your body will no longer respond to other medication/ treatment.  They also destroy your skin barrier making it impossible for your skin to heal itself.  Call me crazy but that sounds counter intuitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t call this a miracle cure.  My face did not clear up over night and it&#x27;s not perfect.  But I would say my face is easily 75-85% better; less hyper pigmentation, almost no itching, almost no itchy red bumps (1 every few days vs. 4-5 every single day like before).  My skin is still a bit dry so in the morning I might follow up with a light moisturizer and at night I follow up with coconut oil or a heavier moisturizer.  But by and large this product is working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like about this is its all natural ingredients, with some of those ingredients being organic.  I do not like using chemicals (prescription meds) unless I have to and more and more I look for natural ways to treat minor health problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having this problem with my skin, and seeing several doctors who&#x27;ve provided no insight has taught me that I am responsible for my health and it&#x27;s largely up to me to find the right treatment.  :/</li>
    <li> Skin feels really smooth, love the silky feel of the lotion. Smell isn&#x27;t the greatest but doesn&#x27;t stink up the face after it&#x27;s applied. Been using product every day for about 3 weeks, not a lot of improvement yet. Hoping I will see results soon.</li>
    <li> Did not work on me :(</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried for Rosacea.  I have acne plus redness and this has completely controlled it and I&#x27;ve noticed my tone more even.  Each product is different and this works for me.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> For the price of it - I was expecting (and hoping for!!) so much more.  The redness on my cheeks has calmed a bit - but the bumps on my nose have not changed a bit!  They&#x27;re worse if anything.  I am a bit disappointed, because after reading the online reviews I thought this was the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; I had been waiting for.</li>
    <li> I am a skeptic of sorts.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this a try...the cost was the same as a refill on the Metrogel that didn&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;By day three, the redness had reduced by 50%, and the bumpiness had also greatly diminished.&lt;br /&gt;Now, at day 6, the redness is very slight, and the bumpiness is 95% gone! I am now a &#x27;lifer&#x27; and would recommend this product to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;I am a redhead with very fair skin (thanks pops for that Irish/English touch you added - I don&#x27;t think a drop of my mom&#x27;s olive complexion reached my DNA.) This combination of genetics, and super-sensitive skin puts a person at the greatest risk for Rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;. I have been using this product, along with the facial cleanser, for 6 days...I am simply amazed at the change in my skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say straight out that I paid Amazon&#x27;s regular price for this product, and did not receive any type of &#x27;deal&#x27; from the company...I have read enough criticisms of BioFitness for offering this at a discount for favorable reviews to wonder if THEY are writing to discrerdit this product, or&lt;br /&gt;possibly the company. Hmm...just thinking out loud.&lt;br /&gt;No matter...it works wonderfully for me, and I do understand that everyone is different. I only wish I had before and after pics to offer as evidence to the other &#x27;skeptics&#x27; out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: It is 9/1/15, and you could never tell I have Rosacea! My skin is 95 % clear, with no bumps, and I do not need to use any cover-up powder on my face. This has been a miracle for me, and I only wish it worked as well for everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: 10/6/2017  After using  Red Rock Rosacea Cream For over two years, I am still in love with this product!&lt;br /&gt;I do have a flare-up occasionally, but with the cream, they are very short-lived. I have also discovered a few other triggers...the only one I can&#x27;t avoid are windy days...and that is something I have to live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always keep the product on hand, and have discovered a new use for it...my arms began showing some small red bumps, and I figured I would try the magic on them...good decision!&lt;br /&gt;So combining red rock and sunscreen, the problem has virtually disappeared! Did I mention I love this stuff?</li>
    <li> It did reduce some redness from my face but, not much and certainly not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I have mild to moderate rosacea and was excited to have found a product that was affordable and would tame the redness. I&#x27;ve been using this cream 1-2x a day, along with the Rosacea face cleanser by the same company, for a little over a month, and have seen zero change in the condition of my skin. I was really disappointed, especially considering how well this product is reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I remember thinking it was weird how many of the five star reviews said &amp;#34;I received this free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review,&amp;#34; but I figured that must be how new products or vendors build up some reviews for their product when they first list them.  After having such a lackluster experience with this product, however, I decided to do a little more investigating, and clicked on the names of several of the reviewers who had traded a free product for an &amp;#34;unbiased&amp;#34; review. Turns out a lot of these folks write LOTS of reviews for items in exchange for free/discounted products, and nearly ALL of the products they review get 5 stars, with a few 4 stars thrown in. I actually research and pay for things on amazon all of the time and wouldn&#x27;t give 5 stars to everything I&#x27;ve purchased. The whole thing seems super shady to me. I rely on Amazon ratings in determining nearly everything I buy, so I&#x27;m really disapointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in summary, from someone who actually paid for this product and actually has Rosacea, this product does not work. It&#x27;s a nice texture of lotion, so I might&#x27;ve given it 2 stars for that, but the sketchy review padding put me off. Spend your money elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have been using this and the cleanser for the last 2 and 1/2 weeks and there has been no change in my redness.  In fact, the products have left my skin dry, itchy, and with breakouts.  I will keep using the products until they are gone in case there is a change and will update my review if there is any improvement.</li>
    <li> Great cream - multi uses for many purposes! New staple in my cabinet!!</li>
    <li> My item arrived on time.  This product as a smooth texture and works great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok as a cream, but it could be better. It just feels like coconut butter. Even after 4 weeks it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my rosacea. And how could it, if you look at he ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I am just mad at myslef that I believed the reviews I read here - I simply cannot believe that it could help rosacea in any way. It sure didn&#x27;t change anything for me.</li>
    <li> Horrible smell but works!</li>
    <li> feels good on my face</li>
    <li> I attempted to purchase this item, placed my order and it was lost in shipping.  I was going to reorder the product, but instead, received an email from the CEO of Red Rock Organics asking why I requested a refund.  I explained that I never received the order.  I was apologized to and was told that I would receive the Rosacea Cream free of charge as well as an upgrade from the 2 oz. size I tried to purchase, to the 4 oz.&lt;br /&gt;Exceptional Customer Service is alive and well!&lt;br /&gt;I received the Rosacea Cream almost a week later and started using it daily.  It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks and I can see an improvement in my skin.  I&#x27;ve always had rosy cheeks, but after an allergic reaction to antibiotics and another reaction from steroids, my face exploded.  I&#x27;ve done several other things to help my skin, including a diet change, but I really do believe that the Red Rock Organics is working.  I could see a difference after a few days.  My friends have also noticed that a lot of the bumps and redness on my face have faded.&lt;br /&gt;I love Manuka Honey and know of the many benefits it has...that&#x27;s what attracted me to this product in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a wonderful, organic product and your wonderful customer service!  I&#x27;m a customer for life and will not hesitate to tell all my friends about this product and the experience I had.</li>
    <li> This stuff does work well. It just has a wet rock smell to it. Like if you wet a rock then smelled it, this smells a bit like that. It is the crushed up lava rock in it. The smell does not linger hardly once it is applied. It works well for roscea like I have. It lost a star only because I was expecting it not to have any scent to it.</li>
    <li> I am using this and the face wash.  While I do not see a reduction in redness, it does soothe and there is no increase in redness.  I am hoping that eventually my skin will recover.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s rosacea flares every time she is out in the sun, it is red and bumpy and itches like crazy.  She uses this Red Rock rosacea cream and it immediately helps.  It takes the itch and intense red color out.  She then uses it twice a day for the next few days as the rosacea dies down and her skin dries out and the cream continues to heal and soothe.  What used to take weeks to heal is now quickly gone within 4 days.  Great product.</li>
