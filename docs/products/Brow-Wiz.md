      <li>My favorite eye brow pencil.</li>

      <li>This pencil is the best I&#x27;ve found for my dark brown brows.  </li>

      <li>After a couple of uses however, the liner stick some how broke inside the tube and a huge piece of it fell out.</li>
      <li>There doesn&#x27;t seem to be too much of the product in there, but I&#x27;m not complaining at all because it&#x27;s AMAZING.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be ordering this from Amazon again when Nordstrom has free shipping too.</li>
      <li>It also makes a grinding sound when I twist it to get the pencil out of the holder.</li>
      <li>so it applies precisely.</li>
      <li>My new favorite!</li>
      <li>Pricey, but totally worth it!</li>
      <li>It is definitely authentic but the stick fell out the first day I used it.</li>
      <li>Worth it!</li>
      <li>very fine line and looks like my real brow</li>
      <li>simply rater high because of the price and the brand, so it MUST be wonderful, right?  </li>
      <li>so any patchiness is super noticeable.</li>
      <li>I have decent eyebrows that mostly just need to be arched a bit more, and filled in just a bit so this brow pencil has definitely done the trick for me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have decent eyebrows that mostly just need to be arched a bit more, and filled in just a bit so this brow pencil has definitely done the trick for me. I top this with Anastasia&#x27;s clear brow gel &amp; my eyebrows stay on and in place all day!</li>
    <li> There is nothing bad I can say about this product except that I LOVE it and I wish it lasted longer. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be too much of the product in there, but I&#x27;m not complaining at all because it&#x27;s AMAZING.</li>
    <li> Amazing pencil. Goes on lightly so as to help you build a natural looking brow.</li>
    <li> It keep broken into small pieces. See that attached pictures.  After 3 weeks, almost gone.</li>
    <li> I am fully convinced that makeup artists and youtube gurus are paid to drop the name of this product, as it certainly does not live up to the hype whatsoever.  Im flabbergasted at the rave reviews and feel this must be some sort of conspiracy or simply rater high because of the price and the brand, so it MUST be wonderful, right?  Wrong, its pure junk.  Ill give it a star for the color, as im a cool toned brunette with dark hair and light eyes,  and this pigment has no red undertones, which I despise and often find in brunette colored pencils. I prefer my pencils to be a bit on the dry side so they don&#x27;t glide on like a crayon, which often causes smudging and smearing throughout the day and the dreaded &amp;#34;clown&amp;#34; painted brow look.  However, this pencil is BONE DRY and extremely brittle, and breaks apart is little chunks extremely easily to the point the product is nearly rendered useless. For the price and amount of product, you already have to savor it, but the fact that is crumbles in near shards due to brittleness is ridiculous.  It is like trying to draw with a raw spaghetti noodle, even the slightest amount of pressure will cause it to crack.  My hair and skin tone is that of Megan Fox or Courtney Cox, and I SO wanted this pencil to work for me.  Do yourself a favor and use Mac Spiked brow pencil instead, it is very similar for cool toned brunettes yet much more sturdy and dependable. I really wanted to try the dipbrow pomade as well but have a hard time justifying contributing to a company who made such a lousy, overrated brow pencil.</li>
    <li> I purchased dark brown/brunette and I have almost black hair. I found that the color worked great for me even though I have very full brows. I find it easy to blend and easy to fix mistakes. It has a light touch and gives a natural look. I am a big fan of Anastaisa&#x27;s products. I will definitely be purchasing other products from Anastaisa Beverly Hills.</li>
    <li> lovely! very fine line and looks like my real brow - I&#x27;ve found no finer tip. the spoolie is perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these pencils in the past and think they&#x27;re good but when I took the cap of this product the pencil part broke off. When I twisted the pencil up to use it also ended up breaking off after a few days. Not sure if this particular pencil was old/dried out but I was disappointed with the quality.</li>
    <li> With no tax &amp; no shipping cost, l wish I&#x27;d ordered more than one.  I have no eyebrows &amp; this is the best pencil I have found.  It&#x27;s easy to apply &amp; doesn&#x27;t look like I drew my eyebrows on.  I put it on in the morning &amp; sometimes it lasts a few days with just a few touch-ups.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I used to swear by the Benefit&#x27;s Instant Brow pencil, but I decided to try this since everyone always raves about it. Definitely a great brow pencil. Much creamier than Benefit&#x27;s brow pencil. My new favorite!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it to line my brows and then use a fine brush to apply powder. This pencil spreads easily and gives me two looks (depending on how much I apply): natural or dramatic.</li>
    <li> Great color! I have sparse and brows so the small applicator really helps me to get a natural hair look.</li>
    <li> That is very nice product to instead of my hourglass or tom ford! Get it ,you won&#x27;t regret .</li>
    <li> Product works great! It looks very natural and subtle while still adding definition to brows. I chose dark brown for my black hair.</li>
    <li> This makes my brows so natural looking with just a little bit of tint.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!! This brow pencil will forever be my holy grail! I was used to the old Anastasia packaging but she tweaked it and it&#x27;s just the icing on the cake in my opinion. I does however wear off a little bit after about 6 hours since I have oily skin.</li>
    <li> Love this.  its always sharp and the color is perfect.  it stays all day long providing you lead a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; life, that is if you do sports or sweat a lot, not optimal, but better than others.</li>
    <li> Works very well and looks natural -- not too dark or light. I have reordered this many times. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye brow liner and I have bought it from sephora before. I fig I would save the trip and buy it here and it keeps breaking and falling out!!!</li>
    <li> This pencil does magic! I can literally shape my eye brows how ever I want with it looking very natural. I heard about this brow wiz pencil through Jaclyn Hill on YouTube and extremely happy with my purchase. She has a video up on how to use it and it&#x27;s amazing. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> It was dried up, and there was less product in the tube than usual.  I get this all the time, but this one was awful. I have to get one again already. I wish I knew another brand that had a line this fine. Anastasia is inconsistent, but I love the fine line it draws.</li>
    <li> Does not retract well and the whole piece of the actual pencil falls out! Do not buy, save yourself the trouble and go to Sephora or Ulta to purchase. Doesn&#x27;t even deserve a star, since I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> This pencil is the best I&#x27;ve found for my dark brown brows.  It has a nice width to the &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34; so it tends to look more natural than most brow products, lasts very well, and doesn&#x27;t get too dark, like a lot of brow options.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s waterproof by any means, which I wish they did offer this in that formula, but it holds up very well.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> Best product if you already have heavy eyebrows and only need to fill in the small gaps I love it ..</li>
    <li> I read about this on a blog and decided to give it try. I love it! This will now be a stable in my make up bag.</li>
    <li> My most favorite eyebrow pencil EVER!!!  I love this brand and would recommend it to anyone who likes to draw on their eyebrows!</li>
    <li> I have been trying many brow products lately because I have the weirdest eyebrows ever!! Anyway this product is so easy to apply, and looks super natural. I have almost black hair so I get the dark brown color which is perfect for me. The spoole works great for spreading out the color and brushing through your brows. My only gripe is that its so expensive! NYX does have a comparable brow pencil but it does pull slightly more red which some people may like, some may not but for me, I do not like more reddish brows. NYX is 1/2 the cost too. Also, ELF has a comparable brow pencil that I really really like, and its only $1!  If you can afford this brown pencil, its worth it, otherwise, you may need to find a cheaper option like i did.</li>
    <li> This product is SO expensive for what you get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally didn&#x27;t even use this for a month &amp; it&#x27;s already out‚Ä¶ I feel like I&#x27;m being ripped off. Will be going to the ‚Äúit‚Äù cosmetics or the sephora brand‚Ä¶ Definitely better values than this! Very disappointed‚Ä¶</li>
    <li> I used anastaisa bh brow pomade before i bought this.. The brow wiz is a lot easier and faster to apply and i used it to cut down my time applying make up. I like the pomade better, though its a lot more expensive. The brow wiz also broke after a week or two, but i think it was my fault</li>
    <li> Opened my brow wiz today and while I was twisting the pencil out. Half of it fell out. Very disappointed, especially since the packaging seems like it would prevent any breakage.</li>
    <li> OHEMGEE I totally love this pencil. Applies nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Better than the MAC eyebrow pencil</li>
    <li> Love this! Its so easy to apply! and it lasts all day!!!</li>
    <li> by far the best brow pencil on the market. I&#x27;ve tried them all and this is by far the easiest to apply. It doesn&#x27;t require a sharpener and is very thin (much thinner than a traditional pencil) so it applies precisely.</li>
    <li> This really is a great eyebrow pencil!  I was hopeful but skeptical when ordering this item because I was one of those tried and true fans of the discontinued Revlon fine-line mechanical pencil and have been searching forever for a replacement.  The Anastasia pencil lead is not as thin as the Revlon but it makes a beautiful line and stays on longer.  I don&#x27;t know yet how long the lead will last and have not seen refills offered so I&#x27;m assuming that it&#x27;s not refillable.  I&#x27;ve already ordered a replacement so I&#x27;ll be ready when that happens.  I hope this item will continue to be offered.</li>
    <li> My favorite eye brow pencil. Goes on nicely stays on all day.</li>
    <li> Ive gotten it before and had no problem. But this time the pen was broken into pieces so some of it fell out and was a waste. But overall, it does the job.</li>
    <li> Initially, I loved the color! It matched perfectly. After a couple of uses however, the liner stick some how broke inside the tube and a huge piece of it fell out. When I say huge, I&#x27;m using the term loosely to explain that the broken piece was larger in comparison to what was left, but the total amount of liner in the tube when new was far from &amp;#34;huge&amp;#34;...it couldn&#x27;t have been more than 2 inches long. It is a ridiculously small amount of liner for the price you are paying!! Don&#x27;t waste your money! The product is nice, but you will find yourself needing a replacement very quickly, and it is way too expensive for that!</li>
    <li> Great product, but you get so LITTLE for $20! You will be lucky if it will last you a month. You literally get only 1&amp;#34; of the super thin product. Costs way, way too much for this amount. I started purchasing the pomade, and for the same about of money you get so much more product, that I do&#x27;t think I will ever run out. It is not as easy to use, but when you get use to it you will be as happy as with the pencil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve over plucked my brows. This product has like a crayon consistency so it stays on most of the day. Best product out there. And you don&#x27;t need a sharpener and that is a bonus.</li>
    <li> Repeat buy!! Love this eye brow make up. Have looked a long time for just the right type of make up for my eyebrows... very happy... especially since I never thought I would pay this much for an eyebrow pencil! Worth it!</li>
    <li> I Always Buy at sephora to get my points but this is beyond amazing and you never have to sharpen it . the lady showed me how to use it and it last me a month maybe a few days longer and I use it everyday !</li>
    <li> My #1 must have makeup product. I have kind of spare brows, but they&#x27;re dark so any patchiness is super noticeable. Brow whiz helps me achieve a polished look with minimal effort, and the color is perfect for my golden-brown hair and olive complexion. The tiny size of the pencil tip gives a very natural looking end result. I love the little spoolie brush on the other end too, which I give a little shot of hairpray and then comb through to help everything stay in place. Pricey, but totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Where has this product been all my life!?  I&#x27;m glad I researched the product and purchased it.  I suffer from sparse eyebrows due to over-plucking as a teenager.  This color is perfect for my dark brown hair.  Light strokes creates an illusion of thicker, fuller eyebrows without looking false.</li>
    <li> I usually use the MAC Brow Tech pencil, but I have heard good things about Anastasia, so I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t make the mark for me in terms of precision and staying power. I will keep this as an emergency backup, but I would not purchase again. My MAC pencil can last midway through a strenuous workout, and wont smudge until I grab the towel. Anastasia barely lasts through the work day for me. I In my opinion, the Anastasia pencil is a bit more waxy and softer than MAC, which doesn&#x27;t work with my combination skin. The MAC pencil is more of a matte finish and the pencil goes on much more precisely. This is important when you are going for the natural brow. Based on the YouTube reviews I saw comparing both pencils, it seems that most people prefer one over the other for various reasons, so good luck ladies!</li>
    <li> I love it!!! Good quality, last long!!!</li>
    <li> A-MAY-ZING! I&#x27;ve used this for years and it never disappoints! Looks natural and matches my brows. Anastasia&#x27;s brow wiz is on point!</li>
    <li> Best product out there.  It&#x27;s pricey but well worth it. I wish it lasted longer!</li>
    <li> The only brow pencil I use</li>
    <li> Totally disappointed, the product was in bits and pieces, every time I tried to twist the pencil to get more out, it would fall out in small pieces! Could of done a better job of packaging and inspecting before shippingüòí</li>
    <li> The best eyebrow pencil I have used.</li>
    <li> I heard so many amazing things about this, but I was worried it would be as great as everyone made it out to be. I LOVE THIS! I really have no idea what it is, but my eyebrows are transformed!</li>
    <li> I am someone who has never filled in my eyebrows because I&#x27;ve never needed to. Lately, the trend is to have beautifully defined eyebrows, so I decided to give it a try. I wanted something that didn&#x27;t take away my natural look but gave some definition. I love this Brow Wiz pencil because it give a very natural finish and the brow brush at the end smooths away harsh lines and blends the color effortlessly. I truly encourage anyone to try this product if you are in need of a few small fill in and evening out your brows. It&#x27;s easy and stays put!</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this product from Amazon. When I received the package,I noticed the it was an open item was a little dinged Upon arrival, The one liner pencil is all broken inside.  Only one small piece remains it was dry/hard to apply, No matter how much I twisted the pencil nothing came out. It was really disappointing and a total waste of money  I will say I do not appreciate paying in good faith for a damaged product. I&#x27;d send it back this it not worth it.</li>
    <li> This product is everything you can want in an eyebrow pencil and even more. On one end you have this ultra silky smooth color and the other end comes with a brush you can use to blend or for combing your hairs. I have used eyeliners and actual brow pencils (latest was the Mary Kay 11$ one) but this is 10x better. You do not get a lot for what you pay for and 21$ is very expensive, but it all seriously depends on how your bank account is looking. I would buy this over and over again, but I also do not have bills or other expenses. If you are tight on cash, you may want to try to dipbrow pomade and invest in an angled brow brush because it&#x27;ll last waaaaayyy longer than this. This is an amazing product though and I believe it is definitely a good investment.</li>
    <li> Best eyebrows pencil ever!!</li>
    <li> I love this pencil, but it only lasted me 3 months. I rather waste money on the pomade instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this eyebrow pencil for the last three years and plan to continue doing so for as long as they are available. It is subtle and a no brainer when it comes to applying it.</li>
    <li> Is a good eye brow pencil but is too expensive for so little product.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!</li>
    <li> Ridiculously awesome.</li>
    <li> Love this. Works well.</li>
    <li> Dont buy very cheap product</li>
    <li> Have used many different eyebrow filler products in the past and this is by far the best. Never runs, or wears. Have even worn it in the pool multiple times.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for quiet a while now....i love it!!! Especially good for thick eyebrows!! only negative is that my lead ALWAYS comes out..so if I&#x27;m not careful i can loose the whole lead and have wasted my money. so great product just be careful!!!!</li>
    <li> i loooove this for my brows totally in love with this product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Not greasy, easy to apply, looks natural.  However, for the price, I wish it lasted a bit longer.</li>
    <li> Its blends in with your eyebrows and doesnt look like a wierd color in the sun</li>
    <li> I probably will keep using this and then be done with it. I have oily skin and I find that this product is kinda greasy and so wipes off if I rub against it. If I don&#x27;t touch it, it stays on all day. I also find that with this product I am more coloring in my eyebrows rather than drawing in hairs for bald spots.  Maybe I am doing it wrong, but I don&#x27;t see how the pencil will stay sharp enough to add fine little hair lines, in addition, as I said before, it smudges.  Still it overall provides me with thicker brows that look natural. I am going to try the dipbrow instead.</li>
    <li> The first time I bought it it arrived broken but the quality is good so I bought another one and it arrived ok.</li>
    <li> Perfect colour for my eyebrows! It is so easy to apply and lasts all day, very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The color is perfect and it&#x27;s very easy to apply and it looks great. It last all day, even when my skin is oily.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t be ordering this from Amazon again when Nordstrom has free shipping too. When I opened the pencil end, half of the pencil fell out. It also makes a grinding sound when I twist it to get the pencil out of the holder. It&#x27;s too expensive to lose half of it when opening.</li>
    <li> I usually purchase this from Sephora. It is definitely authentic but the stick fell out the first day I used it.</li>
    <li> It was damaged and I did not have an opportunity to try, when I opened it the pencil stuff just fell of the base and it was like on small pieces so I first could not understand what was going on. I was very sad and frustrated and I made the return so I need my money to be reimbursed asap.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Best brow pencil I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Love this product - I will not use any other kind of brow pencil! Looks so natural!</li>
    <li> Love makes my brows look amazing</li>
