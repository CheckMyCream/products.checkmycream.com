      <li>a glove and a nice case came with it.</li>
      <li>The HSI shampoo was excellent when I applied it to my hair because my hair felt soft while shampooing and was not tangled even before I put the conditioner on.  </li>
      <li>It has an amazing smell too :)</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this product so far and would buy it again.</li>

      <li>The adjusted  temperature is perfect for all different hair types.  </li>
      <li>I spend some weeks using it before poste a review to have sure about the product.</li>
      <li>keep on using this magic shampoo</li>
      <li>I use this with the thermal protector spray and I love them.</li>
      <li>I wish I could say better things about the HSI Conditioner and Shampoo</li>
      <li>Her hair is the softest, shinniest, and healthiest it has been since we have been married!!!</li>
      <li>so you aren&#x27;t going to get much lather - you don&#x27;t need lather!!!!  </li>
      <li>I really enjoyed how quick it was to warm up, and straighten.  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo, take the kinks out of my hair, easy to comb.</li>
      <li>Great for my curly hair, and leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>became ever more soft and after one try my colleagues remarked that my hair looked amazing and baby-soft!  </li>
      <li>and i feel that my hair (which frankly speaking was fine)</li>
      <li>This product is sulfate free</li>
      <li>This shampoo is sulfate free.</li>
      <li>I really recommend and will for sure bring some more to Brazil.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is my new favorite thing!  </li>
      <li>but still, i think price is worth the results!</li>
      <li>Very satisfied with this professional shampoo.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair manageable and gives great shine, a pleasant scent too,  odor is gentle on the nose if  you are particularly  sensitive to odors like me.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like right on the first try I notice a difference on my frizzy, naturally wavy-curly hair, it has a smoother</li>
      <li>I bought this thinking that it was the oil leave-in treatment, so I didn&#x27;t keep it, but I have no doubt this would be at least as awesome as the product I like to use from HSI.</li>
      <li>As with all sulfate free shampoos, do not expect it to lather a whole lot.</li>
      <li>Smells fantastic and makes my hair feel so soft and smotth.  </li>
      <li>HSI Pro flat iron protection hair spray is fantastic too!</li>
      <li>I  absolute ly love this flat iron.</li>
      <li>so i really recommend this stuff.</li>
      <li>I really like the fact</li>
      <li>My hair is VERY damaged</li>
      <li>It is eay to use and seams to be very durable.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and the shampoo seemed to weigh my hair down.  </li>
      <li>The problem I have with shampoos is my hair is left feeling dry by the next day, even with a good conditioner.</li>
      <li>I have had a Chi in the past and this one is so much better in my opinion and priced very affordable.</li>
      <li>Good product but expensive</li>
      <li>Fabulous and nothing less!</li>
      <li>This product and the conditioner has really helped my dry hair.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural ingredients &amp; no chemicals that secretly do damage to your hair.</li>
      <li>They leave my hair soft and shiny, and I will definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>Very disappointing, I was really hoping with all the good reviews it would work well for me</li>
      <li>At the first use i tought that i will not like, the shampoo is heavy and not &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; to use.</li>
      <li>My wife says that she loves the Argan Oil products I got her with her HSI flat iron, and how it has helped keep her hair from drying out and breaking like she used to complain about with her old flat iron!!!</li>

<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> A little hard to rub into hair</li>

<li> Not good for my hair!</li>
<li> I have thick crazy hair and this stuff makes it so manageable.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great&lt;br /&gt;does the work&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
    <li> My wife says that she loves the Argan Oil products I got her with her HSI flat iron, and how it has helped keep her hair from drying out and breaking like she used to complain about with her old flat iron!!! Her hair is the softest, shinniest, and healthiest it has been since we have been married!!! She says it is from using a quality straightener to start with, and then good haircare/styling products!!! But she is extremly happy with this product... and if she is happy, I am elated!!!</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t the greatest like they make it sound like will not buy it again</li>
    <li> This product smells great and makes a luxurious, beautiful lather. My hair is very fine and the shampoo seemed to weigh my hair down.  I returned it, that&#x27;s the only reason for 4-stars, otherwise it would be a five-star review.  but don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it - everyone I know loves it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product yet, but I&#x27;m giving it a 3 because it claims to have no sulfates, but the 2nd ingredient is sodium c14-16 olefin sulfonate, which is a sulfate. Since the cost is reasonable, I will use the product and give another review in a few week. But, if you&#x27;re looking for sulfate free--don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> I wish I could say better things about the HSI Conditioner and Shampoo but I did not have a good experience after finishing the bottle. My hair is VERY damaged so I tried to base it on my 7yr old daughter who has beautiful long thick hair and in the past month since using these 2 I&#x27;ve noticed breakage and the shine was not like usual on her hair. Very disappointing, I was really hoping with all the good reviews it would work well for me but after it not working on both our hair I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Has sulfates! Not good for my hair!</li>
    <li> I use the leav-in oil conditioner, and it&#x27;s amazing. I bought this thinking that it was the oil leave-in treatment, so I didn&#x27;t keep it, but I have no doubt this would be at least as awesome as the product I like to use from HSI.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. It left my hair greesy and a mess.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that this is the best shampoo I have ever tried and I have probably tried almost all of them.  The problem I have with shampoos is my hair is left feeling dry by the next day, even with a good conditioner. HSI has proven that an excellent product can improve my hair&#x27;s condition.  The HSI shampoo was excellent when I applied it to my hair because my hair felt soft while shampooing and was not tangled even before I put the conditioner on.  The only drawback is I don&#x27;t know if I can afford this product every time.  It is pretty expensive!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is sulfate free. As with all sulfate free shampoos, do not expect it to lather a whole lot. I have to wash my hair twice when I use it. Two pumps each time, and I have a mid-neck length bob. I use this with the thermal protector spray and I love them. They leave my hair soft and shiny, and I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This product and the conditioner has really helped my dry hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> i got this shampoo and i&#x27;m really happy with it! the item delivered as it is described, greatly sealed. the texture and smell is great and i feel that my hair (which frankly speaking was fine) became ever more soft and after one try my colleagues remarked that my hair looked amazing and baby-soft!  Just after one try! so i really recommend this stuff. the only thing is i ordered 236ml which is quite small but i hope it will last at least 2 month for me. otherwise it is a bit pricey.  but still, i think price is worth the results! keep on using this magic shampoo</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product so far and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Amazing product !! I spend some weeks using it before poste a review to have sure about the product. At the first use i tought that i will not like, the shampoo is heavy and not &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; to use. After one week my hair was awesome smoothing !!

    <li> The adjusted  temperature is perfect for all different hair types.  I really enjoyed how quick it was to warm up, and straighten.  I would have to get product 5 stars!</li>
    <li> THIS SHAMPOO IS AMAZING WILL BE BUYING THIS PRODUCT AS LONG AS THEY MAKE IT. GOOD FOR ALL TEXTURES OF HAIR.</li>
    <li> It works great. It is eay to use and seams to be very durable.  I have had no issues with it. I really like the fact a glove and a nice case came with it. I love it!!</li>

    <li> This shampoo is my new favorite thing!  Smells fantastic and makes my hair feel so soft and smotth.  I have thick crazy hair and this stuff makes it so manageable.  This product is sulfate free so you aren&#x27;t going to get much lather - you don&#x27;t need lather!!!!  I wish people would do their homework about sulfate before complaining about sulfate-free things not lathering!</li>
    <li> Great for my curly hair, and leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo to date!!! I love that it&#x27;s natural ingredients &amp; no chemicals that secretly do damage to your hair. It has an amazing smell too :)</li>
    <li> I  absolute ly love this flat iron. It fits perfectly into my hand and it is not bulky like some of them are. I have had a Chi in the past and this one is so much better in my opinion and priced very affordable.</li>
