      <li>This is a very good sunscreen as it has as few harmful ingredients as you can get.  </li>
      <li>A good organic mix should cost only around 15 for 3oz.</li>
      <li>A good organic mix should cost only around 15 for 3oz.supplements. 11.</li>
      <li>According to Yahoo, AMAZINGLY, this is one of “”11 Best Natural Sunscreens”” with a description of &amp;#34;&amp;#34;The sheer, hydrating formula is gentle enough for infants too.&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I keep it refrigerated till I use and always go for a fresh sunscreen all the time</li>
      <li>it is it makes my skin feel so waxy when its fresh on my face..</li>
      <li>… This is a mix that it does not even specify the size of ZO which gets absorbed by the skin and processed by the liver and dumped into the blood stream.</li>
      <li>Also this makes your face very matte!</li>
      <li>This goes on quite easily and I&#x27;m not pasty white afterwards.</li>
      <li>I am very allergic, and I do not react at all to this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soothing although it may not blend well with all types of makeup.</li>
      <li>One more thing, this leaves absolutely no residue on the skin</li>
      <li>Was really looking forward to my &#x27;new&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for roughly a month, and I love it.</li>
      <li>I really like this sunblock.  </li>
      <li>Additionally, the price is really reasonable for this quality product.  </li>
      <li>Free of  all the following; PABA, synthentic chemicals, fragrance, alcohol, gum, supplements.&lt;br</li>
      <li>After spending WAY too much time researching sunscreens, in the attempt to find a reasonable alternative to the chemical options, I chose this item based on the reviews of others.</li>
      <li>Only minimal white residue on clothing after application -  better than most others.</li>
      <li>None oily and protect my face from getting more dark spots.</li>
      <li>Mineral is what I want which is thick, overly creamy, and leave your skin looking ashy-white since they&#x27;re basically made of finely ground rocks of ZO but needs to be the right mix with he right ZO.</li>

      <li>This particular sunscreen also acts like a primer for my foundation-</li>
      <li>and normally I always burn my face no matter</li>
      <li>I insure to check the expiration date and purchase anything that I consume especially anything that it goes on my skin which is absorbed by the skin and processed by the liver.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
      <li>Must have the blessing of the Environmental Working Group although that they are allowing many half shady mix in their top choices lately.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The trick is to exfoliate every other day or so, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
      <li>It is sold for less quantity, for more money than the certified organic mix with the Non-Nano Uncoated ZO of 20% with only a handful of ingredient without alcohol, gum and the rest that you can read in the ingredient</li>
      <li>I have worked hard to eliminate chemicals from my skincare routine and have tried many alternative sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>It goes on clear after your rub it in for 2 seconds, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>Dries fast, so mixing with regular skin lotion makes it easier to apply.</li>
      <li>I have oily, acne prone, mature skin</li>
      <li>Producers like to spin the facts and challenge our knowledge and intelligence by claiming it as WITHOUT any harsh chemical or chemical FREE or without chemical ABSORBERS.</li>
      <li>With the thinnest coat I could apply, and after applying it daily for 4 days ( to give it a reasonable chance), I had to stop.</li>
      <li>It also moisturizes my face really well without clogging my pores which is usually such a problem!</li>
      <li>I also had some breakout action.</li>
      <li>like for the first hour and a half my face feels really just waxy.</li>
      <li>This product is light, doesn&#x27;t cause break-outs and doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky white film you find with some of the other natural SPF products.</li>
      <li>I mountain bike ride about 3 times a week, live in Southern California and don&#x27;t want to use chemical sunscreens.</li>
      <li>ACTIVE INGREDIENTS of more ZO less titanium, the best-rated mineral sun blocks.</li>
      <li>Broad Spectrum, UVA &amp; UVB, Mineral sunscreen</li>
      <li>So, it apparently works well!</li>
      <li>This is one of three natural sunscreens I bought for a recent vacation.  </li>
      <li>I have tried other non-chemical sunscreens and they are very greasy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not only it is full of unwanted ingredients from Gum to alcohol that not only I would not put on my skin less alone on an infant’s skin, the question is where is the protection… How did they come up with 28-SPF with such ingredients and only 11.6% ZO when 23% ZO offers only SPF-35</li>
      <li>To apply I usually mix it with a small amount of Badger Damascus Rose antioxidant face oil.  </li>
      <li>I avoid OXYBENZONE which apparently disrupts human hormonal system.</li>

<li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other zinc-based sun screens.</li>
<li> but my skin was still pink after each day</li>
<li> The one thing that you may find with this sunscreen is that you need to exfoliate every other day to get it all off your face.</li>
<li> We were at the pool for three hours the other day (with breaks, of course), and it protected their skin, no sunburns, without reapplying.</li>
<li> This is a little dry.  </li>
<li> I usually just use it on my face; I wear long sleeves to cover my arms.</li>
<li> This product is not greasy, but it does feel a little heavy on your skin, which is probably unavoidable.</li>
<li> which I hate it all and worst of all not being outdoors doing what I love the most,</li>
<li> In the past, I&#x27;ve had trouble with my skin breaking out from wearing sunscreen, but that hasn&#x27;t happened with this brand at all.</li>
<li> and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my face or feel the least bit heavy.</li>
<li> (The others were John Masters which was really expensive and Caribbean Solutions Faces Only which was too pasty.)  </li>

    <li> Wonderful sun shield. No smell. Not greasy. Does the job!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 44, very fair skinned and sensitive.  I&#x27;ve made several purchases of this product.  It&#x27;s very soothing although it may not blend well with all types of makeup.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. Really, it&#x27;s great. It blends in so well and does not cause acne! It&#x27;s so awesome and I&#x27;m thankful to have found it. It also moisturizes my face really well without clogging my pores which is usually such a problem! I pack this stuff on my face and have yet to see an adverse effect - also as I type this I sssssssslathered this on my face at 2pm and now at 1am my face feels smooth which makes me happy because my skin just drinks it in. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is it makes my skin feel so waxy when its fresh on my face.. like for the first hour and a half my face feels really just waxy. It&#x27;s the best description I can give. Anyway, I recommend. This is the unscented version, but next time I buy it I want to try the scented version - coconut! Also this makes your face very matte! One more thing, this leaves absolutely no residue on the skin so buy this with confidence!</li>
    <li> I love the creamy texture. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other zinc-based sun screens.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, I use it every day.</li>
    <li> According to Yahoo, AMAZINGLY, this is one of “”11 Best Natural Sunscreens”” with a description of &amp;#34;&amp;#34;The sheer, hydrating formula is gentle enough for infants too.&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients: 11.6% Zinc Oxide (ZinClear™), 0.67% Titanium Dioxide&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients: Alcohol, Allantoin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Alumina, Aqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ceteryl Alcohol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Citric Acid, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Fructooligosaccharides (D-Beta), Gluconolactone, Glycerin, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Glyceryl Isostearate, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Isononyl Isononanoate, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate, Polysorbate 60, Potassium Sorbate, Simethicone, Sodium Benzoate, Squalane, Tocopheryl Acetate (D-alpha), Trisodium Ethylenediamine, Xanthan Gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only it is full of unwanted ingredients from Gum to alcohol that not only I would not put on my skin less alone on an infant’s skin, the question is where is the protection… How did they come up with 28-SPF with such ingredients and only 11.6% ZO when 23% ZO offers only SPF-35… This is a mix that it does not even specify the size of ZO which gets absorbed by the skin and processed by the liver and dumped into the blood stream.

ACTIVE INGREDIENTS of more ZO less titanium, the best-rated mineral sun blocks. Majority have many different ingredients than zinc and titanium as ACTIVE INGREDIENTS which you can get the best of the best in CONSUMER YEARLY report where I look to purchase the best of best black tar for all my roofing needs. Only Non-Nano Uncoated ZO.&lt;br /&gt;2. Must have the blessing of the Environmental Working Group although that they are allowing many half shady mix in their top choices lately.&lt;br /&gt;3. I do not pay attention to water proof or water resistant. How stupid, I am going in the ocean, in salt water under the sun. Unless I put a deck coating or a roof on my head, it will not last. Anyone looking for those wordings should avoid sun and ocean. Producers like to spin the facts and challenge our knowledge and intelligence by claiming it as WITHOUT any harsh chemical or chemical FREE or without chemical ABSORBERS. Any mix unless certified organic is not organic, it is conventional.&lt;br /&gt;4. Majority have fragrance and alcohol which I avoid. After all, I am going in the ocean not on a date. Why do I need fragrance on my skin which is alcohol regardless. If I want fragrance, I will apply the fragrance of my choice that I purchase separately.&lt;br /&gt;5. I never leave the sunscreen in the sun. I keep it refrigerated till I use and always go for a fresh sunscreen all the time so I never worry about few months old mix. Freshness is a priority in any mix especially when it comes to oil. I insure to check the expiration date and purchase anything that I consume especially anything that it goes on my skin which is absorbed by the skin and processed by the liver.&lt;br /&gt;6. I always apply 30 minutes before any exposure to the sun since it needs to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;7. I avoid OXYBENZONE which apparently disrupts human hormonal system. It is an excellent protection and 16oz is sold for less than 3oz of fancy brands but it is about doctor bills, cancer and being sick which I hate it all and worst of all not being outdoors doing what I love the most, my favorite sports.&lt;br /&gt;8. I avoid vitamin A (retinyl palmitate) which seems to boost skin cancer risk and after all consume that with my healthy diet, I do not want any supplements in the mix.&lt;br /&gt;9.

Free of  all the following; PABA, synthentic chemicals, fragrance, alcohol, gum, supplements.&lt;br /&gt;11. I avoid chemical based sunscreen sunscreens with sleeker bottles and quick-absorbing formulas that sell in every box store and drug store in every form from liquid to spray which or toxic and kills the idea of doing what I intended to do for my skin, PROTECT FROM CANCER.

    <li> I love Mychelle products. This sunscreen is great. Non toxic and great for oily skin types. I use it daily under a mineral makeup for great sun protection. I noticed it is also great as an oil absorbing cream for my face.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen seemed so light, I wasn&#x27;t sure of the protection it would provide. However, it has provided amazing protection to my children (3 and 6). We were at the pool for three hours the other day (with breaks, of course), and it protected their skin, no sunburns, without reapplying. We also used this on our faces while at Disney, and had people ask us how we managed to go to Disney for an entire day in July and not get sunburned. So, it apparently works well!</li>
    <li> I hve allergies to sun screens, but this worked for me.</li>
    <li> I really like this sunblock.  you do have to blend it in well, but i love the coverage and it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out.</li>
    <li> I use this for protection for my face.  I have fair skin and must use something.  This is a little dry.  To apply I usually mix it with a small amount of Badger Damascus Rose antioxidant face oil.  I put both products in my palm, mix and apply.  Love that this is vegan friendly, gluten-free and cruelty free with good SPF protection</li>
    <li> Love MyChelle products. The texture of this particular one could be a little smoother. But still a good creme.</li>
    <li> Provides great protection and matte finish, which is essential for persons with oily skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used MyChelle products for years. This product is light, doesn&#x27;t cause break-outs and doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky white film you find with some of the other natural SPF products.</li>
    <li> After spending WAY too much time researching sunscreens, in the attempt to find a reasonable alternative to the chemical options, I chose this item based on the reviews of others. Well - not sure who&#x27;s writing those reviews or what they have for skin covering their faces, but I found this product to be one of the most uncomfortable formulas I&#x27;ve ever tried (of anything made for the face). With the thinnest coat I could apply, and after applying it daily for 4 days ( to give it a reasonable chance), I had to stop. It felt like my face had been coated in paraffin. To touch my cheek minutes, even hours later, results in releasing a trickle of water (I didn&#x27;t perceive myself to be sweating) I didn&#x27;t know was sitting on the surface of my face. Add to that the painful breakout that showed up on day 2 (?), and vanished within 3 days of stopping the use of this sunscreen. So I thought maybe now that I&#x27;ve paid for it, maybe I could use it on my arms. Nope. So sticky, I was afraid to place my arms on the arm rests of a chair, thought I might soil them. In either case, washing it off wasn&#x27;t difficult. And the good news is that it doesn&#x27;t have any detectable odor. So something to be grateful for. Very disappointed overall. Was really looking forward to my &#x27;new&amp;#34; summer sunscreen. And I waited for over a week (about 10 days?)  to receive delivery. Anyone want a used tube of sunscreen?</li>
    <li> Works well. Seems to be 28 SPF as stated, so re-application may be necessary after several hours, swimming, toweling, etc. Only minimal white residue on clothing after application -  better than most others. Dries fast, so mixing with regular skin lotion makes it easier to apply.</li>
    <li> I have tried other non-chemical sunscreens and they are very greasy. This product is not greasy, but it does feel a little heavy on your skin, which is probably unavoidable. I am not sure how protective from the sun it is, so I still wear a hat with it. I also don&#x27;t use this product if I am going to be in the sun outside at midday for an extended period of time; then I use a chemical sun screen. Overall I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The best sunscreen ever! None oily and protect my face from getting more dark spots. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product contains zinc oxide which is the one ingredient any sunscreen should have for actual protection from the sun.</li>
    <li> Never leave home without it. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so white, but if I mix makeup in it or use powder it cancels that out. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard wonderful things about this company, and I don&#x27;t doubt that their ingredients are quality. However, this sunscreen didn&#x27;t work out for me. The texture is nice and I like how it feels on my face, but it didn&#x27;t work as a sunscreen. I tried applying it thicker but my skin was still pink after each day I tried it. I also had some breakout action.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome I recently took it to the beach and normally I always burn my face no matter what but this stuff saved on a hot San Diego beach day, I love that this dosent smell like anything and not greasy but most of all its all natural and it works!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product - been using it for years!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is my all time favorite.  I have worked hard to eliminate chemicals from my skincare routine and have tried many alternative sunscreens.  I cameback to  MyChelle because I can mix it with a bit of moisturizer and it glides on, doesn&#x27;t leave a white film and doesn&#x27;t flake when I put makeup over it.  Additionally, the price is really reasonable for this quality product.  I have oily, acne prone, mature skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my face or feel the least bit heavy.</li>
    <li> I mountain bike ride about 3 times a week, live in Southern California and don&#x27;t want to use chemical sunscreens. This goes on quite easily and I&#x27;m not pasty white afterwards. It&#x27;s not sticky, and seems to do the job. I usually just use it on my face; I wear long sleeves to cover my arms.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for roughly a month, and I love it. It goes on clear after your rub it in for 2 seconds, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. In the past, I&#x27;ve had trouble with my skin breaking out from wearing sunscreen, but that hasn&#x27;t happened with this brand at all. This particular sunscreen also acts like a primer for my foundation- it helps it to stay on all day! The one thing that you may find with this sunscreen is that you need to exfoliate every other day to get it all off your face. It does comes off when you wash your face, but to me, it feels like a bit of it stays on. The trick is to exfoliate every other day or so, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> This is a very good sunscreen as it has as few harmful ingredients as you can get.  I am very allergic, and I do not react at all to this product.  That says volumes about its quality.</li>
    <li> This is one of three natural sunscreens I bought for a recent vacation.  This was the best sunscreen for the price.  (The others were John Masters which was really expensive and Caribbean Solutions Faces Only which was too pasty.)  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I am OBSESSED with this Zinclear SPF 28 sunscreen. If you have oily skin wear it under foundation (I use it with a liquid mineral) for all day matte finish -- BETTER than ANY MATTIFYING product at Sephora or elsewhere and all natural -- love it! Please keep this product as is forever!</li>
