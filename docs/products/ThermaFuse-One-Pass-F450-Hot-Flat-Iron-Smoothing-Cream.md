      <li>I have the frizz of death and this stuff is amazing</li>
      <li>my hair turn out amazing,</li>
      <li>and I think it&#x27;s the best for keeping that straight hair style.  </li>
      <li>but of all of the products I&#x27;ve tried this product does the best at not only smoothing the damaged ends, but adding body.  </li>
      <li>The size and price offered here were much better than I have seen before.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for naturally curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Hair feels smooth and stays that way</li>
      <li>Paid 1/2 the salon price for the same great price.  </li>
      <li>This is fantastic like all the Thermafuse products are.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s for special occassion and not every day use.</li>
      <li>, I found the F450 product and it works for me and my type of long and beautiful hair very impress with product, I recommend this product to any one that wants there hair smooth and straight ......</li>
      <li>I have used the F450 Smoothing Cream twice now and it is true that for the most part it is one pass with the flat iron -</li>
      <li>This product is expensive and I ordered it because of the wonderful reviews.  </li>
      <li>This product didn&#x27;t work any better than my lower priced Regis flat iron spray.</li>
      <li>it used to take me 2-3 passes in certain areas and my neckline would curl anyways.  </li>
      <li>It did absolutely nothing to soften it</li>
      <li>I have REALLY frizzy hair when it&#x27;s humid out.</li>
      <li>but I do have a cheap flat iron that could have something to do with it.</li>
      <li>I will have to wait a few days to ensure they&#x27;ll be no reversion and my hair does not require more frequent washing although as it stands now, there is no evidence of a coating on the hair.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this and the Heatsmart serum for anyone with naturally curly hair.  </li>
      <li>It also feels protective when you are flat ironing as long as you use enough (more than recommended).  </li>
      <li>I have ultra fine, frizzy, soft hair that when dried naturally, resembles brown cotton candy.  </li>
      <li>this is an absolutely MUST before you use your flat iron.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair very smooth and does weigh it down, like other products!!</li>
      <li>Love the product just don&#x27;t like receiving Broken items</li>

    <li> I just got this product.  This is fantastic like all the Thermafuse products are.  I have used the heatsmart serum for several years and it keeps my hair from frizzing.  I have used the F450 Smoothing Cream twice now and it is true that for the most part it is one pass with the flat iron - it used to take me 2-3 passes in certain areas and my neckline would curl anyways.  Now it doesn&#x27;t!  I would highly recommend this and the Heatsmart serum for anyone with naturally curly hair.  I wish these products were around in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s!!</li>
    <li> My hair is completely damaged from a bad hairstylist and this makes my hair so much easier to straighten now. I definitely recommend it!!</li>
    <li> The cap was broken when I received it. Love the product just don&#x27;t like receiving Broken items</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  I have ultra fine, frizzy, soft hair that when dried naturally, resembles brown cotton candy.  Also more recently my hair has begun to thin and is less bouncy.  I&#x27;ve only used it once, but of all of the products I&#x27;ve tried this product does the best at not only smoothing the damaged ends, but adding body.  I will have to wait a few days to ensure they&#x27;ll be no reversion and my hair does not require more frequent washing although as it stands now, there is no evidence of a coating on the hair.  Wish it added more shine as described but all in all an excellent product!</li>
    <li> This product is expensive and I ordered it because of the wonderful reviews.  I have wavy hair that has been lightened and is a little frizzy. This product not only weighed down my hair but left Iit feeling rough and course. It did absolutely nothing to soften it it make it look shiny. Confused.</li>
    <li> Best product ever!!! I&#x27;m so glad I found this. The only product I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually does work against humidity.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work any better than my lower priced Regis flat iron spray. I didn&#x27;t like that it was a cream not a spray. I have to change my style from day to evening which I usually flat iron for day, curl for evening. This product inhibits curling so I suppose that&#x27;s a plus if you want to keep it flat. I also didn&#x27;t find that it was a one pass and stay product but I do have a cheap flat iron that could have something to do with it.</li>
    <li> Paid 1/2 the salon price for the same great price.  I love this stuff!  Hair feels smooth and stays that way</li>
    <li> I have the frizz of death and this stuff is amazing</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair. I have REALLY frizzy hair when it&#x27;s humid out. This works wonders on it.</li>
    <li> love it, works great, smells good! would buy again, pretty expensive stuff, but works really well and I like the big bottle</li>
    <li> I like this product, I have used it before, The size and price offered here were much better than I have seen before. I would recommend this to use before flat ironing. It works for me, thank you.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for naturally curly hair.  I have used it for a couple of years and I think it&#x27;s the best for keeping that straight hair style.  It also feels protective when you are flat ironing as long as you use enough (more than recommended).  It is a little expensive so it&#x27;s for special occassion and not every day use.</li>
    <li> I was visiting with my daughter in Hawaii she took me to her salon my hair turn out amazing, So  I went on line when I return to California, I found the F450 product and it works for me and my type of long and beautiful hair very impress with product, I recommend this product to any one that wants there hair smooth and straight ......</li>
    <li> If you have hair that is over-dried or over-processed like mine and too curly (like mine) this is an absolutely MUST before you use your flat iron. It smooths down my ends and makes my hair look like silk. I give it a big THUMBS UP!!</li>
    <li> Best product for my hair! It does what it says! makes flat ironing faster too! I think by other comments it was supposed to have a cap but mine didn&#x27;t….</li>
    <li> Awesome product... Love love love!!! Makes my hair very smooth and does weigh it down, like other products!! Al little bit goes a long way! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Love it !!!!&lt;br /&gt;5 stars</li>
    <li> Love it. I use to buy this from my hairdresser. I got this big size for the same price I had been paying for the small size at the salon.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just like described.</li>
