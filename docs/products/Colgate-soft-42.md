      <li>They do a good job of brushing your teeth.</li>
      <li>this was a good purchase price wise and quality wise.  </li>
      <li>Kind of smallish.</li>
      <li>bought these because toothbrushes are a handy thing to have around to give to people or get a quickie replacement without having to go to the store.</li>
      <li>My mentor, my savior, my charitable host, had given over his mind to the demon sheep-rabies and had become a madman!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good quality toothbrush that will keep you away from more than schedule dental visits :)</li>
      <li>The price is amazingly appealing, too.</li>
      <li>A good basic toothbrush at a great price.</li>
      <li>Patients love it</li>
      <li>I mostly use an electric toothbrush, but I use these when I need an easy one for travel.</li>
      <li>Great toothbrush for sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>To this day I owe much of my knowledge of animal husbandry, rustic cuisine, archery, wine, and song to the wise words of Hercules Katsoulidis, and I blame him not for the tragedy that soon befell him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Boxes were sealed and are re-closable, so we store them in the cabinet easily and conveniently.  </li>
      <li>and ...things were fine.</li>
      <li>Everything was fine.  </li>
      <li>His smile, once so kind and so full, gnashed and gnarled as his mind gave over to madness, and the foam seeped forth from his maw.</li>
      <li>Comfortable and quality toothbrush</li>
      <li>Toothbrush is sturdy and bristles do not fall out like some cheap toothbrushes do.</li>
      <li>Good soft toothbrush.</li>
      <li>As my toothbrushes get worn out, I quickly move to a new one and so far they have fully impressed me.</li>
      <li>These are used to clean the harmonicas that I repair.  </li>
      <li>I grabbed a splintered broom-handle from the kitchen corner and parried his clumsy blows as best I could, all the while attempting to talk some sense into him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem like the brush was a full head.</li>
      <li>Shipped out quick and came in two boxes of 6</li>
      <li>The soft bristles are difficult to find, so I was very happy to see them offered here and at a fair price.</li>
      <li>would recommend this to just about anyone who is interested in good care for their teeth and these days that is a big investment.</li>
      <li>Since I switched to these Soft Brushes my gums are in better shape.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the cost.</li>
      <li>Odd but true, I&#x27;ve been on a quest for the best toothbrush and finally found one.  </li>
      <li>Just right softness, yet work well.  </li>
      <li>They are just right for me.</li>
      <li>just right.  </li>
      <li>I have enough brushes for a year and the exact kind that I like.  </li>
      <li>prefer a soft large brush like the old Oral-B 60 from 30 years ago which was rectangular and able to brush most of my teeth on one side with one</li>
      <li>l like these brushes very much.</li>
      <li>Another thing is that the elasticity of the bristles is just the right amount, I prefer the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; over the other choices, it is kind to my gums.  </li>
      <li>Because of this genius design I am not wasting energy just holding onto the toothbrush, therefore I am doing a better job at getting my teeth thoroughly brushed.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what ordered...</li>
      <li>Or have you taken leave of your senses entirely, and do you now stand before me more beast than man?!?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You will get exactly what you were expecting if you order these.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>And with the Lord as my witness, the only foam to fringe the corners of my mouth will come from the rich lather of my toothpaste!</li>
      <li>Really I just needed a few more dollars to get free shipping.</li>
      <li>Really appreciated the easy open packaging.  </li>
      <li>I like the full head that the colgate extra clean toothbrush offers.</li>
      <li>Wow, doesn&#x27;t this sound a little over the top?  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>My smile, ever so soft and refined, maintains its pearly luster on account of these brushes.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re shaped for comfort with a basic hand grip and comfortable bristles.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I did not bother sending them back, as the cost of shipping from where I am now would have been as much as the toothbrushes cost originally.</li>
      <li>I feel like they don&#x27;t clean well enough.  </li>
      <li>When I was a boy of no more than 12 summers, I&#x27;d come to wander the countryside, after having lived on the run from the destruction of my father&#x27;s ancestral lands at the hands of his own folly.</li>
      <li>Decent brush though.</li>
      <li>High quality.</li>
      <li>The bristles also are of varying sizes and textures, which makes them a notch up from a normal toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are also very durable with a firm strong handle.</li>
      <li>I cringe each time I need to buy a new toothbrush</li>
      <li>I start using a new one.</li>
      <li>The handle design is ergonomic and I use less energy brushing because it is easy to hold and manipulate with a place for my thumb to balance the toothbrush body.  </li>
      <li>Prefer soft brushes that are decently priced.</li>
      <li>I really like this toothbrush because it fits into most bathroom holders without being too thick.  </li>
      <li>I saw, by the wild and distant look in his eye, and the in-sane smile that crested his lips, that Hercules had been stricken by madness!</li>
      <li>They came in two small boxes of six, that are attached on top of one another.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend these for their quality and major discount.</li>
      <li>It is soft as labeled and stands up to some hardy brushing.  </li>
      <li>These are way too soft for me.</li>
      <li>Product was exactly what was listed except for the bristles are not soft</li>
      <li>They are soft toothbrushes what else can I say...</li>
      <li>Please, what I want is an old fashion tooth brush like a Oral-B P-60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
      <li>this contest will not be settled by our prowess with these weapons, but with the wits in our skulls!\\&quot; And at that, I kicked a clod of dirt into the old man&#x27;s face, momentarily blinding him.</li>
      <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Hercules, you old, befuddled fool!\\</li>
      <li>four long hours, without rest, without relent, I battled Hercules and his machete with my broom-handle to a reasonable stalemate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>wretched old Greek lunged forward at me in reply, his blade nearly slicing the ear from the side of my skull!</li>
      <li>this day, whenever I brush my teeth with these Colgate Extra Clean Toothbrushes (Full Head - Soft), I think back to my time on the Aeolian isles, and I weep for the man that Hercules Katsoulidis had been, and for the twisted freak he had become.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t bad toothbrushes, and they aren&#x27;t great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Hercules lurched toward me, salivating, murmuring gibberish from the corners of a mouth that had long ceased to be capable of rendering perceptible human speech.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised that a company as sound as Colgate has little quality control - at least with these toothbrushes.</li>

    <li> I like the full head that the colgate extra clean toothbrush offers. The soft bristles are difficult to find, so I was very happy to see them offered here and at a fair price.</li>
    <li> Since I switched to these Soft Brushes my gums are in better shape.  Great price and quality.</li>
    <li> Great value here! Good quality toothbrush that will keep you away from more than schedule dental visits :)</li>
    <li> These are way too soft for me. I feel like they don&#x27;t clean well enough.  Would rather have the medium.</li>
    <li> Good soft toothbrush. now I&#x27;m all set for a year!</li>
    <li> Great deal for a variety of colors.</li>
    <li> These are used to clean the harmonicas that I repair.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Toothbrush is sturdy and bristles do not fall out like some cheap toothbrushes do.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pack of 12 toothbrushes.They work well enough. You will get exactly what you were expecting if you order these.</li>
    <li> I got my pack of 12 and all were perfect.They do a good job of brushing your teeth.They come in a variety of colors.I would recommend.</li>
    <li> pack of 12 for a great price. They are at least $2.50 at the store. Individually contained and came in 2 small boxes of 6</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem like the brush was a full head. Kind of smallish. It&#x27;s not because I have a &#x27;big mouth&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I buy toothbrushes in  volume because whenever I feel a cold coming on I start using a new one. This helps stop the spread of the of the virus. These brushes are of good quality and economy.</li>
    <li> I bought these for hygeine packages we were putting together for church. They aren&#x27;t bad toothbrushes, and they aren&#x27;t great. the bristles aren&#x27;t packed together as tightly as the more expensive brushes, and they don&#x27;t last as long. However for the price per brush, they aren&#x27;t too bad. I mostly use an electric toothbrush, but I use these when I need an easy one for travel.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush for sensitive teeth</li>
    <li> Really appreciated the easy open packaging.  Also, the multiple colors are a bonus.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Really I just needed a few more dollars to get free shipping. So why not by toothbrushes for the next 3 years. They are soft and no special bells and whistles. The head has a few different colored bristles, but I don&#x27;t see a real difference. Stands up to twice daily brushing for 3 months as expected.</li>
    <li> A good basic toothbrush at a great price.</li>
    <li> I like them.  They are what I expected</li>
    <li> Comfortable and quality toothbrush</li>
    <li> These are name brand, quality toothbrushes. They&#x27;re definitely not anything fancy, but they&#x27;re way above the weird toothbrushes you get for free at various events or pickup last minute at corner stores. They&#x27;re shaped for comfort with a basic hand grip and comfortable bristles. The bristles also are of varying sizes and textures, which makes them a notch up from a normal toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these because toothbrushes are a handy thing to have around to give to people or get a quickie replacement without having to go to the store. Furthermore, when you bulk buy 12 at a time, individually you can make them last 2-3 years for about $10. As my toothbrushes get worn out, I quickly move to a new one and so far they have fully impressed me. I highly recommend these for their quality and major discount.</li>
    <li> l like these brushes very much. They are not too soft and not too hard. They are just right for me. They are also very durable with a firm strong handle. l&#x27;ve used it for several weeks and there&#x27;s been no change in the quality or condition of this brush. Good quality !</li>
    <li> They are soft toothbrushes what else can I say...</li>
    <li> this was a good purchase price wise and quality wise.  I have enough brushes for a year and the exact kind that I like.  would recommend this to just about anyone who is interested in good care for their teeth and these days that is a big investment.</li>
    <li> When I was a boy of no more than 12 summers, I&#x27;d come to wander the countryside, after having lived on the run from the destruction of my father&#x27;s ancestral lands at the hands of his own folly. Homeless and alone, I earned my keep on several small fishing vessels off the coasts of the Mediterranean, before finding refuge in the seaside home of one Mr. Hercules Katsoulidis, a Greek shepherd of limited means and boundless generosity. To this day I owe much of my knowledge of animal husbandry, rustic cuisine, archery, wine, and song to the wise words of Hercules Katsoulidis, and I blame him not for the tragedy that soon befell him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had just returned to the dinner-table, having spent the afternoon gathering corn-husks and sea urchins for supper, when Hercules burst into the hut, foaming at the mouth, his expression vacant and eerie, a crude machete dangling from his beefy hand. I saw, by the wild and distant look in his eye, and the in-sane smile that crested his lips, that Hercules had been stricken by madness! I would later surmise that he&#x27;d contracted the sheep-rabies from a wayward ewe in his flock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hercules lurched toward me, salivating, murmuring gibberish from the corners of a mouth that had long ceased to be capable of rendering perceptible human speech. He drew his machete and raised it aloft, and in that instant, I knew I would have to use my limited understanding of the martial arts in order to defend myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Hercules!\\&quot; I cried. \\&quot;It is I, the boy who&#x27;s come to stay with you! Do you not remember me?!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wretched old Greek lunged forward at me in reply, his blade nearly slicing the ear from the side of my skull! I grabbed a splintered broom-handle from the kitchen corner and parried his clumsy blows as best I could, all the while attempting to talk some sense into him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Hercules, you old, befuddled fool!\\&quot; I said. \\&quot;I&#x27;ll do you in if I must! But please, return to your reason! Or have you taken leave of your senses entirely, and do you now stand before me more beast than man?!?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I received the answer to that grim question. Hercules locked eyes with me, and in a low, gutteral growl, he said only this: \\&quot;Baaaaah. Baaa-aaa-aaaaaaaah! Baaaaa-aaaa!!!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rabies indeed! It was too late for him now! My mentor, my savior, my charitable host, had given over his mind to the demon sheep-rabies and had become a madman!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For four long hours, without rest, without relent, I battled Hercules and his machete with my broom-handle to a reasonable stalemate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I see,\\&quot; said I, \\&quot;That this contest will not be settled by our prowess with these weapons, but with the wits in our skulls!\\&quot; And at that, I kicked a clod of dirt into the old man&#x27;s face, momentarily blinding him. I hesitated to deal the coup de grace the once-proud man probably deserved, and instead, I ran off into the hills under cover of dusk and cloud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To this day, whenever I brush my teeth with these Colgate Extra Clean Toothbrushes (Full Head - Soft), I think back to my time on the Aeolian isles, and I weep for the man that Hercules Katsoulidis had been, and for the twisted freak he had become. His smile, once so kind and so full, gnashed and gnarled as his mind gave over to madness, and the foam seeped forth from his maw. My smile, ever so soft and refined, maintains its pearly luster on account of these brushes. And with the Lord as my witness, the only foam to fringe the corners of my mouth will come from the rich lather of my toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Excellent product great price great value</li>
    <li> Product was as described and worked well.</li>
    <li> Just received these toothbrushes.  Tried and disappointed.  The handles are poorly designed.  The brush head is poorly made.  You (I) get what you pay for in th end.</li>
    <li> Everything was fine.  Just what I ordered, took a bit to get to me but I believe it was within the shipping quote and ...things were fine.</li>
    <li> Please, what I want is an old fashion tooth brush like a Oral-B P-60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How or where can I purchase them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dale</li>
    <li> It is exectly what you would expect</li>
    <li> As described.  Timely shipping.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Good value and price.</li>
    <li> Well packaged  and gift for our poor.</li>
    <li> Seller Overstocksale shipped on time, well packed.  The brushes themselves are very small.  For a child?  The handles are skinny and wimpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer a soft large brush like the old Oral-B 60 from 30 years ago which was rectangular and able to brush most of my teeth on one side with one stroke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This puny brush is for kids.</li>
    <li> Instead of soft head toothbrushes, I received firm head.  And unfortunately, it&#x27;s too late to send them back.</li>
    <li> Horrible plastic taste in mouth for the first couple of bushings with these toothbrushes. Yuk!</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what was listed except for the bristles are not soft</li>
    <li> Was disappointed that they were all the same. Decent brush though. Prefer soft brushes that are decently priced. Shipped out quick and came in two boxes of 6</li>
    <li> Good toothbrushes. High quality. Good value.</li>
    <li> Toothbrushes are the same ones we have been using for a long time.  Just right softness, yet work well.  A little less than the store and bulk convenience for changing every 2-3 months, as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They did not arrive on a sheet like looks in the picture.  They came in two small boxes of six, that are attached on top of one another.  Boxes were sealed and are re-closable, so we store them in the cabinet easily and conveniently.  Takes up a lot less room than having 12 toothbrushes sitting around loose.</li>
    <li> These actually came out cheaper, than buying at the Dollar Tree.</li>
    <li> These are not &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brushes; at best they are medium. I did not bother sending them back, as the cost of shipping from where I am now would have been as much as the toothbrushes cost originally. I&#x27;m surprised that a company as sound as Colgate has little quality control - at least with these toothbrushes. Again, they are not soft.</li>
    <li> Odd but true, I&#x27;ve been on a quest for the best toothbrush and finally found one.  The handle design is ergonomic and I use less energy brushing because it is easy to hold and manipulate with a place for my thumb to balance the toothbrush body.  Because of this genius design I am not wasting energy just holding onto the toothbrush, therefore I am doing a better job at getting my teeth thoroughly brushed.  The length of the bristles are long enough so they move around my teeth without having to press too hard to get in between the teeth.  Another thing is that the elasticity of the bristles is just the right amount, I prefer the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; over the other choices, it is kind to my gums.  Wow, doesn&#x27;t this sound a little over the top?  You may say, &amp;#34;A toothbrush is a toothbrush&amp;#34;.  If you feel this way you haven&#x27;t tried this one.  Congratulations to Colgate for creating the better/best toothbrush.  The price is amazingly appealing, too.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain. They arrived on time, and individually wrapped. Great for visitors and for traveling. I cringe each time I need to buy a new toothbrush so I&#x27;m happy to have the supply at home.</li>
    <li> I really like this toothbrush because it fits into most bathroom holders without being too thick.  It is soft as labeled and stands up to some hardy brushing.  I also like the size of the head because it isn&#x27;t too large or too small....just right.  Also, this is a good value.</li>
    <li> It feels like it should be a children tooth brush</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes of good quality and are a great deal.  They are the same toothbrushes you would get in the store for about $1 each.  I&#x27;ve reordered these twice.</li>
    <li> Exactly what ordered... Patients love it</li>
    <li> great price! and the product performs flawlessly so you will enjoy using them day in and day out</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re nothing fancy, but I still like having them around as a courtesy for people who stay over at my place. They&#x27;re also great for going on trips and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Great quality toothbrushes</li>
