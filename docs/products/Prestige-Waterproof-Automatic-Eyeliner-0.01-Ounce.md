      <li>Awesome combination.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Otherwise, great product!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Otherwise, great product!  </li>
      <li>I especially love it for filling in my brows.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone to bed and woken up with my brows still looking great while using this product!</li>
      <li>For years I&#x27;ve used CoverGirl&#x27;s espresso clicker pencil, but I&#x27;m happy to say this one surpasses it in both price and functionality.</li>
      <li>Great liner.</li>
      <li>So happy I found this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>The price is amazing and it stays on all day I teach PE and can wear my eye liner (to look awake lol ) and know it won&#x27;t smear.</li>
      <li>Super, duper great value!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>My favorite eyeliner!</li>
      <li>I will note that the eyeliner is very easy to use for smudge looks, and won&#x27;t put up a fight, if you want it moved or REmoved; very easy to take off with just water and a q-tip, but long-lasting.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and the colour is nice.</li>
      <li>Goes on easy and is a nice color..  Doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
      <li>(mostly the double-edged sword that is sharpening</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and great product.</li>
      <li>My favorite, promptly delivered</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re on the fence, it&#x27;s only about $5, which is still an excellent price point for an eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>and so glad I tried this one.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s gone in an hour, even if I put eyeshadow on top.</li>
      <li>I love prestige pencils.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re on the fence, it&#x27;s only about $5, which is still an excellent price point for an eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>Goes on easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;PROS: Prestige eyeliner doesn&#x27;t require a sharpener, and the difference in the amount of time it lasts, compared to brands that DO require sharpeners (looking at you, Tarte) is huge.  </li>
      <li>Can do clean lines.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner is also SUPER long-lasting on an application basis--I apply once in the morning</li>
      <li>I ended up loving both, but for different reasons</li>
      <li>Tarte is about $10 higher in cost, but it&#x27;s way more vivid, creamier, and eco-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Quick shipping, thanks!</li>
      <li>It really does last all day and the price is exceptional.</li>
      <li>This melts right off my eyes.</li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t come off!</li>
      <li>Nice liner, stays put like any other high end liner !</li>
      <li>I really needed waterproof...especially for those warmer days when your face feels like it&#x27;s melting.</li>
      <li>Lastly, although the color is just as shown, it would also be nice if they would produce a darker brown--but that&#x27;s just personal taste.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Lastly, although the color is just as shown, it would also be nice if they would produce a darker brown--but that&#x27;s just personal taste.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The color is great--a little light to be their main brown shade, but exactly how it appears in photos (Google &amp;#34;Prestige eyeliner Expresso&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll find swatches, since they seem to have been taken off of Amazon), so that&#x27;s a plus.  </li>
      <li>The tip of the liner dulls after one use, and, after that, precise points just aren&#x27;t going to happen.  </li>
      <li>Nice dark color, stays where you put it, for a low price.</li>
      <li>This will definitely be my new go to.</li>
      <li>: Wow, do I wish this thing would come with a built-in sharpening piece.  </li>
      <li>First of all, for me this brand falls just slightly behind Tarte cosmetics, so, if you&#x27;re looking for something just slightly different (or something with a bit more sparkle), I&#x27;d say try Tarte.  </li>
      <li>Color was medium brown, not dark brown.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m busy and constantly on the go and don&#x27;t have time for sharpening which sometimes create a longer application time.</li>
      <li>If you like the haphazard, smudged look, it works out great; if not, it isn&#x27;t impossible to create a neater look...just slightly more cumbersome.  </li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a little mushy and smears while putting it on but once it&#x27;s on, it stays in place.</li>
    <li> Super, duper great value!</li>
    <li> This is my go-to eye-liner. It is easy to apply and the colour is nice. It causes no irritation what-so-ever. I especially love it for filling in my brows. It seems to last a lot longer there. I&#x27;ve gone to bed and woken up with my brows still looking great while using this product!</li>
    <li> First of all, for me this brand falls just slightly behind Tarte cosmetics, so, if you&#x27;re looking for something just slightly different (or something with a bit more sparkle), I&#x27;d say try Tarte.  Neither of these brands tests on animals, and I ended up loving both, but for different reasons (mostly the double-edged sword that is sharpening--Tarte requires a sharpener, Prestige does not).  Tarte is about $10 higher in cost, but it&#x27;s way more vivid, creamier, and eco-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto this eyeliner:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Prestige eyeliner doesn&#x27;t require a sharpener, and the difference in the amount of time it lasts, compared to brands that DO require sharpeners (looking at you, Tarte) is huge.  I have two liners, in Expresso and Black, and they, together, have so far lasted me five months, with plenty left to give.  This eyeliner is also SUPER long-lasting on an application basis--I apply once in the morning and it lasts all day.  The color is great--a little light to be their main brown shade, but exactly how it appears in photos (Google &amp;#34;Prestige eyeliner Expresso&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll find swatches, since they seem to have been taken off of Amazon), so that&#x27;s a plus.  I will note that the eyeliner is very easy to use for smudge looks, and won&#x27;t put up a fight, if you want it moved or REmoved; very easy to take off with just water and a q-tip, but long-lasting.  Awesome combination.  PLUS, the pencil itself has the twisting, retracting part under the cap, so your eyeliner won&#x27;t push up into the cap accidentally, if you carry it in a bag.  Convenient design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Wow, do I wish this thing would come with a built-in sharpening piece.  The tip of the liner dulls after one use, and, after that, precise points just aren&#x27;t going to happen.  If you like the haphazard, smudged look, it works out great; if not, it isn&#x27;t impossible to create a neater look...just slightly more cumbersome.  Of course, some stores do sell sharpeners for retractable liners, but that&#x27;s extra cost that doesn&#x27;t always deliver all that well.  Lastly, although the color is just as shown, it would also be nice if they would produce a darker brown--but that&#x27;s just personal taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, great product!  If you&#x27;re on the fence, it&#x27;s only about $5, which is still an excellent price point for an eyeliner.

    <li> Nice dark color, stays where you put it, for a low price. Goes on easily.</li>
    <li> The product is dried up and the tip breaks into pieces. Can do clean lines. Color was medium brown, not dark brown. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> This exceeded my expectations. It really does last all day and the price is exceptional. This will definitely be my new go to.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and is as advertised.  Color is too dark for me, but that&#x27;s user error.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and great product.</li>
    <li> Great liner. Stays put all day for me.</li>
    <li> Nice liner, stays put like any other high end liner ! Would reorder again!</li>
    <li> So happy I found this eyeliner. I was looking for an eyeliner to add to my amazon subscription and so glad I tried this one. The price is amazing and it stays on all day I teach PE and can wear my eye liner (to look awake lol ) and know it won&#x27;t smear.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and works well for me.  I have this on subscrbe and save.</li>
    <li> My favorite, promptly delivered</li>
    <li> Finally, an eyeliner that actually works! Love it! Will definitely buy again and again!</li>
    <li> There is nothing to not like.&lt;br /&gt;The twisting function of the liner works, twists the product both out and back, unless some others that twist only out.&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the liner glides on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;The color is a very dark brown, espresso, as expected.&lt;br /&gt;It is made in the U.S.A.</li>
    <li> I actually have eyebrows, but I like to fill in and shape a bit with a pencil. For years I&#x27;ve used CoverGirl&#x27;s espresso clicker pencil, but I&#x27;m happy to say this one surpasses it in both price and functionality. The fact that it&#x27;s waterproof is a bonus. It really doesn&#x27;t come off! I really needed waterproof...especially for those warmer days when your face feels like it&#x27;s melting. No smears here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased it at some store...WalMart?, Once from Amazon out of desperation for a replacement, but it&#x27;s an annoying &amp;#34;add on item&amp;#34;, so I began looking elsewhere. I recently found it on Ulta&#x27;s site and saw that they actually have a waterproof lip liner line too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m busy and constantly on the go and don&#x27;t have time for sharpening which sometimes create a longer application time. This just works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this buy...if you buy the right color of course!</li>
    <li> This melts right off my eyes. I put it on - it goes on well/easy - but it&#x27;s gone in an hour, even if I put eyeshadow on top.</li>
    <li> My favorite eyeliner! Quick shipping, thanks!</li>
    <li> I love prestige pencils. This is no different.  Goes on easy and is a nice color..  Doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
