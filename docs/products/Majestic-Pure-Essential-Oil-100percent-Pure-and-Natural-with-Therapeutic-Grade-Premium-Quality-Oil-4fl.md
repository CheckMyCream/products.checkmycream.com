<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used Majestic Pure Oils before and I have never been disappointed. Not only was this the first time I&#x27;ve tried Majestic Pure Frankincense Oil but this was my first time using Frankincense Oil period. Like usual I was NOT disappointed. I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect so before actually trying it I put a drop on a paper towel to smell it to see how strong it was so I would know an estimate of how much to put in my oil diffuser. The scent isn&#x27;t overly strong so I put 3 drops in my diffuser and let the Frankincense fill my house with it&#x27;s scent. It has a really nice scent. My roommate is allergic to a lot of stuff and sometimes can have a hard time breathing with different scents and when she walked out of her room and smelled the Frankincense Oil she actually really liked it and said that it actually made her breathing easier which is a huge surprise! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> I love this scent for use in my diffuser. If you are using as much as I do, then a larger bottle like this one will be a must. This is also great if you are into making soaps or candles as well. The droppers comes separately and is added after opening. The scent is stronger than other Frankincense Essential oils I have and it is long lasting in my diffuser and I will definitely go back  to this one after I run out. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts opinions or experiences.</li>
    <li> This essential oil smells really good.To be honest I tried most of this seller&#x27;s essential oil products and they are all great.The aroma is really good.It lit up my whole room.I love all your products.The smeels are so relaxing.This will be great to use with a diffuser though.</li>
    <li> Love the scent. Good value for size of bottle!</li>
    <li> This oil has a very strong smell. I will admit that may be a good thing as it has passed the paper test where you drop a drop on a piece of white computer paper and wait for it to dry, of it leaves a ring its not pure. This oil left nothing behind at all. Good product.</li>
    <li> So I have to start by saying I love the smell of Frankincense, so one of the main reasons I bought this oil was to put in my diffuser . Frankincense oil will immediately induce the feeling of peace, relaxation, and satisfaction. Add a few drops of frankincense oil to a hot bath for stress relief.  You can also add frankincense to an oil diffuser to fight anxiety and for experiencing relaxation in your home all the time. To me the smell of Frankincense remind me of a cleansing, or a new start.  Some people believe that the fragrance of frankincense can increase your intuition and spiritual connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense essential oil is a powerful astringent, meaning it helps protect skin cells. It can be used to help reduce acne blemishes, the appearance of large pores, to prevent wrinkles, and it will even help lift and tighten skin to naturally slow signs of aging. The oil can be used anywhere where the skin becomes saggy such as the abdomen, jowls, or under the eyes. Mix 6 drops of oil to one ounce of a carrier oil and apply it directly to the skin. Be sure to always do a small patch area though first to test for possible allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense oil can help with wound healing and may decrease the appearance of scars. It may also help reduce the appearance of dark spots caused from acne blemishes, stretch marks, eczema and help with healing of surgical wounds. Mix 2-3 drops of oil with a carrier oil or lotion and apply directly to skin. Be careful of applying it to broken skin, but it is fine for skin that is in the process of healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am going to share my face lotion recipe with you, it really easy and it will make you skin look and feel great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Drops Frankincense Essential Oil&lt;br /&gt;5 Drops Lavender Essential Oil&lt;br /&gt;1 1/2 Tablespoon Organic Coconut Oil&lt;br /&gt;1/2 Teaspoon Olive Oil&lt;br /&gt;Small Container or jar to mix the ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you do is make your coconut oil soft rather than solid. If need be, heat it first in a double broiler. Add the other oils and stir together to combine. Spread over your face and body. You may want to pat yourself off after to not allow the oil to seep into your bed sheets. You can also store this to use at another time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always one of my favorite parts of ordering Majestic Pure oils, they come with a lid on it, in a dark glass bottle, with a dropper for when you are ready to open it.

    <li> Majestic Pure has done it again with this Frankincense Essential Oil! Being an oil fanatic, I was eager to test the benefits of frankincense. I am very happy with the results I&#x27;ve had thus far. This is a very large amount of the oil, so one bottle will last you for quite some time, even if you use it heavily. It was happy to have both a screw top, as well as a dropper for dispensing,  this comes in handy when blending oils! Now, as far as the scent of this goes, if I had to compare it to something, I&#x27;d say it smells like a mild tea tree oil. If you&#x27;re not familiar with that scent, it&#x27;s similar to a pine cleaner. I tested this oil both by diffuser as well as topical use, and was pleased with the results of each. I felt more at ease, free, relaxed. This has become a great ally in my yoga arsenal, as it helps to set the right mood. I also like to diffuse this during work to keep the stress level to a minimum. Super product!&lt;br /&gt;Discounted for truthful evaluation</li>
    <li> best price I could find and great scent. Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> oh my god this smells so good. I just got it but can tell it is a quality product from first whiff. can&#x27; t wait to use this in homemade soaps and lotions. Came nicely packaged and ready to use. Glad I got it.  I got this product at a reduced rate in return for reviewing it, but I am very glad that I did.</li>
    <li> Frankincense essential oil is a miracle cure for so many different ailments including many skin woes such as acne, wrinkles, chapped skin, stretch marks, acne scars, oily skin and blemishes.  Wake up tired and dull skin using this frankincense essential oil facial steam! All you need to do is fill a pan halfway through with water and place it on the stove. Let the water boil for about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and carefully carry it using kitchen gloves to a table. Add only 1 to 2 drops to the water. Cover your head with a towel while leaning your face over the pan to perform a facial steam. After about 15 minutes, wash your face with a mild cleanser and behold glowing skin!  I did receive this product at a promotional price in exchange of my unbiased opinion.  I am quite pleased to say this is a wonderful medicinal oi.</li>
    <li> While I love the oil, packaging needs a lot of work both of my droppers arrived broken. That means a lot of waste.</li>
    <li> I have never used Frankincense before so I had to do a little research on it.  I have a 3 year old daughter who doesn&#x27;t sleep well due to anxiety issues.  I was suprised to find out that they suggest using a few drops in a diffuser to help fight anxiety.  Considering I typically get around 3 hours of sleep a night because she wakes up frequently I though why not give it a try.  I mixed equal parts of Frankincense with Lavender in our diffuser and for the first time in a very very long time she actually slept 5 hours straight.  So it seemed to relax her which is beneficial.  I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. As always, all opinions about the products are my own! I would never, ever review something I didn’t enjoy or use myself this is my promise!  I did find a great recipe for a night lotion that I tried too that I actually enjoyed too...&lt;br /&gt;Mix 1 1/2 tablespoons of coconut oil (that has been warmed to make liquid), 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil, 5 drops of franincense oil and 5 drops of lavender oil in a small container.  Then rub into the face/body and pat with a soft cloth (in case the oil doesn&#x27;t completely absorb so it doesn&#x27;t oil stain your sheets).  You can also add a few drops to your shampoo or bath water which is quite relaxing as well.  I can honestly say I enjoy this product.  The only downside was my dropper arrived broken which was probably caused by my postal carrier who constantly abuses my mail by just tossing any and all packages onto my porch without care.  So once again I will have to politely ask him to be more careful.  Anyone else have issues with mail carriers doing this?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this, especially for the price. It appears to be genuine and unadulterated and is a huge bottle. Frankincense (or Boswellia Serrata) is a genuinely useful skin care ingredient and has been used to ease arthritis. You could add a few drops to your face cream and body moisturizer and it would have a good effect. Put in arthritis cream too! It&#x27;s an anti-inflammatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not one of those &amp;#34;ahhhhh, this smells so good I could breathe it all day&amp;#34; ones like lavender or rose. But it&#x27;s not at all unpleasant either. It&#x27;s sort of a citrusy-pine scent and smells wonderful mixed with other essential oils in fragrance or therapeutic blends.  It&#x27;s widely used in perfumery blended with other fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a paper-drop test (genuine essential oils evaporate without leaving a stain on the paper, carrier oils used to dilute do not) and it passed. It doesn&#x27;t smell like it has alcohol in it. The smell doesn&#x27;t make me feel funny after a while the way artificial fragrance oils do. I think this is the real deal and a fantastic value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
    <li> THIS OIL IS PREMIUM QUALITY!!!! IT BEATS SOME OF THE OTHER DILUTED ONES I HAVE TRIED. I USE THIS OIL FOR RELAXATION BEFORE BED. IT CAN ALSO BE USED AS A POWELFUL ANTISEPTIC, IT CAN REDUCE PAIn ASSOCIATED WITH ARTHRITIS AS WELL.&lt;br /&gt;I RECIENTLY RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT AS A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST UNBIASED REVIEW. AFTER TRIAL I WOULD RECOMMEND ITS GRADE. I LOVE THE EXTRA GLASS INCLUDED DROPPER FOR EASIER USE! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED QUALITY OIL</li>
    <li> Great value, good quality. We use this oil for many purposes and have found this to be one of the better ones we have tried.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, I use it for everything. I add to my body cream for relaxation and for waking up the senses and relaxes the ones that are so stressed!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the frankincense oil in a diffuser and I love it!</li>
    <li> frankincense essential oil. I&#x27;ve been diffusing it everyday, and am very satisfied. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just starting to learn about essential oils and their healing powers. I&#x27;ve used this mixed with witch oil as a face astringent as well as cleaning products! You really can google this and there are a million different ways to use it. I&#x27;m excited to learn more about it and use it for more things. I really like it as the astringent! It leaves my face feeling so clean and cared for.</li>
    <li> The bottle is wonderful. Came to us in a quick amount of time.very large bottle, the only thing is the dropper that came with it to use was broken when it arrived. It was crammed in a small box and broke while shipping. Other than that the product is great.</li>
    <li> great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It is great for headaches and this brand is just as good as other brands I have tried.</li>
    <li> This oil smells a little mediciny and reminds me of tea tree oil when I first put it on, but it gets a slight fruity smell after a few minutes.  It mixes well with other oils and I am enjoying mixing new scents with it.  It gives the sweeter smelling oils more body.  I am wondering about the color.  I thought frankincense essential oil is supposed to be pale yellow.  This oil is clear as water.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Gross!  It smells like cleaning fluid!  Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Frankincense has many many benefits, and I like to always have one handy especially in Summer time when you are exposed to bugs and skin rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has the tube like cover that allows you measure the amount you use at a time. I will use half the tube when applying to specific areas of the skin and two tube full when using in diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used frankincense before, now is a good time to start, not only is it excellent for the skin, especially in healing wounds or scars, it also has a calming effect. If you have a high stressed job or going through difficult times, try meditating and along with diffusing frankincense and you will realize how different, free and calm you become which is essential for you to be at your best and produce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In aromatherapy, frankincense oil is diffused  a very effective sedative that induces a feeling of mental peace, relaxation, and satisfaction, and helps relieve anxiety, anger, and stress.</li>
    <li> We enjoy using essential oils and use often.  This pure Frankincense essential oil has a lovely scent.&lt;br /&gt;We purchased the frankincense oil in a promotion for testing and review.  This essential oil smells&lt;br /&gt;especially nice when used in a diffuser.  This brand comes in a huge 4oz bottle.  The bottle also&lt;br /&gt;lists uses of Frankincense, (help in reduction of acne, pores, wrinkles, and the appearance of scars).&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend</li>
    <li> Update7/15/2016: Almost a year later, and I still have a lot of this oil left over. It lasts such a long time. I can also say that I can definitely tell the difference between this and tea tree oil now, lol :D It&#x27;s so good. I know it&#x27;s used for homeopathic things, but I just like/use it for the calming smell :)&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;It smells a little like tea tree oil, but earthier. I love this kind of oil. I don&#x27;t know if I am not used to the smell, but I think this brand smells more like tea tree oil. I am used to the DoTerra brand. I will have to find my other bottle and compare the two. If you want oil, this is a great deal. Usually it is way more expensive than this! I only review things I think I will like, so you will see many five star reviews, but that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t just test anything. I pick what I would like to review and am usually happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> i love this product and use it everyday</li>
    <li> I recently got an essential oil diffuser, so I&#x27;ve been trying out new oil varieties in it. I had actually never used Frankincense, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. The scent is rich and deep, quite unlike anything else I&#x27;ve encountered. It seems to be very relaxing and mood-uplifting. It really just takes a tiny amount for each use. This jar (with glass dropper included) is a comparatively huge 4 oz- the labeling says it&#x27;s 100% pure, which makes it quite a bargain over other brands of the same product. I&#x27;m curious to try out some of the other applications I&#x27;ve read it&#x27;s good for- the list is extremely long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I like Frankincenses Earthy calming Musk.  To me it&#x27;s a nice Rich, Earth smell.  I found this brand to be Thick, and one Drop in my Aromatherapy Oil Diffuser lasts about 6 hours with Water.  Frankincense is one of the only deep musk Oils I actually like.  I also use a couple drops in my bath water, with Epson Salt while I soak.  I like having Frankincense on hand at all times.  I received product at discount for my opinion.</li>
    <li> This product is nice and is a great price.A lot of comments said it did not smell right or as good as they thought it should although the best Frankincense if you want it for it&#x27;s smell is Boswellia frereana. This is good for many skin issues. This is a really good price for this much oil. I buy many different oils from this company they have excellent pricing and oils are high grade. Lemon for use on many of my wood furniture items,&amp;Lavender for use on my wool dryer balls, also use both in my home made bug spray along with a bunch of other great oils. Plus they all smell wonderful!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and well packed.  I love this smell, especially mixed with other oils.</li>
    <li> Majestic Frankincense Oil - Frankkly I was really curious what this smelled like after all the years of hearing the gifts of the wise men and I&#x27;m like what the heck IS frankincense I HAD to smell it!! Come to find out it has so many good uses and can help relieve anxiety and stress and who can&#x27;t use some of that right?!! I put it in my essential oil diffuser and later also tried it in my bath water with Epsom salts.  I find it is very relaxing and I like the scent too and heard it is a natural antiseptic and deodorizer to boot- seriously!.  I love that essential oils have multiple positive uses and that they are all natural - I don&#x27;t worry abut using them around the house or for personal care the way I did other products before I went all natural. I notice that when I use it in the diffuser my breathing is better (asthma) and I&#x27;ll keep using it just for that purpose if nothing else.</li>
    <li> The oil is well packaged.  It fully meets my expectations of quality essential oil products.  I especially like the accompanying tips and faqs regarding the oil and the follow up by the retailer.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! I am very pleased with the product as well as the professionalism of the company.</li>
    <li> This Frankincense oil is a new oil for me!  I checked it out on Google &amp; was amazed at the benefits. I immediately diffused some &amp; then kept reading. I am going to add a few drops to my bath later today. Majestic Pure is a great company for me!  I can&#x27;t afford to pay the prices of one of the companies that sell oils by distributors. You know the one with the catalog that people at work swear by (so they can get theirs cheaper!).  They sell .17 oz. for $45.99- not even 1 ounce!  4 oz of Majestic Pure will last a lot longer &amp; you get a dropper!  Frankincense is used for spiritual awareness &amp; meditation. Also to overcome stress &amp; despair. I did receive this oil at a reduced cost for an honest opinion. It is Wonderful!  When I run out, I can afford to buy again. Thank You!</li>
    <li> These oils smell wonderful and came in a very large bottle for the price.  They came as described and appear to be very good quality.</li>
    <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fascinated with essential oils.  Different oils work for different things. I got Frankincense oil by Majestic Pure to use for joint nd pain reduction. I was in a car accident a couple of years ago and my legs and asthma ache. I massage this oil into my shoulders and knees and it gives me the pain relief I&#x27;m looking for. It had a earthy smell.  So I smell good and I&#x27;m feeling relaxed.</li>
    <li> Helps my sinuses clear up and stop hurting--relaxed tense muscles in my face.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the smell I am used to.  Smelled more like citrus.  I usually use frankincense to scent my wool dryer balls to make our clothes smell nice, but now they smell like citrus cleaner.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Frankincense has always been highly revered and coveted. Many associate it with tumors and ulcers and cancer. In holy times it was considered a gift for kings. Frankincense is centering, comforting and elevating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this 4 oz bottle, I use it in my diffuser and also on my face as an astringent</li>
    <li> Very nice product, Great price, fast ship, easy to do business with this vendor, I recommend them.</li>
    <li> This is so much frankincense oil you will have it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra large bottle with convenient eye dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankenscence almost smells like christmas, it&#x27;s got an allspice scent to it and really makes you feel good. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a promotional discount on this product, however, my reviews are always honest and unbiased regardless of price I paid.</li>
    <li> For the money this is really good value.  I have used DoTerra too, which seems a bit more pure, but is too pricey for me. Although this is cheaper than DoTerra it seems to be working well for me.</li>
    <li> Great oil; smells divine and I use in an air difuser and mix with cleaning agent to help clean better. Seems to keep bugs away also. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> It has a woody/spicy fragrance to it and compliments an oil diffuser perfectly. A lot of people use this and lavender oil to sleep and relax.&lt;br /&gt;I did a little research to find other uses and here is what I found.  Uses of Frankincense Oil:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense oil has long been revered in the Middle East, where it’s been used in religious ceremonies as an anointing oil for thousands of years. It is also a popular ingredient in cosmetics, and has even been found in the remains of Anglo-Saxons and ancient Egyptians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that frankincense oil is one of the top essential oils you can use for your health. It’s known for its comforting properties, and is useful for visualizing, improving one’s spiritual connection, and helping overcome stress and despair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In aromatherapy, frankincense oil is either inhaled or diffused via a vaporizer – a very effective sedative that induces a feeling of mental peace, relaxation, and satisfaction, and helps relieve anxiety, anger, and stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense oil promotes healthy cell regeneration and keeps existing cells and tissues healthy. It’s useful for skin health, and can help treat dry skin, reverse signs of aging, and reduce the appearance of stretch marks and scars.&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense oil’s astringent properties help:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strengthen gums and hair roots&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop wounds from bleeding&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speed up the healing of cuts, acne, insect bites, and boils&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits of Frankincense Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The health benefits of frankincense oil are mostly attributed to its anti-inflammatory, astringent, antiseptic, disinfectant, digestive, diuretic, and expectorant properties. It also has cicatrisant, carminative, cytophylactic, emenagogue, uterine, and vulnerary effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense oil is considered a tonic, as it benefits all the systems operating in the body, including the digestive, respiratory, nervous, and excretory systems&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product as a value for the price!

    <li> Very disappointed. Foul oder</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. It reminds me of Christmas Mass when I was a child. It has that wonderful earthy, woody, enchanting scent. Frankincense and myrrh filled the church as the story of the three wise men was told. Frankincense oil is a wonderful scent to diffuse, but I like to use frankincense oil in my lotions and candles. It&#x27;s a very soothing and rich scent, promoting relaxation and calm. Feel free to use it as you please, but remember that a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST, FAIR AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN. I HAVE IN NO WAY BEEN COMPENSATED FOR MY REVIEW BY THE MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTOR IT ANY OTHER ENTITY ASIDE FROM SAID DISCOUNT*</li>
    <li> This is 100% pure Therapeutic grade Frankencense. This mixes well with coconut oil to use as a topical antiseptic.  It says it can be burned to reduce germs in the air, I have not done that.  I prefer to use a diffuser to get the scent into the air.  I like to mix it with Lemon, orange and lavender.  Keeps the germs down and a nice fragrace in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a coupon code to use with my purchase In Exchange for me purchasing it on Amazon, using it and the writing in a review my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sustainable baby steps is a great way to learn about essential oils and their uses.

    <li> Frankincense oil was new to me until a few months ago and I study the benefits. This oil can help in many areas like scars, boils, acne and pox on the face for fading. Also it can help with stretch marks and surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Digestively it can help to deal with chronic indigestion or after eating. The Frankincense oils help to speed up with secretion juices and balance gastric juices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Females this can help with pre-menopause and help to regulate younger female monthly. Other benefits are that it can help with some forms of arthritis or rheumatism. Help with wound care, insomnia and other types of arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am honored to have had the chance to explore the many helps from this essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Majestic Pure gave me this product for free for an honest #review of the product.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Majestic Pure and for years I thought I did not like the scent of frankincense oil. I ordered a bottle of frankincense oil years ago and the scent was terrible! It smelled like plastic and I absolutely hated the scent. I decided to give frankincense another chance and ordered this item during a one time promotional period. The oil arrived quickly and well packaged in a dark glass bottle of oil which keeps the oil pure and fresh. The oil also comes with a glass dropper which is perfect for dispensing the right amount of oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, I was not excepting frankincense oil to smell so amazing! The scent is very pure and has a spicy, lemon, floral scent. I absolutely love this oil, I use it everyday for aromatherapy, relaxation and meditation. I diffuse the oil in my essential oil diffuser and my home turns into a meditation/ prayer temple. The scent is soothing and allows my thoughts to slow down and think about all that is divine around me. This oil has revived my prayer and meditation life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense has been used for years around the world to connect mind, body and spirit. I am very glad that I purchased this oil from Majestic Pure because this oil is pure, organic and 100% natural. The scent is very fresh and pure and even reduces my cousin&#x27;s allergies to my cat&#x27;s fur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this oil for anyone in search of a premium quality frankincense oil! The oil is very gentle on the skin and is great for bringing a positive energy to any room. I have now become a huge fan and advocate for frankincense oil and have gotten a few of my friend&#x27;s addicted as well.</li>
