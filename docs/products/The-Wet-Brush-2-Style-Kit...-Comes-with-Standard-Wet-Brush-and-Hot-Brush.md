      <li>The Wet Brush is the best brush EVER!!!</li>
      <li>The brush is AWESOME for wet hair.</li>
      <li>This brush works best with wet hair</li>
      <li>Does not Comb out easily</li>
      <li>so it knots so easily to the point where I just want to chop it off</li>
      <li>Quick ship!</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are super light and comfortable to hold which I love.</li>
      <li>The flat brush was great and painless for my granddaughter.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping!!!</li>
      <li>I do love how the bristles feel, but I don&#x27;t think it really dries my hair any faster.</li>
      <li>She has super curly hair like me</li>
      <li>Any brush I have ever used rips out my hair no matter how gently I use it because my hair is so fine.</li>
      <li>I got a free wet brush from PopSugar box and fell in love with this brush!</li>
      <li>I have below shoulder length straight, fine hair cut in an A-line bob...</li>
      <li>Pretty good brush, just a little hyped up but overall good buy.</li>
      <li>I purchased this because my hair stylist said the brush works wonders to dry your hair more quickly.</li>
      <li>Love these products overall!</li>
      <li>The hot brush is not as great, I like that it withstands the heat, but it&#x27;s hard to grip my hair while drying straight.</li>
      <li>I love the wet brush, so much!</li>
      <li>I have used the regular Wet Brush to blow dry and style my hair many times and it works like a dream!!!</li>
      <li>Wet brush is great for wet hair, extensions and wigs...</li>
      <li>This may work wonders for someone with much thicker hair....</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s how much I like this product.</li>
      <li>The brush really delivers on its promise.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really help that much with tangles in hair.  </li>
      <li>My daughter thought it wasn&#x27;t really brushing her hair because it didn&#x27;t pull as it removed the snags and tangles.</li>
      <li>My oldest daughter has mixed hair, and she can actually do her own hair in the morning with these.  </li>
      <li>Love the Wet Brush!</li>
      <li>Using the round brush while blow drying, on Low, leaves my hair full of static.</li>
      <li>I was expecting a lot more after such a positive experience with the Wet Brush.</li>
      <li>The round brush isn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
      <li>I can throw all my other brushes away and enjoy having my long hair down so much more!</li>
      <li>But new a &#x27;re of the circular brush</li>
      <li>They did not put the comfortable little balls on the end of the bristles.</li>
      <li>I got both brushes for only a little more that either one would be alone.  </li>
      <li>The hot brush is the exact opposite of the wet brush.</li>
      <li>but this brush was completely worth the money spent now</li>
      <li>I get help with my long hair and get to wear it down and show it off more &amp;#60;3</li>
      <li>, sadly I don&#x27;t look good with short hair</li>
      <li>but my daughter has the MOST sensitive scalp and enough thick, curly, coarse hair for 5 people!!</li>
      <li>My daughter has another Wet brush and loves it, so I was excited to try the round brush on my hair.</li>
      <li>Does not cause breakage like a normal brush on wet hair!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I would give the Wet Brush five stars, but the Hot Brush was not what I expected.  </li>
      <li>I have thin, fine hair.</li>
      <li>Steer clear of the Combo Kit, and buy the Wet Brush by itself.  </li>

<li> I thought it would be made the same as the flat brush.</li>
<li> the bristles on the thermal styling brush are super short and hard and kept slipping out of my hair, hence the severe neck scratches...</li>
<li> I have relatively thick hair, and the Hot Brush does not hold the strands in place.  </li>
<li> I have fairly thin hair though so it dries quickly anyway.</li>
<li> my hair out when I brushed it wet.  </li>
<li> Purchased for my long hair daughter.</li>
<li> Definitely recommend the Wet Brush...</li>
<li> She was pleasantly surprised to run her fingers through  silky, groomed tresses after just a few strokes with the brush.</li>
<li> Trust me when I say that I NEVER brushed my hair when wet</li>
<li> It helps with my long hair in getting the tangles out especially when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
<li> and I scratched my neck almost to the point of bleeding while trying to use it to dry my hair...</li>
<li> Now the brush glides through with ease, both with wet and dry hair.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had other brushes of a similar design that have worked well, so I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is with this brush, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work.  </li>
<li> The bristles are extremely scratchy.  </li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> but this brush helps with the knots and even goes through my hair when wet!</li>
<li> My advice...just get the Wet Brush by itself and forget the round styler...</li>
<li> The previous one broke at the weakest part of this brush (between handle to the brush area).</li>
<li> The wet brush is fantastic for my long hair, but the round brush is terrible.</li>
<li> I am still getting used to the round brush.</li>
<li> The round brush makes blowing out my hair so easy.&lt;br</li>
<li> and I can brush through without any tangles and less frizz!</li>
<li> The round brush has very stiff bristles.</li>
<li> , however the round brush is ineffective, doesn&#x27;t grip my hair and my hair isn&#x27;t thick which makes it unusable</li>
<li> My hair is always tangled and one time it was so tangled that I forced the brush through</li>
<li> It is difficult to work through my hair.</li>
<li> handles have unpleasant odor</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> I used the thermal styling brush ONCE and have thrown it away...completely USELESS!!!</li>

    <li> My daughter has another Wet brush and loves it, so I was excited to try the round brush on my hair. The round brush has very stiff bristles. It is difficult to work through my hair. I have thin, fine hair. Using the round brush while blow drying, on Low, leaves my hair full of static.</li>
    <li> I recommend these brushes all the time.  I actually opened my mouth to recommend these to my stylist, and then he pulled one out himself to detangle my hair.  They&#x27;re that good!  My oldest daughter has mixed hair, and she can actually do her own hair in the morning with these.  I have every bathroom stocked with these.</li>
    <li> The wet brush is fantastic for my long hair, but the round brush is terrible. Will never use it because it snags and rips my hair out. The hot brush is the exact opposite of the wet brush. It creates knots in my hair. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! Super fast shipping!!!</li>
    <li> Pretty good brush, just a little hyped up but overall good buy.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush set.  My daughter thought it wasn&#x27;t really brushing her hair because it didn&#x27;t pull as it removed the snags and tangles. She was pleasantly surprised to run her fingers through  silky, groomed tresses after just a few strokes with the brush.</li>
    <li> The original brush is amazing and I use it daily, however the round brush is ineffective, doesn&#x27;t grip my hair and my hair isn&#x27;t thick which makes it unusable which is why I removed 2 stars.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really help that much with tangles in hair.  Other than that, it is a well made brush.  Quick ship!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my hair stylist said the brush works wonders to dry your hair more quickly. I do love how the bristles feel, but I don&#x27;t think it really dries my hair any faster. I have fairly thin hair though so it dries quickly anyway. This may work wonders for someone with much thicker hair....</li>
    <li> My professional hairstyling best friends LOVE this brush so I had to buy one.... turns out the best brush i&#x27;ve ever had my hair had damage from a perm being done to it so it knots so easily to the point where I just want to chop it off, sadly I don&#x27;t look good with short hair so I just put my hair up in a bun or braids and call it good but this brush helps with the knots and even goes through my hair when wet! Trust me when I say that I NEVER brushed my hair when wet it just didn&#x27;t like it at all...so this brush has changed my life I still haven&#x27;t used the styling brush but this brush was completely worth the money spent now I can throw all my other brushes away and enjoy having my long hair down so much more! This brush works best with wet hair but I use it all the time.My fiancee loves brushing my hair with it too so it was a huge win win. I get help with my long hair and get to wear it down and show it off more &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I love this brush!! It helps with my long hair in getting the tangles out especially when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
    <li> I got a free wet brush from PopSugar box and fell in love with this brush! I broke that one and that&#x27;s why I bought this set from Amazon. The previous one broke at the weakest part of this brush (between handle to the brush area). My hair is always tangled and one time it was so tangled that I forced the brush through and then it broke. But that didn&#x27;t prevent me from getting another one and I also got the mini ones for my daughter and her cousins and all the girls are very happy to use them. That&#x27;s how much I like this product. I would definitely recommend people with tangled hair get this brush. It will make your hair brushing so much easier and pleasant.</li>
    <li> handles have unpleasant odor</li>
    <li> I got both brushes for only a little more that either one would be alone.  Smells fine to me :)</li>
    <li> Wet brush is great for wet hair, extensions and wigs... Great for Halloween! The round brush isn&#x27;t my favorite it gets the 3 stars.</li>
    <li> The brush is AWESOME for wet hair. Does not cause breakage like a normal brush on wet hair!&lt;br /&gt;I have one in my travel bag so it&#x27;s always with me where ever I go!</li>
    <li> Steer clear of the Combo Kit, and buy the Wet Brush by itself.  I would give the Wet Brush five stars, but the Hot Brush was not what I expected.  I would only give it one star.  I have relatively thick hair, and the Hot Brush does not hold the strands in place.  The bristles are extremely scratchy.  I&#x27;ve had other brushes of a similar design that have worked well, so I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is with this brush, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work.  I was expecting a lot more after such a positive experience with the Wet Brush.</li>
    <li> The flat brush was great and painless for my granddaughter. But new a &#x27;re of the circular brush it hurts even to touch it. They did not put the comfortable little balls on the end of the bristles. I thought it would be made the same as the flat brush. I would never buy the set again. Ouch</li>
    <li> These are amazing. Any brush I have ever used rips out my hair no matter how gently I use it because my hair is so fine. This brush, however, does not!! It&#x27;s amazing you must try it!!!! Love love love!!!</li>
    <li> Love the Wet Brush! Was looking for purple for quite some time so I hit the jack pot when I came across this combo back! Know I can rest assured my hair will be in good hands while blow drying too!</li>
    <li> The brush really delivers on its promise.  I used to feel like I was &amp;#34;ripping&amp;#34; my hair out when I brushed it wet.  Now the brush glides through with ease, both with wet and dry hair.  I am still getting used to the round brush.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my long hair daughter. She loves it and her friends have commented on how great her hair looks!</li>
    <li> Best airbrushed ever owned....Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Does not Comb out easily</li>
    <li> The Wet Brush is the best brush EVER!!! Especially for anyone tender headed...which I am not...but my daughter has the MOST sensitive scalp and enough thick, curly, coarse hair for 5 people!! This brush goes through it like cutting warm butter with a bread knife...BUTTTTTTT....I used the thermal styling brush ONCE and have thrown it away...completely USELESS!!! and I scratched my neck almost to the point of bleeding while trying to use it to dry my hair...I have below shoulder length straight, fine hair cut in an A-line bob...here&#x27;s the problem...the bristles on the thermal styling brush are super short and hard and kept slipping out of my hair, hence the severe neck scratches...OUCH!  My advice...just get the Wet Brush by itself and forget the round styler...I have used the regular Wet Brush to blow dry and style my hair many times and it works like a dream!!! Definitely recommend the Wet Brush...you will be simply amazed at how such a simple brush works wonders!!!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, they glide through my hair so nicely with no snagging or pulling. The round brush makes blowing out my hair so easy.&lt;br /&gt;They are super light and comfortable to hold which I love.</li>
    <li> I love the wet brush, so much! that I&#x27;ve already ordered one for my best friend! She has super curly hair like me and I can brush through without any tangles and less frizz! The hot brush is not as great, I like that it withstands the heat, but it&#x27;s hard to grip my hair while drying straight. Love these products overall! Product was on time and I should also note that my hairdresser told me to get one because they work so well on tangles in curly hair! Great product, thank you!</li>
