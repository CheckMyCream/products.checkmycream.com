      <li>I love it .</li>

      <li>It will come as a kit with many Nu Skin products.</li>
      <li>Its best to do fountain 1 for 2 min on left then 2 min on right side of face.  </li>
      <li>My skin felt softer and fine lines didn&#x27;t seem to be as visable.</li>
      <li>(It is FREE to do so)and you can then buy this product this October with a 2 yr.</li>
      <li>is this significant?</li>
      <li>I own one, bought it from directly from Nuskin as a prefer customer.</li>
      <li>Less age spots too and a great glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Back then I was on my own with the instructional help from the DVD.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the $$$</li>
      <li>And the product looks really cheap,not worth the price!</li>
      <li>and I could tell the difference right away.</li>
      <li>First, I understand that Nuskin prohibit its products to be sold on Ebay, Amazon, or any website beside their website or F2F via distributor.</li>
      <li>I have been impressed by other Nu Skin products and I won&#x27;t use other companies.</li>

      <li>can re-program itself overtime to work positively under your skin.</li>
      <li>I have large pores and sagging skin causes wrinkle problems.</li>
      <li>The images are VERY misleading and the description does nothing to clarify what you&#x27;re getting.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
      <li>very surprise by this appareil..</li>
      <li>Nu Skin product is something you have to understand for a real result.</li>
      <li>Second, the packaging, this Galvanic Spa is of the 2nd edition, but the packaging is from the latest, which has not been release to the market.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>that said, I thought I was getting a new one, which it was,</li>
      <li>Made me uneasy thinking it was supposed to be new.</li>
      <li>Wow! it does work.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m probably too far gone for this to work.  </li>
      <li>but I think it is important to use this routinely so that your facial muscles (and some other things)</li>
      <li>They created a new product with mircrocurrent for the US market - making this an entirely different machine.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sadly, working out alone doesn&#x27;t really help on skin tightening any more.</li>
      <li>The pictures clearly show the galvanic serum gels which are for the GALVANIC machine and do not work with the micro current machine.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be surprised if you are short, item opened or expired.</li>
      <li>Because since you will be watching the mirror the whole time you are doing your facial, it is likely that you won&#x27;t see the big difference after the treatment is done.</li>
      <li>First time I used this last week, I had dinner with my ex co-workers (haven&#x27;t seen each other for couple of month).</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get it to fast as all other Amazon orders I have gotten.</li>
      <li>What if you like using Nu Skin products so much that you want to become an active distributor?</li>
      <li>I am 33 years old and my facial skin is starting to loose tightness.</li>

<li> Please don&#x27;t throw it away lightly by signing up with a wrong distributor who we already know is unethical.</li>
<li> BUT I have been treating my left and not right hand</li>
<li> Also one of the gel packs had and expiration date for the next month and the other was for 2015!</li>
<li> didn&#x27;t get the other two items on the picture,and the price cut down to $450 within a week of my purchase.</li>
<li> have a question for everyone out there who buy nuskin products via ebay, amazon, and few other websites that is not NS</li>
<li> well after waiting a few weeks I think they &amp;#34;forgot&amp;#34; about me or would have if I didn&#x27;t get a hold of them asking where my replacement was....low and behold with in a day or two</li>
<li> An illegal site, I&#x27;d not trust this person as far as you can toss her/it.</li>
<li> As other reviewers have said, you NEED to use this product for at LEAST a couple of weeks to see the results.</li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to show that dramatic difference since I only used it once.</li>
<li> It was a waste of my hard earned $500.</li>
<li> I usually get botox or fillers</li>
<li> /&gt;Ive done 6 treatments now (2 weeks) and the results are now less dramatic</li>
<li> Duh.</li>
<li> Less two parts to me! ! !</li>
<li> /&gt;However, I&#x27;m confused on this listing.</li>
<li> FALSE ADVERTISING.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re looking for something dramatic to happen with just one session, then you&#x27;d have to go to a plastic surgeon.</li>
<li> and I feel like the instructions are vague.</li>
<li> it was dusty, banged up, dirty spots, and torn.</li>
<li> If you use a Sponsor ID# from someone you don&#x27;t know, unbeknownst to you, you could get stuck with a business partner you hate for life.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am torn on this...I didn&#x27;t get it to fast as all other Amazon orders I have gotten. The product is great...that said, I thought I was getting a new one, which it was, its just that the box looked as if it had been used. So giving as a gift...no way.&lt;br /&gt;The box was opened it was dusty, banged up, dirty spots, and torn. Made me uneasy thinking it was supposed to be new. Also one of the gel packs had and expiration date for the next month and the other was for 2015! go figure. I wrote to who ever and they sounded as if they were glad to exchange or replace the product. I asked for a replacement...well after waiting a few weeks I think they &amp;#34;forgot&amp;#34; about me or would have if I didn&#x27;t get a hold of them asking where my replacement was....low and behold with in a day or two I got the gels. And to top it off there was not an expiration date on it to be found....odd????&lt;br /&gt;My advice.... do your homework, know what your getting and what you need for products..and look around for the better prices.</li>
    <li> To purchase Nu Skin products, go to  nuskin com, click on your country, then click on &amp;#34;Sign up as Customer&amp;#34; and enter sponsor ID: USW8836585&lt;br /&gt;If you would like 30% discount, sign up as a distributor, by going to nuskin com, click on your country, click on &amp;#34;Sign up as distributor&amp;#34; and enter sponsor ID:USW8836585</li>
    <li> An illegal site, I&#x27;d not trust this person as far as you can toss her/it. Don&#x27;t be surprised if you are short, item opened or expired.</li>
    <li> I use my nuskin for one week, I think it is helpful to my face. Very good seller and everything worth this price.</li>
    <li> I have tried to use this product and I can not get it to work.  It was a waste of my hard earned $500. I contacted the seller and it has been over two weeks and still can not get a reply.  I would like to return or replace it.</li>
    <li> excellent product reached me inexcellent product reached me in time time</li>
    <li> This is a product that you have to understand to get it to work. I had a galvanic spa 5 years ago. Back then I was on my own with the instructional help from the DVD. I thought I noticed improvements in my skin but didn&#x27;t work for me so ended up somehow returnimg it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 4 years later, I re-met this spa system but this time I had a Nu Skin distributor coaching me and following up with me. At the beginning of using it, she continuously shared the tips for a better result AND the result was way greater than 4 years ago. I have been impressed by other Nu Skin products and I won&#x27;t use other companies. Based on my experience, it makes a difference depending on which distributor you connect with too. Nu Skin product is something you have to understand for a real result. For customers who rated onr star, I have no idea how this galvanic spa could have no result if used properly. I want to advise to connect with a good distributor who is well trained with the products.</li>
    <li> Wow! it does work. With the line corrector wrinkles actually do fade away. So you have to get the line corrector to see results with it. Plus...got it on time!</li>
    <li> Well I have been using it for 3 weeks now. I did a lot of research and I feel like the instructions are vague. Its best to do fountain 1 for 2 min on left then 2 min on right side of face.  Then fountain 2 for 3 min on R and L side. 2 to 3 times a week. If you do it more I read your skin can sag!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate this 5 stars but the gels are just overpriced. I found miracle ii gel for fountain 1 is a cheaper alternative and almond oil or miracle ii lotion for fountain 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; That aside..... I love it . Im 34 w crows feet. I usually get botox or fillers but I&#x27;m breastfeeding and will not risk my baby&#x27;s health for my vanity.  This is a GREAT and Cheaper alternative to botox and fillers.... my skin looks as good as it did the week after my fillers and botox. Less age spots too and a great glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive done 6 treatments now (2 weeks) and the results are now less dramatic but I&#x27;m gonna stick with it for maintenence.  Im a stay at home mom so I dont have anyone complimenting me on my skin (noticing a difference) BUT I have been treating my left and not right hand and DEF can see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I reccommend buying this INSTEAD of fillers or botox.</li>
    <li> Hello...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very very surprise by this appareil..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In french : je ne croyais vraiment pas aux résultats du SPA II, d&#x27;ailleurs lorsque j&#x27;ai vu la vidéo et entendu la femme dire \\&quot;ho My God, look at my eye !\\&quot; j&#x27;ai bien rigolé, car pour moi, en une fois, résultat il ne pouvait pas y avoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J&#x27;ai donc fait mon premier soin, et en me regardant dans la glace \\&quot;Ho My God !\\&quot; J&#x27;étais ravie ! Mon visage rajeunit, que dire de plus ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Très bon achat et aucun regret, au contraire, de la jeunesse en plus, les rides s&#x27;estompent, les ridules sont parties, en clair : achetez le !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bye bye</li>
    <li> Please note that a Sponsor Distributor ID# is not a promo code and it should not be posted and used freely, it&#x27;s against Nu Skin&#x27;s policy for a good reason. Would you want someone unethical to be your business partner? What if you like using Nu Skin products so much that you want to become an active distributor? If you use a Sponsor ID# from someone you don&#x27;t know, unbeknownst to you, you could get stuck with a business partner you hate for life. I had bought Nu Skin products about 5 years ago from a beauty salon and I love it. Now, I&#x27;m a distributor and have a wonderful sponsor distributor to help and guide me to grow my Nu Skin business. This might be the business opportunity that you&#x27;ve been looking for and it may become your future and retirement income one day. Please don&#x27;t throw it away lightly by signing up with a wrong distributor who we already know is unethical.</li>
    <li> Written on behalf on my mom, who used the product:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Wonderful product! I&#x27;ve gotten great, very noticeable results after using this. As other reviewers have said, you NEED to use this product for at LEAST a couple of weeks to see the results. As with all beauty regimes and supplements, you don&#x27;t just get a miracle makeover after using something once. If you&#x27;re looking for something dramatic to happen with just one session, then you&#x27;d have to go to a plastic surgeon. Duh. My skin felt more even and softer after the first use, but I really started to see my face looking younger after a couple of weeks. Within the month, my family and friends noticed how bright and good my skin looked. I use this product twice a week. Highly recommended.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m probably too far gone for this to work.  I need a facelift.</li>
    <li> In Spanish but as promised otherwise.</li>
    <li> I love the Galvanic Spa. I own one, bought it from directly from Nuskin as a prefer customer. I don&#x27;t use it often enough, but everytime I used it, I always mesmerized on how my skin felt afterward. My friends loves it when I show it to them.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m confused on this listing. First, I understand that Nuskin prohibit its products to be sold on Ebay, Amazon, or any website beside their website or F2F via distributor. So, this act of selling its on here has void the guarantee and warranty to the buyer. Second, the packaging, this Galvanic Spa is of the 2nd edition, but the packaging is from the latest, which has not been release to the market. Only limited number of folks can get this via the pre-release sale few weeks ago, so this cause me more confused on the package that is display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a question for everyone out there who buy nuskin products via ebay, amazon, and few other websites that is not NS, how do you know your products is geniune when the company policy has prohibit such sale?</li>
    <li> I items I received is different from the picture，I didn&#x27;t get the other two items on the picture,and the price cut down to $450 within a week of my purchase.And the product looks really cheap,not worth the price!</li>
    <li> I know it is pricey but ladies with sagging skin must try this!  I am 33 years old and my facial skin is starting to loose tightness. I have large pores and sagging skin causes wrinkle problems. Sadly, working out alone doesn&#x27;t really help on skin tightening any more. First time I used this last week, I had dinner with my ex co-workers (haven&#x27;t seen each other for couple of month). They asked me if I lost weight. They told me that my face looks so much skinnier than before and looks great.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to show that dramatic difference since I only used it once. I recommend that you take BEFORE pictures. Because since you will be watching the mirror the whole time you are doing your facial, it is likely that you won&#x27;t see the big difference after the treatment is done. But believe me there will be a huge difference! And I am not an expert but I think it is important to use this routinely so that your facial muscles (and some other things) can re-program itself overtime to work positively under your skin. Good luck!!!</li>
    <li> WARNING: Picture shows you are purchasing galvanic spa II, &#x27;facial spa&#x27; received instead.  FALSE ADVERTISING.</li>
    <li> If you think you can return this product think again.  No money back guarantee with any of the sellers of Nu Skin products on Amazon.com. Go to www.nuskin.com and sign up as a distributor using my ID# US1204151 (It is FREE to do so)and you can then buy this product this October with a 2 yr. warranty and 100% money back guarantee.  In October Nu Skin is putting out a NEW improved Facial Spa that is even guaranteed to show a difference in a half face demo.  It now is FDA approved as a class II medical/cosmetic device.  It will come as a kit with many Nu Skin products.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference. But my friends said I look better.</li>
    <li> Is still in trial effect temporarily is not obvious</li>
    <li> The images are VERY misleading and the description does nothing to clarify what you&#x27;re getting.&lt;br /&gt;1) The photo shows the Nuskin machine with 4 heads - this will arrive with two heads.&lt;br /&gt;Why is this significant? Beyond the fact that you are two heads short.&lt;br /&gt;Because the machine with two heads made by Nuskin is NOT Galvanic, but micro current. I was told that the FDA consider the Galvanic Nuskin (still sold in the rest of the world) a medical device and therefore they cannot sell it in the USA. They created a new product with mircrocurrent for the US market - making this an entirely different machine.&lt;br /&gt;2) The pictures clearly show the galvanic serum gels which are for the GALVANIC machine and do not work with the micro current machine. Thus leading the consumer to believe that is what they will get. There will be no age loc gels in your package if you order from Swan Lake</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used it when arrived and I could tell the difference right away. My skin felt softer and fine lines didn&#x27;t seem to be as visable. I would recommend this product to anyone who starts to see the signs of aging.</li>
    <li> A friend who is an esthetician recommended it. She said it works like a non surgical face lift BUT you hv to keep up the routine. 3 times a week fr 10 min. After 3 weeks my results are noticeable. Around mouth frown line and crows feet.  Totally worth the $$$</li>
    <li> Less two parts to me! ! !</li>
