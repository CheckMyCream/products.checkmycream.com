    <li> This product was waste of money and I brought more than one which was a very bad idea.</li>
    <li> I always have had a tartar problem with my lower front 4 teeth.  Have seen a lot less tartar build up and gums are pinker.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely stick with this product.</li>
    <li> Its just toothpaste. Nothing special.</li>
    <li> i likeit ,, I alternate with my other toothpaste. it delivers anice minty taste as well as producing a foamy lather to remind you that tour teeth are getting clean alittle goes along way!</li>
    <li> Unexpected! This toothpaste leaves my teeth smoothe! I also have the impression that they are whiter, but I&#x27;ll have to use it for a longer period to check that out.&lt;br /&gt;The taaste is fine, the cold feeling of mint is not that strong that it burns my mouth, like some crazy over the top pastes out there.&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering more soon, as my wife is stealing mine away!</li>
    <li> This tooth paste worked to strengthen my gums.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t flossing as much as I should however I received a good report from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Previously I receive a bad report.&lt;br /&gt;This time I am flossing and using this tooth paste in hope that my gums will be 100 % on my next appointment.</li>
    <li> This paste taste better than I thought it would.  It also seems to be getting my teeth cleaner.  Hopefully  less flossing will be less.</li>
    <li> Very good traste, I liked the clean sensation...I have few days with it but I like it!!! Give it a try...</li>
    <li> Love this and my mouth is thanking me. Years i&#x27;ve been using popular brands and they have irritated my mouth, around my mouth, tongue. This toothpaste cleans, freshens, and have actually helped my gums. Gum inflammation, bye bye! Neem toothpaste people forget your usual brand!</li>
    <li> Went to theBahamas, learned about Neem, came back did some research on Neem and wanted to try the product.&lt;br /&gt;I love the texture, not too minty, just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> heard about neem products on Dr Oz, thought I would try the toothpaste, love it! great taste and it is good.</li>
    <li> I started using this stuff about a month ago......I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m more enthusiastic about brushing/proxy brushing but my last perio check up was much better than my last! You draw the conclusions!</li>
    <li> I opened it up before seeing it has fluoride in it and that is toxic to me.</li>
    <li> Looking for a better toothpaste than I could buy in  the stores. This has been a very good product and the price was very reasonable. Will be doing business with them again for sure.</li>
    <li> I use to buy this stuff when I lived in India. It costed only $0.50. I wish this stuff was a little bit cheaper, so I could buy more of it. Other than that, one of my most favorite toothpastes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good toothpaste, but I was able to find it cheaper and in a larger amount at a Indian store near my Dad.</li>
    <li> its not as nice as some of the other neem products i use but tastes minty and teeth felt clean</li>
    <li> I love this all natural toothpaste made from the healing plant of the Neem Tree. Everyone has to brush their teeth, why not use a healing toothpaste, it does not have floride .</li>
    <li> I use this every day and it gives my mouth a nice clean feeling once finished. It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell and doesn&#x27;t burn the mouth. I noticed a big reduction in the amount of plaque and my teeth are whiter. Will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste.  I bought 2 since.  This is natural toothpaste that kills bacteria without all the other gunk that&#x27;s found in ordinary toothpaste.  My breath is always refreshed after use.  I will buy this and stick with it.</li>
