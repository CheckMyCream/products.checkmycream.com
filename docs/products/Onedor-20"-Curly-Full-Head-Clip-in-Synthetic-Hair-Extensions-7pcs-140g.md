      <li>Great for the price though!</li>
      <li>Color was perfect.</li>
      <li>The color matches perfectly and they are a breeze to clip in.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
      <li>Mine arrived in perfect condition with all the clips in track.</li>
      <li>The packaging was good and the hair was in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and they are a great price.</li>
      <li>Def a great buy.</li>
      <li>These are really great quality hair extensions.</li>
      <li>This method worked great for me.</li>
      <li>They are still holding up very nicely.  </li>
      <li>Anyway I just love it!</li>
      <li>so I think the two lengths will go amazingly together.</li>
      <li>I wore these out for my birthday and they looked amazing.</li>
      <li>but they still blend nicely and</li>
      <li>that nice volume I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get these extensions, they came nicely packaged and looked great when they came out, but literally within a hour of wear they had become so tangeled and knottted</li>
      <li>After looking at most reviews, I honestly CANNOT wait for them to come in the mail on Wednesday.</li>
      <li>after a preliminary tug test they seem to be in there very securely.</li>
      <li>I just bought this as a test run, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll be better to just buy the clips and hair separately.</li>
      <li>For ten bucks, I am nothing but impressed.</li>
      <li>love that even though they are synthetic,  I am still able to curl them.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I will be ordering my daughter some of these for sure.</li>
      <li>These were the first extensions I have ordered and they are absolutely amazing!</li>
      <li>so I think that would be pretty embarrassing to wear and that happens the good thing though that product wasnt tangled</li>
      <li>The clips were easy to put in and gave my hair</li>
      <li>Tangled easily.</li>
      <li>and it matched perfectly so if you have dark brown hair</li>
      <li>Color was an exact match to my own color.</li>
      <li>It a good product for the amount you pay although right out of the bag so much hair was already falling out</li>
      <li>I am excited to put then into my hair, as well as blending my 16 inch extensions with them.</li>
      <li>First of all this is not 20 inches more like 14.</li>
      <li>so, if you&#x27;re wanting to use these for a full head of hair I&#x27;d recommend getting two, or more packs to look more natural.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really only good for one or two uses.</li>
      <li>From what I can tell, you need to let it cool in the coiled position or it will cool straighter than you want.</li>
      <li>Only thing I would have liked would have been if a true curly hair option was available.</li>
      <li>The product shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>First off, this is a lot of hair!</li>
      <li>This product is worth the money.</li>
      <li>Very cute and long, they shed quite a bit.</li>
      <li>Throughout The Day, Probably Better For Wearing Up Not Down, They Also Feel Like Horse Hair...</li>
      <li>For someone with naturally curly hair this curl doesn&#x27;t match, it is more of a hot roller type curl.</li>
      <li>so I put them in without curling my own hair first or doing any of the back combing</li>
      <li>The shipping was very fast.</li>
      <li>This was my first extensions i buy 2 packets</li>
      <li>They could fool people to thinking its your real hair!</li>
      <li>It was exactly what my mother had been wanting.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty soft and full but it knotted a lot</li>
      <li>They are thick, soft and beautiful.</li>
      <li>I absolutely recomend these hair extensions.</li>
      <li>It tangles too much.</li>
      <li>And They Become Very Tangled</li>
      <li>Very easy to use, but it did come with a few tangles.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend these</li>
      <li>thats are 260g to know if my head can support the wheight they look extremly natural and smell like new barbie</li>
      <li>and they still look natural IMO.</li>
      <li>Its so soft and match my hair color.</li>
      <li>As far as brushing them or straightening them</li>
      <li>The only thing is they  loose a lot of hair every time i brushed but for the price i thing is fine</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gorgeous and only looks fake if you&#x27;re trying to look for it.</li>
      <li>only semi-con was that they were way too long to look natural for me, but I just cut them and now they are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great!!!</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast for being on the other side of the country and on 4th of July weekend.</li>
      <li>My real hair color is black though at the end of my hair is kinda brown.</li>

<li> They&#x27;re obviously not amazing because they were only ten bucks, but they still surpassed my expectations and I would highly recommend them.</li>
<li> so I decided to straighten them out a bit and only slightly curl the ends under.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a lot heavier than I expected.</li>
<li> I only needed one set as I only have about 1-2 inch(es) of hair in length, but if you have thick hair I would get 2.</li>
<li> I ordered one package and they don&#x27;t look stringy at all once put in as is the case with other extensions.</li>
<li> Doing this also put the smoothness and shine back in them as they had started to look a bit dull and dare I say...</li>
<li> Not worth the money.</li>
<li> ALSO, some of the pieces of hair are very small (like two or three pieces are only one clip)</li>
<li> It was obviously black...</li>
<li> It looks black though.</li>
<li> so you didn&#x27;t have to worry about brushing it out and losing half the hair.</li>
<li> shipped out in less than 24 hours and arrived within a week.</li>
<li> Another note darkest brown is jet black I swatched it to jet black</li>
<li> like jet black.</li>
<li> i choose darkest brown and its like off black.</li>
<li> They are very soft and not too shiny, nor do they look fake.</li>
<li> When I brush them a little bit of the strands come out but nothing too severe.</li>
<li> The color is a little off</li>
<li> I brush from the bottom up and keep a firm grasp on the strands just below the clips.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure as I have not tried that yet</li>
<li> If you havr very thick hair, you may want to buy two packs.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
<li> Not happy with this as its false advertisement</li>
<li> False advertising.  </li>
<li> Wore it for a day and was useless afterwards.</li>
<li> Horrible product!</li>

    <li> I was so excited to get these extensions, they came nicely packaged and looked great when they came out, but literally within a hour of wear they had become so tangeled and knottted and then me trying to get these knotts out resulted in clumps of hair having to get pulled out.  These are not for eveyday use.</li>
    <li> This was my first extensions i buy 2 packets thats are 260g to know if my head can support the wheight they look extremly natural and smell like new barbie i choose darkest brown and its like off black. The only thing is they  loose a lot of hair every time i brushed but for the price i thing is fine</li>
    <li> I absolutely recomend these hair extensions. I wore these out for my birthday and they looked amazing. The clips were easy to put in and gave my hair that nice volume I was looking for. It&#x27;s really only good for one or two uses. I would buy these again!</li>
    <li> These are really great quality hair extensions. They are very soft and not too shiny, nor do they look fake. They could fool people to thinking its your real hair! Highly recommend these and they are a great price. ALSO, some of the pieces of hair are very small (like two or three pieces are only one clip) so, if you&#x27;re wanting to use these for a full head of hair I&#x27;d recommend getting two, or more packs to look more natural.</li>
    <li> Its so soft and match my hair color. My real hair color is black though at the end of my hair is kinda brown. Ordered #2 darkest brown. It looks black though. Anyway I just love it!</li>
    <li> Very cute and long, they shed quite a bit. Great for the price though!</li>
    <li> This is a VERY initial review.. Meaning they were delivered to my door about 30 minutes ago. First off, this is a lot of hair! I ordered one package and they don&#x27;t look stringy at all once put in as is the case with other extensions. The color matches perfectly and they are a breeze to clip in. I have added several pictures and like I said, they were JUST delivered so I put them in without curling my own hair first or doing any of the back combing that&#x27;s sometimes suggested to get them to stay put but they still blend nicely and after a preliminary tug test they seem to be in there very securely. I will be ordering my daughter some of these for sure. As far as brushing them or straightening them I&#x27;m not sure as I have not tried that yet but should there be a problem I will come back and update. *UPDATE* I have had these for a while now. I have brushed, washed, and straightened them. They are still holding up very nicely.  As it turns out they were just too curly for me. I never wear my hair this curly so I decided to straighten them out a bit and only slightly curl the ends under.  I have a conair curling iron, 1 1/2&amp;#34; barrel with 30 heat settings. I put the setting on 15 and left the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; on the barrel for about 10-20 seconds. I opened the barrel and let the curl fall onto the counter still in a coil. From what I can tell, you need to let it cool in the coiled position or it will cool straighter than you want. This method worked great for me. Doing this also put the smoothness and shine back in them as they had started to look a bit dull and dare I say...Frizzy.  I washed them according to the instructions and that went off without a hitch.  When I brush them a little bit of the strands come out but nothing too severe. I brush from the bottom up and keep a firm grasp on the strands just below the clips.</li>
    <li> This product is worth the money. I have looked at ones just like this at local beauty supply store&#x27;s and they are 3 or 4 times the cost. Mine arrived in perfect condition with all the clips in track. Color was an exact match to my own color. Only thing I would have liked would have been if a true curly hair option was available. For someone with naturally curly hair this curl doesn&#x27;t match, it is more of a hot roller type curl.</li>
    <li> Cannot Curl, Only Can Straighten And They Become Very Tangled Throughout The Day, Probably Better For Wearing Up Not Down, They Also Feel Like Horse Hair...</li>
    <li> False advertising.  Looks nothing like the picture. ..  First of all this is not 20 inches more like 14. They have taken 1 20 in strip of hair.  And cut it into 7 pieces.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, but it did come with a few tangles. Color was perfect.</li>
    <li> I have very short hair and these worked for me. I&#x27;ve had synthetic extensions all my life as a teenager who can&#x27;t afford to chuck away $300 for hair. I haven&#x27;t cut these at all and they still look natural IMO. I only needed one set as I only have about 1-2 inch(es) of hair in length, but if you have thick hair I would get 2. Def a great buy. The shipping was fast for being on the other side of the country and on 4th of July weekend. I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
    <li> The product shipped quickly. It was exactly what my mother had been wanting. Way cheaper than the price at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> These were the first extensions I have ordered and they are absolutely amazing! They are thick, soft and beautiful. If you havr very thick hair, you may want to buy two packs.&lt;br /&gt;They shipped out in less than 24 hours and arrived within a week. The packaging was good and the hair was in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;I love that even though they are synthetic,  I am still able to curl them.&lt;br /&gt;The only semi-con was that they were way too long to look natural for me, but I just cut them and now they are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great!!! Especially for the price. I am recommending this to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> Horrible product! Wore it for a day and was useless afterwards. Tangled easily. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> After looking at most reviews, I honestly CANNOT wait for them to come in the mail on Wednesday. I am excited to put then into my hair, as well as blending my 16 inch extensions with them. I bought the 20&amp;#34; from ONEDOR so I think the two lengths will go amazingly together.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and it was not at all brown!  It was obviously black... like jet black. Not happy with this as its false advertisement</li>
    <li> It a good product for the amount you pay although right out of the bag so much hair was already falling out so I think that would be pretty embarrassing to wear and that happens the good thing though that product wasnt tangled so you didn&#x27;t have to worry about brushing it out and losing half the hair. The shipping was very fast. Another note darkest brown is jet black I swatched it to jet black and it matched perfectly so if you have dark brown hair DO NOT get that color. The package also comes with directions for heat purposes you CAN NOT use heat on these. For the price you take the risk if you want.</li>
    <li> For ten bucks, I am nothing but impressed. They&#x27;re obviously not amazing because they were only ten bucks, but they still surpassed my expectations and I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s a lot heavier than I expected. It&#x27;s gorgeous and only looks fake if you&#x27;re trying to look for it. The color is a little off but it still blends well. I would deff buy from them again and probably will be soon.</li>
    <li> I just bought this as a test run, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be completely satisfied. It&#x27;ll be better to just buy the clips and hair separately. It tangles too much.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty soft and full but it knotted a lot and I only got to use them about 3 times</li>
