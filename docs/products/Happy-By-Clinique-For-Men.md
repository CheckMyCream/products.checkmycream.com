<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best men&#x27;s cologne I&#x27;ve ever used. Don&#x27;t buy any other.</li>
    <li> Good value for amount ourchases</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for 15 years and love it. I won&#x27;t wear anything else. It has a peachy, citrusy smell. Not musky, which I don&#x27;t like, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like the old man&#x27;s 5 dollar aftershave. 3.4 ounces lasts me about three years wearing it maybe 4 times a week 2 or 3 squirts each time. 50 bucks is a pretty good price for 3.4 oz considering the 1.7 oz bottle is 39$ on amazon and about the same in most perfume shops.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle of this stuff, I just love it.  Its got a light, citrusy fragrance which is pleasant while still being masculine.  I&#x27;ve used other colognes but this is the only one I keep coming back to over and over.</li>
    <li> Very clean and citrusy fragrence that you can wear out just about anywhere.  This is made by Clinique and is sure to get you some compliments.  Nice see thru bottle lets you know when you are almost out</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and did not care for it.  I love the smell of citrus and oranges, however I do not personally want to smell like one.  This stuff makes me noxious to be honest.  Different strokes for different folks I guess.</li>
    <li> I have known this cologne for over 10 years and still use it. It is refreshing, discreet, and very comfortable to use: no allergic reactions whatsoever. Clinique has made a very successful product with Happy for Men.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was just right, products arrived way before expected.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was a great experience!</li>
    <li> Good product. Would buy again. Comes exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd cologne and my number 1 favorite even before i bought it, i still have a bvlgari aqua, smells really good, but i want to switch scent every other day, this smells really good no matter what your age is, you&#x27;ll smell masculine yet light to women &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Excellent... I bought it use it to work and is just amazing...</li>
    <li> I ordered this men&#x27;s cologne as a gift for my son. He loves it! And I enjoy making him HAPPY! Pun intended.</li>
    <li> quik delivery with regular mail, smells great! my husband loves it</li>
    <li> I love this cologne.  Although this is for men, I prefer it for myself as a woman.  The cologne lasts longer than the eau de toilette, and it smells great.  I get lots of compliments on this.  I am not one who likes flowery scents; and so this citrus scent is right up my alley. &#x3D;)  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> The best cologne a guy can buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne is light and refreshing. Every woman who has asked me about it has absolutely loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Light, refreshing smell&lt;br /&gt;Unique ( most men don&#x27;t shop at Clinque)&lt;br /&gt;Not over bearing or over powering&lt;br /&gt;A lot of compliments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Scent doesn&#x27;t last long&lt;br /&gt;light smell</li>
    <li> It arrived on time &amp; just what I expected!!</li>
    <li> I am buying another bottle as this scent is definitely something I particularly love. I can wear it everyday and it can be worn when going to the zoo or even at a business meeting.</li>
    <li> I first purchased happy for men in 1999, mainly because it was new and not main stream like cool water, ck1, yada yada yada.. It&#x27;s quite intriguing, pleasant with citrus tones, and if you accidentally put too much on, it&#x27;s not terribly overpowering.  I highly recommend this to any guy who is looking for a unique scent that stands out above other over-used brands cologne sprays. It is in the 50-70 dollar range, which I find to be the only downside.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne it&#x27;s smells great I buy it for my boyfriend and he loves it this is a great idea for a gift.</li>
    <li> So an old ex gf gave me this one year for a birthday, anniversary or some other monumental date in time. I was a little reluctant, but once I started wearing &#x27;Happpy&#x27; I started to get compliments from women whom I was close to or whom I hugged. Several dates and a gf or two later, I&#x27;m still getting complimented and I have no plans to change this from my primary cologne! I am by no means a cologne connoisseur. However being a man I have went through many colognes in my lifetime. And none have given me better success/results with women and smelling good, than Clinique Happy for Men.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> One of best colognes out there! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great Price for the size ... I love Clinique Happy for Women and the Men&#x27;s has a similar scent profile ... Absolutely love it on my husband!!! :)</li>
    <li> It has a nice scent.  Not to over powering, a little citrusy.  It&#x27;s a little pricey so he just gets it for Father&#x27;s Day and Christmas.  Which usually gets him through the year.</li>
    <li> Good afternoon. with you buy 3 perfumes and one of them clinique happy for men, not an original perfume is water and the smell does not last at all. I write because as a buyer I claim my right as pay for a perfume and original sheath apology and thank you very much</li>
    <li> Love this perfum, really fresh and classy!</li>
    <li> After fifteen years I finally converted to another cologne. I guess I just finally felt it was time to move past my high school years. It still smells amazing, but I wanted something complex. I went to one of those perfume stores and discovered Givenchy play sport. It smells amazing and lasts all day. I will miss you happy, but we had some good times together. I hope you bring as many wonderful memories and hide many body smells for another generation of young people. You shall be missed.</li>
    <li> Perfect great price I love that scent been a fan for over 10 years.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my boyfriend as a birthday present. It is the absolute best cologne in the WORLD, as he states, so why not make him happy with this?   The delivery was quick and I was happy to receive it before my trip to visit him. Packaging was good, and the box was wrapped as you would receive it from the deparment store. I received samples along with my purchase which is always a plus.   Thank you for fulfilling my order. I am....happy, lol.</li>
    <li> starsgot here super quick, smells fantastic, and its a much larger amounth than i thought. Very happy. I got it for my husband for valentines day.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of Versace metal jeans for men</li>
    <li> This was my dad&#x27;s father&#x27;s day present and he loved it. Not too strong and smells great. Fast shipping also, definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCES FOR A WHILE. I&#x27;VE PURCHASED THIS COLONGUE ABOUT 6 TIMES, THIS IS A SUMMER FRAGRANCE</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my son for christmas. It was the best gift.  It smelled really good and didnt have the heavy smell of alcohol.  I glad i made this purchase because i was tired of my son thinking that Axe body spray was a cologne.  Best investment and he loves it.</li>
    <li> An original scent that makes you unique. A little on the pricey side, but worth it if you replace it just once a year.</li>
    <li> Whether your man is old, young, athletic or an arm chair observer, this is a great day time fragrance - light enough.  It is also very nice in the evening as well.  It does not turn, it remains true.</li>
    <li> this is far and away the best cologne out there in my opinion...&lt;br /&gt;will not over power others and last the entire day without&lt;br /&gt;being so in your face- very- VERY Happy...</li>
    <li> Have taken years to decide on wearing cologne.  Yea, surprising right?  Very picky about smells.  Caught a whiff of its scent on passerby while in transit.  Procured it shortly after and have been happy since.</li>
    <li> Happy smells like it sounds. It&#x27;s light, airy, and optimistic. It&#x27;s citrusy, crisp, and clean- but not soapy. I don&#x27;t like cloying, musky colognes. They make me feel dirty when I put them on. When I&#x27;m just out of the shower and spray on some Happy, I feel even cleaner. It&#x27;s like the Danish Modern of colognes- straightforward, contemporary, and honest. I don&#x27;t notice the smell after a few minutes, but everyone else confirms that it&#x27;s still there. It&#x27;s probably received the most compliments of any scent I&#x27;ve ever worn. Go for the big bottle.</li>
    <li> I recommend this cologne. From the first time I bought this cologne years ago, I always try to buy the same one.</li>
    <li> Wore this some years ago, and love the smell. Good price, delivered on time, and the cologne still smells as good as I remember.</li>
    <li> I had this perfume before, and the one i received is not the same one at all, it doesn´t smell like the original one at all..</li>
    <li> I used Happy by Clinique years ago since I was in High school. This product is not Happy by Clinique. It is either fake or old. The smell is not the same. My brother has the same cologne (original of course) and I even compared the box and IT IS NOT THE SAME. The scent of the one I purchased is way different than the original one that my brother owns. Please do not buy since it is not the original version! Do yourself a favor and DON&#x27;T BUY this one!!!</li>
    <li> Good price and a great cologne.</li>
    <li> Smell just great, soft!!!</li>
    <li> A great value, much cheaper than what I was paying for in the department stores.</li>
    <li> I was nervous ordering online since I had heard that there were fakes and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a good chunk of change on something I wouldn&#x27;t like. It&#x27;s the real thing! The scent is very citrus-y but not too sweet. It&#x27;s a little crisp when you first spray it on but settles to a smooth citrus. Might be a little overwhelming is you used too much but all cologne is.</li>
    <li> Very good cologne, my favourite</li>
    <li> I know this says Happy for MEN, but it is a really light fragrance and can be worn for both men and women. I wear it as a daily cologne because it is so clean and fresh - has a hint of citrus.  It smells really, really good when you mix it with a nice body oil - I typically use Egyptian Musk when I first get out of the shower and then spray this on after the oil has dried.  People are always asking me what I&#x27;m wearing because it smells so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the best thing about it is that it is so light and gives you a clean smell.  The downside is that it doesn&#x27;t really last, so I typically spray it on after I&#x27;m dressed so it gets on my clothes.  Plus I think the body oil helps it &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On men it also smells really nice - a clean &amp;#34;just showered&amp;#34; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell as good as it does at the mall. Seemed old and not fresh. Will not purchase again</li>
    <li> BF loved and it smells delicious!  I&#x27;m going to buy the ladies version!</li>
    <li> This is a clean, fresh, original scent that most ladies love.     It will not turn them off as being too strong, or too old fashioned, and it will not overpower anyone.    It has just the right amount of citrus to give you that fresh, just showered, clean feel.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, but everyone has different scent preferences.  Regardless, great product and scent.</li>
    <li> Like this product a lot. Has a great smell. but the reason im writing this review is how fast the product actually arrived. it said 3-5 buisness days and the product arrived in a little over 24 hrs of actually buying the product through amazon.</li>
    <li> This scent will become your newest favorite, it will be tough to use anything else !</li>
    <li> I got this for my son for part of his Christmas present and he was very happy with it.  I will be getting more in the future.</li>
    <li> Great price and this is 100% the real deal. Got this for my husband to replace his empty and it smells just like the one from the store. This is the only place I&#x27;ll buy his cologne anymore.</li>
    <li> Has a good fresh smell to it. Not too overpowering either. I get a ton of compliments on how good I&#x27;m always smelling.</li>
    <li> stole this order, I got different sizes and neither, service or product.stole this order, I got different sizes and neither, service or product.</li>
    <li> i have bougth this perfume always, so i rally like it.</li>
    <li> Great buy, this smells great and fragrance lasts all day</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Happy for years now.  It&#x27;s a great clean fresh scent to wear every day and to work.  Last time I purchased here on amazon but the stuff I got is very weak from what I remembered of prior bottles, and does not last long at all. I have read similar reviews about other perfumes and colognes bought on amazon. Not saying it&#x27;s amazon&#x27;s fault, but more so the vendor/supplier. I think it&#x27;s better to just spend the extra money and buy locally from a reputable store or maybe direct from Clinique if possible.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne,very subtle not sweet,good for everyday or going out</li>
    <li> I love Happy! People always compliment me on how great it smells etc. It&#x27;s not overpowering like a lot of other colognes that I&#x27;ve come across. I have been wearing it for years, and will continue to.</li>
    <li> Has a great citrus scent without beating you over the head with it. My wife loves it. That is more than enough for me. I like it, too. I highly recommend it. Thanks Clinique and OxCom.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, the best men&#x27;s cologne out there and the only one I use. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Same thing I&#x27;ve been paying $74 for in Macy&#x27;s for 10 years...quick delivery have ordered twice since. People on here have said they got a bad product but all of mine have been correct the right smell and serial numbers on bottom..hope this helped</li>
    <li> Like happy as a whole and my wife likes how it smells on me! Not too strong but good aroma to the senses</li>
    <li> Love it!!! A Fast service and a excellent perfume!!!</li>
    <li> Smells Good and it is what i want no similar product available it is a good perfum choice for men</li>
    <li> Smells great Iike it on my man, he absolutely loves wearing it everyday cause of all the compliments he re ie es</li>
    <li> I still dont receive my stuff, its more than one month and they dont even answer my letters. Do not trust this guys they dont care about the customer</li>
    <li> Great scent - more of a fresh citrus type scent.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and a nice addition to the variety of colognes I like to keep available.&lt;br /&gt;Originally a bit skeptical of name and company, but LOVE this cologne.</li>
    <li> I used to be Bvlgari Extreme man but since this came out, I have changed brands. Although BE is so manly and lasts a long time, Clinique happy does that without smelling too overpowering. Moreover, my girlfriend loves this more than Bvlgari Extreme. That being said, I know I would save more money because she loves the smell so much I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll be buying me the stuff. Ha Ha Ha.</li>
    <li> This cologne meet every expectation for a fresh sent. If you&#x27;re looking for a clean smell look no further Happy!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for nearly a decade and it&#x27;s still awesome. It has a subtle yet strong citrus like smell. I have never met a lady who didn&#x27;t like. It puts a smile on my face and adds a touch of confidence to my day.</li>
    <li> Everyone asks me what I am wearing when I have this cologne on. It really smells elegant. Women like its smell even more than men for some reason. I know at least a couple who have bought them as gifts for their significant other. With that said it&#x27;s really not a feminine cologne. I would say it&#x27;s a subtle, elegant, masculine cologne. I know this will not match the description but it has an orange-jasmine smell to it.</li>
    <li> One of the Best freshest Colognes on the market! Love it! ***5 STAR***!! Thank you Clinique! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Fake!  Amazon won&#x27;t let me put up my original review for some reason? So I&#x27;ll just get to the point to protect the honest people reading this. This smells like it has been watered down 80%. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.  Fake! The end.</li>
    <li> Wonderful,&lt;br /&gt;Use it every day.</li>
    <li> Good price and great cologne. My favorite</li>
    <li> Excellent product and very attentive seller</li>
    <li> Got the perfume as expected.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the scent of Clinique Happy. It smells so fresh and clean and a little goes a long way. I wear about 5 to 6 sprays in the morning and it lasts until the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I love this bright, clean, citrusy scent. I love wearing it in the Spring &amp; Summer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;It smells so good, it is woodsy but not like someone who rubbed themselves down with a pine air freshener. It has an almost spice smell and a soft citrus tone.&lt;br /&gt;It is manly and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;I do not usually use that word in a review but this cologne has such a sexy masculine smell... I really love it when my husband wear Clinique Happy for men.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product, but be ready to smell amazing. :)</li>
    <li> All my husband wears, LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Smells great . Awesome price</li>
    <li> I hope excuse what I&#x27;ll say but it&#x27;s reality, it seems the original this perfume, in that I&#x27;m giving my opinion later, you do not use it when removing them, but to use the smell goes very fast, or is expired or imitation is not recommend to buy them ...</li>
    <li> I love the scent because it&#x27;s a soothing smell ,not over whelming. When I realized that he was hooked on it as well, it became our favorite. He has worn this cologne for the past five years.</li>
    <li> My wife wear this brand also one of her favorites and she wants me to wear it also so she ordered for man.  I like it too..It stay for a long time.</li>
    <li> Very good same as I got before</li>
    <li> Excellent immediate despatch smoothly, new product guaranteed as published</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it looks like a got a fake one too.  It does smell the same, but the smell only lasts like 30 mins and feels like water.  I have to carry the bottle with me to keep spraying it on me.  I&#x27;ll never buy perfumes from Amazon again.  Same thing happened to me with a Lacoste Essential. I&#x27;ll probably dispute the charges with my bank for selling fake products online.  I&#x27;m tired of having issues with Amazon, that&#x27;s why I pretty much stopped buying from this website</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Happy for Men for as long as I can remember. Well over ten years. I&#x27;ve never really told any of the women who ask what it is. It&#x27;s a hidden gem in my arsenal! I&#x27;ve never met a woman that hasn&#x27;t said &#x27;WOW. What cologne are you wearing?? I love it&#x27;. Simply put, it&#x27;s worth the $50! The 3.4 oz bottle lasts me usually 1.5 to 2 years. Never loses it&#x27;s scent or potency. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> LOVE the smell of this clinique happy for men. It has a very attractive, light and fresh masculine smell with a nice citrus base. Its very pleasant to the senses. I like that its not some heavy over-powering cologne that tries to smell too robust.</li>
    <li> I have worn this scent for 5 or 6 years.  It&#x27;s a great every day cologne that can also be worn with formal wear.  Not to overpowering and long lasting.  I have received many compliments on this over the years.  I have actually finished my bottle recently and will take a break from this one for a while.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance it is perfect for the house so I can carry the smaller one on travels on the road</li>
    <li> I always get complimented when using this cologne, it lasts a good while. Always smelling fresh. Use it if you are into the citrus kind of smell.</li>
    <li> Love it, its my favorite cologne.  Compared to major department stores its a great price. I used standard shipping and it arrived sooner then expected. Buy it you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Smells OK but very weak.  Can barely smell it.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend (now wife) loves it!!  Matches my body chemistry in a great way all throughout the day. I would highly recommend testing colognes at a brick and mortar store to make sure it suits you well.  This one is amazing for me!</li>
    <li> Smells clean and fresh. Scent staying power is really good without being overpowering</li>
    <li> Fantastic cologne, always has been one of my favorite scents!</li>
    <li> Perfect, exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong with Happy by Clinique for Men.  Son loved the gift and saved $$$ over the dept store price</li>
    <li> Good stuff - my wife has been wearing it for years, and the men&#x27;s counterpart is great. Lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> i give this ratting because the product is just great the product i really like it and i recomended 100%</li>
    <li> Feel like I stepped right out of an orange grove with every spray - the ladies love it too!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a gift, made a hit with my youngest son who is 45 years old.</li>
    <li> Requested by Nephew, who likes it!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend and I just absolutely love the smell. I would definitely recommend this cologne.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these. It&#x27;s original</li>
    <li> Love the fresh citrus scent. One of my favorites. But it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the longevity of other quality colognes like a Polo. Great price on Amazon and fast shipping. Beats any deal fragrance.net advertises.</li>
    <li> this is a knockout product very dissapointed, but o well what can we do</li>
    <li> Great Service and item</li>
    <li> I love the clean, citrus-y smell of this cologne.  My girlfriend says that it makes me smell like a girl and after viewing online reviews, some people out there seem to agree that it&#x27;s not an exclusively masculine smell.  That being said, I still like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do one pump on my left wrist and put it under my neck and behind my ears (don&#x27;t rub it in!).  That seems to do the job without going overboard.  After about 30 pumps, the liquid level hasn&#x27;t noticeable gone down, so I think this thing will be with me for the long haul.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite cologne for years, I was very pleased to see it on Amazon, it got to me almost after hanging up the phone.</li>
    <li> This cologne is so fresh and what a awesome price made this deal so sweet ... thanks you</li>
    <li> I love this cologne but the item I was sent was most likely a counterfeit. The smell was hardly noticeable whatsoever and when I inspected the box the serial number had been tampered with. There was a piece of orange tape to the right of 3 numbers which had been indented into the box. When the tape was removed there was a narrow rectangular hole that looked as if someone used an Exacto knife to remove part of the serial number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to check your serial number and if there is a problem contact Amazon.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and product was amazing.</li>
    <li> Me gusto el acabado del producto es muy genuino, estoy muy satisfecho por la compra del producto. Excelente servicio Gracias</li>
    <li> My local department store recently quit selling this, so I had to go online. This came promptly and was packaged well so the glass bottle was secure.</li>
    <li> Smells soooooo amazing!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite one!</li>
    <li> Loved it- big size. No dept stores locally could compare w this price.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my dad every Christmas, it takes him exactly 365 days to use up the last bottle, and he always needs a new one. The perfect gift, as he is really hard to shop for.</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful. I was very pleased by the purchase and I hope the women&#x27;s smells just as good as the men&#x27;s does.</li>
    <li> Gift for one of my kids and he loved the smell. Could not find in the stores around my area so on-line shopping is great.</li>
    <li> Received exactly what I ordered only a day late because of a snow storm.  Will definitely order again next year.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great cologne it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. The price was good I could not pass it up. Love it.</li>
    <li> exelente compra, me llego el producto tal cual lo pedi, el tiempo de entrega por parte del vendedor fue rapido, recomendado</li>
    <li> Loved it! Just what I expected it to be. Got here on time!</li>
    <li> 1st  time and my experience was great</li>
    <li> great product, I am very glad to have him, is the best and original, thanks for the sale</li>
    <li> My husband only wears Happy. Very light free shing scent</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a present and It was exactly what I wanted! Its smelled good&amp; he loved it Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeus smelling cologne, for a great price!&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend loves it, and I do too.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived much faster than I expected :-)&lt;br /&gt;Only thing negative, is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long as a perfume would do.</li>
    <li> I have many years using this perfume has excellent fragrance recommend with eyes closed ...&lt;br /&gt;I like to arrive in good condition and did not like to delay by two months to reach its destination&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it with eyes closed very good perfume</li>
    <li> I have had more compliments on this product than any other cologne I have tried.  I have been using it for a number of years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Came fast smells Great.  I will continue to buy from this user. I hope their prices stay low. Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> The packaging again just exceeds my expectation. As a customer the way amazon taking good care of my stuff and orders are awesome you rock.</li>
    <li> This men&#x27;s cologne smells really great.  I&#x27;m tempted to buy another one to have it on hand for when he runs out.  Smells clean and fresh and makes us gals smile.  I also bought him another cologne for Christmas but this one is getting the most use...by request. ;)</li>
    <li> La fragancia no dura nada decepcionado despu&amp;eacute;s de usar productos clinique de hombre, solo me dura 20 minutos ahora uso el perfume de  ambientador no lo recomiendo uso varios de este tipo y duran todo el dia menos este, dinero perdido</li>
    <li> the smell doesn&#x27;t last long... i wonder if the item i bought is original.. im not satisfied ;( i want to return it, but i shipped it here in the philippines</li>
    <li> This supposed Clinique Happy is likely either completely fake or super old batch that it barely even reminds of the real thing. Amazon doesn&#x27;t state that this is in import and there is no way to return the product.&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE, save yourself the trouble and your money and go buy it somewhere local instead.&lt;br /&gt;We got used to the convenience and started buying more things from amazon then local stores so it&#x27;s a shame that amazon is becoming as unreliable as ebay these days.</li>
    <li> super nice citrus smell something very good quality original product. arrived in perfect condition without any kind of problem good</li>
    <li> I have been using Clinique Happy for Men for many years and I love it. I bought this recently directly from Amazon and the last bottle smells different. It causes burn in my nose just like fake colognes do. How can this happen? Amazon should correct this and pay more attention to fake products. That is a shame!</li>
    <li> I love this cologne and it&#x27;s been one of my favorite ones for the longest time ever since my mom bought for me when I was in my teens... now in my late twenties.</li>
    <li> the girls love it, I love it.  best is that nobody even believes it is a Clinique fragrance</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Product just as described. Very pleased... Thank you!</li>
    <li> I do not usually purchase a product that I have never smelled before.  My husband is hard to please when it comes to colognes.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it because of the name and he was very satisfied with it.  Thank you Amazon. We are highly satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Best smelling cologne for a man that I have EVER smelled! My hubbie LOVES the stuff! This HUGE bottle is not much more expensive here on Amazon than the smaller size!</li>
    <li> I have used this item many times, and I did see the reviews that the product was fake!  I have to confirm that the product &amp;#34;seems&amp;#34; fake!  I have sprayed multiple times on my clothes, skin, and on a napkin.  Within hours, even minutes, the scent of the cologne has gone away and others cannot even smell that a scent was sprayed.  This should not be the case with this cologne.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh smell of Happy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you happy new year to all the Amazon family.&lt;br /&gt;Thank u thank u.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not original :( but nod bad</li>
    <li> Bday gift for spouse, he loved it</li>
    <li> i have owned the smaller sized version of this product and it is amazing, its the best fragrance i have ever had the privilege of using, for 10 more dollars compared to the smaller container is a great deal. Get this</li>
    <li> This Cologne is perfect for every occasion, light, citrusy and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;This will make a perfect gift for anyone struggling to find a gift to the guy that has everything</li>
    <li> my husbands favorite cologne to use</li>
    <li> Great cologne and a better price on Amazon then in the stores.</li>
    <li> Great smell, does not last to long, about 3 to 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price, cheaper than the big dept. stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRAVO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend for Valentines Day. He LOVES it. Wears it every day. It has a really nice light summery smell. It also shipped fast and came in a nice package. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I used to buy a cologne which was more than twice as much. Once I experimented with this (Clinique Happy) I found my new and improved scent. I definetly wanted a cologne that had Major citrusy over and under tones and that lasted all day...Happily I&#x27;ve found it, and saving a considerable coin also!!!</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive nose. I can&#x27;t stand perfumes and lotions,  they make me nauseous, but this just smells clean.  It is the only fragrance I will wear.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and price! Good buy, will buy again.</li>
    <li> its a amazing fragance</li>
    <li> In love with cologne!!!!!!! Never heard of it until my bf told me he wanted this for Christmas. Found it on here and bought it for him! When I smelled it I realized why he loved it so much! It is like those axe commercials where the women are all over the man because he sprayed axe.. well...I was all over my bf with this cologne lol!! Truly smells amazing.. My bf is in his mid 30&#x27;s (in case that helps anyone).  I wouldn&#x27;t really put an age preference on this cologne though... smells great for probable any age man. or woman.. ( I spray it in the house as a air freshner sometimes and my bf flips) :) it just smells to good lol.</li>
    <li> While the fragrance smells like Happy, it fades within a couple of hours.  I doubt that this is the real thing - I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Now I smell as good as I look!!</li>
    <li> I tried this cologne more than 12 years ago, I used it for a long time then forgot about it... Remembering old times I decided to buy it from Amazon and the surprise was really shocking :) It is good to remember old times, even more when you enjoyed them :)  It is orginal not a copy and arrived in a good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prob&amp;eacute; esta colonia hace m&amp;aacute;s de 12 a&amp;ntilde;os, la us&amp;eacute; por mucho tiempo y luego la olvid&amp;eacute;... Recordando viejos tiempos, decid&amp;iacute; comprarla por Amazon y la sorpresa fue impactante. Es bonito recordar viejos tiempos, y a&amp;uacute;n m&amp;aacute;s cuando los has disfrutado :) Colonia original, no es copia y lleg&amp;eacute; en buenas condiciones.</li>
    <li> I bought this to give as a gift for my son&#x27;s birthday. I think it has a great light clean scent.</li>
    <li> I have a really good sense of smell and usually it takes me longer to get used to a scent to where I&#x27;m no longer smelling it on my body.  I cant smell this cologne from the first spray, however, others say they can.  I give it three stars because others smelling it is what matters but me smelling it is just weird.  So just be wary go somewhere and smell it before you buy it see what you think and see what others think.</li>
    <li> Clinique Happy for Men is a great scent and one of my favorites - probably sneaking into my Top 10 (out of a collection now exceeding 300 bottles)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy is a clean and fresh fragrance with citrus base notes.  Following the initial application, the essence smoothes out into an easygoing fragrance that is not overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;While there are other fragrances that have a citrus-based scent, Happy is definitely unique.  It would be hard to make a comparison, but perhaps a cross of Diesel, Only the Brave, and Aqua Di (Armani), may provide an idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reviews generally consider the following areas: price/value, appeal/smell, \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot; (compliments), longevity, uniqueness, best time of year worn or occasion, and easy on the nose (and bottle on the eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real beauty of Happy is the scent and it&#x27;s uniqueness.  The price is moderately set, some more expensive and some (maybe more) are less.  The packaging and design of the bottle (appearance) are unremarkable.  Nothing special there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have worn the fragrance once and did not receive any unsolicited comments, i.e. \\&quot;Wow Factor\\&quot;. My girlfriend did, however, inquire last night as to the fragrance I was wearing and added that it smelled great - that works for me..!!  Given the citrus(y) base notes of the fragrance, Happy is probably a Spring or Summer fragrance, although I would have no problem wearing anytime of year or for any occasion (be comfortable in your own skin, right..??).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real concern with the fragrance is the longevity.  Of all the measures in my review(s), I am most critical of this element.  I am especially fond of applying a moderate amount of any fragrance in the morning prior to work and it lasting the day without reapplying. While Happy lasts longer than most, it is on the weaker side following about six (6) hours.  But - your body chemistry and life style may be different than mine - I have a lovely desk job..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give Clinique Happy for Men 4.4 stars, out of 5.  It is under-rated in the cologne arena and I definitely recommend adding it to your collection.Happy for Men 4.4 stars, out of 5.  It is under-rated in the cologne arena and I definitely recommend adding it to your collection.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have lasting power. He wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;Happy&amp;#34; as I wanted on Father&#x27;s Day.</li>
    <li> Wonderful citrus, not a fake.</li>
    <li> Wearing this fresh scent really does make me happy.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites and not very popular surprisingly. I get compliments on it all the time! Has a citrus scent to it. I imagine wearing this in the summer hanging out in the Caribbean or hanging out in South Beach of Miami in the spring. Light and crisp with a lasting smell. Oh and I can attest to the Cologne being 100% real...I have purchased twice here and a few times in the department stores and they are identical.</li>
    <li> This scent smells so good....I bought it off  Amazon as a &amp;#34;blind&amp;#34; buy....This is a fresh citrus scent that seems to last quite a while on me considering it was winter when I purchased and tried it....6 to 8 hrs....projection was pretty good, I did get positive comments when I wore it....  Considering  this is a spring/ summer type of scent I&#x27;m looking forward to wearing it more often then and I&#x27;m sure I will get even more longevity and projection out of it then....this cologne is meant for Spring/Summer and can be worn for almost any occasion... Great purchase...pleasant scent....will purchase again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for years.  The scent isn&#x27;t too overpowering.  Women always compliment me on how great I smell.</li>
    <li> excelente este producto  fino  fino  fino  fino  fino  fino  fino  fino  fino  fino  fino  fino  fino  fino  fino  fino fino  fino fino fino fino fino mejor im posible</li>
    <li> how wonderful cologne the fragance is a little old however this is still my prefer one the are no perfume like this</li>
    <li> Elijo esta puntuacion por excelente vendedore, me gusto que fue seguro el envio y si recomendaria el producto a otras personas</li>
    <li> My fiance (girlfriend at the time) bought this for me and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. I dig how subtle the fragrance is and the amount for how much it costs. At the time of purchase it&#x27;s almost $20 cheaper to buy on Amazon than direct from Clinique.</li>
    <li> Great summer fragrance.  Fresh and clean as always!</li>
    <li> Great smelling stuff. I get sniffed up on the Subway every morning. Very clean smelling and the container looks happy too!</li>
    <li> i think i got a fake one! bad experience! i feel fooled!</li>
    <li> My EDC scent.  It smells good all year.  Two sprays and your good.  I am constantly receiving compliments from women asking me what I am wearing, and I have no doubt enjoyed smelling the scent on myself.  It really does makes you feel happy.</li>
    <li> Off the chain smelling good</li>
    <li> very good, on time, excelent product</li>
    <li> Great smelling cologne. Love the fresh scent. Great pricing versus full retail.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance it has subtle hints of citrus smell but is by no means overbearing. The fragrance comes in a functional bottle and nice packaging. It lasts for quite awhile and I get a lot of compliments when I wear the fragrance. If you like Acqua Di Gio this one has some similarities but is a bit of a nice change.</li>
    <li> Used Happy for years . My favorite scent. I ordered 1st time from Amazon. Product is not Happy by Clinique. It is either fake or old .Terrible waste of Money. Tried to return. Amazon says perfume is a chemical and wont take back. Will never order perfume from Amazon. Dissatisfied customer!</li>
    <li> I always buy this for my boyfriend.  It has a fresh citrus scent, but a masculine background.</li>
