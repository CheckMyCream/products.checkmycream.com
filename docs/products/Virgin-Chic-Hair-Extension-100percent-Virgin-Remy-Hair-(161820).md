<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the hair fast shipping and does great after you wash it</li>
    <li> The hair is pretty good I love it I just don&#x27;t like how freezing it is at the ends</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair but I have not had it installed yet. I was very pleased b/c I received it so fast. The only thing is the color is reddish but not a problem because you can always have it dyed. The color would be my only concern for now, the texture is nice.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!! Bundles are very thin and it SHED REALLY BAD a lot of grey strings in the hair and the curls don&#x27;t stay long ends very raggedy I would never buy this hair again</li>
    <li> DISCLAIMER: the customer service was EXCELLENT!!!! YES, the hair was beautiful out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a week be began to have major issues. At the time of install me beautician let me know it was tangling. it continued to tangle worse and WORSE!!!! The hair began to shed even though i didnt cut my wefts. it lost luster within 2 weeks. i had to do multiple deep conditions on this hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ultimately obtained a refund.</li>
    <li> I received my hair today, 5 days early. It had a funny smell at first but once I washed it, I fell in love. It looks exactly the same as the images provided, its so soft and really long!! I will buy again!</li>
    <li> Good hair. After it was shipped it took 3 weeks before it was delivered.  Any questions I had was answered promptly. I&#x27;ve had it installed for approximately 3 weeks now. Initially it was really soft and didn&#x27;t shed. I went to sleep once without my satin bonnet and the texture changed. It sheds now but it still looks good and it&#x27;s manageable. The hair is more of a number 2.</li>
    <li> The hair was fabulous. It is super soft &amp; silky. I really like my hair. It is so bouncy. I recommend this hair to everyone. I would buy this hair over &amp; over again. You cant go wrong with this hair trust me. No Shredding. Virgin Remy. Hair is good quality for the price. Definitely buying again. Thanks again. I am in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JoJo Flowers</li>
    <li> when i got the hair the hair was amazing until i washed it,after i washed it i was very disappointed but i still have it on until its done it.</li>
    <li> OK. Let me say that i was a little nervous about purchasing this hair based on the reviews. I purchased this hair a few weeks ago and received it a week before the expected delivery date. It&#x27;s been over a week now since i have it in and let me say i am loving this hair. It is soft and silky, plus it doesn&#x27;t shred too much. I wore to Jamaica last week and i received so many compliments about my hair. Again, great hair!!!</li>
    <li> This hair is horrible. It&#x27;s not even 100 grams more like 80. Small bundles. Didn&#x27;t get what I ordered. Hair has a strong processed smell. Ends are super thin. You would have to cut about 3 inches of your length off to get a decent fullness for your head. Terrible hair don&#x27;t buy this $</li>
    <li> Sheds........tangles bad...you get what you pay for...Yuck</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just beautiful and of good quality</li>
    <li> I am so not happy with this hair......and like everyone else who purchased this hair shedding is not the word....all over my bed ...my clothing...and DO NOT COMB THIS WEAVE....hair EVERYWERE....disappointing ...wave pattern was gone within 2weeks👎😤😡😱‼️</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying virgin Brazilian hair.  I had 18, 20, and 24 inch bundles and the price was great to me compared to what some women tell me they spend on the hair.  I absolutely loved the hair except the lengths did not seem as what they were supposed to be, even after straightening the hair.  Ive had $20 bundles of hair that seemed longer than this virgin Brazilian and I never go over 14 inches on that kind of hair. There was shedding but that is what i expect because all hair sheds. When all is said and done, I am still happy about my purchase.</li>
    <li> This hair was less satisfactory. No one should purchase this hair. I mean it, not being hars Im being honest. It is a waste of money and time&lt;br /&gt;- Sheds Horribly&lt;br /&gt;-Tangles and knots nots literally&lt;br /&gt;gets extremely tangled at the nape of the neck and stiffens upon blow drying.</li>
    <li> Ok when I first received the hair I was wow&#x27;d.  Finally after I had it installed, my stylist told me that it shedded really badly.  I didn&#x27;t really mind since it was my first time using virgin remy hair.  Now that&#x27;s been 2 days and i&#x27;m now styling it myself, I do realize the shedding.  Its not as bad as I&#x27;ve seen before but it does shed. Now to the pros.  the hair is beautiful, it blends very well with african american hair and holds curls perfectly.  I straightened it today and its gorgeous.  I&#x27;m just waiting to do my first wash and see how the natural wave comes back. I would recommend this hair but just know that it does shed.</li>
    <li> Hate this hair what a waste of money. It sheds like crazy,  it&#x27;s thin at the ends. I have 4 bundles in my head in it looks like 1.... Never again! Better off going to the hair store. Don&#x27;t buy this hair😠 only giving it a star because I have too in order to post my review.</li>
    <li> It was perfect for one day! Now its a tangle &amp; nappy mess.! I wrapped &amp; everything i needed to do but its terrible.!</li>
    <li> To me it&#x27;s just like regular human hair but I more so think its just the culture I have friends that have purchased Brazilian hair from other vendors and have had the same results. But in all fairness you get what you pay, I have the 20, 22, 24 and paid about 120 which is why I can&#x27;t really complain and it gets 3 stars</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and once I got it it was pretty but had an odor,  but once I died it the body wave didn&#x27;t come back and my color didn&#x27;t show as bright as it should for as long as I left it on if it was supposed to be virgin hair and I&#x27;ve had it in only a month and it sheds like crazy plus it gets nappy and stiff.</li>
    <li> Very bad hair...DO NOT BUY!!!! Was very pretty when got hair but after washing it, it tangled really bad and did not get its curls back.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have hair for two weeks and it matted and shedded to no end. I paid a good bit and this hair failed me.</li>
    <li> I ordered my hair on June 14 2013... it is now August 17 2013 and I still don&#x27;t have my hair!!! I ordered hair from another site HUMANHAIRDIRECT.COM to be exact and I got it within a week and for a cheaper price!! I want a refund already!!!</li>
    <li> i bought this hair befor i went on vacation to miami, I got it installed a week before i left. When i first got it done it was sooo pretty. It has a good shine to it and wad very light weight and bouncy. A few day later it started shedding very bad and was getting tangled..then when i went to the beach i had put it in a braid to avoid it getting tangled. -__-  By the time i got out tht water my &amp;#34;braid&amp;#34; looked like a big dread lock my hair was matted sooooo bad in the back and i was soooo pissed off. thank god this happend on the last day of my vacation but as soon as i got home i tryed my hardest to brush the hair out,,,,FAIL....SO I HAD TO TAKE THE HAIR OUT AFTER ONLY HAVING IT IN FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered my hair August 15, 2013, and I received my hair on August 23, 2013. When I first opened my package I was Soooooo in love in with my hair. It was PERFECT ! The hair was so soft, bouncy, and full of life. I even measured the hair to see if it was really 20&#x27; 22&#x27; &amp; 24&#x27; inches and they were. I literally fell in love at first site with the hair. I installed the hair August 28, 2013 after I sealed my wefts 2 days before. Once I installed the hair my hair was so full and it even had a natural wavy pattern. I left my hair like that for a few days, but then I decided that I wanted it straight because my ends were very dry and lifeless, so I thought putting leave-in conditioner on the ends then straightening it might help; so I did. Then a few days later I wanted it back to its natural state so I washed the hair, but NOTHING HAPPENED. I&#x27;m stuck with straight lifeless hair, and I&#x27;m kind of disappointed, because I loved the way the hair was when I first installed it. Even though i sealed my wefts the hair does shed a little, and ever since i washed the hair it does tend to tangle a little more.  I&#x27;m kinda having mixed feelings about the hair, but overall the service was GREAT! They replied back to EVERY Message that I sent them, and my hair came pretty fast. I am VERY Satisfied with the service not so much with the quality of the hair. I&#x27;m not really sure if the hair is 100% Virgin Unprocessed Human Brazilian Hair like it says it is.</li>
    <li> - I bought this hair for my mother without knowing how it will look and I can honestly say she will not shut up about it. I&#x27;m kind of jealous because I bought the U PICK LENGTH BRAZILIAN hair and now I want to buy this hair. I&#x27;m just glad she loves the hair , the length, and the color. The hair comes in three full bundles, super long and its extremely soft. DON&#x27;T worry about the shedding because what type of hair doesn&#x27;t shed. YOUR OWN HEAD SHED&#x27;s, so if want satisfaction then buy it. BECAUSE SHE WON&#x27;t SHUT ABOUT IT... lol...She tells me about all the compliments she gets for her hair... So I guess this will be my next purchase....</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the hair. It is soft and very manageable. It shedded a little more than expected but all hair does. It was absolutely gorgeous. I would consider purchasing hair again.</li>
    <li> I deleted my last review to let everyone know this:&lt;br /&gt;The quality of hair you get will be purely based on the seller you get it from. Each picture added to the discription is posted from a different seller. Each customer photo is uploaded by customers who went through different sellers. I ordered this hair three different times from three different sellers and had three totally different experiences. Choose your seller wisely and look at the seller feedback, comments, and notes. Like one seller on here states the hair arrives in bulk not in packaging and is pure virgin hair, but the cost was like 350$ for the 3 bundles, big difference from what is advertised. There is good hair on here you just have to shop for the seller for the type of hair you want, because they all don&#x27;t carry the same hair. Do your research, because you will get exactly what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the sellers are selling 100% Human hair, but it is NOT brazilian. It is simply the Brazilian Body Wave style (that is purchased at local beauty supply stores). That is the quality you should most likely expect from the cheaper sellers. The more expensive sellers will have special notes about the quality of there hair and where it comes from. Some of this hair is virgin most is not. Hope for the best and expect the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it 3 times, because ultimately it&#x27;s cheaper than my local beauty supply stores. I no longer expect to get pure virgin hair, because that is simply unrealistic for these prices. But there are a few on here that have real virgin hair, youre just going to pay a lot more for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research your sellers, because it is a game of rush and roulette at the end of the day. Out of my 3 purchases, one seller had good hair and another was a horrible mess and my last purchase from a different seller is on it&#x27;s way. I paid a little more this time, hoping the quality will be better.</li>
    <li> Ugh this hair is ridiculous!&lt;br /&gt;Even after sealing the weft this hair sheds like crazy. It gets tangeled every second. It got so tangeled that 2 of my diamond earrings got caught up and snatched out of my ears! I hate this hair! Will never purchase again!!&lt;br /&gt;I swear it gets thinner and thinner every day.i was hoping it would last until my Vegas trip next month but I think not.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s def not virgin. Smells like chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> This hair had split ends from the VERY moment I opened the package. Trimming the dead ends would have caused me to lose a significant amount of length (1-2 inches), so I went the route of trying to treat the hair with sweet almond and grapeseed oil. BIG MISTAKE. Even with the lightest oils, this hair begins to look immediately greasy like you didn&#x27;t wash it. Not to mention it tangled like a mug during the entire period I wore it. Will definitely NOT be buying again. Ladies, beware.</li>
    <li> THIS HAIR IS TERRIBLE. IT TANGLES AND IT SHEDS HORRIBLE. I BOUGHT THIS HAIR BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER THAN THE $50 HAIR THAT I&#x27;M USE TO.. IT WAS ACTUALLY THE WORST HAIR I&#x27;VE EVER BOUGHT. THE HAIR IS BEAUTIFUL WHEN YOU FIRST GET IT BUT THEN YOU START TO REALIZE THE SHEDDING AND TANGLING.. PLEASE DON&#x27;T BUY THIS</li>
    <li> please do NOT waste your money on this hair, it is PATHETIC!! it sheds like craazzzyyyy &amp; tangles SO much! when it gets wet the waves do NOT come bck &amp; the hair gets matted &amp; it&#x27;s a ugly dry reddish color in the sunlight. please don&#x27;t buy this hair save your money.</li>
    <li> hair is very soft and pretty i haven&#x27;t installed the hair yet but after running my fingers through the hair the was no shedding. I&#x27;m also going to apply a weft sealer so that it wont shed after installation but I love it no complaints here.</li>
    <li> Awful hair lasted a few days and begin to get nappy and tangled I tried washing it but it was no good don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the hair. Its very pretty and unique. I recently washed it and the curls were beautiful. I think I might straighten it next week. N I may post pictures soon to let u see the end result. The shedding of the hair is very small. I definitely recommend this product. !!!!!</li>
    <li> Upon receiving this hair I was kind of skeptical because I thought the bundles looked small but it was well over enough, I actually have a whole bundle left over. The texture is so natural and it&#x27;s a perfect match to my hair! The ends of the hair aren&#x27;t all even which gives this hair an even more natural look. I dyed my hair before putting it in, the wave pattern didn&#x27;t change much. I&#x27;ve straightened this hair and it&#x27;s nice, I&#x27;ve also used my curl wand on this hair and it looks magical. It&#x27;s a little pricy but so far is worth it. I receive compliments all day everyday on my hair.  So far I&#x27;m a satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> Two of the bundles were the same length. After my install the hair became very tangled. It looks dry and I&#x27;ve only had it 2 days. Poor qualiy. : (</li>
    <li> This product is not at all what it says it is, i want my money back or else i will be taking this matter further!!&lt;br /&gt;when i bought the product i thought it was amazing, texture was good and lengths matched up; a little shedding but it was controllable. i have now had this product for 3 weeks and has taken it out to wash; i have never felt as stupid as i feel today; the tracks barley had any hair on them because all the hair had fallen off. it was tangled therefore was very difficult to comb through. The hair had mixed colours therefore was no Virgin Brazilian. i bought this hair because i was trying to save money, tbh your better of spending money on REAL Brazilian hair, and being able to use it for longer than 3 weeks. my anniversary is tomorrow and i have no hair to put in, it is 9:26 PM and i have absolutely no idea what i will do as it is too late to buy replacement hair. SO ANGRY! I will also be sending the pictures of the hair when washed for those interested what this \\&quot;amazing\\&quot; hair looks like after 3 weeks</li>
    <li> Had the hair installed for 6 months August to December 2013..&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend four bundles for a full head if you&#x27;re going for length.&lt;br /&gt;But 3 of an 18 or less would be fine.&lt;br /&gt;VERY IMPORTANT: I washed before I installed the wave diminished. Still a wave but the body was gone.&lt;br /&gt;ALSO: While washing the hair I noticed that It had been dyed. It never lost the black color so I don&#x27;t know why&lt;br /&gt;  it was dyed but the water turned black while washing even after installed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the price this hair had longevity and looked decent..&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase again but maybe a different pattern would suffice for my style</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and product was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ll I purchased the hair it was soft and deceiving I got it sewed in and the first thing I experienced was tangling the hair was so thin it looked literally like a string of hair. 3 days later it started to get really dry and matted I had to take it out wash and moisturize it for it to look full and feel soft it curls awesome and straightens great BUT  I would not recommend this hair unless you can doctor on it</li>
    <li> i love it i can do anything with it.i went too the hairdresser got it wash an blow dry an curied</li>
    <li> First off this product came really fast but I did pay for 2day shipping. The quality of the first 2 packs are REALLY BAD&lt;br /&gt;And all the packs are the same size 22inch. I washed the first 2 packs and put it in my hair the ends are really thin it SHEDS like crazy!!! I took it out of my hair after 3 weeks it really only last me 2 weeks but had to wait to buy new hair, the third pack I love it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s not  the same hair as the 2 other packs. I combined the hair with another hair extension I didn&#x27;t wash it this time and it  hasn&#x27;t  shed so I&#x27;m 50/50 about ordering from this company again.</li>
    <li> Nice &amp; pretty didn&#x27;t last too long &amp; I know how to keep up with some hair! I would buy again for a lower price!</li>
    <li> The hair looks good &amp; feel good at first but maybe 2 weeks later the weave became stiff verry fast &amp; hard feeling. It also lost the curl pattern after a few washes.</li>
    <li> This hair is GREAAAT!!! No shedding. You can bleach and dye the hair. I&#x27;ve had this hair for about 2 months. I&#x27;ve reused it about 4 or 5 times with no hesitation. I highly recommend this hair!!</li>
    <li> I installed my 22 and 24in body wave and it is beautiful, I love it so freakin much. This is the best hair I&#x27;ve ever had. I can&#x27;t stop looking in the mirror. Thank you amazon and Eliza wig company!</li>
    <li> PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASING&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my hair from Selena&#x27;s Mane. This hair is awesome. Anytime one purchases this  type of hair be prepared to buy the weft sealer to PREVENT SHEDDING. ANYTIME YOU CUT THE TRACK , THE HAIR WILL SHED SOME. ALWAYS CO- WASH HAIR!!!&lt;br /&gt;It also states to treat the hair like your own, using lots of hair products will weigh the hair down causing it to tangle!! THIS HAIR IS TO BE AIR DRIED, DO NOT BLOW DRY IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THE CURL PATTERN . I would purchase this hair again and again simply because I know how to take care of it.</li>
    <li> So this is my first virgin hair, and let me just say i don&#x27;t regret buying it. This hair is very beautiful and so soft. It sheds just like any other hair, but with proper care you can stop it. I can not stop feeling this hair!!!!! Amazing price too. The hair comes alot more than i thought!! I&#x27;m in love</li>
    <li> The hair was awesome for three weeks. I received a lot of compliments on the hair it was flawless. Drastically over night the hair changed it became tangled in knots needed to be combed every ten minutes shedded horribly more than normal and eventually unmanageable. It is now in the trash i also prewashed the hair with sulfate free shampoo before using it and it was fine for a few weeks....waste of money this is not real brazilian hair</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again because when I got the hair it was rough I was going to keep it but my stylist recommended I send it back because it wasn&#x27;t good hair!!</li>
    <li> Hair arrived earlier than expected waiting to get it installed but great quality hair is soft and curls hold very well through a couple test I have done</li>
    <li> The hair had a black rinse on it. It had an enormous amount of shedding, it tangled easily and had a lot of grey hairs as well as other fibers mixed in with the hair. On the plus side the hair was soft and a pretty good length. However, I don&#x27;t think I would purchase hair from this company again.</li>
    <li> The texture is amazing, the length was great, and it looks really natural!! Only downside is the hair sheds alot</li>
    <li> Hair came early smelled and felt rough so I washed it this hair waz colored turned the water black brushed with a blowdryer brush it brushed out smooth but ton of hair came out...  It was all differnt lengths splitends and I think it&#x27;s not human...</li>
    <li> The hair is okay, but it sheds like crazy. I had it in for 3 weeks now, and the hair still sheds, it tangles and it&#x27;s not virgin hair. It is human I have lots of gray strands...But for overall the hair is pretty but I won&#x27;t purchase it again...</li>
    <li> The hair is soft n look pretty but it sheeds really badly n i really dnt like it the sheading</li>
    <li> I ordered the hair on the 14th and recieved it on the 16th. I ordered 3 lengths, but i believe i got 2 22&#x27;&#x27;. It was fine though. It looks and feels amazing</li>
    <li> I received my hair 2 weeks early and I&#x27;ve had been hair for about 2 weeks now. I haven&#x27;t installed it yet, but I did make my u part wig last night. The hair was so soft and silky. But the hair smelled. It smelled like plastic. Kinda like the hair you buy at the beauty Supply store. Like synthetic hair. Anyway after making my wig, I decided to do a full wash because the hair smelled so bad. After washing it I soaked it in conditioner. The texture changed. The hair was matted up. The water was black and had film all in it. I combed the hair out and hung it up to air dry. The hair has a slight wave. And this hair sheds like crazy! The hair was already a brown color but once i washed it the hair was a real light brown which means the hair has been colored and it&#x27;s not virgin hair as claimed to be. I haven&#x27;t installed yet but I&#x27;m sure that I won&#x27;t have such a great experience. Ill do another review to let you all know how it all worked out.  Soooooo im back for my update. I installed my 3/4 wig. The hair was decent but it she&#x27;d really bad and it was really frizzy. I use cream of nature with moroccan oil shampoo and conditioner. So I washed the hair and conditioned hair. The hair was still so very dry. Then started to get tangled. I used a little moroccan oil on it and it&#x27;s still dry. Omg this hair is horrible. I just took it out and deep conditioned it with brazilian tech. Put it in a plastic bag and in the microwave for 30-45 sec and then let it set for 30 min. I rinsed it out and hung it up to air dry. I can tell the hair is still going to be frizzy.  Which means tangling which means matting. I swear to you I don&#x27;t think this hair is gonna last a week. Ive only had it installed for 3 days!  I swear ain&#x27;t body got time for this. I most def would not recommend this company</li>
    <li> My friend absolutly loves this hair best buy ever</li>
    <li> I am a professional stylist that recently invested in this hair and I want my money back!!&lt;br /&gt;As soon as the hair was put into my head I notice immediately an extreme amount of shedding really bad.  And to make it even worse this hair tangled and matted up so bad I had to  practically cut it to get it out of my head the same week. No exaggeration at all. DO NOT BUY. I don&#x27;t even believe it is human hair. It felt course and chemically burnt .. JUST TERRIBLE. They are a rip off</li>
    <li> This is the worst hair ever!!! I&#x27;ve worn more syntheic hair with less shedding than this hair. I promise I will NEVER EVER buy from this company ever again! Worse experience ever. It matted and sheds like crazy. DONT WASTE UR MONEY</li>
    <li> Its really thin and it has no life to it. It looks used. The ends are thin and stringy. Spend money elsewhere</li>
    <li> the hair was not a bodywave...it was like a super curly... it was kinda dry and rough as i tried to comb it out as i was preparing to dye it...after i dyed it ...it was extremely dry even with conditioner...you need a very good one like silicon mix... its ok though...more of a temporary hair.</li>
    <li> The hair was a great price however I disliked the quality of the hair. This hair isn&#x27;t virgin hair, in fact when I washed it I washed out black dye. The hair got extremely tangled and was hard to manage</li>
    <li> Hair Sheds Like a DOG! Super embarrassing because my hair was literally everywhere. The hair felt beautiful but was not worth the shedding</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I mean it&#x27;s good hair, but based on the picture that&#x27;s provided... it&#x27;s like two different types of hair. For what I paid, I expected to get exactly what i see on the picture. The hair on the pic looks so smooth and silky, but the actual hair i got was really thick once i put it in, you have to constantly brush it so it will at least look like something. I wouldn&#x27;t by this brand of hair again</li>
    <li> The hair was to thin it&#x27;s horrible but the textures of the hair is good and it came on time. I have a huge head what the hell can with the small amount of hair. Smh</li>
    <li> I am soooooo pleased with my order. At first, I was a little skeptical about ordering hair through another company on Amazon, but it all worked out fine. I received the shipment within the time stated (even though the shipping rate was high), I&#x27;m happy that I purchased this hair. I have had this hair in for about a month and it RARELY SHEDS and DOES NOT TANGLE AT ALL!! Literally...I am practically a \\&quot;weave queen\\&quot; so I KNOW good hair and will honestly say that this hair has definitely made it to my top 3. THANK YOU FOXY HAIR!! I&#x27;m looking forward to buying more of your product soon!! :-D</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair!!! Matched my natural hair perfectly!! My stylist was impressed with the quality of hair considering the reasonable price!!! Worth every dime I spent on it. The seller is awesome I even received two 24\\&quot; instead of the 20\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> this hair is of the best quality, it is beautiful!! very much worth the price, since i installed it it had had minimal to no shedding,was easy to dye, and is the length you are told it is.&lt;br /&gt; i would definately purchase again.</li>
    <li> Shipment is very fast, it took three business days for me to receive my hair. I am really pleased with my purchase and I must say that customer service is GREAT!</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as described! I had to wait a month to do a review and I am going to keep this brief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased hair from (Virgin Fantasy Hair and Sally&#x27;s Beauty) and this hair is on a whole other level. I don&#x27;t have to worry about it tangling every 10 minutes, and it looks so natural! The hair is just beautiful! As far as shipment goes, it arrived quickly, so no complaints there; actually, no complaints at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want great quality hair for a reasonable price -- look no further and purchase TODAY!</li>
    <li> Love it thank you, i ordered twice from here and i still want more....please get more colors and deep waves</li>
    <li> Came on time and so far I&#x27;m loving this hair.. It&#x27;s soft and beautiful.. I don&#x27;t see a shedding problem yet..</li>
    <li> I JUST GOT MY HAIR TODAY IN I REALLY LOVE THE TEXTURE OF THE HAIR I HAVENT INSTALLED IT YET BUT I WILL UPDATE MY REVIEW SO FAR I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> it got here a little earlier then i expected !!!! yahhh when i got it i pulled it out of a small package hair smelled like new hair !! very soft and was a color of a 1b ! i dyed the hair burgandy the hair remained soft!!! ran  my fingers through it and no shedding i havnt installed the hair yet but when i do ill be sure to keep you guys updated this is why i gave it 4 stars becausa i dont no how its going to act once installed but so far so good!!!</li>
    <li> Well I just received the hair yesterday,  which was pretty fast.  I am really not 100% certain I was confused by the packaging it looks as if it was hair I walked into the beauty supply store and purchase.  I havent installed it yet but hopefully it will be great</li>
    <li> This company is amazing, the shipment was fast customer service was excellent she alaways communicated with me with any questions very promptly and the hair is at a good price!  check them out for yourself!</li>
    <li> This Was Top Of The Line Best On the Market Hair. I Couldn&#x27;t Believe It. I Was Very Happy With My Purchase</li>
    <li> This hair looks great. I got it sewn in 3 days ago and it is beautiful. It has been shedding. But I have not had any hair that doesn&#x27;t shed. Hair is the length that is said on the listing. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I received my hair on March 5th. I am extremely impressed with it and America Ladder International Company. There was a small mix up with shipment but they were very prompt to answer my many emails. They also resolved my issue with no effort on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the hair.... When I received my small package and opened it I thought it was beauty supply store hair until I opened the 1st pack. The hair is SO SOFT!!! The wave pattern was so beautiful. I&#x27;m BEYOND IMPRESSED. I will be purchasing from this company again.</li>
    <li> it ok if you looking for a quick style. It last like 2 months. ends were very untamable. I wouldnt buy again</li>
    <li> More like 1 star hair. Horrible hair. Just horrible.&lt;br /&gt;Sheds like crazy &amp; doesn&#x27;t last. The worst hair I&#x27;ve ever bought. I needed it for a quick fix. Other than that I only wear 5 star hair</li>
    <li> The 16in looked like a 12in weave. The quality of the hair was very poor, there were strings of thread all throughout the hair. I didn&#x27;t even have to put in in to notice I made a mistake. I am in the process of sending it back because it is a disgrace!!!! Buy the hair at you own risk and consider yourself warned.</li>
    <li> I was please with the color and the way it looks but its very tangly and it sheads alot  its not like the brazilian i every had iam disappointed</li>
    <li> I loved the hair, also it came fast than what they said it would and I live in IL. It was a very good deal.</li>
    <li> im in love with my hair,it is very soft and managable, it does not shed to much. I would recommend this hair to anyone</li>
    <li> I must say this hair is great and very fast shipping I recieved my hair a week later after ordering it Washed it for tha first time today! Cons it sheds I sealed my wefts so it&#x27;s not shedding to bad also my ends were very dry so I put aragon oil on it and I washed it with coconut shampoo nd conditioner by organix will buy again from this seller!</li>
    <li> Wow dont waste your money and time with this cheap looking hair. The hair is processed a complete let down. Am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;ve had the hair in my head for about a month and a half.. The first 4 weeks, the hair was great.. When washed, the body wave pattern returns and the hair looked absolutely beautiful.. I dyed my ends which came out great and still after that, the hair was great.. Going in two months now, the hair is starting to shed alot and tangles very often.. Overall the hair is great for a month and after that its just ok...</li>
    <li> Hair came super fast, it shipped Monday and arrived Thursday. Its gorgeous, its very long and the bundles are very full. No shedding so far, I did not cut the wefts though. Will definitely order this hair again and again. Well worth it. Ladies when I say you braid it at night and then get up in the morning and just go, I mean it.</li>
    <li> I ordered my hair June 22nd And received it today the 27th so shipping was great ! My hair arrived nowhere near the estimated date. I ordered a \\&quot;20\\&quot; \\&quot;22\\&quot; \\&quot;24\\&quot; the \\&quot;20\\&quot; and \\&quot;24\\&quot; was very soft and silky, when i got to the \\&quot;22\\&quot; it was coarse and a little rough! I was a little disappointed because the hair sheads alot also. I haven&#x27;t installed yet but i will be sure to seal my wefts and deep condition my bundles!</li>
    <li> I just received my hair in the mail yesterday, I&#x27;m not sure how it will be once I install it but as of now...I LOVE THIS HAIR!&lt;br /&gt;It was so soft and looks exactly like the picture.  The color is a off black, sort of dark brown color, but Im going to dye it jet black.  I am very pleased with this hair.</li>
    <li> After wash before installing hair tangled badly it took an hour to untangle all the bundles &amp; hair did not wave back up when wet. After installing had to flat iron which is  beautiful however tangles after being down. Hair is not as described of virgin Brazilian hair. Very disappointed will not buy from company again.</li>
    <li> i would have loved to give this hair 5 stars but i couldnt even though this is really awsome hair if your new to virgin hair but the hair does have its cons. first off it says body wave hair but once you wash it , it doesnt wave back up,second it sheds a little to much..the pros. would be it can definitely be died in keep its natural luster and it doesnt tangle and its very soft so i give this hair 4 stars for being good starter hair! o and shipping was extremely fast came within 3 buisness days!</li>
    <li> Sorry to say but the hair was horrible , but The customer Service was BEYOND great. They answered back to emails A.S.A.P &amp; if their was situations with the hair they made sure that the money situation was handled with Noo Problem. So the Hair was 0% but the Customer Service was Definitely a 100%</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this hair in a whole month and it looks like a spider&#x27;s web.... I wishbi could get refund or better hair! I paid my money and I&#x27;m very angry about this hair!</li>
    <li> This hair was pretty amazing. My first actual experience with Virgin extensions. Easy to dye, although it sheds a like after the dying process which is likely to happen whenever you add chemicals to your hair. However, lasted me a long time.</li>
    <li> When I received the hair it was beautiful, looked JUST like the picture. Of course my first move was to wash and condition the hair. As I washed it the water in my sink quickly turned black. Obviously the hair was dyed and was NOT VIRGIN (hence the word \\&quot;remy\\&quot; in the description. Virgin remy is a huge oxymoron). Not a big deal to me, I wanted it lighter anyway. As I laid the hair out to dry I also noticed that that big bouncy wave pattern had fell. However, I had the hair installed for a month before I decided to write a review so that it could be in depth and honest. The hair stayed soft and full of life, minimal tangeling but the shedding is HORRID!!!!!!! It sheds like a dog!!! I told my mom it&#x27;s a good thing I&#x27;m not cheating with anyone b/c they would get caught every time with me! I&#x27;d leave hair everywhere! (I shouldve sealed my wefts but i did not cut any tracks) Anyway, the hair is now a really dark brown, almost black, with a reddish tint in the sun (yuck). I ended up cutting about 2\\&quot; off of the 24\\&quot; b/c the ends looked really thin and dead which improved the body of the hair. Wave pattern still there but not anything close to when I first purchased. For the price I would definitely purchase again but I&#x27;d seal my wefts next time. :(  Oh and the 3 packs was a little more than enough for my U part wig. Very thick and full!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really what I expected with this hair, the person I gave it&#x27;m very unhappy with this product. not what I expected. It will be for the next purchase.</li>
    <li> When I fist took the hair out the packaging it appeared to be beautiful. However the hair was not authentic Brazilian body wave. When taking the hair out of it&#x27;s packaging it immediately tangled. I also saw a great deal of red hairs/fibers mixed in with the hair when I specifically ordered jet black the hair should have been all one color. Lastly, I experienced excessive shedding and hard to comb through hair which only last about a 1 week, when the shelf life of Virgin Brazilian Body last much longer than that. I ask for a refund or better quality hair neither request was met by the company. So that was money down the drain, unfortunately. I will never buy from them AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Ok so im a hair freak right, so the moment i opened my hair i could tell it wasnt unprocessed brazillian. The hair smells and look like synthetic hair and i am so not pleased with this mess. I wouldnt recommend nobody to buy this mess. The shipping was fast and the hair is the actual length but its not a good quality of hair. I am sooo upset. I am so not pleased. Dont waste your money and time buyin this</li>
    <li> I bought a 20&amp;#34;,22&amp;#34; and 24&amp;#34; hair bundle. The two longest bundle straight out the package tangled and shed like crazy. I was so upset. I had to go out so I installed the hair any way. Things only got worst. The hair tangled some more and sheds like crazy. (I didn&#x27;t seal my wefts) the 20&amp;#34; hair is amazing soft and tangle free. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with the other lengths its almost like they are not real human hair. I received a free bundle of 20&amp;#34; due to the tangling of the longer lengths. I probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> hair was awesome until I dyed it.. made the hair dry and brittle.. shed a lot as well.. but it&#x27;s a good price for good quality. will buy again.</li>
    <li> Horrible quality hair.</li>
    <li> Please do not purchase this hair! My weave is a rat&#x27;s nest. As if that&#x27;s not bad enough, I&#x27;m leaving balls of hair every where I go. It sheds FOR DAYS! I should have known by the price, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. (I know sometimes you get what you pay for) I basically just threw away $150.00... They are advertising a grade AAA, and I&#x27;ve had better synthetic hair. Also, it does not come packaged that way. It is in factory synthetic hair packaging... BUYER BEWARE!!!!!</li>
    <li> Well I ordered the hair on the 21rst of august paid 146.57.....115.10 for the hair and 30.00 .for 1-3 delivery day I received hair at 9:00 pm today.... the 26th!!!!!! for ONE MY INVOICE SAID THE HAIR WAS 60.00$ SO IM CONFUSED I EMAIL ELIZAWIGS AND EXPLAIN TO HER ALL THE PROBLEMS AND I GET A DUMB ASS RESPONSE.. FOR 2 I WASHED A STRAND AND IT LEAKED BLACK HAIR DYE.. AND THE 24 INCH WAS THIN AT THE END CURL DID NOT COME BACK I FEEL LIKE I WAS SCAMMED AND ELIZA SHOULVDE SENT 2 ORDERS OF 20,22,24. MY INVOICE SAYS ARTIFICIAL EXTENTIONS!!!! RIDICULOUS I WILL take matters elsewhere. unless I receive my order and a refund. horrible</li>
    <li> I have had the hair in for about 3 weeks. It is still holding up. It sheds Lot but if you have a good brush and tie your hair up at night in a silk scarf you are ok. I washed it and it bleed alot. You can curl it up with wrapping lotion. It is holding up with gym sweating and humid temps. Maintains a decent look. I like it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This hair sheds like crazy. When I received it I washed it and it never waved back up. So I used flex rods to curl it back. It does hold an awesome curl! But I have to brush it every 20 min, LITERALLY bc it gets so nappy!!! I do not like this hair too much at all! I swear im not exaggeratin in the least bit. The only thing i like is that i paid for it to come in 1 to 3 days shipping and it came like that 2nd day. The hair is cheap so expect the worst and hope for the best lol.</li>
    <li> This hair feels and looks great. Three bundles definitely give u a full look. When I installed it I couldn&#x27;t stop lookining in the mirror.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!!  THIS HAIR IS THE WORST!!!  IT DOES NOT KEEP A CURL, IT TANGLES SO BAD!!  I HAVE TO KEEP BRUSHING IT!!!  I WILL WASH IT AND PUT IN GOOD CONDITIONER AND IT TELL DOES NOT HELP!!!  I AM GOING BACK TO MY REMI VELVET HUMAN HAIR!!!</li>
    <li> was great , i washed it an it stoped shedding! curls came right back you have to wash it in expensive shampoo an keep it up! would have gave it 5sta but it was a little thin</li>
    <li> great hair pretty hair a little gray strand here n there nothing to worry bout though length is good weight of hair is good its overall good hair fir the price I llove it</li>
    <li> The hair was pretty good. Not bad.I would buy from them again. I does shed tho but if you dnt cut the track it wont shed as less</li>
    <li> I got my hair today Feb. 7 nd I ordered it January 25 so it was fairly fast shipping due to the fact I chose standard ...but about the hair its soft full nd luxurious  I ran my hands throught it nd got no shedding I haven&#x27;t installed it yet im gonna wait closer to spring break but it is really nice the seller emailed me bck promptly whenever I had questions # greatbuy</li>
    <li> I bought this hair and the first day i got it done ut was beautiful but the NEXT DAY IT WAS HORRIBLE! All it did was knot up and u had to keep brushes it do not BUT!</li>
    <li> The hair was pretty but the quality is very bad and coarse, I would never buy this thing again, I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
    <li> The hair, is beautiful. BUT. It IS NOT virgin. IT IS NOT 100% Brazilian. You can tell that the hair isn&#x27;t virgin because it&#x27;s been dyed black, and it smells processed. My stylist told be that the hair is also hard to curl, and it was hardly wavy. If I had the time and money to ship ALL the way back to China, I would. But I just won&#x27;t order from this seller again. I wish I could get my money back, or more hair for free.</li>
    <li> i received in really quick. the hair was soft but when i installed it was always tangling and i had to comb it evey five minutes. the hair sheds alot. will not order again</li>
    <li> Hair was of Pristine quality...definitely going to order again... :-) I love love my new hair..thankyou  for living up to your name</li>
    <li> It was not what I was expecting but it could have been better thank you it ain no good qualify hair but I quess if you really want good hair you havespent more money</li>
    <li> I just got the hair 2weeks ago, just got it installed last week wen my styles put it in it shed alot , but as soon as she curled it ..it didn&#x27;t shed as much 2-3 strings which was good,hair soft nd it didn&#x27;t tangle very manageable, I prolly brushed my hair 3 times a day No tangle \\&quot; but wen I dyed it ..it got very stiff nd it didn&#x27;t blow dry good, so I let it air dry a little I just pinked curled it so we will see how it will turn out in the moring</li>
    <li> I was supposed to receive my hair by April 4 but did not receive until 2 weeks from that date. I had to dye the hair because it was not 1b like I thought. The hair immediately tangled. It tangled so badly that I had to take a hour to detangle each bundle. The hair shed as well. I am not happy at all and have never been upset enough to write a bad review.</li>
    <li> I got my hair installed and it is very pretty in and it is true to length.I gave it four stars because I had to put argan oil on it first for it to soften up and keep it from tangling, but for the price paid it is well worth it and I have to remember that it&#x27;s not bundle hair so remy spray works well on it as well. Shipping time was great, so overall I am satisfied with my purchase</li>
    <li> WAS GREAT TIL I WASHED IT AND APPLIED IT TO MY BRAIDS</li>
    <li> If i could rate this a negative 5 i would. this hair i so soft and nice when you put it in at first. give it 2 days and your hair is going to get so matted and shed alot. the buundles are super thin and get even worse as time goes on . its only been 2 weeks and the hair is so thin that i had to get it cut to look like layers. it was horrible &amp; its not cool that this companies ripping people off. NOT WORTH IT!!! pay the extra 30 for better quality hair and no headaches!!!! oh and by the way after you was your hair the waves/curls go away and your left with thin stringy straight hair!!!!!! what a waste of money and time!! all these good reviews have to be payed people writing them because they are false!!!!!! it was great hair for the first 48 hours, after that its horrible.</li>
    <li> Hair tangles and sheds terribly. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> i thought this was a good deal at first but after the first few days i disliked the hair it kept getting tangled shedding way too often and getting maded. dont buy it i think its a mixture of human and synthetic fibers</li>
    <li> its descent hair but it sheds alot and it doesnt go back to wavy hair after you wash it but it feels nice and no i woulfnt buy this brand again but its working out for me overall</li>
    <li> I was soooooo excited when my hair came in, it looks &amp; feels soooooooo amazing and you can just tell that it&#x27;s 100% brazilian Hair if you&#x27;ve been doing hair for a couple of years like I have. I bought three bundles from my last purchase last week and today I bought one more just because I love the hair &amp; I want ultimate fullness. Thank you sooooo much pristine !!!! you have a loyal customer in me.</li>
    <li> Hair came in weeks before estimated time given to dallas tx very soft beautiful color i order the 3bundle but since i want my hair nice and full im wating on my fourth one bundle are a little then but thats because of the length im sure im getting it sew in once my fourth bundle come in im very excited f</li>
    <li> Hair was Beautiful, the bundle was little tho. Had to purchase an additional bundle apart from that I was satisfied</li>
    <li> Sheds a lot. But beautiful wave when wet. Has lots I&#x27;ve colored threads mixed in the hair. Which means it isn&#x27;t virgin. Overall good hair for the price.</li>
    <li> This hair meet my expectations.  It was easy to manage, and was beautiful after being flat ironed.  This was a good price too.</li>
    <li> I just received my hair yesterday it took 4 days to come and the hair is beautiful i freaking awesome</li>
    <li> I FEEL LIKE I GOT A GREAT DEAL AND THIS HAIR IS USUALLY 120-150 FOR 24INCHES IN MY TOWN IN CT. AND 100 FOR 20 INCHES. AND I SEALED MY WETHS JUST TO ASSURE ME THAT THE HAIR WOULDNT SHED. IT CURLS GREAT AND IM FLAWLESS......... 160.00</li>
    <li> at first it was pretty, i liked it the first 3 weeks, THEN, hell came. needed brushing every 10 mins, came out shedding sooooooo much. it was in my mans butt one day lol and thats when i knew it was horrid hair. but seriously its not virgin brazilian hair. i got real brazilian hair from lavish lengths in san diego. they have a website and social medias. they have actual brazilian hair. but this is not it! dont buy unless u plan to keep it 1 or 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> So I PURCHASED THE HAIR IN FEBRUARY AND AT FIRST GLANCE IT SEEMED TO BE BEAUTIFUL BUT BEAUTY ISN&#x27;T THE ISSUE... THE HAIR WAS A TOTAL LET DOWN.. IT SHEDS LIKE CRAZY. IT DOESN&#x27;T WEAR OR WASH WELL THIS HAIR IS A BIG PHONY.... DOESN&#x27;T HOLD WAVES AT ALL... AND MY HUSBAND AND KIDS HATE FINDING HAIR ALL OVER THE HOUSE, DO TO SHEDDING I WOULDN&#x27;T BUY THIS HAIR AGAIN...</li>
    <li> I so love this hair i  installed it is bouncy and I love it it also doesn&#x27;t shed that much love it</li>
    <li> This was soft &amp; very pretty out of the package, true to length. Had it installed &amp; it looked great for a few days. After 2-3 weeks hair appeared dull looking, conditioned the hair still did not bring it back to life. It also started shedding like crazy when it is supposed to be shed free. When I washed the hair, the water turned black. I&#x27;m starting to believe this hair is NOT true brazilian remi, but processed regular humair hair. You truly get what you pay for &amp; with this being my first brazilian hair purchase and doing my research I now know what to expect. I highly recommend spending a few extra dollars to get the silky, high end brazilian hair you truly want.</li>
    <li> Well for starters this hair look just like it does in the picture but what I was most impressed by was the customer service. It was fast &amp; even though I had a mishap with the hair, I emailed the company &amp; they responded quickly with help. I would definitely order from them again!&lt;br /&gt;The customer service with this company is incredible! This hair is a must buy! I&#x27;m in love with it &amp; even more in love with the company &amp; it&#x27;s service. I definitely recommend buying it. It won&#x27;t disappoint you! Great workers!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair! I haven&#x27;t had any problems with shedding, but ALL hair sheds. So it&#x27;s the least of my problems if it decides to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it now for about a week. It&#x27;s looks and feels great. The hair shipped here 2 weeks quicker than it should have. It&#x27;s full &amp; really soft! It still has the same wave it had when I bought it. (But it&#x27;s only been a week). I put my Remington curling rod to the test &amp; it curled really well. I will update this review at the end of this month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this hair again!</li>
    <li> Will order again. Ordering came on time. Everybody love it. It also font shed. I&#x27;m in love with this hair.</li>
    <li> I was a little weary about ordering hair online but this hair is great, its real virgin Brazilian and it does NOT shed. I&#x27;ve washed and dyed the hair and the body wave comes right back.</li>
    <li> When i got the hair i noticed it was a little stringy like hair out of place. But it is soft and pretty and i like it,not love but very good for the price.its worth buying for the price.</li>
    <li> The hair bundles didn&#x27;t have as much hair as I thought they would.... It tangled like crazy and shed like I was wearing dog hair.... I recommend u would be better of at an beauty supply store</li>
    <li> This hair is beautiful.  I was doubtful about buying hair online but I am impress with the quality of the hair.  I got the hair on time. The hair is gorgeous, soft and beautiful I can&#x27;t wait to install it.  I would recommend this hair.</li>
    <li> I just received this hair. It looks pretty in the package. When I opened it, I immediately noticed that it sheds a lot. I installed it as a wig and washed it. It shed a lot as I washed it. I haven&#x27;t worn it yet, but I expect that it will continue to shed and matt like a previous reviewer stated</li>
    <li> This hair is absolutely amazing and shipped way before the estimated arrival! First off, my estimated arrival was February 11, 2013 and I received it January 7th! An entire month earlier. The item(s) are just as described it comes with three bundles of hair - 20, 22, and 24 inches . Now, lets get down to the hair. The hair is beautiful and very soft! This is sew-in/glue in hair but I made my own clip in extensions from it and they look lovely. (I sealed my weft(s) to prevent shedding.) Anyway, after two weeks of being with this hair, I&#x27;m still in love. Of course, its not as soft as it was when it originally came, but still amazing. This hair tangles quite a bit when it&#x27;s straight, but its not  unmanageable or a huge problem for me, personally. I have short, thick, relaxed hair and the hair blends perfectly! The price for THREE bundles of hair is great — ESPECIALLY for the lengths.  It can usually cost $220.00 for only 2 bundles of 24 inches, so this was literally the best bang for my buck. I recommend this product! Also, the seller is really fast about responding to emails and provides great customer service!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair I got the 24 22 and 20 inch for 170. I must say that the product is above average! This hair is beautiful and I only got one strand when I ran my hands through it! Overall good purchase!</li>
    <li> The shedding on this hair was horrible.  I have been wearing Brazillan hair for some time and I have never had hair shed this much.  I expect some shedding even on the best sealed hair, but the 24 inch shedding was outrageous.  The hair comes out in small clumps.  Also, this is not virgin hair, so if you want virgin hair or intend to color this hair, don&#x27;t waste your money.  It is cheaply priced for a reason.  This is the worst hair I have ever purchased.  I read reviews and tried to give them a chance. No, I had to remove the hair after one week. When i say the shedding is unreal, it is no exaggeration.  Tangles constantly.  DO NOT PURCHASE, unless you don&#x27;t mind shedding and don&#x27;t care about poor quality.</li>
