      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff, been using this for years.</li>
      <li>but thankfully I was able to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Most of the hair gels, putties, creams etc.</li>
      <li>but now I am glad I did because I love it.  </li>
      <li>I have tried other gels etc and this works the best for me and holds my style all day.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair look much more full.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only product of its kind I have ever liked or even used more than once.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>and once you run your fingers through your hair a few times, it feels like nothing is in your hair, but you still have the perfect amount of body.</li>
      <li>happy to still find it at Amazon, and pricing is similar to the supply houses.</li>
      <li>this one here is about the best one I&#x27;ve used because I do have short hair then it really held up well</li>

      <li>This is a great, stiff product for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>I put it at the scalp area, running my fingers up through my hair, and it gives super lift.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
      <li>Probably would have been fine with the old container too.</li>
      <li>love this product and can no longer find it locally.  </li>
      <li>The product was just placed in a large envelope.</li>
      <li>Might have been fine with only one unit but more with 4 banging into each other.</li>
      <li>Dip a small amount on your fingers and work lightly and quickly through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only styling gel that has the right consistency and holding power that I want.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and the seller even taped the lids over as an extra precautionary measure which I appreciated.  </li>
      <li>If something should need fixing, just a touch of water to reset the issue and when it dries it is perfectly fixed.  </li>
      <li>Some are too thick or heavy to hold my hair properly and others are too light to be effective.  </li>
      <li>I do not like the new container they been using for the last year or two.</li>
      <li>3 out of the 4 of the outer cases had major cracks/damage.</li>
      <li>just the right amount of hold, and when you mess up your hair after it dries, it doesn&#x27;t create any flakey particulates.</li>
      <li>I have short fine hair that doesn&#x27;t do anything unless forced to by some hair product, and in the past hair products weren&#x27;t strong enough to make it do what I wanted.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I find that I&#x27;m constantly on the lookout for hair products that will work well with my hair.  Most of the hair gels, putties, creams etc. don&#x27;t cut it for me.  Some are too thick or heavy to hold my hair properly and others are too light to be effective.  When I finally find something that works, it winds up being discontinued...  Go figure.  Well, as soon as I discovered it, Styling Gunk became my go-to hair product.  It works perfectly to shape and hold short hair and it even smells great too!  I know scents are subjective and hard to describe but to me it smells like a delicious, aromatic, coconut desert.  After I couldn&#x27;t find it at the store anymore, I learned that it too had been discontinued.  I&#x27;m not sure why but thankfully I was able to find it on Amazon.  So, I stocked up to hold me over until I can find something else of comparable quality.  Shipping was fast and the seller even taped the lids over as an extra precautionary measure which I appreciated.  I highly recommend that you try Styling Gunk before it&#x27;s too late!</li>
    <li> this one here is about the best one I&#x27;ve used because I do have short hair then it really held up well</li>
    <li> Great product and rec&#x27;d very quickly!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this at the beauty salon anymore! I really hope it&#x27;s not going off market because it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for short hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 7 plus years and love it&#x27;s holding qualities and once you run your fingers through your hair a few times, it feels like nothing is in your hair, but you still have the perfect amount of body.</li>
    <li> Best product ever. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!  I have short fine hair that doesn&#x27;t do anything unless forced to by some hair product, and in the past hair products weren&#x27;t strong enough to make it do what I wanted.  This does the trick and then some.  I use it on slightly damp hair, create my style and dry it with the hair dryer.  It stays set all day in whatever style I set it up in.  Does not move!  I love it.  I mistakenly bought .3 jars to try it but now I am glad I did because I love it.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard unless you put too much in.  You can put it in shape i the morning and go for the day.  If something should need fixing, just a touch of water to reset the issue and when it dries it is perfectly fixed.  Can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to try it.</li>
    <li> Product 5 Stars - Shipping 1 Star. I love this stuff, been using this for years. My hair type is coarse asian/white. I do not like the new container they been using for the last year or two. Shipping packaging was terrible, or should I say non-existent. 3 out of the 4 of the outer cases had major cracks/damage. The product was just placed in a large envelope. Might have been fine with only one unit but more with 4 banging into each other. Probably would have been fine with the old container too.</li>
    <li> Best gel not sticky with great hold</li>
    <li> love this product and can no longer find it locally.  thx</li>
    <li> I am a Cosmetologist, and can no longer find it at the supply houses. This is a great, stiff product for my fine hair. I put it at the scalp area, running my fingers up through my hair, and it gives super lift.&lt;br /&gt;So happy to still find it at Amazon, and pricing is similar to the supply houses.</li>
    <li> Already use kit. Can&#x27;t find it in the salons.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used to get this product at my hairdressers then they change products and no longer carry. I have tried other gels etc and this works the best for me and holds my style all day. I know by it by the 3 pack. My grandson tried it one weekend for his hair and he loved it so I gave him one of my jars.</li>
    <li> Outstanding and fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff and they need to start making it again. To bad they took it out of circulation!</li>
    <li> I hope I can still find this product that apparently is no longer in the market!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite a while.  It&#x27;s the only styling gel that has the right consistency and holding power that I want.  I was told it was being discontinued so I stocked up!</li>
    <li> It works. It does not make my hair oily or heavy. It&#x27;s the only product of its kind I have ever liked or even used more than once.&lt;br /&gt; It will wash off my hands with plain water and some rubbing.&lt;br /&gt; It only takes a little to style and hold my short hair dieux. It makes my hair look much more full. Dip a small amount on your fingers and work lightly and quickly through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Keep the lid on tight.</li>
    <li> Great product. A little goes a long way... just the right amount of hold, and when you mess up your hair after it dries, it doesn&#x27;t create any flakey particulates.</li>
