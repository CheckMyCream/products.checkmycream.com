<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like these.  They do not dry my skin out and I can use them more than once a day if my allergies are bad.</li>
    <li> These do a great job removing my mascara, but I can&#x27;t use them on the rest of my face as they make my acne-prone skin break out.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful for dry, sensitive, redness prone skin. Soothing and good at getting dirt/makeup off of face while leaving skin feeling refreshed. These will now be my go to face wipes. I prefer these over Ponds, Say Yes To ___, Oil of Olay, and store brands.</li>
    <li> Love em, nice price.. Smell good. Work well on my sensitive skin. A little rougher than other brands. Preferred to the more expensive &#x27;garnier&#x27; brand</li>
    <li> I have tried various brands of makeup remover wipes, and I this product is one of my favorites. The wipes are moist and don&#x27;t have an unpleasant or overpowering scent. They are also gentle and don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. They do a pretty good job of removing makeup. My only complaint is that I also have to use some baby oil to get off my waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> Leaves you feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> No Irritation. Perfect product.</li>
    <li> I love these wipes, so so much.  They&#x27;re gentle yet very, very effecting in cleaning, and they&#x27;re so inexpensive!  They do an amazing job removing all the make-up and grime from the day, and leave my skin feeling clean and not stripped.  My skin is somewhat sensitive, so everything from the feel of the wipe on my skin to the cleansing formula matter.  These wipes are not thick but not thin, they feel soft but are very sturdy and have a gentle texture that cleans everything away.  I alternate between only using this before moisturizing before bedtime, and using this before using the Elemis cleansing products.</li>
    <li> I love these wipes - I tried the Simple for Sensitive skin wipes, but they didn&#x27;t work as well for my dehydrated face as the Radiance wipes.  I only need to use one wipe for a full face of makeup, INCLUDING eye liner + mascara! The only issue would be that the fibers tend to loosen as you&#x27;re wiping your face so sometimes you find the cloth fibers in your eyelashes... kinda weird, I know. I can use them on the go after a particularly hot day at Disneyland, or after a gym sesh to feel a little cleaner before my shower.  I notice that if I don&#x27;t wipe my face after being extra sweaty, I&#x27;m prone to more breakouts - hence the need to wipe my face!</li>
    <li> Does not give me a burning feeling on my face like other brands.</li>
    <li> I really like the Simple line of products. This one feels very soothing and I love that you just clean and toss!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and I always buy Simple brand face cleansing products as I don&#x27;t react to them at all. I love these face wipes, they get all my makeup and dirt/grease off and they don&#x27;t feel rough on the skin.</li>
    <li> Keep these in the car and they are a life saver</li>
    <li> I have been using Simple Radiance Wipes for years.  Price is reasonable compared to other brands, and it works just as perfect as other brands.</li>
    <li> There aren&#x27;t a lot of facial wipes that haven&#x27;t gone across my skin at some point or another. I like the concept and use them traveling, make-up removal, a quick refreshing, etc. Some are definitely better than others. I have serious combination skin. My chin is a breakout factory. It&#x27;s really quite delightful. Anything with the slightest bit of oil leads to some really impressive cystic pimples. The other parts of my face, however, are very dry and prone to irritation if I don&#x27;t use something sensitive. The wipes made for sensitive skin are often too greasy to put anywhere near my chin, but these wipes are different. They were delicate enough for my dry and sensitive areas, but not greasy, so they didn&#x27;t cause a breakout. I really like them.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have tried all kinds of washcloths and soap to clean them and not get a rash.  I tried these as an alternative to the highly bleached wash clothes in hotels and fell in love with them.  I use them everyday now and take them wherever I visit.  No more worries about leaving makeup on a gracious hosts towels and my skin just loves them.</li>
    <li> these wipes do not clean as well as the other ones that i bought at the same time (Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s and Neutrogena) however, they are okay and do the job. it requires more work from me to get the same effect.</li>
    <li> Love these wipes for cleaning my face in the evenings. Just takes a few minutes and then can fall in bed. These take off eye makeup fast. I purchased this item on Amazon.com, and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find these in the store, so I am glad I can Subscribe and Save.  They are much better than the other Simple Cleaning Wipes.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of the Simple facial wipes but not of the Radiance wipes. As others have mentioned, they do seem drier compared to other facial cleansing wipes. I use the wipes at night and do notice that my makeup, including waterproof mascara, is coming off but I wake up in the morning with an oily face. I have normal skin, only slightly dry in the winter and very slightly oily at times in the summer, so it&#x27;s not normal for my skin to become so oily and I&#x27;ve also broken out just a bit. I won&#x27;t purchase the Radiance wipes or any other Radiance products again but will purchase Simple products again.</li>
    <li> I use these to remove a majority of my makeup before deeper cleansing.  They are also great for a quick freshen-up after the gym.  My skin feels very soft after using these, and they do not cause my acne prone skin to break out.  I really do think my skin looks more radiant!  The only reason I give 4 starts instead of 5 is because I need to use two wipes to feel like I&#x27;ve really removed all of my makeup.</li>
    <li> Cleans well and is gentle on face.</li>
    <li> Works well, to freshien my hubby&#x27;s face.</li>
    <li> Not as nice as the Cottonelle wipes and dry out much quicker.</li>
    <li> I like this makes my face feel good</li>
    <li> These face wipes have a nice fragrance, don&#x27;t dry out the skin, and are refreshing.</li>
    <li> Perfection bedtime and on the go.  Easy to pack and easy to use</li>
    <li> These are nice and thick very good for travel.</li>
    <li> Love it , use it an all of the above. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I use these after I work out each day and it has eliminated acne caused by sweat! Cleans your face very well and leave you refreshed. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using them more than once a day because they make my face feel a bit dry afterwards. I would imagine use on a non-oily/sweaty face would really dry you out. Overall, a great post-workout face wipe!</li>
    <li> Smells really bad and is dry and scratchy. Think I got a bad batch or something.</li>
    <li> Good wipes when you need a quick clean. Although, they can sometimes not have enough moisture leaving you with the need to grab a second wipe.</li>
    <li> I like these.  Not too wet, not too dry. Removes makeup.  Does not break me out.  I use these after gym and on the nights I am too exhausted to wash face.  You know those nights...yes they are rare...you just cannot drag yourself to the sink.  These are perfect.  Grab one and wipe face and hit the pillow.  It&#x27;s better than not washing :)&lt;br /&gt;So far these are my favorite.  I used to be hard core ponds but I these seem better for my skin.  Nice ingredients</li>
    <li> These do the trick without fragrance, preservatives, etc.</li>
    <li> Cleans really good. Glad to pick this for traveling. Smells great compare to others.</li>
    <li> I like these and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering. They have a nice texture and seem to work well on y makeup.</li>
    <li> WORKS WELL FOR THE PRICE</li>
    <li> Does a great job. Has a nice, very subtle fragrance, not at all over-powering. Cleans very well.</li>
    <li> I liked these until I tried the Olay Wet Cleansing Towelette for sensitive skin. Olay ones are thicker and more durable for removing makeup and clay mask. Both are good but the Olay ones just seem more sturdy and like a washcloth.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so when it comes to washing my face, I can easily irritate my skin. These makeup wipes are perfect. They leave my face feeling so clean. During the winter months it is easy for my skin to dry out, so I appreciate that these wipes help restore some of that moisture that my face so desperately needs. These are now a definite staple in my life!</li>
    <li> I received this from bzzagent last week to review for free, and boy am I thankful I got them. I&#x27;ve tried many brands and types of face wipes, these are by far my favorite. Simple did an awesome job with these. The scent is light and they do an excellent job and cleaning my face. There was no irritation and they caused no redness. I am definitely a fan of simple brand now.</li>
    <li> I got to try these for free from bzzagent, and they aren&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;For me- they left my skin feeling a little tight, but it did give my skin a healthy glow. I prefer the oil balancing ones over this one. These do take makeup off effectively, which is great. They are a good size, although it took more than one to remove makeup, but that is fine. They are nice, but not my favorite.</li>
    <li> Simple skin care products are great. I have extremely sensitive skin that most products leave either dried out, or bright red and itchy. Simple doesn&#x27;t do either. There is no feeling stiff or sticky afterwards. I received free samples of their cleansing wipes and eye make-up remover. The eye make-up remover works great, removing the make-up without scrubbing. I will continue using their products and can not wait to try the rest of their line of products.</li>
    <li> I received this free from buzzagent. It is an excellent product. I would make sure none of your medicines will effect it before you use it. It is great for all skin types. Gentle on skin.</li>
    <li> Considering that I have dry, sensitive skin I had found it difficult to find a cleansing wipe that didn&#x27;t irritate my face or leave it oily.  Once I discovered Simple Skincare (for free via BzzAgent), I don&#x27;t have to worry any longer.  Using both the Oil Balancing wipes &amp; these, my skin has softened, has less redness and less pimples.  There&#x27;s no oily residue...only calm, happy skin!</li>
    <li> I just got these wipes as a part of my free BzzAgent kit, and I really like them! They leave my skin feeling clean and refreshed and when used consecutively actually improved the look and feel of my skin! What I also like is the size and effectiveness of these wipes- I am able to remove all of my makeup as well as cleanse my skin all in one wipe!</li>
    <li> The Radiance Cleansing Wipes are amazing! They leave your skin feeling fresh, soft, refreshed and clean. The wipes have some built in moisturizers so it doesn&#x27;t dry your face out like many other wipes will do. It&#x27;s all natural, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about what you&#x27;re putting on your face. Sometimes I break out when I start new products. I haven&#x27;t had any yet! I really like how clean and light my face feels.  I received mine as well as the [[ASIN:B009RNUH7M Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer Spf 15, 4.2 Ounce]], [[ASIN:B00AO4EL34 Simple Oil Balancing Wipes, 25 Count]], and Eye Make-Up Remover Pads by doing a bzz campaign on bzzagent.com. It was nice to be able to try out all of the products so you know which one works best for you. I&#x27;ve found that using the Simple oil balancing wipes at night an the Radiance Cleansing Wipes works really great for me. The simple products are wonderful and I highly recommend you try them.</li>
    <li> My skin is picky when it come to using new products. I have very fair, sensitive skin. The Simple Skincare range of products have been wonderful on my face!    The Simple Skincare products come in pleasant, well-designed packaging that highlights the natural ingredients and vitamins included. Definitely a good first impression.    Both the Radiance and Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes have been satisfactory. My skin is not particularly oily, so I preferred the Radiance wipes. I would be comfortable using the Oil Balancing wipes as well. At the each of the day I try a cleansing wipe and found my skin feeling clean, soft, and refreshed. I think that the size of the cleansing wipes is a little too large - I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed the whole thing. That is my only complaint there, however!    I received a free sample of this product through[...].</li>
    <li> I am fully impressed by the Simple Skincare line. I really enjoy the fact that the products are dermatologist tested and hypoallergenic.  Out of the four products I&#x27;ve tried, I can see  improvement already to my very dry and sensitive skin. I love the cleansing wipes for a quick cleaning when I&#x27;m on the run. One wipe goes a long way and leaves my face feeling fresh! These wipes contain mango extract and no alcohol or oil, so they smell wonderful. Definitely would recommend these!</li>
    <li> After receiving this product for free through BzzAgent, I found that they worked well...but I didn&#x27;t find use for them other than wiping my face with them after washing my face. I didn&#x27;t feel much of a difference on my skin. My boyfriend used these though and he said he felt that his skin felt really fresh. Worked on him, but I didn&#x27;t feel much of a difference on my skin for having oily skin.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of these wipes! I got to try them for free and do believe I will be investing in more! I have pretty sensitive skin and these worked prefect! I would highly recommend these!!</li>
    <li> When i recieved The Simple Radiance wipes via bzzagent.com I was very excited. These wipes are so convenient! I can pop them in my purse for an afternoon freshening up, or use them at night before I go to bed. They make my skin feel amazing!</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent.com, I received free (full-sized!) samples from the Simple Skin Care line. Being a BzzAgent has allowed me to try products I typically would not buy, like the Simple product line. I am a huge fan of the Simple Radiance Wipes! They make my face feel clean and fresh without drying out my skin or making it greasy!! They are perfect for on-the-go, or busy days. I will definitely be carrying these around with me for when my face needs refreshing!</li>
    <li> I received my free samples of some simple products, these Simple radiance cleansing wipes were one of the samples I got. I fell in love with these cleansing wipes, it&#x27;s great to have found a product to clean your skin with out drying it out. I love the fresh clean smell of the wipes!</li>
    <li> have very sensitive skin so using skin products and cleansers is very difficult for me. I recived this product to test on my sensitive skin for free and I am pleased with my results. I had no reaction to the cleanser, it was very refreshing and I carry it with my everywhere.</li>
    <li> I received this product to try for free through Bzz Agent. A little background on me. I am a mother of two, but also a full time firefighter. I work 48 hour shifts and after medical or fire calls, I am sweaty, oily, hot and dirty. Several times a day. The smoke and pollutants I am exposed to at work have literally wreaked havoc on my skin, particularly my face. Often times, my dirty face will sit for hours before I can get back to the station and shower. I decided to bring the oil cleansing wipes and the radiance cleansing wipes in the engine with me to use as an option when it will be awhile before I can wash my face after a call. After a few call, my face began to get heavy with sweat and grime. I opened one of the packs and used a wipe. I cannot even begin to explain the refreshing, clean feeling after long hours working! The were so easy to use. Open the pack, grab a wipe and freshen up. No scrubbing, no rinsing, no mess. I am in love. I used them 2-3 times that day and I now plan on buying then consistently to keep with my gear on the engine. It is by far one of the best beauty products I could ever have in my working situation.</li>
    <li> i ordered these simple wipes in quantity because i am saving about half...i keep them on my dressing table and in car...these are a time saver and perfect for sensitive skin...l</li>
    <li> I had just received the following products free from a sample site, and I could not be more impressed. When I first tried the Simple products, I was a little skeptical. I have always had super sensitive skin. As soon as a new product would touch my face, I would either break out or become extremely dry and flaky. However, when I tried Simple I was simply blown away! The first Simple product I used was the oil balancing cleansing wipes. They were the perfect go-to product to quickly remove a grossly shiny face. Afterwards, I used the radiance cleansing wipes. After a few weeks of using these products together, I found my face to be very natural and healthy looking- very impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye make-up  remover pads were a great addition. It easily removed even my waterproof mascara and day-old make-up without stinging my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite product was the light moisturizer. I used it when I went to Cancun a week ago. It is only SPF 15, but my face did not get burned at all. It also provided good moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I loved the Simple products and would greatly recommend it to anyone. I will continually use these products in the future!</li>
    <li> recieved this through bzzagent as a trial definitely worth it will keep buying once it runs out because it is better than any of the other ones I tried.</li>
    <li> First of all I would like to say I received my Simple Radiance wipes for free :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wipes are one of my favorite products that Simple Sensitive skin produces. These wipes made my skin feel so fresh, clean and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin one bit! My skin is so sensitive I am usually the last one to try something new on it but this company has truly lived up to my standards, not only did my skin feel great but it also didn&#x27;t break out like it usually does.</li>
    <li> I was given these for free to try from BZZAGENT and I like them much better than other competitors.  I was able to use these even on eye makeu-up and no burning occurred. It seems these have lest moisturizing than competitors but I have oily skin so I&#x27;m not looking for that.  It just made my skin feel clean and it dried quickly.</li>
    <li> This product do what it said. It remove dirt and makeup. It feels so refreshing while cleaning your face. There&#x27;s no odor. Your face would be clean and looks great</li>
    <li> These wipes aren&#x27;t as gentle on my skin as I&#x27;d like them to be. However, they do smell nice and do a good job of balancing out my combination skin. I gave them a shot since I got them for free as a BzzAgent. Would I buy them on my own dime? Maybe. I&#x27;ll decide when I&#x27;m done with the full 25 wipes and come back and update this review!</li>
    <li> I got this as a free sample through BzzAgent and I was really excited to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a visible reduction of blemishes after about a week, but before then, the blemishes I had were much redder than normal and I felt stood out more. I felt that the wipes did an adequate job in reducing blemishes, but failed to prevent new ones from popping up. I felt that I had a lot more blemishes appear after using these than my other skincare products. The smell was not unpleasant and my face was neither sticky nor dry after usage. The wipes were very soft. I would recommend these for when you are too tired to do your normal cleansing routine, but I would not recommend switching to solely using these.</li>
    <li> The Radiance Cleansing Wipes are a great set of wipes to use first thing in the morning. I feel as though it brightens up my face, removes the oil that accumulates overnight, but isn&#x27;t so harsh first thing that I feel like I just stripped my face of any of its goodness. I needed something to use when I first woke up - so this is a great item for that! I did get the item for free as part of a sampling pack from a Bzz Campain. But honestly - that would make me more likely to give it a bad review if it did&#x27;t work - because what would I have to lose? lol. While these we&#x27;re the MOST AMAZING THING EVER ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH (that would be their eye makeup remover) - they definitely did their job and I would use them again :)</li>
    <li> These are so gentle, and they remove all of my makeup with just one wipe. I don&#x27;t notice any weird residue left on my face afterward like I have with some other wipes. Great for removing makeup before cleansing, or if you&#x27;re having a lazy night and don&#x27;t feel like getting up to go to the sink. They do feel a bit drier than other face wipes I have tried, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to affect their performance at all. I&#x27;m so glad I got to try these through BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these wipes! I received them free from BzzAgent to try them out. It took me three days to become a believer in using them. On day one, the wipe was extremely abrasive and I wasn&#x27;t sure they were for me. On day two, I decided to give it another chance and still scratchy but not as much as day one. On day three...nothing! Well, something did happen. I fell head over heals! The wipe was no longer an irritation to my skin and left it feeling smooth, looking healthy, and most of all moisturized. I have sensitive skin and have to admit I was a bit discouraged the first two days of use but, if I had not stuck it out I wouldn&#x27;t be as happy as I am with it now. I choose not to go a day without using this product.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product from bzzagent. This product makes my skin feel tight and smooth every time I use it. I&#x27;m surprised when I touch my skin after it because it&#x27;s so soft. It gets rid of the concealer I wear and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on my skin after it dries like some other wipes I have used before. I really like this product.</li>
    <li> Let me first start by saying how excited I was to get to try the Simple Radiance Cleansing wipes and the other new products from the Simple Skincare line.  I hadn&#x27;t tried any of their products until I received this for free in my campaign from BzzAgent and wanted to see if they were really worth the hype.&lt;br /&gt;  In this campaign I received the Protecting Light Moisturizer, the Radiance Cleansing Wipes, Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes, and the Eye Make-up Remover Pads.  I was concerned about a few things before trying these products.  I have oily/combination skin so I didn&#x27;t know if the Oil Balancing Wipes would actually help with controlling the oil my skin produces.  I didn&#x27;t know how well the cleansing wipes would actually remove my makeup and cleanse my skin.  Also I had never used Eye Make-up Remover Pads so I wasn&#x27;t sure if these would remove my eye makeup without causing my eyes to burn.  Finally I was especially concerned about the moisturizer.  I was afraid it would make my skin  as well as cause a breakout.&lt;br /&gt;  I was really impressed with all of these products.  I really like the fact that they are good for my skin.  They don&#x27;t have artificial perfumes or dyes.  They also have \\&quot;skin loving\\&quot; ingredients such as zinc, glycerin, mango extract and more.  They don&#x27;t contain alcohol or oil which is another plus.  The eye make-up remover pads and moisturizer also contain vitamins which are really good for your skin.  I also appreciate the fact that Simple Skincare products contain no animal derived ingredients.  Here is my review of the Radiance Cleansing Wipes.&lt;br /&gt;  Radiance Cleansing Wipes-  I use these wipes at night after I remove my eye makeup.  I use them to remove my face makeup and any eye makeup that may be left behind.  If I didn&#x27;t wear makeup during the day I still use these to get any dirt and oil off of my skin.  They have a slight \\&quot;mango\\&quot; smell but nothing strong.  These leave my skin feeling nice and clean before bed.  I really like the fact thatI don&#x27;t have to worry about rinsing off any residue left behind.&lt;br /&gt;  I would definitely recommend that you check out the new Simple Skincare products.  They have not only improved the condition of my skin but also my skincare routine.  Prior to trying them my routine was minimalistic.  I washed my face while in the shower or before bed and occasionally added a moisturizer to my skin at night and/or in the morning.  These products are so simple to use that you don&#x27;t need anything else.  No water, washcloth, towel.. nothing.  Which means that I clean my face day and night now as well as add moisturizer every morning before applying my makeup or going outside.  I use the makeup remover pads in the evening if I wear makeup so I&#x27;m not tugging on pulling on my eyes.  Again I recommend that you check these products out.  They work great and are good for your skin.  What more could you ask for.</li>
    <li> These wipes seem to do what they are designed for - cleaning and refreshing your face. I like being able to easily clean away my makeup. Just be sure to completely reseal the sticker to be sure the pack doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Simple for about a year and love the results.  This is the first time I tried the Radiance wipes and I love them too!</li>
    <li> After using this product, which I received through BzzAgent.com for free to try, I love it.  It removes all the dirt that even my facewash left behind.  It didn&#x27;t dry my face out or make it oily.  It made my face feel so smooth and soft aterwards.  I will be using this product in the future!</li>
    <li> I have to admit...I thought that taking the time to washing my face at night before bed was entirely too time consuming...I mean, isn&#x27;t washing my face enough? And if you are anything like me (a working, mom-of-4 (fur) babies, spouse, chef, housekeeper, woman of many hats!), actually washing my face at night is mostly optional as well...considering I&#x27;m normally asleep before I even make it to the bed! This isn&#x27;t good...considering I am predisposed to jaw line acne. I was chosen to participate in a campaign to try a few Simple products and the radiance wipes are one of those products. My face is and has stayed clear (not even a single blemish!) since I began using the line. I now use the Radiance wipes to \\&quot;wash\\&quot; my face at night and follow that up with the eye make-up remover pads, then the protecting moisturizer and then DONE! Takes less than 5 minutes! THANK YOU SIMPLE! I love you. #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I got to try the Simple Sensitive products. I have got to say I love them. Doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Doesn&#x27;t have any oils in them. There products are simple irresistible. If you or somebody you know has sensitive skin and has a hard time looking for products, look no further Simple has done the job!! Got a free sample from BzzAgent to try it out. Got to say I fell in love with there products.</li>
    <li> Simple products are just that ~ simple to use.  They are mostly natural (although how natural can a pre-moistened wipe be?), and leave my face feeling clean and fresh.  Does a good job removing makeup at the end of the day, including tough water-proof mascara. Other than that, I wouldn&#x27;t say they&#x27;ve enhanced my skin or made it better.  While they&#x27;re not drying, I wouldn&#x27;t say they&#x27;re moisturizing and they definitely don&#x27;t make my skin \\&quot;radiate\\&quot; (unless you consider clean radiant!).  If you&#x27;re looking for a quick alternative to soaps and cleansers and water for those nights you may be a bit too tired for a full &#x27;spa treatment&#x27;, these are great.  They&#x27;re also great to use on your arms and legs, even your feet, if you need a quick \\&quot;pick-me-up\\&quot;!  They&#x27;re strong &amp; sturdy and won&#x27;t tear in half or roll up like other wipes do.  Sometimes I use in addition to a spring water spray.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think some of the reviewers are using these correctly or with accurate expectations. When reading the back of the Simple Radiance wipes, there is nothing mentioned about makeup removal. I believe these wipes are used to add moisture and radiance, somewhat like the Aveeno Radiance cleanser (which is also great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought  both the Simple Cleansing wipes and the Simple Radiance wipes. The cleansing I use for removing makeup, and while they work effectively, they can leave the skin dry. This is why I purchased the Simple Radiance wipes and I truly believe they are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry skin and felt the moisturizing effects immediately. Not only that, but looking in the mirror, I see an actual glow! Almost ethereal! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an easy way to moisturize who would love to add a beautiful sheen to the appearance of their skin.</li>
    <li> I received these wipes for free as part of a BzzAgent campaign. I think it would take about two wipes to feel like I thoroughly cleaned my skin. They did not leave dry patches which is nice. I would have preferred if these did not use parabens as preservatives. Also, these could stand to be more moist. I would possibly repurchase these for the times I&#x27;m in a hurry/lazy and do not feel like using actual face wash.</li>
    <li> These make-up remover wipes are great for a mid-day pick-me-up.  When I get home from work and before going out at night I clean my face with them and they are both refreshing and non-drying.  The remove my make up completely so I don&#x27;t have to wash my face with soap and water and make a mess.  The texture is smooth and non abrasive for a nice \\&quot;cool and fresh\\&quot; feeling.  They are also large enough to get my entire face and neck clean.  I will continue to use these cleaning clothes as they are a great value for a great product. .  I also use them in the morning as a refresher or after a workout.  They come in handy because you can carry them with you where ever you go.  I received a sample of this product for free from bzzagent.</li>
    <li> I fell in Love with the New Simple skincare radiance wipes. I had Just come home from working with my horses (this can be a dirty job). I had recived my Simple Skincare Radiance wipes as a complementary free Trial from BZZAGENT That afternoon when I came Home. I loved how fresh and clean My skin felt. I have been Looking for a product that could make my morning regimen easy and Quick I am so Not a Morning person and When I use these wipes it makes it fast and easy. I am so Making these wipes a part of my everyday thing.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical of trying this product from Simple because other similar products I&#x27;ve tried have not met my standards.  I received this product free through BzzAgent and I&#x27;ve gotta say overall I&#x27;m really impressed!  Upon first glance I was hopeful because the product description said they were noncomedogenic and hypoallergenic- perfect for my sensitive skin!  Because I have such a hard time finding products that will cooperate with my skin I don&#x27;t automatically eliminate it because it has artificial dyes or perfumes, but the fact that these products didn&#x27;t was an added bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have sensitive, acne-prone skin that is mostly oily.&lt;br /&gt; When I first opened the package I was surprised that the towelette wasn&#x27;t as moist as I thought it would be.  It didn&#x27;t smell too strong, perfumey or chemically like others I&#x27;ve used in the past.  It felt cooling and refreshing on my skin and despite my initial opinion I found that the towelette was perfectly moist enough for my entire face and neck.  I liked that the towelette was about the size of a kleenex.  I didn&#x27;t feel like I was just wiping the grime and oil around my face, but actually removing it!  At first, I thought it was a bit rough on my skin but after I was finished my skin felt smooth and clean so I think it has just the right amount of roughness to gently exfoliate and clean your skin.  I would definitely repurchase- perfect for camping, lazy days, or after a workout!</li>
    <li> These wipes left my face feeling so clean and soft. These are a very moist wipe and very thick! They didn&#x27;t leave my skin oily and didn&#x27;t burn my skin. Smell is ok but not great. I will be buying these in the future! I was able to try this product for free.</li>
    <li> I got my first experience with  the simple Simple skin care line, from BuzzAgent.com. They gave me simple radiance cleansing wipes (25 Ct) oil balancing wipes( 25 Ct) eye make up remover wipes and a full 4.2 fl oz bottle of light Moisturize all for FREE!!! They where easy to use, just wipe an toss! No having to wet my face in the sink, and wash with soap then wet again. Which leaves me soaking wet from head to belly. The Simple skin care line was strong on dirt, oil an removing my eye make up but not harsh on my skin. They left me feeling clean and refreshed but not dried out or burning like some skin cleansing products do. There is NO heavy chemical smells or heavy perfumes with the Simple skin care line.  The Simple Protecting light moisturizer was love at first use!! I love how it feels and how it makes my skin feel!! I just love,Love, LOVE how my skin feels after a week I using the Simple Skin care line. My skin feels clean and looks great!! And I am a person that if I think I using a moisturizer on my face I break out, with this line of skin care I didn&#x27;t, and that is a great thing. I just recently had my first child and I&#x27;m 31, so life is hectic and the last thing I wanted was to walk around with Acne. And with the Simple skin care products I don&#x27;t have to worry, I didn&#x27;t break out. An that was a big relief. I would recommend this product to everyone!! It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I love these but haven&#x27;t really found the &amp;#34;radiance&amp;#34; part of it since I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now. They do get the make up out and leave your skin feeling refreshed and its a very light scent to it which is pleasant to use at night because my husband hates when I put creams or wipe my face with scented stuff because he has a very sensitive nose.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for the Simple skincare products and I&#x27;m happy to say that I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. The first thing I tried were the Simple Radiance Wipes. In the past, I&#x27;ve tried other products that either left my skin feeling dry or oily and the Radiance wipes did neither! Instead it left my skin feeling refreshed. Right when I pulled it out of the package it was moist and the wipe itself was a lot bigger than I expected which allowed me to clean my face without worrying about having to use a second wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part of it all? I got to try this product out for free thanks to BzzAgent. This is a product I will definitely purchase for myself once I&#x27;m all out of my freebies.</li>
    <li> I can appreciate the added moisturizer in these wipes because in the winter my skin gets extremely dry and the use of products sometimes dry it out even more. The wipes automatically refreshed my face and gave me that clean feeling as well as removing my makeup. Disclaimer: I was provided this kit free of charge by BzzAgent.com</li>
    <li> I received these as part of the BZZAGENT campaign. I honestly was a little leery of trying a new facial product. So many products claim to be for sensitive skin, but end up causing a breakout or cause your skin to dry out. The Simple skin care products do not!! I am actually really glad I got picked to do this campaign because the products are great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love these wipes. I used the Radiance cleansing wipes before bed to remove any build up from throughout the day. They left my skin feeling refreshed and so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Simple skin care product line!!</li>
    <li> The Simple® Radiance Cleansing Wipes are refreshing, cleansing my skin from the daily oil and dirt that I come in contact with. This wipe moisturizes without leaving an oily residue which is great because I want my skin to be moisturized with out being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product as a BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I received the simple skincare moisturizer, oil balancing wipes, radiance wipes and eye makeup remover wipes through a bzzagent campaign and I have to admit that I am in LOVE with all of them. I am developing sensitive skin as I get older and many beauty products can irritate my face and neck but simple skincare products don&#x27;t contain alcohols or dyes and they didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all! I used the oil balancing wipes the most because I have oily and shiny skin and they worked like a charm. The amount of oil on my face decreased and stayed that way throughout the day! So I would definitely recommend any and all simple skincare products if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I got these as a sample to try. I was excited to try them out because I have sensitive skin and I am still on a quest to find the perfect wipes for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I was looking for:&lt;br /&gt;- nice scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming or medical smelling&lt;br /&gt;- non drying&lt;br /&gt;- didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes&lt;br /&gt;- removes my make up&lt;br /&gt;- non oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that the Simple Radiance Cleansing Wipes met all of my criteria.There is a nice light fruity scent. It removes my makeup pretty easily (I do have to use the eye make up wiped for stubborn mascara) it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or leave a greasy film behind. I think I finally found my winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are great for traveling too...pack one thing and you are off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I would love improved is the seal of the bag. I wish it wouldn&#x27;t just be a sticker...it sometimes doesn&#x27;t stick so well if there is moisture on the package...and since these are living in my gym bag....that happens often.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of these from Bzzagent and was surprised out how useful I found them. Usually I clean up my makeup with some fancy face soap and water, and occasionally realize after applying toner that the makeup did not come off all the way because I see it on the toner sheet. That doesn&#x27;t happen with these, however, since you can see what is coming off on the wipe and feel assured that your face is clean. Not only that, but my face felt a nice tingly clean after I used them (though I do wish the wipe was a little less dry). To top it off, the inconvenience and discomfort of having to splash water all over your face and then wipe it dry is gone when you use these. You can even keep the wipes by the bed so that, just in case you forgot to wash your face before going to bed, you can still clean up without getting up. I bet they&#x27;d be pretty useful for kids, too!</li>
    <li> I received these for free from Bzzagent.com to try out. I have very sensitive skin an have to e careful about what I use. I was excited to try the Simple brand face products. Unfortunately my skin hated these. When I first used them I liked them. My face felt fresh. Then after using them a few times my skin felt like it was burning. I don&#x27;t know if it was from the texture of the cloths or just the whole product. I will definitely not be using these again.</li>
    <li> Cleansing Wipes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Simple Cleansing Face Wipes were my absolute favorite. Unlike many similar products, they didn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky or smelling funny. The cleansing wipes were a super simple addition to my bedtime routine--and especially nice for when I feel lazy before bedtime. Plus they worked great at removing eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all together I loved all the Simple Products but my favorite product are definitely the Cleansing Facial Wipes. They get every last bit of makeup off of my face at the end of the day and, I don&#x27;t get that burning sensation that I get from other wipes because of rough texture or alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you bzzagent to let me try these amazing product and I won&#x27;t definitely stop to use this product!</li>
    <li> I received this product, along with the wipes for oily skin, the moisturizer, and the eye makeup remover to try through bzzAgent. I do not have a skin care routine, even though I am in my 30&#x27;s and I should have one. I actually hardly ever use any type of products on my face, but I do have problems with dry skin. I used these wipes, and I thought they felt refreshing on my skin. I also used the light moisturizer and liked that it was not oily or greasy on my face, and I did not feel like I had something on my face. In my opinion, the products are very easy to use, I feel comfortable using them since I know they are safe for my skin, and after using them for about 2 weeks, I noticed that my skin tone seemed to be more even. I will continue to purchase this product after the supplies that were sent through BzzAgent run out!</li>
    <li> I love these.  I am allergic to so muck makeup and cleansing products.  These are fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is a handy make-up remover without any fragrance but something that does the trick easily and comfortably.  My one regret is that the seal on the plastic container is possibly not good enough because mine tended to dry out a bit.  They have remained somewhat moist enough to use but my impression is I should use them quickly before they are as dry as any Kleenex sheet.  Other than that they seem to work well and I would use them again only placing them either in a sealed plastic container or possibly a plastic sealable baggie.</li>
    <li> I love these becasue not only do they do a great job on my skin but they are so portable as well! I am an equestrain but any athletic woman/girl would like these for after workout cleansing. I am outdoors a lot and my face feels so much better after a wipedown with these.So great for after a ride in a dusty indooor arena! My skin looks and feels like I just left the spa!</li>
    <li> I keep this in my gym bag as a way to make sure I wish my face clean after a workout where my face gets in contact with a lot of sweat and oil. I&#x27;ve been satisfied with using them so far.</li>
    <li> These have no fragrance which is a plus and my skin feels fine after use.  They are handy in a pinch when I can&#x27;t wash my face at night - on a plane or train or long car ride.</li>
    <li> I like these.  I have normal, sensitive skin that gets dry if I use foaming cleansers.  These don&#x27;t give me any problems, and they remove makeup effectively, although you may want to use an additional product if you wear waterproof mascara.  For traveling, they are very handy.  And they are reasonable priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would suggest to the manufacturer is to improve the closure.  A zip-type resealable package would be an improvement over the current design, which relies on the stickiness of the front label to keep the wipes moist after the package has been opened.</li>
    <li> I love the Simple brand as a face wipes.  I found this a great product to use daily to take off makeup and keep acne a bay. This product stays moist and makes you feel clean.</li>
    <li> I have a packet at home and at work. Its nice to be able to clean up quickly. After use, my skin feels moisturized and not tight. Will continue to purchase. I have very sensitive skin so its nice to finally find something that is convenient .</li>
    <li> Love this product! I decided to give it a try when they were running a promotion (found via Slickdeals) and I&#x27;m so glad I did. These wipes smell nice and actually get make-up, food, dirt, sweat, etc. off your face. If you have oily skin, if you are a messy eater, if you cake on layers of make-up, or if you just are an overall dirty person, I&#x27;d recommend that you buy these wipes.</li>
    <li> I recieved these wipes to try for free from Bzz agent and I loved them, They don&#x27;t burn your skin and afterwards my face felt so clean and fresh and looked so right and even toned!I didn&#x27;t have that tightness feeling like with other cleaners.</li>
    <li> Simple skincare products sounded perfect for me with their claim to be non-irritating and being made with all natural ingredients. I&#x27;m in my early thirties with fair, sensitive and dry skin. Most products I&#x27;ve tried are too harsh for my skin so I was excited to try these cleansing wipes. I love the idea of being able to wash your face with just a single wipe and you can take them on the go. The first thing I noticed when I took the wipe out of the package is that it felt somewhat dry. You are supposed to be able to use the wipes directly out of the package without adding water. As soon as I put the wipe on my face it felt scratchy. I&#x27;m not sure if it is the material of the product or the fact that it needed to be damper. As I continued to use the product my skin started to tingle; not in a good way. My skin never turned red, but it continued to stay irritated for an hour after cleaning my face. Simple has made products that I really do like using, but this is not one of them. I received this product for free as a bzz agent so that I could provide consumers honest feedback about the product.</li>
    <li> I received this in my free sample kit from BzzAgent.com. The first thing I noticed about these wipes was how dry they are. Maybe it was because it was the first one in the pack but it was dry and scratchy against my face. Second was the slight itchy feeling after the use of one. My chin got a little itchy almost like irritated after. These wipe also left the skin around my eyes and mouth feeling dry like it was stuck. Just not for me. I do love that there is no perfume or alcohol. I love what Simple has done for ladies and men a like but something is just off here. Maybe it was because it is the first in the pack and it will get better towards the end?</li>
    <li> I received these Radiance Cleansing Wipes in a BzzKit through BzzAgent for Free to try and I like them to remove my face makeup before I was my face. My Skin type is combo/oily and I believe these wipes are targeted more for normal. dry or even combo/dry skin because when I used them, they felt great and moisturizing, but I always felt like they left some residue behind on my skin or it felt a little greasy and my face would look shiny after I used them. Overall, I do recommend them because I think they are great to remove makeup before immediately washing your face, they don&#x27;t sting or irritate the skin and are good to add a little moisture before or after cleansing if you have dry skin.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product as a free sample, and i am really glad i tried the simple line of skin care products. These wipes are a quick way to clean your face and make u feel refreshed. They left my akin feeling soft and clean after i used them, N break outs, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> These Simple Radiance wipes worked very well for me. I recently got the chance to try them for free, and was so glad I did! They are moist enough to cleanse your skin and don&#x27;t sting or burn. I think they are great for a quick facial cleanse when you can&#x27;t get to the sink to wash your face. These leave your face feeling clean and fresh, and do not irritate your skin, which is a big plus for me, because finding products that don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin is sometimes difficult. I would recommend these to anyone who uses cleansing wipes for a quick facial cleanse. They make your skin feel clean and don&#x27;t leave a greasy or oily look to your skin.</li>
    <li> I do so love to baby my skin and especially my face.  Having grown up with Acne it wasn&#x27;t fun but I learned the best way to help your skin was to clean and exfoliate daily.  I tended to stay away from makeup as that always made things worse and now that I am much much older my face is looking good and I want to keep it that way.  The Simple Radiance wipes are not harsh and leave you feeling clean, fresh and softer.  I do have sensitive skin and these don&#x27;t bother me at all.  As for the price I find they are worth every cent just to keep me feeling and looking my best without making it a cumbersome chore.</li>
    <li> For a facial cleanser, I think it&#x27;s about average overall.  I like the convenience of the wipe.  It&#x27;s easy to take on a short trip for  one or two nights if  &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; cleaning will do.  Also, i like that it has &amp;#34; added moisturizers&amp;#34; and there is no scent that i noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a more thorough routine cleansing and make-up removal, I&#x27;ve had to use a make-up removing cream, followed by these wipes, followed by toner and still the cotton ball showed make-up and dirt residue.  The cloth itself is not thick or &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; enough.  Ponds makes a better facial wipe that feels like a thin mini-washcloth, &amp;#34;grips&amp;#34; my skin and doesn&#x27;t slip.  It makes me feel like I can really scrub my face and get it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in my opinion, not effective for routine and thorough cleansing  but if streamlining your facial routine or convenience is a high priority, then this would be worth a try.</li>
    <li> My daughter accidentally bought this product looking for a make up remover.  As such it was \\&quot;okay\\&quot; but that is not what it is intended for --- it is a cleanser and that is a job it does very well.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> a favorite. i will reorder</li>
    <li> Best way to end the day with a refreshing wipe and leaves my skin soft.</li>
    <li> So easy to take off makeup right before bed.  Otherwise I&#x27;d forget or be too lazy to do it. Love it.</li>
    <li> I loved my Simple skincare package. I have very sensitive skin so I sadly can&#x27;t use alot of things. I used the simple sensitive make up removers and they left my face feeling fresh and clean. The simple lotion was also amazing, it was very light and did not irritate my skin. I will se both of these in my daily skin cleaning regiment. Thank you Bzzagent for the chance to try these out for free!</li>
    <li> I love wearing makeup but don&#x27;t love going to sleep in it. Usually I get the chance to wash it all off but when i&#x27;m out at a friends or am traveling i&#x27;m not so lucky. These wipes definitely do the job in removing the powdered foundation that I put on everyday. I received a free sample of these wipes from a Simple Skincare Campaign on the BzzAgent website and am very glad that I tried them. My skin felt extremely soft after using it and I liked that there was no perfume, and that the scent was very light and clean. The word light is a very accurate way to describe how my face felt after using it. All of my foundation was on the wipe and not on my face, which I think is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin used to burn when I used generic make up removers, but these wipes did not irritate my skin at all. I highly recommend them to those who have sensitive skin, and to those who need a quick and effective way of taking off their make-up.</li>
    <li> Although I received these free as part of a BzzAgent campaign, and I love them! They make for fast facial cleansing. They are perfect for after a run or workout. They don&#x27;t burn like other wipes. Also, they have a moisturizer embedded, but it doesn&#x27;t linger like some cleansing wipes. I really liked that. Overall, great product! I would definitely buy them.</li>
    <li> I got this along with several other Simple products, during a campaign for BzzAgent. I myself have very dry and oily skin, so I break out A LOT. I never actually used makeup wipes before, except samples and so forth. Anyway! These are pretty good. The size is a big enough for the face and lower chin, which I needed. And there isn&#x27;t a strong, nasty odor like some I have heard of. After using them several times, it helped smooth out my skin, I am not as dry anymore which is a plus. Would definitely purchase and recommend these!</li>
    <li> I was so very fortunate to have received this product for free by using Bzzagent.com and I must say that I am so overjoyed by this product and the results!  These wipes are by far the best I have ever tried and they did not irritate my skin or dry it out. The Simple product line is absolutely amazing and well worth trying and buying. I have already started to recommend my family and friends! Give it a try you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> I received my Simple skin care product from bzzagent.com.  Simple radiance wipes have worked very well for me. I have to say that i do use another facial cleaner, and use these wipes as a quick fresh up when i need one!  The wipes work fabulous to me in that aspect and keep my skin oil free for the most part! Id highly recommend this product to anyone that has issues with their oily skin!</li>
    <li> I did receive these for free, however I am going to repurchase these soon! I have heard many great things about the brand itself but have never really tried it before. Upon receiving it I love the design itself. Directions are clear as day and  ingredients are very visible for those who are sensitive, like I am. After applying it to my face and neck, my face felt so clean! There was no overbearing odor, just a fresh clean scent and feeling. The wipes are great for removing makeup without irritating the face; it made my skin have a healthy glow, which I love. Wonderful products! No rash from my sensitive skin! Definitely a fan!</li>
    <li> I received these products for free as part of a bzzagent campaign and I think that they are perfect especially when you on the go. I have found that these wipes have come in handy when leaving the gym and wanting to wipe your face iff after sweating. I also have found that these are great for after tanning. They leave your face feeling clean and fresh. I also think that the smell is really nice and fresh. I definitely recommend these wipes especially if you are looking for something that can be used when busy and feeling like you need to wash your face.</li>
    <li> I got this product free, as a BzzAgent! I was so excited to be apart of this Simple Skincare BzzCampaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily call my skin sensitive, although I do struggle with breakouts and dry skin. I&#x27;m always looking for new products to try, so I was glad to see this on my doorstep. Do note that the wipes might appear really dry when you first touch them; I thought that at first, but they stay moist while taking off all my makeup and leave my skin with a radiant glow and soft feeling. No tightness or filminess from this product, unlike many facial wipes I have tried! And, for a lazy gal like myself, I&#x27;ll take wipes that I can keep on my bedside table over getting up and washing my face any day of the week! I never feel like I need to go wash my face again after using this; my skin feels clean and soft each time. I generally use one wipe, front and back, until all my makeup is off. Oh, and I have to mention the smell. It smells SO fresh, clean, and light. My dry skin woes disappear when using this, and my skin has stayed surprisingly clear as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be taking this to the gym and on road trips! It&#x27;s so refreshing just to use it at the end of the day, so I imagine it is great to use after a long workout or while on the road. I&#x27;m going to even be putting a pack in the fridge so I have some cold wipes during the hot summer months. Ladies and gentleman, I highly suggest you try this product, especially if you are struggling with dry skin, acne, and/or find it hard to get up at night to wash your makeup off. Simple Skincare, extraordinary results!</li>
    <li> I recently received a sample of Simple Radiance Cleansing Wipes in the mail through a company called BzzAgent. I really liked the way they made my face feel. I was a bit confused on the purpose of the wipes because just the word \\&quot;Radiance\\&quot; didn&#x27;t mean much to me. They have in small print that they are a cleansing wipe with added moisturizers so I just assumed they were a moisturizing wipe. Overall, they smelled great without being overwhelmingly strong and they made my face feel fresh and I was  ready to start the day.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the simple convenience of this product! As a new mom every free moment counts! This product makes cleaning my face fast and easy! I can just pull out a cloth real quickly and wash my face without even having to take my eyes off my daughter to go to the bathroom! I am also happy about the fact that Simple didn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin or dry out my face with it&#x27;s simple ingredients! The nice soft smell was an added bonus!</li>
    <li> I have never been as pleased with a facial cleanser as I was when I tried Simple brand products by Unilever. I have sensitive, combination-oily skin so I was skeptical when I chose Radiance Cleansing Wipes after an intense afternoon of spring cleaning; there was no way that my skin would feel clean and look bright without a terry-cloth wash cloth and a harsh cleanser, was there? Yes! The oil, sweat, and grime disappeared and I was instantly invigorated by the face that smiled back at me in the mirror. Radiance Cleansing Wipes left my skin feeling clean and hydrated without feeling greasy or smelling of an artificial perfume. Thank you, Simple! (I received this full-sized product sample to review for free from BzzAgent.)</li>
    <li> I loved receiving this Simple skincare product for free through BzzAgent. I found the Radiance Cleansing Wipes to work extremely well. They were gentle, effective, fresh scented, and left no residue on my skin. My face felt super soft after each wipe. The first couple of wipes in each package aren&#x27;t very moist, so you may need to use two if you wear your makeup heavier. I found using the Radiance Cleaning wipes (that contain an added moisturizer) at night to be more effective than using them in my morning routine with the Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer with SPF 15.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product as a bzzagent and so far this product is OK. I opened the pouch and the first thing I noticed was the wipes were not very wet. They did clean my face but I felt like I needed to use another in order to do my whole face. The great part about this product however, is that I spend my summers on a boat at the shore and this product will come in handy do to the fact that it is very portable and will store very \\&quot;simply\\&quot;. Overall I probably won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I received the radiance wipes for free but this is my personal opinion of them. Well i have incredibly temperamental skin i breakout in a rash from so many different products other than olay and proactiv i hadnt found anything that worked on my skin until i received these wipes. They dont irritate my skin at all and they leave my skin feeling clean but not dry. I love this line of products and this will definitely become part of my new skincare routine!!! I recommend that anyone that has sensitive skin try this product because if youve had as many problems as i have with all of the product lines out there this might just be the product that works for you.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of these wipes about a week ago and so far I have enjoyed trying these. I believe these cleansing cloths were intended to be used on the face but I am hear to tell you that I also enjoy using them for my decolletage, my hands, and as a quick freshen up on the go.  The package is compact enough that you can fit it in your purse or keep them in the compact in your car.  I really like these wipes because they have added moisturizers in them, are free of oil and alcohol, and free of artificial perfumes and dyes.  My skin is really sensitive and so far these wipes have not irritated me at all.  I even have to wash all of my clothes/towels/bedsheets etc with detergents that are free of perfumes and dyes as well.  I think this is a great product to keep on hand.  It can serve many purposes beyond facial beauty!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of the Simple Radiance Cleansing Wipes for free via a Word of Mouth marketing company (bzzagent.com).  Before using a face product there are several things that I look into, the first being is product deemed safe for sensitive skin, with this product, it is specifically geared towards individuals with sensitive skin, and the second is does the product have oil in it?  I do not need to add any oil to my already oily face.  So I was excited to try this product. When I first used the pad, I felt that it was not as wet as it should be, but surprisingly the wipe cleaned well, even removed my thick BB cream with no problems!  I did however notice a slight smell with the pad...and I felt it smelled like beer?  But the scent did not linger on my skin or hands so that was a good thing.  Overall, this product worked great and left my skin feeling wonderful!  I will definitely be using this product again, and using it to replace my skin cleaner that involves a sink and water!</li>
    <li> I have a 7 month old so, i&#x27;m not as much of a &#x27;new&#x27; mom but I still fall into bed exhausted at night and am guilty of skipping washing my face. These are great for those nights or any night really. I received a sample to try through BzzAgent and have been using them for a couple days now. My super sensitive skin seems to like them well enough. No burning sensation, no over drying effects and I love that the scent is very mild. They seem to gently exfoliate too. I&#x27;m going to include these in my &#x27;new baby&#x27; kits for friends and keep a pack on hand for myself too!</li>
    <li> I received Simple Radiance Cleansing Wipes for free about a week ago from BZZ Agent as part of their campaign and have been using them ever since. They work perfectly with my skin. I have really sensitive oily skin and these wipes have worked wonders. They are perfect for my skin type. This product uses natural skin-loving ingredients and vitamins. They also leave out the artificial perfumes and dyes. They are also oil-free and alcohol free. The products have been Dermatologist Tested, Ophthalmologist tested, are Hypoallergenic and Non-comedogenic too! The best part as they leave your skin looking healthy. I personally love the cleansing wipes.  I prefer to use these cleansing wipes at night as I am getting ready for bed. They truly leave my skin with a radiant glow. The first time I used this product I was shocked as how healthy my skin looked. It left my skin with a radiant glow. I love that these wipes have mango extracts in them, mango is my favorite fruit. These wipes are great because they use natural ingredients and don&#x27;t have a strong smell. I really enjoy using them. I plan on continuing to use this product. I recommend these wipes to anyone with really oily skin or those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product for free and found i really enjoyed using the radiance wipes.The wipe itself is a perfect size it is so soft and gentle and glides so smoothly across my face while removing any make-up or dirt.The wipe did not dry out my face and seems great for daily use.The scent of the wipe is very light so it did not irritate me, I think these wipes would be perfect for any skin type.</li>
    <li> These wipes were okay, they didn&#x27;t have a strong smell like the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;I personally use it after i play sports to get the dirts off my face, but these didn&#x27;t clean a well.</li>
    <li> These wipes are great - finally wipes for that work even for my very sensitive eyes.  The best part is, no more staining my towels with mascara and eye makeup stains.  Because no matter how well you scrub with traditional facial cleansers, inevitably you dry your face and BAM!  there are the stains.  Nice.  That&#x27;s why these work out so well.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds in the past...Olay, Nivea, Dove, you name it.  These are the ones I like best, all though, I have to say I like the ones in the light green packaging better than these \\&quot;radiance\\&quot; type.  These sting my eyes slightly more.  I believe they have a exfoliating or \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; ingredient, which is good for skin they say, but my eyes didn&#x27;t like it as well as the usual Simple wipes package I typically buy, in the light green packaging.  Still, that being said, I would still buy these over the other brands I&#x27;ve previously tried.  No chemically smells, headaches, breakouts, skin irritations, or feeling like something is left on your skin when you are done.  I&#x27;m very happy these came out and they sure have helped save my towels!  Black smeared towels aren&#x27;t real classy.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I am a BzzAgent and received this product for free to try. These are awesome! They are very gentle &amp; leave my skin feeling very clean. I wish it was a 30 day supply though, my only complaint. I&#x27;m definitely a fan, they are very effective!</li>
    <li> Sometimes I don&#x27;t have the time to wash my face, and if I&#x27;m on the go or in a rush these are handy to have around. These work just as well as their face washes.. just as gentle and clean just as well. My face feels dirty/oily a lot and these are great for a quick clean-up. They make my skin as soft as a baby&#x27;s behind especially when combined with their light moisturizer. I&#x27;ve used other brands before and none are as gentle and non-irritating as these. Very glad I received these free to sample.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive a free sample of these wipes from a BzzAgent Campaign.  On a typical day I wear primer, bronzer, blush and powder foundation.  On my eyes I will wear a primer, liquid long wearing liner and a decent amount of mascara.  I use these wipes to remove all my makeup and cleanse my face.  Not only did it leave my skin feeling fresh and clean, I tried it on my eyes and it removed all of my eye makeup.  I love that I can clean my entire face with a single wipe, saving me money.  I also like the fact that my skin didn&#x27;t feel tight or dry after using these wipes.  I would absolutely recommend these for any skin type.</li>
    <li> First of all, the product packaging for the Simple Radiance Cleansing Wipes is extremely cute. I love pulling this pack out of my gym bag for my workouts. My skin is prone to breakouts so I used these wipes before, during, and after working out to prevent sweat and dirt buildup in my pores. They worked really great getting off all of my foundation before my workout. I like it when you can really see on the wipes all of the gunk that it removed from your face. During my workout the wipes were really refreshing for wicking sweat. These wipes also came in handy when I was too lazy/tired to get up to wash my face before going to sleep. Keeping a pack in your night side table makes it easy to remove makeup quickly to get you off to sleep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product #gotitfree for testing purposes. All comments and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I got this product free thanks to being a bzzagent. I really liked this product because of the cloth-like material. Very soft. and I can see the dirt on the cloth, so I know my face is getting clean.</li>
    <li> As far as facewipes go, these aren&#x27;t half bad.  They aren&#x27;t my absolute favorite but they provide a lot of moisture to my face and remove most of my makeup.  The first wipe is always a little drier than the ones underneath, but overall they are great.  The texture is a little more exfoliating, and the tissues have ridges in them, which is good for heavy makeup.  I prefer a softer wipe, because I have sensitive and dry skin, therefore these are a bit scratchy.  But, other than the &#x27;yes to cucumbers&#x27; these are the only other ones I would buy again (if they were out of my faves).</li>
    <li> I like these wipes. Each single wipe is pretty large (i&#x27;d say roughly half the size of a sheet of bounty) and has enough moisture to give a thorough cleansing. The package is small but they managed to squeeze 25 wipes into it... though it is somewhat troublesome getting them out initially.The after effects are not troublesome. They dont leave any sticky residue or disturbing scent. Overall i can recommend these wipes.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for removing make up. They have a light scent.</li>
    <li> Excellent product....love the monthly delivery!</li>
    <li> At night time before bed, I use Simple Radiance Cleansing Wipes. The packaging says they refresh skin and keep pores clean of impurities. These smelled kind of like witch hazel and aloe. They look and work similar to the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes, they just smell different. I noticed that they gave my skin a dewy, healthy look when I looked in the mirror the next morning. My skin looks flawless every morning, now. It leaves no residue and removed makeup from face and eyes without burning my eyes. My face feels healthy, protected, and soft and clean before bed. I also apply Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer after using the wipes. I would recommend these wipes for all skin types, these are really gentle yet shockingly effective. I got this for free from BzzAgent!!</li>
    <li> I was given this product to try for free and I must admit, when I first tried this product I was a bit skeptical. I usually use a liquid facial cleanser and massaging tool but I found this product worked well for cleaning my face on the go!&lt;br /&gt;I found that it left my face feeling clean and fresh without drying out my skin (which has always been a problem with past facial cleansing wipes). These wipes are perfect to place in your purse or in the car, for that 2:00 wake-me-up wash!</li>
    <li> I received Simple radiance wipes for free to review from BzzAgent. To me these wipes are a little rough if you are someone who does not have a lot of time in the morning to take your time, but i am pretty pleased with the result after using this product. I like the way my skin feels after using Simple radiance wipes. One of the few product wipes out there that does not make my feel either greasy or too dry (nice balance).</li>
    <li> I was given these wipes for free to try them out, and I was really happy with them. Most likely will purchase. With one swipe you can see and feel almost all your makeup taken off, maybe with one more wipe you will be 100% clean so in conclusion one wipe or two at the most will do the job more than p perfectly. they really have no scent at all and feel really soft and gentle thus my title stating they lived up to Simple´s promise. I did not give it all 5 stars cause I did not understand the \\&quot;radiance\\&quot; part of it all. Simple should provide more description in each package as to how each of the ingredients will help your skin.</li>
    <li> I prefer soap and water when washing my face but when I am in a hurry to get the eye makeup off this is very useful. It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. I have passed some on to daughter who wears so much more makeup than I do and she loves it. I have a feeling the rest will be gone soon.</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m super excited guys! I just tried the complete Simple skincare range -- which includes their Radiance cleansing wipes, Oil Balancing cleansing wipes, eye makeup remover pads &amp; their Protecting light moisturizer! Wonderful bundle of vitamin enhanced skin care products! I am an owner of super sensitive skin and many products I&#x27;ve tried in the past, even for sensitive skin, have left me with red, dry, bumpy skin. Simple&#x27;s skincare is a welcoming difference. The cleaning face wipes left my skin moisturized, clean, and most importantly free of red patches and bumps, which has been the result of other face cleansing wipes I&#x27;ve tried in the past. Simple is VERY gentle on the most fragile skin there is. I promise. They not only cleanse, but have added vitamins like vitamin E and pro vitamin b5 as well as skin loving ingredients like mango extract and glycerin, all amazing for touchably soft skin. I also enjoyed Simple&#x27;s eye makeup remover pads because they were not only gentle on my skin and eyes, but did an amazing job removing even waterproof mascara. The light moisturizer isn&#x27;t thick or greasy and protects from UVA and UVB rays with an SPF of 15. Perfect for summer right around the corner. I am throughly please with Simple&#x27;s new skincare range and cannot wait to make it my new skincare regime for the summer! (I recieved free samples of this product)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bzzagent and I got these for free and I love these cleansing wipes. When I used this they did a good job. My face felt fresh and clean. The wipes are a pure soft cotton on my face.I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> BzzAgent sent me The Radiance Cleaning Wipe For FREE! Just to try them and Review them! I love the Radiance Cleansing Wipes!!! I am one of the many out their battling sensitive skin. Sometimes my skin is way to oily, Or way to dry,Or gets irritated right away. Never seems to stay in the normal. Well guess what! The cleansing wipes WORKED! My face seemed to be clean and fresh! Not to dry and not to oily! Super Excited!!!! I would recommend all of the Simple Skin Care Products!!!</li>
    <li> Note: I received these for free as a bzz agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these I have very normal though  sensitized skin that leans toward dry. I have been trying out different wipes and these are the ones that don&#x27;t break me out or leave a rash. Great for on the go, try them if you have trouble finding wipes.</li>
    <li> I actually got this product in a kit on an {online community} , which gave me the availability of trying this product out. This is a great over all product that the ingredients do not irritate my skin and another plus that it it has no sent. It also does not leave your skin feeling greasy, but the only thing I wish was better it would have to be the wipe texture.</li>
    <li> I have used Simple&#x27;s Cleansing Wipes in the past but I recently received a set of their new products from BzzAgent and was able to check out these Radiance Wipes. Just like the basic wipes, the Radiance Cleansing Wipes pretty much rock! The Radiance Wipes leave you with this very cool, dewy, clean look and feel. I don&#x27;t wear make up often, but these work great just wiping the funk from my day off of my face. Following up with the Protecting Light Moisturizer makes my skin feel fantastic! And to me, the best part is no water required! I often forget to wash my face, so having a bag of these stashed in my bedside table is great when I remember them after I&#x27;m all tucked into bed. I just grab one out, give my face a nice wipe and throw it in the trash. Perfect! :-)</li>
    <li> This wipes are awesome for a quick refresh mid day. I work with dogs so when I get home it&#x27;s straight to the shower, but some days I might not have time. It&#x27;s awesome to have this great product for sensitive skin so I can do a quick wipe and feel good. I have extremely sensitive skin so when I was told about this Simple line by bzzagent, I was ecstatic to be given a chance to try the product for free. They don&#x27;t dry you out, don&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy or oily, and best of all don&#x27;t bother skin. Plus, I am crazy about mango and they have some extract in them!</li>
    <li> I recently received these for free to try and after trying them I was pleasantly surprised by how much I like these. I have dry, sensitive skin and these wipes effectively remove my makeup and leave my skin feeling hydrated and clean. The wipes are soft and have a slight texture that helps get all my makeup off with using only one wipe. They don&#x27;t have a strong fragrance and don&#x27;t leave a residue on my skin afterwards that makes me feel like I have to wash my face again.</li>
    <li> I recieved full size sample of Radiance cleansing wipes FOR FREE because I am a BzzAgent!! The radiance cleansing wipes worked well at getting off all the dirt, oil and makeup from my face. The only thing I disliked was the wipes felt a little rough to me on my sensitive skin. Although they worked well, I was left with a dry feeling face that was somewhat red and irritated from the rough, scratchy wipes. The dryness went away after I used the Protecting Light Moisturizer with SPF 15 but I do wish the cleansing wipes were softer and more gentle.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of these wipes and am absolutely in love with them!  These are the ONLY facial cleansing wipes that I&#x27;ll be using from now on!  I used them after wearing a full face of makeup and just ONE wipe got every trace of makeup off of my face.  They don&#x27;t have an offensive odor and left my skin feeling clean, smooth, and really soft.  I tend to break out very easily and these have actually HELPED my skin...because they&#x27;re so gentle I&#x27;ve made sure to take my makeup off at night!  I&#x27;m going to get a second pack to keep by my bed for those nights that I might forget to take my makeup off before I get in bed!</li>
    <li> These radiance cleansing wipes are amazing! They are so gentle and light; they don&#x27;t irritate my skin like most other makeup wipes! But they are still heavy duty enough to get the job done, without having to scrub my face raw! I have tried other \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; products before, but this one is truly in a league of its own! It&#x27;s my new go to wipe for sure! Did I mention I got to try them FREE by being a Bzz agent?! (bzzagent.com)</li>
    <li> I love Simple products. They work so great and do what they are supposed to. These wipes work great at cleaning your face by removing oil, dirt, and makeup. They also don&#x27;t dry your face out like other wipes. They are awesome and will definetly buy more of their products.</li>
