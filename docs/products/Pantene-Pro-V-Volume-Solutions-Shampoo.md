      <li>Excellent shampoo leaves hair very clean and soft!  </li>
      <li>I love Pantene.  </li>
      <li>I love Pantene shampoo</li>
      <li>I love the body and volume</li>
      <li>so I was very happy to find this big bottle, and the pump is a blessing!</li>
      <li>Love the smell, my hair feels smooth after using it.</li>
      <li>so easy to use on the shower shelf, just pump and use.  </li>
      <li>We found that Amazon stocks the Fine</li>
      <li>My hair looks its best on the second day rather than the first day after shampooing.  </li>
      <li>I also use the Fine conditioner and it works well.</li>
      <li>and we can have it shipped for free with Prime.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure it is the best for your hair</li>
      <li>So if you aren&#x27;t too worried about dry and damaged hair it should be great for you</li>
      <li>The vast majority of shampoos give me dandruff or itchiness, but this one has consistently been a great product over the years.</li>
      <li>This is one of the good Pantene shampoo I have used in last 5 years.</li>
      <li>The shampoo cleans well, and leaves my hair manageable, so it&#x27;s not a disappointment as a shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner does make my hair have more volume more than any other brand I have tried.</li>
      <li>It measures out just the right amount of shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love that it comes with a pump top, it just plain makes it easier to use.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine with a bit of wild curl - this shampoo makes it fuzzy.</li>
      <li>It seemed to last most of the day as well.</li>
      <li>My husband and I have used Pantene Fine and were lucky enough to get it from Costo in bulk for years.</li>
      <li>It definitely gives the hair more body, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>This shampoo really gives a good feeling about your hair being cleaned and have no sticky feeling which I observed in previous Pantene products.</li>
      <li>No dyes, very mild scent, light formula with little too residue.  </li>
      <li>big container is huge and some of it leaked out in shipping.</li>
      <li>This is a very generous bottle of shampoo, so I think for the price, it&#x27;s a bargain.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t, however, say I see any real difference in my hair&#x27;s volume.  </li>
      <li>so it looks like I do not have much hair.</li>
      <li>I think the shear weight of the container caused this and not poor packing.</li>
      <li>I regret that I so quickly responded to my first use of this product and the initial praise.</li>
      <li>I have thinning hair as I am getting older.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen the TV commercials, and that&#x27;s the main focus of the message: increased volume.  </li>
      <li>I bought this with the conditioner (which by the way I love) and my hair dried out to the point that while I was gently brushing it it all snapped off and broke.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend the Pro-V Volume Shampoo.</li>
      <li>For me, anyway, it just doesn&#x27;t live up to the promise of adding volume.  </li>
      <li>so there&#x27;s no waste.</li>
      <li>It takes a ton of conditioner though just so my hair isnt in a complete knot when I get out of the shower.</li>
      <li>Recently they changed the product they stocked to Pantene Classic, which we don&#x27;t care for.</li>
      <li>This product is clear, crisp, lathers well with a small amount and does not leave a residue.</li>
      <li>I have fine, thin, oily hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks. If your looking for a daily shampoo and not too concerned about volume, this is meant for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the conditioner (which by the way I love) and my hair dried out to the point that while I was gently brushing it it all snapped off and broke. Hate the shampoo, love the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, great value as an add-on!  No dyes, very mild scent, light formula with little too residue.  I love the size too!</li>
    <li> It definitely gives the hair more body, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I have try other shampoos that were much more expensive without getting the same results.</li>
    <li> It gave my really fine hair great volume. It seemed to last most of the day as well. It smells great too.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo leaves hair very clean and soft!  Will buy again.  Leaves hair manageable without conditioner. One of the best.</li>
    <li> This is a very generous bottle of shampoo, so I think for the price, it&#x27;s a bargain.  I can&#x27;t, however, say I see any real difference in my hair&#x27;s volume.  The shampoo cleans well, and leaves my hair manageable, so it&#x27;s not a disappointment as a shampoo.  For me, anyway, it just doesn&#x27;t live up to the promise of adding volume.  I&#x27;ve seen the TV commercials, and that&#x27;s the main focus of the message: increased volume.  (That&#x27;s what prompted me to order it.)  Does that mean the Pro-V doesn&#x27;t deserve a four-star rating?  Perhaps.  I just considered that maybe on some types of hair, the product would add volume.  Maybe my fine, fair hair is beyond help.  (At least from a shampoo.  For the moment, I&#x27;ll continue to rely on mousses, gels, and sprays.)</li>
    <li> I love Pantene.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  The price isn&#x27;t bad as I only need a little.  I&#x27;m not sure the volume does anything, but it&#x27;s worth a shot to me since the price is usually the same as the regular.</li>
    <li> (From my wife) This is my go-to for shampoo. The vast majority of shampoos give me dandruff or itchiness, but this one has consistently been a great product over the years. I love that it comes with a pump top, it just plain makes it easier to use. Don&#x27;t know how long the pump will last as I have only had this a couple of weeks. If it breaks before the bottle is finished, I will adjust my review.</li>
    <li> I love Pantene shampoo so I was very happy to find this big bottle, and the pump is a blessing! It measures out just the right amount of shampoo. No fumbling with slippery bottles; no over pouring so there&#x27;s no waste. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin, oily hair. This shampoo and conditioner does make my hair have more volume more than any other brand I have tried. It takes a ton of conditioner though just so my hair isnt in a complete knot when I get out of the shower. I&#x27;m not sure it is the best for your hair but yes, it does give good volume. So if you aren&#x27;t too worried about dry and damaged hair it should be great for you but I&#x27;m going to stick with Joico Moisture Recovery. Nothing can beat that.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have used Pantene Fine and were lucky enough to get it from Costo in bulk for years. Recently they changed the product they stocked to Pantene Classic, which we don&#x27;t care for. We found that Amazon stocks the Fine and we can have it shipped for free with Prime. This product is clear, crisp, lathers well with a small amount and does not leave a residue. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone that likes shampoo that rinses well. I also use the Fine conditioner and it works well.</li>
    <li> This choice of Pantene Pro-V Volume Shampoo was an alternative to the Sheer Volume version that my wife prefers but we could not find a supplier for.  It&#x27;s not a good as the Sheer Volume.  By the time it&#x27;s used I hope I can locate a distributor of the other version.</li>
    <li> Use this as alternative to my regular shampoo.  Find it a little drying.  My hair looks its best on the second day rather than the first day after shampooing.  My hair is fine with a bit of wild curl - this shampoo makes it fuzzy.</li>
    <li> I regret that I so quickly responded to my first use of this product and the initial praise. The results did not continue, and I&#x27;m back to the flatness of before.</li>
    <li> Great product that we have learned to expect from Pantene. Highly recommend the Pro-V Volume Shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, my hair feels smooth after using it. I bought it with coupon, so it is even cheaper than walmart!</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair as I am getting older. I love the body and volume this shampoo gives me.&lt;br /&gt;The big container is huge and some of it leaked out in shipping. I think the shear weight of the container caused this and not poor packing.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair too flat. I wear it short so it looks like I do not have much hair. And it is very fly away hair.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it!  (I use it too).</li>
    <li> Love the pump!!...so easy to use on the shower shelf, just pump and use.  No flipping tops, no unscrewing tops, just pump and your done.  And its a great shampoo.  Not harsh, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is one of the good Pantene shampoo I have used in last 5 years. The last one I had has issue with stickiness after washing my hair. I am an asian man and have thick but manageable black hair. This shampoo really gives a good feeling about your hair being cleaned and have no sticky feeling which I observed in previous Pantene products.</li>
