      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to do my own nails at home with out hesitation..</li>
      <li>but we know that&#x27;s what you get with this kind of liquid.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also the kind I&#x27;ve seen salons use in their shops.</li>
      <li>it works as nicely as you would want it too</li>
      <li>I would reccomend This product if you do your own nails as well as others.</li>
      <li>Very strong odor</li>
      <li>Great product to accomplish your favorite full set or fill.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what they use in the nail salons works GREAT</li>

      <li>then anything I have used before love it</li>
      <li>Works great able to do nice professional  acrylic work with this product ......will order again.</li>
      <li>Yet it has a strong strong odor.</li>

      <li>This Acrylic really goes on very smooth</li>
      <li>it is worth the money.</li>
      <li>It matters what supplies you use to make them look good and this stuff worked.....but only for about a week before lifting I even bought the primer to ensure bonding great when first put on but lifts too quick at least it did on my nails.</li>
      <li>I have used several different acrylic liquid monomers from online to the beauty supply place,and this is by far the best I have ever used and for the money you can t beat it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that strong and it holds to any acrylic that I have so far.</li>

      <li>Really like it.</li>
      <li>SO MUCH A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE</li>
      <li>,If anyone wants to try a diffrent Acrylic look no futher.</li>
      <li>As well as i must say the first one i ordered didn&#x27;t get to me, but as soon as i told the seller they shipped out a new one</li>
      <li>and I used less liquid in my dappen dish than any other product I have used in the two years I have been doing my own nails!</li>
      <li>It really last a long time much better than the one&#x27;s</li>
      <li>man i ran out again, gotta run to the beauty supply&amp;#34; So I again as usual looked to amazon for a big bottle,and hoped to find quality as well,and sure enough that&#x27;s what i found in this product, haven&#x27;t heard those words in a while, also planning to purchase two more for longevity.</li>
      <li>So far it has stayed on my nails without any issues!</li>
      <li>This is professional quality and makes doing acrylics at home way easier than buying that stuff at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  </li>

<li> nothing out of the ordinary for monomer.</li>

<li> This was also another buy for my fiance&#x27;, she&#x27;s always using those small bottles and running out, i got tired of hearing these words, &amp;#34;all</li>
<li> but the smell is so dreadful</li>

    <li> this is a great deal for the price and the amount. As well as i must say the first one i ordered didn&#x27;t get to me, but as soon as i told the seller they shipped out a new one and i had it within days. So great product and great customer service.</li>
    <li> I have worked with Sassi Acrylic Liquid before so I know what I was getting.</li>
    <li> I literally got this like 2 days after placing the order. And I just got standard shipping. Works great. I recommend buying the 8oz even though it&#x27;s more expensive it&#x27;s the best deal.</li>
    <li> Great size! I&#x27;m a beginner when it comes to doing acrylic nails myself so this jar was pretty satisfying when I saw it. The only thing I can say is when I pour some of the liquid into my dish some actually went on the side of the jar instead of into my dish. I wasn&#x27;t to happy about that. I suggest using a pipette.</li>
    <li> I had acrylic nails done at a salon for years but I just didn&#x27;t want to pay the money anymore.  I figured I&#x27;ve been getting them done for so long I can do them myself.  I have tried other acrylic liquids that have not worked at all.  My nails lifted within 3 days and using Sassy Acrylic liquid in combination with Creative Nail Design Nail Prime Acid-Free Primer works like a charm.  2 weeks later and my nails have not lifted at all.  This is a great poduct.  Love it!</li>
    <li> gREAT dEAL. Great Price. A must Buy! it is worth the money. Yet it has a strong strong odor. nothing out of the ordinary for monomer.</li>
    <li> it works as nicely as you would want it too but the smell is so dreadful I don&#x27;t ever want to use it again, even when the bottle is closed the smell fills the room up, I had to put it in a ziplock bag and hide it in an enclosed area. I would not recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> This product I like very much. It&#x27;s also the kind I&#x27;ve seen salons use in their shops. It&#x27;s not that strong and it holds to any acrylic that I have so far. Yes! I would order this again.</li>
    <li> Have ordered this product a bunch. Really like it.</li>
    <li> great liquid, does the job. Very strong odor but we know that&#x27;s what you get with this kind of liquid.</li>
    <li> Works great able to do nice professional  acrylic work with this product ......will order again. It&#x27;s nice to do my own nails at home with out hesitation..not knowing what your going to walk out with at the salon. Great product to accomplish your favorite full set or fill.</li>
    <li> This Acrylic really goes on very smooth,If anyone wants to try a diffrent Acrylic look no futher.I&#x27;ve not done a fill-in yet and it&#x27;s my third week.It really last a long time much better than the one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used in the past.It came sealed to perfection and in a timely fashion.I would reccomend This product if you do your own nails as well as others.</li>
    <li> I AM MORE THAN SATISFIED WITH ALL MY PRODUCTS THANK YOU SO MUCH A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE EVERYTHING CAME IN A SHORT TIME.</li>

    <li> I have used several different acrylic liquid monomers from online to the beauty supply place,and this is by far the best I have ever used and for the money you can t beat it. It does nt run all over your nail and I used less liquid in my dappen dish than any other product I have used in the two years I have been doing my own nails! Hands down I will continue to buy and use this product,Highly recommended!!!!!!</li>
