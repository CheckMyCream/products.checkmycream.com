<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have now used the whole 100mil of retinol moisturizing cream and sow vey little difference.  Any other moisturizing cream would do the same. Does it really contain 2.5% retinol? !! Made no difference to wrinkles at all. Wont buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love these products,great company,and first product that has results</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in literally 1 night.  Has a slight acidic odor but nothing awful.  Its a light cream and you can wear it day or night .  My husband just stole it from me.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to really see any difference. That being said, I think it is a really nice moisturizer and will order it again. I love that you get a nice size of it, not a little dinky container that&#x27;s gone before you know it. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Love, love ,love this product I saw results with first application. Moisturizing and anti-aging all in one product. Will have my Husband use it also.</li>
    <li> I purchased OZ Retinol Serum, Retinol Moisturizer and the Ocean Mineral Cleanser at night, and am pleasantly surprised by how well these three products work together.  I was using an extremely expensive natural brand (3-5x the $ of OZ) and while it worked well, I felt a little sick spending so much on skincare.  I normally don&#x27;t switch dramatically because it upsets my skin, but did not experience any trouble at all!  The only problem I have is that I can&#x27;t determine which product is doing the most for me, but I can say this: the cleanser is gentle and thorough, and I believe the serum in combo with the moisturizer have worked together to lighten up some dark spots that just popped up at 40.  My skin is soft, smooth and feels good, and not oily at all (I have combo skin) .  I&#x27;m going through some serious stress right now too, so I can&#x27;t vouch for my eyes yet... but I&#x27;m expecting good things soon.  I will definitely buy this moisturizer again and hoping the serum is back in stock soon!</li>
    <li> I do like this lotion. Leaves your face feeling moisturized. Smell is fine.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. Very pleasant feeling and I like the generous quantity. As for results..We&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals is a very highly regarded company in the cosmetics industry, and for very good reasons. Their products are pure, very well manufactured according to rigid FDA standards, are completely natural and fragrance free, and most important, their products do what they promise to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Retinol Moisturizer comes in a generous 4 oz tube that is very reasonably priced, but then how can you assign a price to a substance that performs as well as this? The very soothing cream contains 2.5% Retinol (71% organic and vegan formula) combined with vegan hyaluronic acid serum and vitamin E - the cocktail for anti-aging results. While other anti-aging moisturizing creams make promises and demonstrate their product with the faces of movie stars, OZ Naturals cares about the user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a day or two after starting to apply this product twice a day (after cleansing and toning and even exfoliating the skin) the results are apparent. Not only does the mirror show you the difference, but the sensation of have rejuvenated skin is something you can feel. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, November 14</li>
    <li> This stuff feels amazing on my skin! So silky but not greasy at all. I can see a difference after only about a week, and just a tiny amount is needed so it will last a long time. Love it, love it, love it!</li>
    <li> Great value for the price/size/concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many options out there.  This is one to try if you haven&#x27;t used products like this before.</li>
    <li> Skin felt softer after one week works great with serum. I could really tell the difference on my neck area, which I&#x27;m lazy about.</li>
    <li> Seems like a good product and good value!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, I have been using at night faithfully for over 2 months and my skin has never looked healthier. I have fair skin and prone to redness which has faded, I also can breakout with moisturizers , not the case with ANY of the Oz Naturals products. I am sold and have purchased several other products in line.</li>
    <li> I started using this at night and it gives me headaches.  Not sure if this is too strong for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product but when I tried this face spray:   http://goo.gl/n05SFS   ...I can&#x27;t believe that something so simple can deliver amazing results! My skin glows and it&#x27;s so much tighter. It also helps fade dark spots.</li>
    <li> My face had noticeably smoother results in a week! Love the texture and (non) scent.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I use it every night and my face feels so smooth. I&#x27;m sure with time there will be more improvements! Gentle too for Retinol, no flakes. :)</li>
    <li> The ingredient list is an absolute joke!  First off, they say 71% organic? That is a work of fiction especially for this formulation. They listed the first ingredient as &amp;#34;Aloe Vera&amp;#34;? Aloe Vera what? Extract, Juice, Powder? A label must specify what form of Aloe Vera it is. They say that Isopropyl Palmitate is Palm Oil?! Another work of fiction!!! Isopropyl Palmitate is an ester of isopropyl alcohol (not from palm) and Palmitic acid ( Palmitic Acid by itself is somewhat derived from Palm oil, but not exactly). Its 100% synthetic!!! That info can be Googled.  Which brings me to the next one of Green Tea....well, green tea what? Extract? Powder? The tea leaves themselves? They MUST specify the form and/or property of green tea being used. I don&#x27;t know what sort of &amp;#34;genius&amp;#34; put that ingredient list together, because it is not even close to regulation. I found it humorous.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Just don&#x27;t over use it, will make you peel.</li>
    <li> So far I really like it.</li>
    <li> I like it-need to use for a little longer to determine how effective it is!</li>
    <li> Instantly made me break out, and terribly. It took a few weeks to normalize again and I didn&#x27;t want to stick with it longer to see if the acne would go away since it was the worst I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the result.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  I doubt that I would buy from this product line again.  Not really seeing the value if there is no change in my skin.</li>
    <li> Second Ingredient is Palm Oil!--Not good for your skin and not good for the planet and environment (Google it) and CHEAP.  First ingredient is Aloe Vera -- fine, you can get that most anywhere.  I&#x27;m not impressed and feel duped by all the hype.  I should have read the info more carefully (ingredients list is in the Q&amp;As).</li>
    <li> After two weeks of application, I don&#x27;t see much difference</li>
    <li> Definitely misleading - this is not pure retinol, it is raetinyl palmitate which is much less effective. Save your money and purchase an item with pure retinol instead. Paula&#x27;s Choice has a 1% retinol product that is amazing I purchased this because I thought I was getting a much stronger product. I will be sending this back for a refund and sticking with Paula&#x27;s Choice products.</li>
    <li> Nice Moisturizer. Leaves your face feeling hydrated.</li>
    <li> Love it....it doesn&#x27;t take very much and I instantly feel so moisturized and my skin feels so soft!</li>
    <li> Still waiting for the results as I have just used it for 2 weeks... texture was good thou &amp; hopefully it can really produce the effects</li>
    <li> Love this product and will be buying again.</li>
    <li> really like the ingredients but don&#x27;t like much the texture: i think that it doesn&#x27;t penetrate very well -but still works!</li>
    <li> This is a phenomenal product with a terrific formulation, generous size and GREAT price.  This is my new hero product...amazing!!  Will continue to buy this cream regularly!  Thanks OZ Naturals! I wanted to write a follow-up comment concerning the accusations other reviewers made regarding &amp;#34; padded/mendacious reviews&amp;#34; or  reviewers being &amp;#34;bought by free products&amp;#34; and &amp;#34; ruining the system for everyone&amp;#34; .  HARSH WORDS.  I&#x27;ve been using this cream over a year now, no one ( Oz Naturals or anyone else) has given me free ANYTHING.  I can&#x27;t speak to the &amp;#34; padded numbers&amp;#34;...(actually, it does seem fishy), but I can and WILL unequivocably attest to the efficacy of this cream.  It&#x27;s fantastic!!  My skin loves it, my pores are diminished, fine lines gone, the integrity &amp; suppleness of my face is clearly noticeable...even my three teenagers have taken note &amp; asked me what I&#x27;ve &amp;#34; had done&amp;#34; .   Nothing, just Timeless VitC Serum, CoQ10 serum, and Oz Naturals retinol moisturizer.  My skin looks better now, at 52 then it did when I was 35.  That&#x27;s MY truth.  Nobody buys or corrupts MY integrity, and I resented the crap out of the implication.    This is a STELLAR product, hands down.</li>
    <li> Very nice feeling facial cream</li>
    <li> I use this at night mainly with the Sea Infused Moisturizer for day time. I believe I see reduced evidence in wrinkles around my lips and mouth as well as forehead already,</li>
    <li> I have only used a week; but I am very pleased with the product.  I have been a renova/trentinoin cream user for 15 years with excellent results; however, the cream is getting quite expensive.    I am updating my review.  After using OZ naturals retinol cream for two months, I am extremely pleased with this product.  I also purchased the retinol serum, and I alternate both products.  I can definitely tell a difference with my skin after using their products--smaller pores, clearer skin, etc.</li>
    <li> This does moisturize and soften the skin, not sure yet if it eliminates the wrinkles, had only used it for over a month.</li>
    <li> In the winter my skin is always a little drier so am only using the cream every other day.</li>
    <li> Nothing extraordinary, like all other moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I put this on my face, arms, and hands a few nights a week before going to bed.  In my opinion this stuff &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; in that it does seem to moisturize (&amp;#34;plump up&amp;#34;) the skin, and possibly even out the tone (reduce splotches).  The bottom line is that I think this stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tube lasts a very long time, and when it runs out I&#x27;ll probably reorder.</li>
    <li> This makes my face feel amazing! Not oily like alot if moisterizers. First time I&#x27;ve used it and it already feels nice and tight. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a,great product i love the fact it has retinol in it for such a low price. I have bought other products with retinol that seemed to be ok for alot more money. I really love this product and i highly recomend this product to anyone that asks me, i also have recomended this to a couple friends.</li>
    <li> When I received this moisturizer, I was immediately impressed with the size of the product.  I am usually expecting a small bottle, but this was a large quantity.  I was immediately drawn to this product because I have been very pleased with other products from this line.  I appreciate they contain natural ingredients and don&#x27;t test on animals.  I also like this cream is made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream contains retinol and Vit C.  I usually apply two separate products, but liked it was almost two products in one.  The cream went on very smooth and absorbed quickly.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any dramatic wrinkle decreases, but my skin does have a nice glow and feel after application.  I have not had any issues with this cream and look forward to seeing further results in the future.  I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> This is a great cream. I just love how it makes my skin llook and feel. Best I&#x27;ve used, at a good price.</li>
    <li> Love this! Not greasy and feels really moisurizing.</li>
    <li> did not work as said on my skin. dried it out too much</li>
    <li> It is okay -- it does make your skin nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Love this and all oz natural products</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few days along with the vitamin c cleanser.....and I can see a significant difference in my skin tone. This is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a few weeks now and I like it.  Skin feels soft and moisturized, I use it as part of my night routine.  The size is great, you can be liberal with the application.</li>
    <li> I have been waiting 2 months to write a review of this product.  I am 27 years old, years of sun damage on my pale freckled skin, and I&#x27;ve been struggling with moderate cystic adult acne for the last 2 years. I use this product with the Vit C serum (helps fade scars well) and the HA serum. Two months ago I was crying over my skin, dreaded leaving the house and interacting with people and now my skin is still not perfect but IT HAS IMPROVED SO MUCH that I can have a normal life again and feel pretty and confident again.    Patience is important with this product.  I started using it every night initially and then my acne got even worse (SO BAD) and I stopped using it for a week. Then i tried using the product once every three nights, then every other night, then two out of every three nights, then finally every night--used this way i experienced only slow steady improvement with no major flare ups.  I took pictures each week so I could see the progress---it was slow.  Be patient, use less product, don&#x27;t use more because it does not help it work better!  When i need additional moisturizer on my face in certain areas before bed I put on FAB Ultra Repair cream on those areas (around eyes, forehead) over the retinol moisturizer once it has absorbed into the skin.    So the acne--while not completely gone, no longer makes me look like faces of meth and can be hidden with concealer now--but also, I&#x27;ve never had great skin, I have been mistaken for much older than my age countless times although my body is in great shape--this stuff has improved my complexion and overall appearance so much over the past two months--I am really shocked with I look in the mirror and instead of feeling like my skin ages me, I feel like my skin is getting more and more beautiful and even.    Of course, with any product there are no guarantees and rarely any perfect solution, but if your goal is \\&quot;improvement\\&quot; I highly recommend this product and I recommend patience when using it (don&#x27;t use it every night, work up to every night use).    Oh I did not receive any free samples or anything for this review, I just read the reviews and ordered the product.        ***Update: 2/26 - This product + birth control &#x3D; NO MORE ACNE and beautiful skin, faded scars.     Also, this tube of product has lasted me months! And I&#x27;m not sure, if like retinol it needs to be replaced sooner than it runs out to be its most effective. Any one know how long this product&#x27;s active ingredients are actually active for?</li>
    <li> The best cream I have ever used.  A small amount will cover your face and neck.  It rich and leaves your skin tight and glowing</li>
    <li> Have used Retin- A prescription in the past. This does that, but does not cause flaking, peeling, redness, irritation that the prescription does.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I have oily skin. I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week now, and notice a great difference when using it. It does not dry my skin out at all, but it does help to make it not so oily. I use it daily, and sometimes pair it with Sonya Dakar Flash Facial. These two products make a great combo.</li>
    <li> After only a week of using this my skin feels soft and supple, lines and wrinkles are less noticeable</li>
    <li> good  moisterizer for aging skin.  Combine it with OZ naturals Vitamin C-organic.  For best results apply a good serum after aplying the moisterizer.&lt;br /&gt;First: the vitamin C.  Second: the retinol misterizer.  Third: the serum</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this product. You will get actual results using oil of Olay. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price, visible results</li>
    <li> Feels good on my face as good as any high end product I have used</li>
    <li> After using the product a few times my skin became red, it burned, I had blurry vision and a headache (after each use, used it 2x) after lots of research I came to the conclusion that I&#x27;m one of those people that has a bad reaction to retnol. I&#x27;m sure there are tons of people that can benefit from this moisturizer, unfortunately it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> Just to be clear I literally hate trying new moisturizers because my skin is so sensitive and I always seem to breakout. Please make sure you read this entire review and dont stop after the next sentence! Of course my skin did indeed have a breakout BUT it was a small one... but what happened after is where the MIRACLE happened!!! It was like every single poor on my face was gone after the breakout- my skin was literally GLOWING and the texture of my skin is so incredibly soft- to the point even my hubby noticed. Even with getting a facial once a month my skin has never looked this good. Normally when you see the word &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; on a product you instantly think ... &amp;#34;yeah right&amp;#34; but I assure you- this product does exactly what it says and more. I&#x27;m actually shocked how much I like ... no... LOVE it. Goodbye to overpriced products that don&#x27;t deliver. The price, the quality and the impressive results are above and beyond what I expected. Thank you for making such a good product line - every single item I have tried I love!!!</li>
    <li> Seem to be working. Fine line less visible.</li>
    <li> I received this 1 day before Mother&#x27;s day and it was right on time. I gifted it to my grandmother and so far she has said good things about it. She intends to use it every other day or so. According to her she likes that it leave a greasy feeling behind after using it. Nothing like getting something that is supposed to be healthy for your skin and being grossed out by the product. Overall the smell isn&#x27;t too bad. Right out of the package it&#x27;s a hit!</li>
    <li> The product went on smooth, absorbed well and basically did the job as advertised.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s winter here in the south, the heat is always on , and my skin was getting dry. This arrived , and after only two days use , I see a complete transformation . The skin on my face is hydrated , soft , and some redness I had seen before completely disappeared , as did a few blemishes . I am even awakening without the puffiness under my eyes . I think I&#x27;m sold! I will continue to use regularly , and continue to evaluate , but I&#x27;m excited because I think I found my new moisturizer . This is the first Oz product I have tried, and I did, based on the reviews. This is also a great size , for the price , and I can see it lasting quite a while.</li>
    <li> I am new to the OZ Naturals line. The attraction for me was the all natural ingredients they use.  I&#x27;m very particular about using hygiene products that do not contain harmful chemicals or endocrine disruptors.  I started using the C Serum and Retinol Moisturizer together about three months ago.  I have been very pleased  with what they  are  doing for my skin.  It looks and feels clearer, healthier and smoother than it has in years.</li>
    <li> Really liked the way it made my skin look and feel!</li>
    <li> feels good. not using it long enough to discuss results</li>
    <li> so this really works... i&#x27;m always so hopeful when buying online just to be left w disappointing results and wonder why things work for others but not me and this one is not the case. I have seen lines get much smaller and love it! my only suggestion is use it wisely - I started with once a day and felt like teenager in a week, not because of perfect skin but because of acne that visited me like its High School over again, now i use it once a week and seems to be good enough</li>
    <li> Although is advertised as having a higher level of retinol than a product I was previously using (and can&#x27;t find anymore) I am not getting the same results as the old product.</li>
    <li> I absolutley love this serum it is wonderful I noticbly seen a difference in a weeks time</li>
    <li> Nothing change to my skin. Even worst!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, does what it claims</li>
    <li> This product lives up to its claims.  Excellent and economical.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT LEFT MY SKIN VERY DRY AND IRRRATED..</li>
    <li> Super Youth Retinol lotion is one of my very favorite products...I have absolutely seen a decrease in fine lines &amp; my skin is smoother &amp; more even toned in general...I layer over OZ Naturals Retinol serum &amp; feel like I&#x27;ve truly found a key to looking more youthful</li>
    <li> Amazing cream. Thank you</li>
    <li> Incredible moisturizer! Leaves my face feeling softer and makeup goes on smoother for a very natural look. So glad I starting using OZ Naturals, wish I would have started sooner!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help with fine lines and love what it&#x27;s done for my face. I feel fresh and youthful!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is very rich &amp; creamy. No drying out the skin or adverse reactions. No breakouts. Gentle.  After a few weeks of use, my skin is softer and smoother, looking more even toned. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. This is my first purchase from OZ Naturals. I did not receive this item from them for a review. I&#x27;m very pleased with all of the OZ Naturals products that I&#x27;m using currently (eye gel, toner &amp; this moisturizer). I will re-purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> Love Oz Naturals products and this one is no different. I have noticed a real difference in my skin since I started using it especially with fine lines. Repeat buyer. Strong recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizing cream, from the initial use my face has really felt really soft and there is a wonderful look to it.&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkles are just starting to look less prominent, yeah for me.&lt;br /&gt;Try it if it is working this well for me just imagine how it could work for you.</li>
    <li> My skin is so dry from using this. I&#x27;ve begun to alternate it with a different moisturizer which has seemed to help. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and have noticed some results but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of this lotion or serum I&#x27;m using underneath it. Maybe the combo of both has helped. It&#x27;s really just the texture of my skin seems smoother but nothing much more than that.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for the winter.. keeps skin hydrated and soft and smooth .. i will buy this again</li>
    <li> Fantastic cream! Will be using this all the time now. My skin looks amazing! Very easy to order and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I just love the OZ Naturals products!  I tend to have dry skin and am beginning to worry about signs of aging, I can already see the difference in my skin.  I look forward to what the continued use of the products will do!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer, very smooth and makes my skin feel very nice. You only need a little bit for your whole face. It&#x27;s a little overpriced for how much you get.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer - lightweight, absorbs quickly, has no scent. Love the package too, there&#x27;s no waste or contamination of the product. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 30 and don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet but I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now and have seen differences in my skin from pictures I took recently and compared with ones from 4 years ago.  My skin looks smoother and still just as firm.  I like that this is unscented and does not feel sticky.  I will keep using it to maintain my youth.</li>
    <li> Lotion was moisturizing, didn&#x27;t see any retinol relatrd results or side effects. Broke out my exzema on my hands pretty fierce.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last 2 months and haven&#x27;t seen the improvement I was waiting for. I have tried many retinol products so I know what to expect and this product is not strong enough to make a difference to the skin. It moisturizes the skin but that is as far as it goes. I have an skin care website and I know what I&#x27;m talking about. In my opinion there are far better over the counter retinol products on the market and I&#x27;m surprised that this product have such a good reviews. Are these impartial reviews? Who knows ...</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is the best!  I&#x27;m noticing a difference!</li>
    <li> Nice retinol moisturizer, none irritating and no smell. Is helping to even skin tone and fine line.  Received this product for exchange for honest reveiw.  The only reason i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I&#x27;m not a fan of the form of retinol used.</li>
    <li> I absolutely have noticed a huge difference in my skin since I started using the Super Youth product with retinol by Oz Naturals. I was given this product for free for an honest opinion and was amazed when I got complimented for looking radiant. I truly would recommend this product. I think you will be pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Over rated at best ! Total scam . This is a walmart quality product at best . Don&#x27;t waste your money on this or anything from the line . Plan and simple it doesn&#x27;t work and low quality .</li>
    <li> The cream feels really good. After a week of use the hydration is remarkable . The face looks less shiny and feels really good. This cream is getting a glow in my face that I did not have before and feels great and is great under make up</li>
    <li> Awesome facial moisturizer! The lotion is thick, scentless, and non-sticky. I noticed my face was smoother. Also my hyperpigmented patches seem to have lighten and my overall skin tone is much more even. Also, my wrinkles have reduced in appearance after a couple of weeks. My skin is absolutely glowing! Would recommend this product for those who want smoother, evener skin tone, with less wrinkles!</li>
    <li> great product! If you want to keep your skin looking fresh without the dull sallow look from the build up of dead skin on the surface, this is a great mild product to do just that. I have oily acne prone skin, and so when I have a build up of dead skin, I will use a little extra morning &amp; night to get a gentle peel. Gives you a glow, without red peeling skin like Retin A does.</li>
    <li> Almost no results. Didn&#x27;t improve fine lines around my mouth or help my hyper pigmentation. I&#x27;m 33 so you&#x27;d think I would see some results, right? Been using this now in tandem with the vitamin C and wishing it worked better.</li>
    <li> Too drying for winter use</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer now. No fake perfumey smell. A great product and reasonably priced. i love how smooth this moisturizer is going on. And I cannot say enough about Oz Naturals customer service. Quick replies and answers all my questions.  I love all of their products.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t reduce any kind of wrinkles. Not worth trying</li>
    <li> This is the best my skin has felt and looked in years.</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer! Got as a sample to leave feedback. leaves kin feeling hydrated and smooth</li>
    <li> This product goes on smooth and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on my face but a couple of hours after applying it, my skin feels dry.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a month so it may be too soon to see any improvement in fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this! Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> So or dr oz.  nothing to rave about.  Will not rebut</li>
    <li> Great daily moisturizer!  Love it and quick results! I&#x27;ve used several times and got my last one free just for posting a truthful review of how great it is!  So simple and not really even fair because the product is so good I&#x27;d pay double!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Oz Naturals products for a few months. My skin feels hydrated and firmer. It looks better, brighter and plumper. The eye gel immediately softened the area around my eyes, the retinol, hyaluronic acid and vitamin C are all working together to change my skin. It is healthier and happier.</li>
    <li> This cream was &amp;#34;just ok&amp;#34;. I had high hopes for it with the retinol, but it has not delivered. It tingled the first day when I applied it but it just seems like a regular face cream. Probably won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Face feels so soft and moistened after I apply. I am 31 yrs and using this every night to prevent wrinkles. I love how a small amount goes along ways. It will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Time will tell on final results.</li>
    <li> Very good. Notice improvement almost immediately</li>
    <li> Not sure yet, been using it for only 2 weeks</li>
    <li> Made my skin breakout.</li>
    <li> I received my order just on time and faster than I expected. I&#x27;ve been usin this cream for 4 nights and I love it. My skin feels moist and soft . I used as night cream. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell for sure, I will know more in 30 days.</li>
    <li> I guess my skin is pretty sensitive, started peeling after 1 day of use. If you have sensitive skin you may want to reconsider.</li>
    <li> Ok Ladies... I have waited until the dead of winter to write my review because I KNOW how my skin reacts to the cold and the multiple steps I have had to resort to in past years to deal with the DRY, flaky facial skin.  I am very pleased to share that this moisturizer is the best I have ever used and I have purchased many different expensive brands in my day. This winter I have not had to go to Plan B or Plan C to either keep my skin soft or to address the flakiness.  My skin has remained hydrated throughout the cold winter months this year.&lt;br /&gt;There is something great going on with the texture and tone of my face since I began using 3 of the OZ Natural products.  Using the Vit C serum , the HA serum and this moisturizer is providing visible results.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I was faithfully using my Stem Light and my Facial Muscle Massager and decided to stop using them as an experiment and surprisingly my face has only fallen a tad.  Before using these 3 products if I stopped my facial exercises I saw big time sagging within a week.  So something GOOD is coming out of using these products.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy and very satisfied.  Want to try the Toner soon as I have one deep age spot that the Vit C has lightened but has not taken away and I am wondering if the Toner with GA in it would bring more fading.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this comment is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;Regards --</li>
    <li> Updating this review after rating negatively with only 4 weeks use.&lt;br /&gt;You need to use this for 5 - 6 months to really notice a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;Has lightened brown sun spots on face in conjunction with Vitamin C serium.</li>
    <li> Really impressed with this product. I tried it because i was trying to find a more natural, cost effective brand. I was pleasantly surprised with the texture, move-abiity (if that&#x27;s a word) and scent of this product. I was only buying to use as a night cream, but it is works perfectly under my makeup. I have noticed a great improvement to the texture and brightness of my skin, I use the vitamin -c serum in the mornings... Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a really good moisturizer,  I use it every other night, and wake up with smooth, glowing skin. However, if you are looking for this to be your number 1 Retinol treatment, this is not what you&#x27;re looking for. I do love it as a non irritating moisturizer.  Highly recommend! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I really like the texture.  Absorbs fast.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I recommend this for anyone who wants to look young again...that&#x27;s what my hubby says.</li>
    <li> makes your skin a bit dry and need a moisturizer after</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> I previously used Neutrogena&#x27;s night moisturizer with retinol, with excellent results. So I was excited to purchase this one, along with their Vitamin C serum. After 3 months, I noticed no difference. Now that I think about it, I have actually broken out more than before I started using these products. My skin also looks more dull and uneven in tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that the cream inside the tube I got is yellow...not sure if it is supposed to be like that..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: I would do some research before purchasing from Oz Naturals. Don&#x27;t believe all those rave &amp;#34;unbiased&amp;#34; reviews!!</li>
    <li> I only use natural products on my skin.  I love this moisturizer. After only a couple of months my face is so smooth.  I am over fifty and don&#x27;t have to wear make up if I don&#x27;t want to.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for over a month now and absolutely love the way my skin looks and feels!  I have definitely noticed a decrease In fine wrinkles, and my skin feels more smooth and supple.  I like that there are no fragrances and it does not feel heavy or greasy going on.  I use it in combination with the Vitamin C serum in the morning and  Hyaluronic  Acid serum at night.  I am always a very tough sell on anti-aging products.  I have tried several products over the years such as the Mary Kay Timewise line and could not tell any difference in my skin.  Oz Naturals is a product line that I will continue to use!</li>
    <li> Good product! it does refine aging lines in the face, but only a tiny bit. I have y&#x3D;used this product  now for 4 months. it does not help with&lt;br /&gt;aging skin all that much, but it does give the skin a more youthful glow, when you add the vitamin C Serum to the face after application of the OZ&lt;br /&gt;Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the product, even though it does not refine aging lines all that much. It is a good product and I will reorder it again.</li>
    <li> Very happy.  can only use every other day.  Does dry out skin.  Wrinkles do fade.  I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I just started using OZ Naturals Retinol Moisturizer and I can all reedy tell a different in my skin. My face looks firm and I can see less lines. This is a great moisturizer with Vitamin E and B5. It has 2.5% Retinol and Hyaluronic Acid this seems to work wonders for my skin! I  got this for free for the purpose of my reviewing. I think it is one of the best moisturizers on the market and I have tried a lot of them. It is great for a older person that wants there skin to look SUPER YOUNG again. I know that I have found youth in a tub.</li>
    <li> Its been a week since i have been using this. My husband and i can visibly see the difference in my skin. I was scared of using this product as i have a very sensitive and oily and acne prone skin. My skin is showing positive results and I am happy so far :)</li>
    <li> Loved it... definitely would buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about 2 months ago. I really love this stuff. I finally decided to start taking care of my skin. I&#x27;m 47 so maybe it&#x27;s too late :) Anyway I purchased the OZ skincare line and I&#x27;m not sorry I did. Just a few minutes in the morning and you&#x27;re ready to go. I don&#x27;t use base makeup anymore. I use this stuff and maybe a little concealer. This moisturizer is great. I use it after the toner. My face feels clean and fresh all day. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Use this at night after serum.  Think I see less wrinkles especially around my forehead.  I like the way it feels too.</li>
    <li> works well on my skin (mixture oily and dry), helps with acne without over drying the face. great product</li>
    <li> The false advertising alone is enough to warrant a one star review for this product.  Despite the labeling on the tube, this product contains absolutely no retinol, much less 2.5%.  Not that most people would want a 2.5% retinol because that would likely be too much for even the least sensitive skin types.  No matter what spin or lingo this company attempts to use to justify their false labeling, retinol and retinyl palmitate are not the same ingredient and do not have the same results on the skin.  Both are very good skin care ingredients but retinol is a much more powerful anti-aging ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company&#x27;s claims that natural is better are also misleading given that a skin care ingredient isn&#x27;t good or bad because it&#x27;s synthetic or &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s good or bad because research has either shown it to have positive or negative results on skin.  And regardless of what this or any other company says about their products being &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, there&#x27;s very little if anything natural about what these ingredients need to go through to transform them into a product that is pleasing to the consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only positive for this product is that the company has wisely left out the irritating ingredients like witch hazel that are found in so many of their other products.  So, if you want to support a company who false advertises, you can purchase this product and you&#x27;ll end up using a fairly good moisturizer (albeit way overpriced for what it is).  There are much cheaper and much more effective options out there.  And if you are truly looking for an anti-aging moisturizer, consult your dermatologist.</li>
    <li> This is a very disappointing product. In fact, this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t even contain retinol. It&#x27;s made with retinyl palmitate, which is an ester of retinol. The palmitate part is a 16-carbon tail that greatly attenuates the penetration and absorption of retinol. My guess is that OZ Naturals simply doesn&#x27;t have the technology to stabilize retinol, so they use this derivative of it. With real retinol product even at 0.5% (Skinceuticals Retinol 0.5), I still cannot tolerate daily use. (I use three times a week.) But with this product, I can just jump to daily use with no reaction at all. Some people may think this is good, if they don&#x27;t understand retinol. But in reality, this just means that the retinyl palmitate is much inferior. If you want real results, use real retinol products, not this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great! I use it together with Oz Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum. After 3 days I could notice the difference - face, neck and decolte - after a week my skin looked so smooth, so shiny and bright!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. My acne is starting to clear up and it leaves my skin solo soft.</li>
    <li> I like the way the moisturizer feels on my skin; makes my skin feel soft and smooth, without the greasy feeling. It&#x27;s too early to tell if it will fade a few sun spots on my face, but so far it helps minimize my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> As someone with combo oily/normal skin, I was astonished by how well this moisturized and helped balance out my face&#x27;s moisture. Admittedly, I never used a moisturizer specifically for face, always used an all purpose lotion (nothing too heavily perfumed) and always had to rinse my face midway through my workday because my face just became so oily. With this, I see no such need. I&#x27;m 25 and prone to stress related acne and also have very very fine lines forming around my eyes. There is no change with the fine lines, but I&#x27;m pretty pleased with my face&#x27;s new chemistry. BTW, I also use the Super Youth Eye Gel and the Professional Correcting Serum along with this product.</li>
    <li> My age spot  on my right cheek has faded!  It is not totally gone but I can see that it had faded tremendously.  This is a great product to use if you have age spots on your face. I am really impressed for not having a lot of expectation.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so I was kind of iffy at trying this. I must say I highly recommend this cream to anyone after using it! It left my skin feeling radiant and super soft! It definately left my skin feeling firm too and I will use this product from here on out! I love the feeling I get when I use it. Best retinol product by far!!</li>
    <li> I am seriously in love with this lotion. I use it with several of the Oz  Naturals serums and my skin looks better than it has in years.</li>
    <li> Great product I&#x27;ve really seen my pores stinking and even tone on face. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now.</li>
    <li> I have used this for 5 days along with the OZ Naturals Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum and the OZ Naturals Best Naturals Eye Gel...I am already seeing results with decreasing visibility of crow&#x27;s feet, smile lines, and brow lines.  At age 45, this is the first product that I can say really does what it claims.  I have used department store brands, designer cosmetic store top sellers, and top line drug store products, and none can compare to the results of these 3 products.  As a reader of Product Reviews, I never post a review...until now...this is worth the money because it delivers what it claims to do for your skin.</li>
    <li> After using this for almost 3 months, I decided to write a review. I do not like this product and do not recommend it. I didn&#x27;t notice a more youthful look or any positive results. Granted, I&#x27;m in my 20s and don&#x27;t have severe wrinkling taking place, but I thought that my skin tone would at least look more even with regular use. Instead, my face and neck became sensitive with use. You really do need to wear sunscreen EVERY time you put this on when going outdoors because the retinol sort of thins the top layer of your skin, making it very susceptible to damage from the sun. Also, do NOT make the mistake of facial waxing when using this product. My face was destroyed for several weeks. The top layer of my skin came off when I tried to wax my eyebrows. Yes, I guess this could be considered my fault, but there was no warning that this could happen. After waxing and being in severe pain, a quick Google search informed me that you can&#x27;t wax when using products with retinol.</li>
    <li> This was used or only filled half way when I received it. Would not buy again. Very disappointed after seeing great reviews. Beware:(</li>
    <li> had a reaction to it and sent it back....not good for me!</li>
    <li> I really, really, really like this moisturizer!  First off, it has Vitamin C, algae keratin, and blueberry extract... great for building collagen!  Secondly, it pairs perfectly with Oz Naturals 2.5% Retinol Correcting Serum.  The two make my skin feel tighter and look radiant!  I use the combo nightly and the moisturizer with a sunscreen in the morning.  Finally, a little goes a long way which makes this a great value!  Buy it!!</li>
    <li> Super Youth Retinol Moisturizer is my favorite OZ Naturals product so far. After using this moisturizer for only a few weeks,  my skin looks and feels smoother and I can see fading of brown spots.  It&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy feeling and the generous 4 ounce size is a bargain!</li>
    <li> Very nice moisturizer, I use at night and it goes on beautifully, feels nourishing, very moisturizing, and not the least bit greasy. I really like this product, and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Using it day and night</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It.came quickly and I love it.so.far! :-)</li>
    <li> Oh. I do love this!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very rich and feels great</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for the money! Goes on well and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky.</li>
    <li> so far I really like it,I haven&#x27;t used it very long, but I hope that it will live up to my expectation</li>
    <li> This product + the Vitamin C serum &#x3D; glowing skin!  HOWEVER--- I felt like this did absolutely nothing for dryness or help wrinkles.  By the time I finish this tube, yes, I&#x27;ve had a nice run but my wrinkles are truly worse in the long run unless I combat the dryness every. single. day.</li>
    <li> Just starting using this on my face after cleansing at night, no huge improvements that I notice (so far), but I like the way my skin feels in the morning.</li>
    <li> clogged my pores too much!</li>
    <li> This company uses the name OZ without the consent of Dr. Oz.  Cannot support this company. Too shady for me.</li>
    <li> Good product but don&#x27;t expect miracles from it.  Good moisturizer but fine lines still there after two weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Using along with oz naturals serum and toner. I love it! Noticed a difference after first use.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff! I actually cut open the tube when I ran out while I waited for my next delivery, I would recommend over many other high-end and more expensive retinol creams. The wrinkles on my forehead smoothed out significantly within two months of use. It&#x27;s also a generously sized tube and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> With drawers full of almost completely-used moisturizers (name a brand, cheap or pricey and I have it) and prescription grade retinol products that were either greasy, too strong/weak, thick/thin, ineffective, I tried this product, resigned to toss it into the drawer in a month, too. Skeptical of anything that claims it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;BEST&amp;#34; (thought I&#x27;d love to prove them wrong!), I bought a tube. I used it daily without expectations of a miracle...or even noticeable difference, because I liked how it blended into my skin, made it feel (lush but very slightly taut, and very smooth). Though I use it nightly, when I use it in the daytime, my foundation (Lancome) goes on without a problem. I started off using too much product (it&#x27;s a huge tube!) but over time I&#x27;ve found less works just as well. I use it on my face, neck, and back of my hands. Now, after 5 months of use, even my husband can see a difference in my neck, face, and chest skin tone, lightening of pigmentation/dark spots, tightening of pores and smoothness--and he notices that sort of thing! My girlfriends all remarked on the changes as well. One of them asked for a tube as her birthday gift, so now she&#x27;s been using it for 2 months and loves it! I started using this at age 66, so my deep wrinkles are set, but my finer wrinkling only diminished when I had lots of moisturizer on. Now, even without the moisturizer, the fine lines are gone! I&#x27;m afraid to stop using it...ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m aware than not everyone will have my results, but I hope they stick with this product and see what happens. I was 99% doubtful, 1% hopeful, and am now a 100% believer. I almost hate saying this, but turns out for me, it is the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just reread my review and realize it reads like the product is &#x27;too good to be true&#x27;. Well, my hands are still quite pigmented and spotty and wrinkly as ever (I swim daily all year-round), and this product is pricey (unless you use it sparingly, which is to say that if you allow it to soak right into towel-dry skin...I don&#x27;t use toners...then apply more and it feels damp or like it&#x27;s sitting on your skin, you know you don&#x27;t need more than the initial amount). So it hasn&#x27;t worked everywhere I&#x27;ve tried it. But for my face/neck/chest, this product works!llow it to soak right into towel-dry skin...I don&#x27;t use toners...then apply more and it feels damp or like it&#x27;s sitting on your skin, you know you don&#x27;t need more than the initial amount). So it hasn&#x27;t worked everywhere I&#x27;ve tried it. But for my face/neck/chest, this product works!</li>
    <li> Sorry I put the wrong review for this. Amazon doesn&#x27;t show the products in the right order. I just started using this. I love it. I love the smell and the consistency of the cream. I am oily, but it leaves my face feeling silky smooth and moisturized without that heavy greasy shiny face look. I am not sure it has enough retinol to make a difference, so only time will tell. So far, I like. Love the tube!</li>
    <li> If you just look at my skin, I breakout.  I have used Retin A prescription so I do know how my face reacts to Retin A and I can notice effects after a few weeks at .05%.  Not sure what to think of Retinol Moisturizers and think that if I truly want some strength and effects of Vitamin A, I will have to stick with perceptions.&lt;br /&gt;Pros- I do not breakout from this.  Good as a  face moisturizer.  The tube is larger then it appears on the photo.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- Not noticing the Retin A after 6 months of bi weekly use.  Would be nice if it had SPF protection.</li>
    <li> waste of money. do not buy !</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with triple action vitamin c serum.  I am 47 years old with acne prone skin. Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;Will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer, not greasy or heavy. Feels like my make up goes on really smooth after applying this. My only thing is it doesnt have an spf which would would of made this product 5 star</li>
    <li> Another Superior Product! Feels good. Smells fine- not perfumey- not like it&#x27;s full of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;But the best part is that it did NOTHING negative to my face- which I see A LOT, and after a few days I honestly went back to the pics on my phone to compare blemish scars.... And I can see a difference!</li>
    <li> Love this ptoduct..very mild but it absorbs  to your skin. I noticed  when wearing makeup before after 4 hrs my face tense  to flakes. But now even after 10 hrs still  flawless</li>
    <li> this stuff goes on smooth, but skin does not feel smooth after application. good for nite.  but t does a heck of a job  very good product.  bought it on a trial  best trial i ever had</li>
    <li> I use it daily &amp; i looove it</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad moisturizer but very heavy. It takes quite a while to absorb into the skin so i would recommend using this only as a night cream. I had purchased this as a daily moisturizer to wear under my make up but I don&#x27;t see that happening.</li>
    <li> Honestly dont see a difference. Been using it for months!</li>
    <li> Helps your skin stay fresh</li>
    <li> I still look my age and beauty has not surprised me when I look in the mirror in the morning, but I guess I wasn&#x27;t buying a miracle, at least not for this price.  haha  It seems to be a good product and I have no complaints.  The good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t just soften my skin like so many products do.  I prefer a firmer look and while this doesn&#x27;t really do that, it doesn&#x27;t disappoint either.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Highly Recommended!!</li>
    <li> Love this. Just about a week of use and already notice a difference. Went and ordered the eye gel too!</li>
    <li> I like the moisturizer that this product gives but the 2.5 retinol isn&#x27;t nearly as strong as my 1% SkinCeuticals</li>
    <li> Appeared to dry out my skin. Perhaps better for younger skin type</li>
    <li> Really love this cream! Even noticed some lines disappearing!!</li>
    <li> Love it already! It has only been 3 days since I have tried this but, I can definitely say this product is working! I have been using this each evening and morning.  Luckily, I have not had any sensitivity.  It sinks totally into my face &amp; neck, leaving it soft, firm &amp; plump! I can hardly wait to see even more visible improvement with time!&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to be able to get some samples of other products in this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I must commend the super fast processing and shipping of my first order..Incredible!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer.  Didn&#x27;t notice any wrinkle shrinkage, but then I&#x27;m old.</li>
    <li> I don’t know if it’s the combination of all these great oz products that I’ve been using or just the retinol moisturizer  but my wrinkles and fine lines have definitely been minimized.  My skin feels firmer  and looks brighter.  For these past  few days  my skin did not experience any peeling, redness or flakiness. The only thing I wish  is that it had a better scent. I received  this  product  for  free  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review.</li>
    <li> Wonderful moistureizer. Immediate notice in hydration and lines seem softer</li>
    <li> Great retinol moisturizer! I would suggest only using during the evening since it is thick and makes your skin oily. The morning after, my skin looks rested and even toned!</li>
    <li> works pretty good.  little thick for summer use.</li>
    <li> My face didn&#x27;t tingle or burn so I wondered if it really had retinol in it.</li>
    <li> It is smooth and rich, but it&#x27;s not absorbed quickly into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The odor is not fresh.</li>
    <li> Was expecting more from the product than what I experienced.  Reviews were high but I feel it is very hard to find facial products that do what is said the are suppose to do.</li>
    <li> Not better than or worse than products used before.</li>
    <li> The Retinol Moisturizer is amazing -- my dark spots on my face (and hands) significantly reduced within 1 month.  And it doe not dry out the skin, although I do use a light oil over it.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome moisturizer that I use after the Hyaluronic Acid Serum. Its not heavy and does not make my skin oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months now. I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m going to do when it&#x27;s gone. I could feel the difference immediately. I just turned 39 and was ID&#x27;d just last week. I would recommend this product, for men and women.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly, non-invasive feeling formula, I haven&#x27;t felt dry or itchy. Seems to be working great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE: OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel, OZ Nat Hyaluronic Acid Serum, and OZ Nat Super Youth Retinol Moisturizer (daytime or night time).  Of course I only use OZ Naturals Products ALONE with &amp;#34;Oil Of Olay 7 in One Total Effects Moisturizer&amp;#34; (for daytime-under makeup). I have oily and some semi-dry skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I also make Green Tea Astringent.  (&amp;#34;Green Tea Classic&amp;#34; w/ caffiene -- boil 2 bags as directed with Kentwood &amp;#34;Spring Bottled Water&amp;#34;, let cool-may add more spring water to make a lil less concentrated/make it last longer.  It will last approx 1-2 wks if kept in fridge. Smell to see if rancid-green tea doesn&#x27;t last too long!), Then I transfer to a spray bottle, put in fridge, get really cold ---- I use astringent with a cotton ball works wonders!!!  Tightens the skin on my entire face -- esp around the eyes ! It also helps reduce dark circles, wrinkles and puffiness -- I prefer a natural astringent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I also use coconut oil all over my face and Vitamin E and Rose Hip Seed oil under my eyes for night time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say after crying for the last 8yrs after my fiance died...Jon, My Love Rest in Paradise...I miss you so much my love! .....&lt;br /&gt;My face looks awesome!!!  I had many deep wrinkles from crying so many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched for a few months before I was able to find all the natural info I listed.  Thank you so much for the natural facial products!!!  Its so hard to find anything whether its facial, body or food that does have all kinds of unwanted and harmful ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DENISE</li>
    <li> Best facial cream I have used ! I had oily skin no matter what I used ! It was always oily by the end of the day. Since using this cream I don&#x27;t even need a primer before using my make up. I do recommend a spf when using this and no facial waxing I did threading instead . Love this cream works wonders, makes my skin look flawless and smooth!</li>
    <li> I purchased OZ Naturals Facial Cleanser Contains Powerful Vitamin C, OZ Naturals Facial Mask, OZ Naturals -  Retinol Moisturizer Contains 2.5% Retinol Cream, Vegan Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E + VITAMIN B5 and OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum For Your Face - Organic Vitamin C + Amino + Hyaluronic Acid Serum, four items total.  I&#x27;m 48, light brown skin black American.  I want anti aging and skin brightening products.  Now, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because we&#x27;ve already have gotten some hot days here in DC which my skin tends to oil up compared to winter months, but I got a pimple above my right eye brow, then two small pimples on the left side  of my of the jaw, which I do use a rotary razor.  Then another one where I shave left side side face.  I&#x27;m light brown skin and don&#x27;t&#x27; have severe acne, but they may pop up here and there. Today, I have another small pimple right side shaving area. But before OZ, I used another brand which uses all natural 100%, men anti aging; don&#x27;t know if I should name it, RSVP. But I thought I would try OZ.  RSVP products were used during winter when my skin is dry, not oily and no problems.  I have some pigmentation spots due to chicken pocks when I was 19, so they didn&#x27;t totally go away. But my face looked pretty good.  So, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll return OZ or stick it out. On my second week at least with the products.  I don&#x27;t think my face can take a lot of lotions and creams, maybe with the warm days, oily skin and such, my pores getting clogged. I do a mud facial mask and use apricot face scrub too; store brands.  *** UPDATE 6/12/15 *** I&#x27;m still getting pimples and now too late to return.  So disappointed.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is gentle enough for any sensitive face. I used it in the mornings and at night and noticed dark spots lightened up. Would recommend this to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and so far I like it.  I would love to see a moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I just started to use this product I use it after I put my SPF on, and it makes my face feel hydrated. I LOVE the ingredients in this product. It has healthy organic ingredients in it--one of the better products out there. Plus it goes on smooth, not cakey, and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. I read a lot of the reviews about this product which were excellent and that is why I am trying it. I appreciate all those people who write a review because it&#x27;s people like me who rely on those reviews since I spend HOURS trying to find the cleanest natural product with the least amount of unhealthy  carcinogenic ingredients in it. So far I LOVE Oz Natural--The BEST Retinol Moisturizer. I also have their serum line which I HIGHLY recommend. I think my skin looks really good and I am 53 yrs old. Most people think I am in my early 40&#x27;s. I will buy this product again. The price is reasonable as well. Thank you OZ Naturals for making such a great product. It really is what the product states--The BEST Retinol Moisturizer!!!</li>
    <li> all OZ products are great, give it a try ,no regrets</li>
    <li> I am using several products in my facial/body care routine. I&#x27;m not sure how much it is part of my facial improvement, but I am having a minor improvement on my arms where I have crepiness. I also use Palmer&#x27;s Firming Butter (which is a shocker for me a bit : ) , but I have read that it is the BEST firming cream out there. I see a minor firming effect, but have not been using that long enough to fully say yes/no to it&#x27;s effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I will continue to use and wait to see further results, hopefully : )</li>
    <li> I love everything natural this item work perfectly I love </li>
    <li> I was immediately intrigued by this product because it&#x27;s 100 percent vegan friendly! No animal testing! I applied a bit on the back of my hand and I saw the lines diminish in seconds! After cleansing my face, I applied this and my face looked incredibly smooth. My skin had a youthful look to it! I am very impressed!</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals rentinol moisturizer is a product I bought on a sale to try out.  My skin has had some problems but my mom got me started on a certain skin care routine that actually has it looking better now.  She said this will help to get rid of the old skin on top and the fresh new skin will look better and it actually does.  So while this is like its for older ladies with wrinkles and stuff like that they are worried about I am actually in my late twenties and have had skin problems since I was a teenager.  my mom switched over to all all natural skin care stuff for herself and she noticed rit away her skin was better with out all the harsh cleansers and chemicals so I am trying it too and it is working for me. So far so good. I put this on at night after I wash my face in a very light thin layer after the serum.</li>
    <li> Good Things are happening to my Mature and Dry Skin and I am not the only one to notice this improvement. I have not used all the skin care products in the Oz Naturals skin-care line, but this one is my favorite so far. I think that it is important to note that Super Youth Moisturizer is dispensed from a tube; therefore, there is less chance of bacterial contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, this moisturizer has benefits for anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-irritant, my prime interests are the anti-oxidants, and the anti-aging properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though Super Youth Moisturizer has ingredients to help heal, and soothe acne, to smooth and soften scars and to help to heal skin sores, my skin condition mainly deals with dryness, sun damage, and the inevitable aging process, so this is what my personal review will address.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three main ingredients that are printed on the Super Youth Moisturizer are 2.5 RETINOL MOISTURIZER, HYALURONIC ACID, and VITAMIN E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RETINOL is a derivative of vitamin A, the stronger counterpart is tretinoin, which is the active ingredient in Retin-A. If your skin is too sensitive to use Retin-A, retinol is an excellent alternative. The reason that skin responds to skin care products with retinol, is that vitamin A has a molecular structure that is tiny enough to get into the lower layers of skin, where it finds collagen and elastin. Retinol is proven to improve mottled pigmentation, fine lines and wrinkles, skin texture, skin tone and color, and skin&#x27;s hydration levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist had given me a prescription of Tretinoin Cream at 0.05%. I used this faithfully every night for 9 months, and although there was no skin irritation for me, I was constantly peeling and shedding my skin. Finally, after nine months I stopped using the tretinoin cream, I was no longer willing to suffer this continual ugly shedding, as this was both more noticeable, and less attractive than my skin condition. However, usage of the Super Youth moisturizer, which does have retinol, did NOT irritate nor have I had any of the shredding or peeling associated with Retinol, and my face skin tone and color is noticeably brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second ingredient on the front of Super Youth Moisturizer is HYALURONIC ACID (HA) - The loss of natural hyaluronic acid is one of the causes of Wrinkles. Since topical products with HA cannot penetrate to deeper layers, the moisturizing effects will only last a few days. Repeated use will maintain moisture levels in the skin, preventing skin dehydration. Hyaluronic acid is useful for reducing or removing wrinkles, which makes the skin look younger and promotes an even skin tone, making it look smooth and supple. HA holds up to 1,000 times its weight in water, it functions not only to deliver water to the skin, but also to hold it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already do use a Hyaluronic Acid serum, and I apply it right after my Vitamin C serum. I will continue to use my HA serum even though Super Youth contains this ingredient, since I have dry skin. I live in the dry desert area of the southwest, and I definitely need to maintain the moisture levels that this acrid climate continues to eradicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E is so important for everyone&#x27;s skin, it does not matter what unique skin condition each one of us has, it is necessary for all skin types, as this has to do with your general skin health. Vitamin E - Neutralizes free radicals UVA, UVB, infrared radiation A, and replenishes skin&#x27;s Lipids (giving structure to cell membranes). As an anti-aging benefit, Vitamin E is an antioxidant; it both increases firmness, and reduces wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Results: I have not even been using Super Youth for a full month, and yet my skin is noticeably brighter, the fine lines around my eyes have diminished, and are not noticeable when I am expressionless. My &#x60;smile&#x27; lines are also less prominent, but the most conspicuous improvement has been in my cheeks and neck! My cheeks are visibly smoother, almost completely line/wrinkle free, they are plumper and less sunken. My neck is also smoother; the tiny vertical lines running down toward my collarbone seemed to have disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are new to skin-care, it can be overwhelming with all the different product usages and the sequence of applications, so I thought that I would provide a general guideline to eliminate confusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Always, wash and cleanse first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It is better to have a designated washcloth just for your face, as wet towels can breed bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply your toner immediately following patting your face dry. It only takes 60 seconds before moisture tends to leave your skin, and the toner helps to lock in this necessary moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply your Vitamin C serum first. This needs to soak through the skin to the inner layers, so nothing other than the toner should come first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Apply your other facial serums, I use Hyaluronic Acid serum next, this retains 1,000 times its weight in water and not only does HA deliver water to your skin, it also helps to retain moisture, preventing dehydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Any type of facial oils should be applied right BEFORE your moisturizer, since oils will soak into the skin, and your moisturizer sits on the top layer, providing an effective barrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Next apply your moisturizer, I recommend Super Youth by Oz Naturals; it is the best moisturizer that I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Sunscreen comes next, no matter whether or not your foundation make-up contains it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Your facial skin has now been prepped and now you can finish off with your normal cosmetic&lt;br /&gt;routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize this review on Super Youth Moisturizer, from my experience this moisturizer helps to repair cell damage and accelerates cell growth, for a healthier and better-looking complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: Moisturizer sent for an evaluation, without any obligation, the research and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and have noticed an improvement in my skin! My skin looks more even and a little bit lighter. I like this a lot because it moisturizes my face without leaving it shiny/oily. I have very oily skin so its nice than this product doesn&#x27;t enhance that factor. My favorite way to use this is as a primer underneath my foundation</li>
    <li> my skin looks amazing after just a couple months of using without all the harsh chemicals! much smoother and more even tone</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first since I haven&#x27;t heard much about the product other than the rave reviews on amazon. It&#x27;s a excellent moisturizer that hydrates without being greasy and keeps my acne at bay when I remember to use it daily. The reviews are spot on by deeming this an overall excellent product. I look forward to trying more products by this company. I&#x27;ve been pleased so far and I&#x27;m buying a new tube soon! Normally I switch things up but I may just be making this a permanent fixture in my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> This line is amazing. I waited for almost 9 months to write a review because I needed to see over time if my completion  actually did improve. It is worth the investment. I also purchased a Clarisonic Mia 2 to go along with this product.My skin looks brighter and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;The amino herbal hydration mask is great, I use it once a week and I can see the difference of my skin immediately. This line works great for me.</li>
    <li> i like how my face feel after i use this one .. i used it morning and night..i will recommend this..i got this at discounted price ..thanks</li>
    <li> I intended to get this for myself and my mother ended up using it. I am in my 30s and my mom is 65.  I have to get another for myself because this product is just awesome.  I notice that it leaves my skin soft and the difference in my skin is noticeable after a few days.  I use it because my skin was looking a bit tired and I&#x27;m getting fine lines. I recommend it!&lt;br /&gt; I received a sample of this product to review, however, the results are my own and my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> It has helped a little but not the best I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Great deal too!</li>
    <li> When used with OZ wrinkle eraser, is incredible</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell how well it works against aging, but is non-fragranced, which seems to be quite rare, in spite of most advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on well and is adsorbed well.</li>
    <li> Saw a change overnight ! Have been using every day for a month. I look 5 years younger</li>
    <li> This is my first retinol product and I have to say I love it! Within weeks I felt my skin looked lighter and brighter, I will continue to try other products offere by this line, does bot feel greasy when applied:)</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. Better than the more expensive brands!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the results yet after one month of using this product 2 times a day. I am using the eye gel and the Hyaluronic Acid as well. So far, nothing. Im hoping after 3 months the product will minimize my wrinkles and my puffiness on my eyes....</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I use it at least twice daily. I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and haven&#x27;t really seen any changes in my skin, but I still plan to keep buying this product. You only need a tiny bit for your whole face and neck.</li>
    <li> I liked the idea of this and thought the list of ingredients would be beneficial.  i have sensitive skin and developed a tea tree oil allergy after using that particular flavor of dr. bronner&#x27;s soap (which was misdiagnosed by 2 derms) after which i started using vanicream soap and eventually dr. hauschka&#x27;s clarifying toner and clarifying day oil (i have mostly oily skin).  at some point i started blending my own oil for the face (jojoba, tamanu, rosehip).  no problems and my blackheads started diminishing and my pores looked much better and a large majority became clear.  after a year of using the oil blends, i started introducing the Oz Naturals product .  it caused breakouts on my decolletage (no problems with oil blend or vanicream moisturizing cream) and after about 3 weeks use on my face i noticed many many more blackheads forming in my pores. i chose to discontinue use.  unfortunately, did not agree with my skin to that extent.</li>
    <li> Good product will buy again</li>
    <li> Good price, but the smell is a little off, a bit stale.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and great price! I brought this as a gift to my mother. She loves it.</li>
    <li> this products is excelent</li>
    <li> First I want to say I got this product for free to give an honest non biased review. Pretty awesome, huh? I have used Oz Naturals Retinol Moisturizer now for a week or so. I love the way it feels when I put it on my face. I have only been using it once a day. In the mornings, before I apply my make-up. My skin feels so soft, and refreshed after application. Usually my skin is a combination of oily and very dry. The dryness has virtually vanished since using this product. It&#x27;s great to be able to go out, with or without make-up, and not have dry patches on my face. I would recommend this product yo anyone, so grab yours today, trust me you will see a difference!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face moisturizing cream by far.  I have seen a noticeable improvement in my skin&#x27;s appearance and feel.  My face and neck haven&#x27;t felt this soft since I was a teenager. And the best part is the pores on my nose have become noticeably smaller.  My skin is the typical combination T-zone type,  dry but sometimes oily on the nose,  chin and forehead and it works great on both combo skin qualities.  I use this lotion twice a day.</li>
    <li> Non greasy moisturizer, use twice daily.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for four days but I can already see a big difference in the tone and texture of my skin. My skin is brighter and very soft. So far I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> This also failure،، bad product Caused the spread of pimples in my face 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼</li>
    <li> Made me break out and worsened my skin. It might have worked for others, but it didn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
    <li> This is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used. I&#x27;ve used moisturizers for sensitive skin, acne, etc, and they&#x27;ve always left my skin feeling dull, oily and more to be desired. I reached a point where I gave up with moisturizing since I didn&#x27;t want to put something on my skin that was going to leave it feeling greasy and nasty all day. Until I bought this moisturizer from Oz Naturals. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and I can already tell a difference. I use it morning and night. I feel like the dark circles under my eyes are lightening up, and the milia underneath my eyes are actually starting to get smaller, despite the fact that most articles say you can&#x27;t use any topical creams to get rid of milia. I also feel like my skin tone is becoming more even, though I&#x27;m sure this is probably not just the moisturizer, but a combination of an exfoliator, toner and vitamin C serum I use prior to this moisturizer. Overall, I can say that as long as Oz Naturals keeps on making this moisturizer, I will keep buying it!</li>
    <li> I have been using several OZ Naturals products for a couple months now and I really am happy with this line. I was afraid this moisturizer would be too heavy for day use but it&#x27;s not. I wish they made something with SPF for day use though. Love that the products are cruelty free!</li>
    <li> My skin tone has dramatically improved after using this and in less than 2 weeks. Plus it has been like a natural exfoliant which I think has a lot to do with it. My skin also looks younger and much more refreshed! Fine wrinkles seem to have disappeared as well! HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product so much!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for. A month and its really effective moisture your face and healthy and say bye to the wrinkles.and love it all the products of oz its really great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 1 star because there is no zero. Not good for sensitive skin. Not good if you have any sun exposure even with sunscreen. Very drying. Made my roschea come back also left little patches of brown skin, likes freckles.</li>
    <li> Truly the best. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> i received the item for testing and review purposes.  i totally love this product .. why? as you can see it looks so simple from the outside. but its so magical when u use it.. it helps me .. my face more smooth like a baby. and this product is so awesome too cuz u can use even day or night. you just need sunscreen after. i like the OZ brand cuz its natural made and its from USA so youll feel its so safe that you dont need to worry about..</li>
    <li> I guess this product is OK for some people, but Roc PRO is much better.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE OZ MOISTURIZERS-- ONE IS SEA INFUSED AND THE OTHER IS JUST AS NOURISHING WITH DIFFERENT&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS.  NO ONE RECOMMENDED USING THEM BOTH AT ONCE I  JUST DECIDED TO ON MY OWN.  I APPLY ONE--WAIT A BIT AND PUT ON THE OTHER.--THEY FEEL SO GOOD ON MY FACE</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer! Makes my skin tone more even, goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> This stuff is THE BOMB-DIGGITY! Seriously, I have been using this for a few weeks and my skin has never looked better. It looks and feels so much smoother, softer and it is definitely improving the overall tone of my skin. My mild/medium acne has cleared up and even my acne scaring is less noticeable. Also, my skin seems less oily, odd, but true. People comment on how nice my skin looks and want to know what I&#x27;m using. I love this and shall not ever be without it!</li>
    <li> Good product have seen great results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream every morning and night for at least two months and I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference. I&#x27;m still waiting.....</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer! I have very dry skin that will &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; if not moisturized just right. I use this after I have washed off all of my makeup and used the OZ Naturals toner and OZ Hyaluronic Acid Serum. A little of this moisturizer goes a long way. This moisturizes so well so that I don&#x27;t have any dry &amp;#34;patches&amp;#34; still left over like I do with some other moisturizers. In the morning, my face is a bit shiny, but I just blot off the shiny areas with a face towel. The Retinol in this moisturizer seems very gentle and I have not experienced and redness or irritation. My foundation has a high SPF in it  which is needed if you use any kind of Retinol product. I am using this cream every other night and it is working beautifully. No break outs at all. I also love the ingredients in this moisturizer: all good stuff for our skin! I become more and more impressed with each product from OZ Naturals and can see myself using this brand for a long time!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer.  I will always use this.  Not heavy but just enough moisture to feel smooth and healthy, not greasy.  Was looking for a retinol containing product due to my age.  It was not irritating to me, although I know it may be for some.  It made a noticeable difference in my overall appearance of my face.  Just need a little bit so lasts awhile.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for several months now and my wife complimented me that my face doesn&#x27;t look dry anymore.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all the proof I need! She&#x27;s a tough critic!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a thicker moisturizer to use at night, and since I have recently converted my skin care regimen to Oz Naturals - I decided to try the Retinol Moisturizer. Compared to the Sea Infused Moisturizer it is much thicker, but not as heavy as traditional night creams. Neutral scented which I appreciate, deeply hydrating, and I wake up with a soft, smooth, and tighter feeling skin. I look forward to see the benefits that this will produce, as I just recently purchased the Retinol Serum to use underneath.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t find this to work at all but everyone&#x27;s skin is different.  What&#x27;s good for one person may not be for another.</li>
    <li> Received a free sample to try for my review.  There is hardly any fragrance which is a good thing.  Cream goes on smoothly and does not dry out your face.  Seen slight difference in lines but I haven&#x27;t used for that long. So far so good only time will tell.</li>
    <li> Best face cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  Can&#x27;t be without it anymore.</li>
    <li> This was amazing,but you really do have to wear sunscreen. Since I forgot and I got tan. It got rid of my acne :),plus it is so gentle since I forgot I scratched my face. I then put it on my face and it didn&#x27;t sting strangely</li>
    <li> Im feeling younger already im so in love with the oz natural products!! I am just so happy to finally get my face back lol thank you OZ Naturals</li>
    <li> It made my skin feel so good at first but then severely dried it out.  I can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. To tell the truth, I&#x27;m the kind of person the skin very dry,and live in very dry area, so perhaps this moisturizer is not right for me, I will choose another one next time.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes great, I still look old.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for several weeks now. I have noticed that the fine lines disappear when I consistently use it. I only use it at night since it doesn&#x27;t have a sunscreen and only on days I&#x27;m not running outdoors the day after. Depsite this, I still think it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin after several months use.  Didn&#x27;t hurt me, either, so 3 stars.  No magic here.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
    <li> I ordered this with the Vitamin C serum.  It&#x27;s a thick cream like consistency and spreads nicely on the face.  On the first night I used it along with the Vitamin C serum, I noticed the moisturizer was having a hard time blending with the serum and left thick white streaks that took a while to absorb. I&#x27;ve been using it during the day now with my SPF and cushion compact because I can&#x27;t use it with the serum at night.  It&#x27;s an average moisturizer, but didn&#x27;t knock my socks off.  I will use it until it&#x27;s finished and look for a new retinol moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This really makes my skin soft and hydrated.  I have been using this on my hands as well.</li>
    <li> I do not like it at all. Not absorbing, not seeing any improvement</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this is not all natural and containers petroleum products.  If only a retinol moisturizer was available that was all natural.  Oh well.  If you don&#x27;t mind that this isn&#x27;t pure, it is nice that it is fragrance free.</li>
    <li> Not sure what happened, but this did nothing for me. I used this twice a day for a month and a half.  I have hyper-pigmentation from several surgical scars, blackheads, general discoloration and laugh lines crowd the sides of my eyes.  I see no improvements, even slight improvements, in any of these areas or balancing general discolorations.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is non-greasy and makes the skin feel comfortable and soothing. I love the powerful antioxidant and retinal in the formula. It&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts. My skin feels ampazi g after using this. A fabulous brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a product to test but my review is genuine.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product a lot! I&#x27;ve noticed a definite improvement in my skin through the last month. I use this moisturizer with the OZ spray toner. The two together work great to keep my skin hydrated! I recently moved to CA from the east coast and I&#x27;m not used to the climate yet. This product is great to keep my skin hydrated and start anti aging regime. (I&#x27;m late 20s). I enjoy the product, but be sure to pair with an SPF makeup!</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this face moisturizer.  I am 43 years old, and have been wanting to find something to use on my face without seeing a dermatologist.  I have used very thick and heavy face creams/moisturizers in the morning and night when I go to bed because my skin is extremely dry.  I was worried about using this because it said your skin might peel and I was afraid of my face being even more flaky than it can be at times, especially in the winter.  Dry dry dry skin!  I have been AMAZED.  My skin is never dry, I use about a pea sized amount in the morning before applying makeup and at night.  I also use it on my  neck and hands.  I can tell a HUGE difference in the few weeks I&#x27;ve been using it and actually have had people complement about how much younger I am looking lately.  I notice my skin is more &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; if that makes sense, like it finally retains moisture, almost plump feeling and very soft.  I just love the way this stuff works and will be getting more when this bottle runs out!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t see a difference between this brand and the O&#x27;lay brand for the store.  I would save my money and skip it.</li>
    <li> My skin is insanely good as a result of using this every other night. I hated using prescription retain-a because it always made my skin peel and red, however this stuff is truly effective without the irritation. I don&#x27;t need to discontinue it before a big event and it didn&#x27;t make my skin peel AT ALL. I use it with the hylauronic acid serum beneath it every other night, and honestly even after 3 weeks the results are quite obvious. People are in awe of my skin. This is an excellent, excellent product.</li>
    <li> it was okay.  would not buy again.</li>
    <li> One of the things that just amazes me after I have used this at night is how smooth my skin is, even the next morning.  It is also incredibly soft.  I generally have a clear complexion anyway, but even starting from that point, there is a huge improvement.  I don’t find ANY uneven skin or dry patches anywhere.  My skin feels smooth and perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a number of products from OZ and have been really impressed with their products.  I had been a long time user of Clinique and then NIA but these products are better hands down.  I should say face down.  They just feel better.  I am also sensitive to scents and have discovered that these are perfect.  There really isn’t any noticeable scent.  OZ is not adding anything to the fresh clean small and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer warns to use sunscreen outside for several days longer than you use this product.  Luckily for me, at this time of year, this isn’t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is even more impressive to me is the price.  Clinique started out being pretty reasonable but at a certain point all of their bottles started costing $50-$75 each.  That’s just ridiculous, because they were also upping the ante of how many bottles of things you needed to use EVERY day.  From what I can tell, from having received some of the OZ products for review AND having purchased the OZ products as well, is that the quality is BETTER than Clinique and the price is LESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OZ is just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review.</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;m 51 and people consistantly think i am ten years younger.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of OZ Naturals moisturizer. Lasts a long time because you get a nice size tube for the price and not a drop is wasted - I wish more companies would sell their products in this type of tube rather than pump bottles.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin super oily and pores looks bigger. Good size however, but not for my skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Excellent product ..seeing results</li>
    <li> Purchased this based on all the great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I believe the great reviews are power of suggestion of all the &#x27;great&#x27; reviews.  I used an entire tube, as directed and saw nothing, nada.  I feel as though a cream of some sort was put in these tubes with none of the listed helpful ingredients.  If this contains the amount of Retinol stated, my face would of at least &#x27;tingled&#x27; a bit but nothing.  False claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally will not buy again, waste of money in my opinion.  Think about it - If this stuff&#x27;s as great as touted/reviews, it&#x27;d be impossible to buy - there&#x27;d be a buying frenzy..</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to start using any cream with retinol. I didn&#x27;t know much about it and it seemed scary to use something that could cause dark spots while being in the sun. So I use it at night only and still apply plenty of sunscreen during the day.&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizes my skin. It feels very soft in the morning. I use it after vit C serum from the same company, and I&#x27;m loving the results so far. I can wear no make up and still feel great about my skin. It is a wonderful feeling :)</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, clears, moisturizes and firms skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have tried a million different moisturizers.  I rarely purchase the same thing twice.  That search is OVER.  I love this moisturizer.  Keeps my pores unclogged and my skin soft.  Not greasy.  Great for adult acne prone skin!  The size is very generous and lasts me about six months, using it twice a day.  Very reasonably priced and arrives in two days with Amazon Prime!</li>
    <li> waiting to see how it works</li>
    <li> This a wonderful product for wrinkles - best I have used to date and I have been through quite a few! My big surprise was using it on my hands which have seen too much sun over the years.  I use many of the OZ Naturals products and love them. Update - I now use this on my arms for those droopy wrinkles one gets as one ages and it works to diminish them - love it !!</li>
    <li> My skin dried up like a raisin left in the sun!  I developed new wrinkles.  It says to use every other day if you experienced drying of the skin...  I did that.  It wasn&#x27;t any better.  My other moisturisers sunk into my skin like a drop of water in the desert.  Other than the drying I experienced, I noticed no improvement at all.</li>
    <li> This lotion slides on smoothly and absorbs quickly into skin.</li>
    <li> Snake oil with fake reviews!!! Does nothing!</li>
    <li> I am soooo in love with this moisturizer. My skin looks refreshed, feels and looks tighter, and it&#x27;s made my complexion GLOW! I loved it so much, I bought more Oz Naturals products (the exfoliater, serum, and mask)&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a skin care line that isn&#x27;t pricey, and does what it says! Can&#x27;t wait to see what it does for my sun spots. I&#x27;m 29 years old and I&#x27;m trying to keep my skin from aging, out of all the products I&#x27;ve tried, this is by far my favorite. I&#x27;m done spending money on the pricey stuff from Sephora, and never seeing a change. I even bought a $160 bottle of Skin Medica from a spa, used it all, never seen a difference in skin tone, firmness or sun spots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neurogena&#x27;s Retinol moisturizer, so I wasn&#x27;t sure about getting this one.  But I&#x27;ve been using the Oz Vitamin C and the Hyaluronic serum and have been very, very pleased, so I decided to get this one.  (I got it on a special deal, so it was a little bit cheaper when you compare ounce to ounce.) Neutrogena&#x27;s is excellent, but I think this one might actually be even better!  My skin is dewey and refreshed and people can&#x27;t believe my age.  Or at least they say that when I tell them my age and then pause and look meaningfully at them!  (Mothers, for goodness sake, raise your kids right - teach them to gasp in disbelief when a woman tells them her age!)</li>
    <li> I waited a couple weeks to put in my review to give it a chance.  It&#x27;s an ok product, but I haven&#x27;t seen the miraculous change in my skin others have seen.  In fact, I&#x27;m 58 and I developed whiteheads while using it.  So, I would say it&#x27;s a good moisturizer, I&#x27;m using it mostly on my neck now, but I know others are having fantastic results.  Sorry I can&#x27;t report the same, but people are different, so maybe you will have better results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect. I can&#x27;t believe how great my skin feels. I have been using twice a day. I am getting no sensitivity only soft perfect skin. I normally get breakouts and greasy from moisturizers but not this one. I can&#x27;t wait to see if some of my 35 year old wrinkles will diminish.</li>
    <li> Pretty good cream. Works great.</li>
    <li> I like this cream very much. It is not oily or dry. It can visible reduce the lines (the minor ones, I don&#x27;t have the deep ones yet. LOL). And it does not have any weird smell. Actually it smells a little bit like E cream.&lt;br /&gt;Very good one, I will purchase it once again.</li>
    <li> I really like OZ Natural products.  They are wonderful.  I&#x27;m in my sixties and my skin tends to be dry and dull.  I live in a very cold region and this can stress skin even more.  I wanted a moisturizer that would protect my skin and keep in the moisture without being heavy and waxy.  I got what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;It has been a month since I began using OZ Naturals Retinol Moisturizer in combination with 2 other OZ Naturals products, Vitamin C Serum and Facial Toner Spray.  I use it in the AM. There is a difference.  My skin feels softer and looks more dewy not dull.  The fine lines from dryness are going away.  I am very happy that I started using their products.</li>
    <li> No results at all. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals are amazing for my combination older skin, it rocks back the clock and feels so good on my skin.  I&#x27;m so happy I was able to try this product for free and will not hesitate to order in the future. Love it.</li>
    <li> Wow I love this product!! I have been using this for about 2 weeks. I do see a reduction in my fine lines. This is extremely creamy. My face feels soft and hydrated after I put it on. My skin soaks it up. I have acne prone skin. This has helped my acne clear. I have confidence!! I use this with my other face cream by Toulon. I think mixing the two has been the holy grail of skin care. My Toulon cream is a glycolic acid cream I put that on first let it set in for fifteen minutes then this on top. All I can say is wow!! Oh I also prep with vitamin c serum. I used to get botox now I dont need it!! Oh I also use facial smoothies as well. This combo has erased sun damage and fine lines that even botox couldn&#x27;t erase!! I will never be without this product!! This is my day cream as well. My make up which I just use my bb cream now glides on. No breakouts!! This is the first time in my life that I have not had to use a concealer to cover up a blemish or sunspots. I am a skin care addict and this is the best retinol product I have used!!! Love this product.</li>
    <li> I donot feel any different and also broke my skin out. I have a lot of cysts after a few used.</li>
    <li> Only been using for a few days, so I will need to update this review after several weeks. I love the tube instead of the typical jar - a little bit goes a long way! It has a high level of Retinol and leaves my skin feeling very moisturized. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent at all. I would highly recommend this product and look forward to seeing the results some other reviewers have shared after more usage.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I would buy this product again. It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t have the strong odor that most of these types of products have. I didn&#x27;t experience any drying of the skin as I have with other products. Overall this is a really good product!</li>
    <li> I received this moisturizer several days ago and I love how it moisturizes my very dry Colorado facial skin! Very little is needed so it will go a long way.  I use OZ Hyaluronic Acid Serum first and after it dries I apply this moisturizer.  I will definitely order again.  Price isn&#x27;t all that expensive, all I want is for something to work.</li>
    <li> I am 26 years old and wanted to start using a retinol cream. I researched and wanted something natural and with awesome reviews. This lotion is wonderful! I use the vitamin serum and eye cream in addition to this. It&#x27;s the best! Highly recommend  it!</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals - The BEST Retinol Moisturizer is exactly as it&#x27;s said!  It is the Best!  I put this on before I go to bed.  In the morning my face feels very smooth and well moisturized.  I will continue with this and also my OZ Naturals that I use in the daytime.  Both work great for me!</li>
    <li> Retinyl Palmitate does not equal Retinol.  If it did, then the ingredient list would say RETINOL rather than Retinyl Palmitate.  If they were the same, then the front of the product would have no issue saying that it contains Retinyl Palmitate.  Retinyl Palmitate is a cheaper, less effective version of Retinol --  but it is not Retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked on a cosmetic ingredient distributers website and actual Retinol cost 2.79x more than the cheaper Retinyl Palmitate.  But obviously if they were the same ingredient they wouldn&#x27;t sell in separate bottles and be listed as such drastically different prices. Just Yahoo/Google search Retinyl Palmitate and you&#x27;ll be surprised what you find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saying it&#x27;s a Retinol cream when it doesn&#x27;t contain Retinol, but rather Retinyl Palmitate is like ordering a pair of leather shoes and receiving synthetic pleather.  The front of the bottle shouldn&#x27;t say it contains a key ingredient that it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full List Of Ingredients (71% Organic):&lt;br /&gt;Organic Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera), Isopropyl Palmitate (Palm Oil), Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Organic Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower Oil), Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond Oil), Hyaluronic Acid, Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Organic Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), Organic Resina Propoli (Propolis), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Citric Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;__________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for review by: OZ Natural&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC</li>
    <li> I have received several products from OZ Naturals to review and I&#x27;ve been very impressed with all of them.  It&#x27;s upsetting when I see negative reviews on Amazon about OZ Naturals because OZ Naturals clearly states all the ingredients in their products.  Their ingredients are kept to a minimum, must have, essentials and are always derived from the best sources.  Statements such as their products are a scam is ridiculous. The OZ products are manufactured using a high quality, all natural, and mainly organic ingredients. They are paragon free and cruelty free.  This retinol moisturizer is an excellent product that I apply at night. The hyaluronic acid provides deep hydration and the retinol diminishes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  My skin is always soft and hydrated in the morning and my makeup looks beautiful the next day.  This line has done an outstanding job of staying away from big advertising and frills in their packaging and their products and word of mouth speaks volumes.  This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause break outs and there is no scent or necessary perfumes.  I&#x27;m very pleased, once again, with OZ Naturals and would highly recommend it to men and women of all ages and ethnicities.</li>
    <li> Feels good on my skin. Not sure yet if it is doing anything</li>
    <li> Sorry...not impressed with this brand.  I can&#x27;t recommend any of the products I have tried</li>
    <li> Large bottle, great price, perfect on my sensitive skin, blends well, creamy and light.  A great morning moisturizer.  One I will most likely purchase again.  So why 4 stars?  For the idea that it reduces wrinkles and/or fine lines.  Still haven&#x27;t found that product to turn back time lol</li>
    <li> Not as good as serum...my mistake.</li>
    <li> Good Things are happening to my Mature and Dry Skin and I am not the only one to notice this improvement.  I have not used all the skin care products in the Oz Naturals skin-care line, but this one is my favorite so far.  I think that it is important to note that Super Youth Moisturizer is dispensed from a tube; therefore, there is less chance of bacterial contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, this moisturizer has benefits for anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-irritant, my prime interests are the anti-oxidants, and the anti-aging properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though Super Youth Moisturizer has ingredients to help heal, and soothe acne, to smooth and soften scars and to help to heal skin sores, my skin condition mainly deals with dryness, sun damage, and the inevitable aging process, so this is what my personal review will address.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three main ingredients that are printed on the Super Youth Moisturizer are 2.5 RETINOL MOISTURIZER, HYALURONIC ACID, and VITAMIN E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RETINOL is a derivative of vitamin A, the stronger counterpart is tretinoin, which is the active ingredient in Retin-A.  If your skin is too sensitive to use Retin-A, retinol is an excellent alternative.  The reason that skin responds to skin care products with retinol, is that vitamin A has a molecular structure that is tiny enough to get into the lower layers of skin, where it finds collagen and elastin.  Retinol is proven to improve mottled pigmentation, fine lines and wrinkles, skin texture, skin tone and color, and skin&#x27;s hydration levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist had given me a prescription of Tretinoin Cream at 0.05%.  I used this faithfully every night for 9 months, and although there was no skin irritation for me, I was constantly peeling and shedding my skin.  Finally, after nine months I stopped using the tretinoin cream, I was no longer willing to suffer this continual ugly shedding, as this was both more noticeable, and less attractive than my skin condition.  However, usage of the Super Youth moisturizer, which does have retinol, did NOT irritate nor have I had any of the shredding or peeling associated with Retinol, and my face skin tone and color is noticeably brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second ingredient on the front of Super Youth Moisturizer is HYALURONIC ACID (HA) - The loss of natural hyaluronic acid is one of the causes of Wrinkles.  Since topical products with HA cannot penetrate to deeper layers, the moisturizing effects will only last a few days.  Repeated use will maintain moisture levels in the skin, preventing skin dehydration.  Hyaluronic acid is useful for reducing or removing wrinkles, which makes the skin look younger and promotes an even skin tone, making it look smooth and supple.  HA holds up to 1,000 times its weight in water, it functions not only to deliver water to the skin, but also to hold it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already do use a Hyaluronic Acid serum, and I apply it right after my Vitamin C serum.  I will continue to use my HA serum even though Super Youth contains this ingredient, since I have dry skin.  I live in the dry desert area of the southwest, and I definitely need to maintain the moisture levels that this acrid climate continues to eradicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E is so important for everyone&#x27;s skin, it does not matter what unique skin condition each one of us has, it is necessary for all skin types, as this has to do with your general skin health.  Vitamin E - Neutralizes free radicals UVA, UVB, infrared radiation A, and replenishes skin&#x27;s Lipids (giving structure to cell membranes).  As an anti-aging benefit, Vitamin E is an antioxidant; it both increases firmness, and reduces wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Results:  I have not even been using Super Youth for a full month, and yet my skin is noticeably brighter, the fine lines around my eyes have diminished, and are not noticeable when I am expressionless.  My &#x60;smile&#x27; lines are also less prominent, but the most conspicuous improvement has been in my cheeks and neck!  My cheeks are visibly smoother, almost completely line/wrinkle free, they are plumper and less  sunken.  My neck is also smoother; the tiny vertical lines running down toward my collarbone seemed to have disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are new to skin-care, it can be overwhelming with all the different product usages and the  sequence of applications, so I thought that I would provide a general guideline to eliminate confusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Always, wash and cleanse first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  It is better to have a designated washcloth just for your face, as wet towels can breed bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Apply your toner immediately following patting your face dry.  It only takes 60 seconds before moisture tends to leave your skin, and the toner helps to lock in this necessary moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Apply your Vitamin C serum first.  This needs to soak through the skin to the inner layers, so nothing other than the toner should come first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Apply your other facial serums, I use Hyaluronic Acid serum next, this retains 1,000 times its weight in water and not only does HA deliver water to your skin, it also helps to retain moisture, preventing dehydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  Any type of facial oils should be applied right BEFORE your moisturizer, since oils will soak into the skin, and your moisturizer sits on the top layer, providing an effective barrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.  Next apply your moisturizer, I recommend Super Youth by Oz Naturals; it is the best moisturizer that I  have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.  Sunscreen comes next, no matter whether or not your foundation make-up contains it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9.  Your facial skin has now been prepped and now you can finish off with your normal cosmetic&lt;br /&gt;routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize this review on Super Youth Moisturizer, from my experience this moisturizer helps to repair cell damage and accelerates cell growth, for a healthier and better-looking complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I Received a free sample of the Moisturizer for an evaluation, and without any obligation.

    <li> Moisturizer is a must for my 69 year old skin and most retinol products have been too drying for me.  This one is perfect!  I have used the entire line of Oz Natural Products.  I began with the serums and the eye gel.  After a few months my skin was improving in texture and clarity.  I have used the toner, mask, cleanser and retinol moisture for 2-3 weeks now and am amazed at the difference in my skin.  It is hard to tell which products do the most, but I would not be without this moisturizer.  My skin is amazing since I began using these products.  They all work and they are budget friendly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks now. My skin is showing improvement, fine lines lessened, soft and smooth skin is the result so far. I am impressed with the ingredient list. Its a generous 4 oz tube for a reasonable price. I have added it to my OZ naturals vitamin C serum and eye gel.  The company is great, they keep you informed with informational skin care emails. Great info!  I am over buying and trying $60. skin creams only to find they DON&#x27;T WORK. OZ naturals skin care products work and they are very affordable. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I can see a difference since  started using this cream, and that&#x27;s all that matters; right?</li>
    <li> After using for about 7 days (skipped a couple) with the vitamin C serum....I really can see a difference in my skin tone.  I am 42 and a smoker with sun damage.  I hope to see more results with further use.  Oh, I am also using Clarisonic Mia 2 prior to application and it seems to help with absorption.</li>
    <li> I received the Retinol Moistureizer from the OZ company to test and give them my opinion of the product.  This cream is amazing.  I use it every night.  I love the way my skin feels and looks.  My skin is firmer and the lines and wrinkles are less noticeable. My dark spots are fading and som of them are completely gone.  I love this product.  Their customer service is superior.  You should try this Moistureizer,  you won&#x27;t want to use any other after you use the Retinol Moistureizer.</li>
    <li> so far so good. Skin feels softer</li>
    <li> This cream has worked really well for me; it has helped with enlarged pores and gives my skin an overall smooth feeling. I use OZ vitamin C Serum first, then apply the retinol cream. Nice combination, and it works!</li>
    <li> compared to other retinol containing products this one had minimal positive effect on my skin, while redness and skin irritation continued for a long time</li>
    <li> I adore this product. Will keep using it as I get lovely compliments on my skin since I began using.</li>
    <li> Love vegan health care products. Like the animal compassion that these products introduce. I am vegan for health, ethical, and environmental reasons. This product was good! Sample was provided for review purposes.</li>
    <li> For the price u can&#x27;t beat it!  And I have older skin.  Is taking the place of my Kinerase, at least for now.  We&#x27;ll see how it does...if it stands up, will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Use this as part of my skin regimen with the cleanser and Vitamin C serum. Very happy with the results so far. My skin looks better and brighter than it has in years.</li>
    <li> This is a wow product for those who are starting to notice fine lines, wrinkles, and areas where the skin just looks a little bit dull or dry. Since having my son a little over a year ago, my skin has not been the same. I try to drink enough water and take good care of myself, but frankly it is hard to exercise and take care of myself the way I used to. So getting a good facial cream that could help me look and feel my best seemed like a good way of caring for myself without taking too much time away from my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly like this moisturizer used in combination with their facial mask, because the two seem to enhance the results from the other. In any case, on the days when my skin is feeling dry and parched and I look as though I haven&#x27;t had a good night sleep, this moisturizer really helps my skin to look younger, fresher, and like I have had a full eight hours. While I received a sample for review, I intend to continue purchasing these products and exploring the rest of the line since I have been impressed with the results as well as the price points.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer. It can be drying ( I have sensitive skin ) which is the case with all retinol products. You just need to use every other night. It&#x27;s a great product at a very affordable price. I didn&#x27;t have any major acne etc problems before using this cream so I can&#x27;t speak to that. I do think retinol products in general keep your skin look refreshed and plumped. I used this as a night time cream.</li>
    <li> Something special.  Love it! And retinol has not been my friend before, but is now.  The formula does it.  Definitely thrilled to have found this.</li>
    <li> I started with this 2 weeks ago.  Feels good on my skin.  Starting to see small results regarding discoloration on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Will order this again!</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and hopefully time will improve my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product  for about 3 weeks now, although I&#x27;m also using the Dr OZ vitamin c serum under started with that a month ago, again now that I&#x27;m using  both  on daily  bases I noticed not only did it help my pigmentation of my skin it seemed to help with my under eye puffing ness and which have no success with any other product. So very much pleased with the product since it helped with most troublesome concerns for my face will defiantly keep using</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing night cream! Makes my skin feel so soft! Highly recommended! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I have received this product for free, in return for my HONEST review. I have always been afraid of moisterizers due to suffering with acne most of my life. I was always afraid my face would break out more or it would clog my pores but this product did neither. It leaves my skin feeling soft, not oily and has not caused me one breakout. Love it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Amazing! My skin seems so different after using this the night before - so smooth, dewey almost and seems firmer too somehow. I love it! Just be careful if you do home chemical peels of any strength while using this. I am used to doing either 50% glycolic peels or 15% salicylic peels 1x a week and forgot I had been using this new stuff. Basically, my face frosted with the salicylic peel and I was so worried I created a medium-depth peel on accident. So far though - no major peeling - maybe will have flaking in a day or so....the result will be clearer skin though&amp;#62; Love it. Great product and the price is EXCELLENT for such a  large amount of product.</li>
    <li> Does the job well and is not overly fragranced.</li>
    <li> MAKES YOUR SKIN SOFT. GOOD PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Great product for nighttime cream.</li>
    <li> This is my nightly cream along with the C/Retinol serum</li>
    <li> I think was expecting too much for my age 69</li>
    <li> LOVE this moisturizer! I will likely continue to use it forever. I&#x27;ve used other retinol products for a while (including prescription creams) and they did the job, but left my skin extremely dry and irritated after. This product gives me the same results only with no irritation. There has been slight dryness (which will happen with frequent use of ANY product with this ingredient), but it has been very minimal which is quite remarkable for my skin. I&#x27;ve been really impressed with every single Oz product I&#x27;ve tried, so I think I&#x27;m going to try out the regular moisturizer and switch between the two during the winter just to be safe (New England winters are super rough on skin). I would recommend this product for anyone really, but especially for those with combination skin. It helps get rid of the dead skin cells so that more air can get at your pores and prevent bacteria from growing and won&#x27;t dry your skin as much as other retinol products. Plus, who wouldn&#x27;t love that it helps prevent aging?!</li>
    <li> I just received this and the vitamin c serum today, I washed my face applied the serum and then super youth and I feel it working, a slight tingle. I have sun damage, and at 40yrs old I have decided to start taking care of my skin, which I should have been doing all along, however... I am expecting great things from these products and will update at a later time after I have had a chance to really experience it.  UPDATE, been using for a while now and so far my skin feels great and my dark spots are starting to fade. Very happy thus far!!</li>
    <li> Actually caused me a break out!</li>
    <li> Sorry to say ..it hasn&#x27;t worked for me.</li>
    <li> La quantity and works well.</li>
    <li> Burns my sensitive skin and leaves my face feeling dry.</li>
    <li> I like that it has retinol. Its fast absorbing and not greasy.</li>
    <li> bottle i received looks a lot bigger than the one in the photo so I&#x27;m happy with that and it really makes my face feel real smooth after i wash it. would buy again and recommend to others</li>
    <li> I have not tried it long enouhg as to say it really Works. For the time being, ot feels great on skin.</li>
    <li> Love it! Very moisturizing for my very dry skin. Onlly used for a few weeks so not sure of the benefits yet.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> good product; good price.</li>
    <li> Been using for two weeks and love the way it makes my skin feel. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer....to soon to tell how well it works on reversing the signs of aging but definetly will keep buying!</li>
    <li> I came online this evening to write a review about the three OZ Naturals products that I recently ordered. I feel more than a little compelled to share with other women and men about the quality of this product. I have only been using it for approximately two weeks in the morning and evening. I could not be happier with this product. I purchased while looking for a product that would help reduce some new vertical aging lines under my eyes, crows feet around the side of my eyes, and a general firming and moisturizing product for my face that would brighten my skin. Well, I am absolutely amazed at the change in just two weeks. My skin looks and feels softer, smoother and more firm. The area I was concerned with around my eyes has completely resolved. I no longer have &amp;#34;any&amp;#34; lines around my eyes. I had circles, vertical lines and crows feet; and they are GONE, completely gone....so happy.  I am in my mid 60s, and I was pretty unhappy when I saw those lines developing, but not I am HAPPY. My skin is showing a definite improvement, and I have hardly used the product because it goes on so smoothly, that you need very little. Please try this product and see what it can do for you. I think you will be as happy as I am.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I&#x27;m on my second tube and will buy it again. It isn&#x27;t greasy or oily, it leaves my skin feeling so soft and my wrinkles are reduced.</li>
    <li> Not bad product but not the best neither.</li>
    <li> I like the way this makes my skin feel and I like the healthy glow that I get from it....but it gives me red-eye if I get it anywhere near my eyes so I&#x27;m a little hesitant to buy again.</li>
    <li> Still using my 1st tube. Haven&#x27;t noticed any results yet. Hoping they happen soon!</li>
    <li> I have to start out saying I was chosen to try this new product for free. I&#x27;m so glad I was picked this is a really nice moisturizer. First of all it has 2.5% retinol so that is fantastic, again as with all their products it has many nice ingredients to nourish and feed the skin. Plus this size is HUGE! Most moisturizers anymore are 1 ounce or maybe 2 but this is 4 ounces, absolutely fantastic. The prices are very affordable, I have paid 150.00 for a serum or cream that just didn&#x27;t deliver, this is great for me,great ingredients and a great price. It&#x27;s a win win, especially with how expensive everything is now a days. Thank you OZ Naturals, I hope you keep making great products and staying with your great prices. Oh yes I forgot it gives you a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> I use right after vitamin c serum. Good moisture and not greasy. Will keep buying.</li>
    <li> What an excellent product!! This moisturizer is fantastic! My skin is more radiant and youthful since using. I use other products in this skin care line as well and every one is great! I wouldn&#x27;t use any other skin care line. My skin is now in the best shape. I highly recommend this moisturizer as well as the other products. Will continue to be a faithful customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a great skin care line!</li>
    <li> The tube is large and seems like it will last a long time . I just recently purchased this and have just started using. I have to use it solely without other beauty care to give it a true review. I&#x27;ll give one after I&#x27;ve used oz products for 2 months. Give me time.</li>
    <li> Better than 300 bucks cream from sk2</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  I don&#x27;t typically like most brands because of smell or they don&#x27;t have a good consistency.... not in this case, I can&#x27;t even smell the product, and it has a nice thick consistency!!  GREAT product!  Will be buying again when I need more! :)</li>
    <li> This moisturizer makes my skin feel so soft and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy look or feel. It is absorbed quickly and is basically scent free, so it does not compete with my perfume.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for a few days.  It feels nice and light going on.  I think it works well with the Oz Naturals Eye Gel.  It does seem to lessen fine lines around my eyes.  It moisturizes without being greasy and leaving my face shiny like some products I&#x27;ve tried.  I think it works best as part of a whole Oz Naturals skin care regimen and will continue to use it to see longer term results.  I may need to alternate this with a more emollient moisturizer, though, as my mature skin may need the added help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Oz Naturals, for your line of natural, mostly organic products without all the artificial, harsh chemicals in most products.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Great service!  Great price!  Highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals ALL products are the BEST and the cost is great!!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Skin is in heaven!!! :)</li>
    <li> I am using this for a week now. It has a weird smell but other then that I like it. No complains. I have not used it long enough to notice any changes however I do feel its a good thick moisturizer, great value for the price and need just a bit for the whole face and neck. I did not have any peeling or drying like other reviewers. I will repost a review after a month or so of using this product on its effects on my skin.</li>
    <li> What an excellent product!! This moisturizer is fantastic! My skin is more radiant and youthful since using. I use other products in this skin care line as well and every one is great! I wouldn&#x27;t use any other skin care line. My skin is now in the best shape. I highly recommend this moisturizer as well as the other products. Will continue to be a faithful customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a sample of this product to review, however, the results are my own and my opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;What a great skin care line!</li>
    <li> When the word “best” is included in the marketing of your product, obviously, the results after time should support that decree.&lt;br /&gt;It is possible my skin type (Dermatologist has determined normal) is not conducive to this formula.&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, the product has admirable qualities - applies easily, greaseless, no after shine, better than average moisturizer with zero dryness.&lt;br /&gt;Minimizing of lines, well, lets just say, I can’t exactly see a difference versus other products sold at Department Stores.&lt;br /&gt;I fully intend to use 100% of the product.</li>
    <li> This product is equal or better than many lotions that I have tried. I notice that when touching my face, the skin has a firmer feel, but not sure if it has made a difference in appearance ... but I have only been using it for three weeks. Most times I do not repurchase a product unless the product has offered something substantial, and the price and quality of OZ Naturals Retinol Moisturizer makes it among the best that I have tried. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  goes on very smoothly and is absorbed quickly.  And, a little goes a long, long way!</li>
    <li> I love everyone of their products......</li>
    <li> This is the best retinol moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin which is good since my skin is very sensitive and has some dry patches. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin tone is more even and the fine lines are less noticeable. A little goes a long way. Their customer service is pretty awesome too.</li>
    <li> There are allot of reviews on here that are written by people who revived the product for free to review.  As another reviewer mentioned this contains the wrong type of retinal or non at all because it does nothing you would expect from a retinal product.  It also leves white residue on your face.  Ofcource you get what you pay for but I don&#x27;t like to be misled.  Very disappointed at this product.</li>
    <li> So far so good! Have been using the product for just a couple of weeks and I like it!</li>
    <li> No change in dryness or less wrinkles.  Bought a dermatologist&#x27;s formula which is much better--more $</li>
    <li> Feels great on, not sticky and makeup glides over it wonderfully. I love that fact that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
    <li> broke out with pimples.  bad product</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever used a retinol.  I am 39 and I had deep lines on my forehead and stress was really aging my face. This retinol from Oz Naturals appealed to me because of the natural ingredients. I have to say this stuff works.  The lines on my forehead have softened and my skin in general looks great. I have received compliments on my skin which is fantastic! I started to notice results after a few weeks and I didn&#x27;t suffer from really dry or peeling skin at all. I use every other evening and on alternating evenings use a moisturizer or facial oil. Great stuff and now I am trying more of Oz Natural products.</li>
    <li> I have used every moisturizer there is - from the most expensive to the most promising. I had come to the conclusion that truly nothing can make your skin more youthful other than painful procedures. As a huge fan of all the Oz products I know they deliver what they promise so I thought what the heck? I knew I had a 100% money back guarantee - and the price is more than reasonable. After using so many chemical based products before I love that Oz products are just that Oz &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; - I used this for the first time at night after washing with Oz Vitamin C cleanser; slathered it all over my face and neck - be careful! - a little goes a long way. It felt creamy and cool on my skin. Very pleasant. Woke up to very soft and pampered skin. Used again that day and have been doing this same regime for several weeks now. My skin is so soft and supple - people keep asking me if I have had a facial (or some &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; done wink, wink). The only complaint I would have is that I wish this came in a big body moisturizer! It is so delicious you will want to slather your whole body in this magical potion. Another product from Oz that truly does what it states it will!</li>
    <li> A little goes a very long way, my skin looks and feels very hydrated and smoother tone, its only been two weeks but i am&lt;br /&gt;Seeing an overful improvment by adding this to the rest of my OZ REGIME</li>
    <li> When I received my order both the moisturizer and serum were frozen due to the bitter cold weather we were having.  I decided to keep and use because I was completely out and needed right away.  I do like the moisturizer.  It goes on nicely and leaves my skin feeling smooth.  I think I see a more even complexion and feel but am not sure I&#x27;m getting the optimal effects of either because of being frozen - not sure if freezing diminished the advertized and reviewed affects.  Will probably order the moisturizer again because I do like the way it goes on and feels.</li>
    <li> this is outstanding moisturizer!  I am noticing that my skin is looking even smoother and more radiant as time goes on.  The formula used is gentle on my skin--I couldn&#x27;t use the prescription retinol, so this is a great choice.  I use it at night along with a serum or two and wake up with bright even toned smooth skin.  Makeup goes on beautifully!  The price is outstanding particularly since you get four ounces rather than the usual 1 or 1.7 oz.  Well worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have added this to my night time regime and I have seen definite improvement in my overall skin texture.  My skin feels wonderful when I get up in the morning.  It goes on smoothy and absorbs quickly, so no greasy feeling.  When my day moisturizer runs out, I am going to switch to using his 2x per day.</li>
    <li> I didnt expereince much redness at all, I did in the frist week have some dry peeling which is showing me it worked, I love the new texture of my skin. Be sure to use youre sunscreen while using this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My skin is brighter and clearer.</li>
    <li> Not great for my face, but loved it for my arms, chest and legs.  I found that this thick moisturizer was a bit overkill for my face.  In addition, the retinol caused my face to peel for days.  I had to stop using it on my face after about three days, but continued to use it on my hands, arms, and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say my hands have never felt so soft, especially during the winter.  In addition, my legs, and neck are noticeably smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone who lives in harsh climates--but to caution those with fair, sensitive skin.  Overusing it, or using everyday on the face might be a bit much for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was asked to give this product my honest opinion, and I am happy to oblige.</li>
    <li> I really love this product!!.  I like the fact it has the retinol in the moisturizer allowing you to moisturize and treat at the same time.  I have seen a reduction in size and color of  my sun damaged brown spots using this product everyday for the past month while moisturizing my skin which eliminates the drying effect of the retinol.  I don&#x27;t do reviews normally but I really like this product and feel it does what it is intended to do.</li>
    <li> Great nighttime moisturizer.  My skin has more even tone and texture and I awake each morning looking smooth and radiant.  Love, love, love!</li>
    <li> Love this cream!. IRecommend</li>
    <li> I bought these products based on reviews by other customers.  Hmmmm. Seems to me my eyes looked puffier, and the moisturizer actually caused a small breakout.  I would say it works for some people, not for others.  How would you know?  I guess you just would have to try it like I did and find out the hard way.</li>
    <li> Had never tried a retinol cream for concern of over drying or skin sensitivity.  I had neither with this cream, even using it daily.  It does everthing it promised. The fine lines have deminished and my complection appears more even.  Currently using after Oz Naturals vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> I am giving this 4 stars because I have only been using it for 2 weeks.  I will update at a later date.  I have to say I am impressed with this moisturizer.  I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and this seems to be exactly what I am looking for.  I want a product that will aid in anti aging, help with past sun damage, diminish scarring, and get rid of my dull lifeless skin.  In the short time that I have been using this product, I have seen my skin come alive again (this is a gradual process, but I am seeing results of my skin brightening up).  I use this at night only after I use a facial serum.  Since I am using 2 products, I want to make sure I am getting the benefit of both so I make sure that after I put on my first product I give ample drying time before I put on this moisturizer.  The moisturizer is a just about right consistency, not too thin, and not too thick that it doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin.  You can put a dab on your finger and it will stay on if you turn it upside down (dab, not blob).  There is very little scent to the moisturizer which I enjoy because I have sensitive skin now that I am in my 40&#x27;s.  Aside from seeing some result so quickly, the other thing that I like is that the ingredients in this moisturizer I can actually read the words, have heard of the ingredients and research shows the benefits of the actually ingredients in this retinol moisturizer.  Last word of advise, make sure regardless of when you use this product and for some time after you use this product that you wear sunscreen.  I have received this product for a true and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> This cream makes my face feel tightened and fresh.  I started using it morning and night after I got it, after serums and my face feels moist throughout the day.  It works well over the tonic, which gives the skin and cream an extra dewy look and touch.  My skin looks good and I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I use a 1.0 retinol by another brand and I can really feel it working, yet this &amp;#34;claims&amp;#34; 2.5 and I feel zero effects that retinol has. It is a good moisturizer but as far as skin correction the retinol is not there.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Ready to order more.</li>
    <li> The ingredients in this Retinol Moisturizer are awesome 71% organic and parabens free. It comes in a generous 4 oz tube. The very soothing cream contains 2.5% Retinol. A little of this moisturizer goes a long way. The Retinol in this moisturizer seems very gentle and I have not experienced and redness or irritation. I use it each morning and I love it. Leaves my skin feeling nice and soft. I was given this product for the purpose of review, however, all thoughts and opinions expressed here are solely my own.</li>
    <li> Starting to see wonderful things happening to my skin with this product! My skin is getting more supple &amp; is so soft!</li>
    <li> I used this for two days and it broke me out. Just beware if you&#x27;re prone to breakouts with certain moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Too soon for a comment--only used for a week.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly I was suprised with how large the tube is. Generally a face moisturizer is kind of small.&lt;br /&gt;This one looks like the bigger size, of say.. a hand cream? I like how my face feels and I havent been wearing makeup all week so I could really see if its impacting my overall skin. I really like it. My skin tone looks better. Its not a splotchy. Its hard for me to find a face lotion that works because I am prone to acne and I break out so badly. This hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all. I have also been using it on my hands!&lt;br /&gt;You know , Hands show age! Now they should make this in a HUGE tube for the body lol</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of anit aging moisturizers on my 55 yr old face and I am a believer in OZ Naturals. It helps with fine wrinkles, tone, dark spots.</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t lived up to its promise because its use made my skin break out almost instantly in cyst-type acne that has been difficult to clear up, so I stopped using it after a few days. I can&#x27;t find any research that mentions retinol causing acne, though it has been known to inflame skin. I&#x27;m not that impressed with Dr. Oz and won&#x27;t buy any products that carry his name again.</li>
    <li> great product.  works as advertised.  would order from again.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff!!!  I&#x27;ve been trying to find an anti-aging moisturizer for the longest time that would not break out my skin.  Roc was the only product that came close but it just didn&#x27;t give me the glow I was desiring and my skin still broke out, just not as bad.  I came across this product after I purchased the &amp;#34;I&#x27;m beautiful, my vibrant glow serum&amp;#34;.  It is incredible!!!  I use the serum first and then I apply this moisturizer.  Not only does it not break out my skin but it&#x27;s clearing it up while giving my skin a glow and reducing the wrinkles/age spots.  I just wish I had found this sooner.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. I use it with Oz Naturals hyaluronic acid serum and I can see my skin tone has evened out after one week of use. And, I can see my skin continues to improve four weeks after use.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and it has faded my fine lines and evened my skin tone. My esthetician said she has noticed a difference in my skin. Love all their products!!</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for my mom who uses it nightly she is very happy with the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Have used Retin-A prescription in the past. This does that, but does not cause flaking, peeling, redness, irritation that the prescription does.</li>
    <li> Great price! these can go for quite a bit, and this is not only a great product but well priced.</li>
    <li> Lovely Moisturizer which I combine with the Oz Vitamin C serum, and I feel it has softened my skin and smoothed some of the wrinkles.  I don&#x27;t have crow&#x27;s feet but those nasty lines above my lips.  That is what I am watching for improvement.</li>
    <li> So no changes, waste of my money.</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals Retinol Moisturizer Night Cream is simply awesome. After pregnancy my skin hasn&#x27;t been up to par and has been looking dry and pale. I&#x27;ve used OZ Naturals products in the past so I decided to give this product a chance as well. The Moisturizer is perfect for day or night and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and bright. I use it in conjunction with the OZ naturals face wash, Vitamin C serum and use the hydraulic acid serum once every few weeks.  If you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer that keeps your skin looking young and fresh then I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Quite thick feeling, so definitely better as a night cream.&lt;br /&gt;No strong scent, and feels good afterward.</li>
    <li> good cream.  ticks all the boxes. good size tube. vegan and natural. contains all the must have anti aging ingredients.  not greasy but keeps skin moist and fresh.  will re order. efficient service.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks now, so I haven&#x27;t had time to see any results, so this review is on what I&#x27;m seeing so far, I&#x27;ll give an update later after 3 months use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this as a night cream on top on the OZ naturals Vitiman C serum.  I let the serum dry for about 2 min, then apply OZ naturals Retnoil Cream.  First, this is a super LARGE tube of moisturizing crime for the price!  There is not much of a fragrance, but a slight medicine smell.  It&#x27;s alittle on the thicker side, so you only need a very small amount to spread all over your face.  There is a suttle tingle that lets you know it&#x27;s working.  I feel this will be a big asset to my skin care regimen.  I&#x27;ll do an update later, but as far as the texture and feeling of the cream, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  Everything about this product says quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so my face started burning and turning red, I notified Oz and they let me return, I immediately purchased the other moisturizer &amp;#34;sea infused&amp;#34; from OZ.  I think I may be allergic to the Retinol in this product, not their fault.  Still a quality creme in my opinion..</li>
    <li> Pro: It moisturizes well and does not cause any acne flare ups or skin discolorations. It was pretty cheap for a big tube of Retinol moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Con: It doesn&#x27;t make my wrinkles go away or shrink.  I still look old.</li>
    <li> Not really the best at all. I tried several and this is just ok.</li>
    <li> Great product . Not oily, no perfum which i love! Feels great! It makes the skin glow and soft!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad to find a daily that can be worn day or night with retinol! I really enjoy this lotion and I use use after my OZ victim an C serum and before I apply sunscreen or night cream. This lotion leave my skin smooth, clear, and calms the redness around my nose. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I usually have very dry skin in the winter.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this product my winter skin hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me.  I put this on at night before going to bed and wake up to soft hydrated skin.  I tried using this twice a day but found that my sensitive skin couldn&#x27;t handle it.  Started to get red and flaky.  Which I understand is what retinol does.  I like that it is mostly natural since Ive been trying to steer away from chemicals as I get older.  Only been using for a few weeks so not sure if wrinkles are disappearing.  Will probably take a bit longer since I do have some sun damage and Im older.  But so far its working for me.</li>
    <li> The three key ingredients in OZ Naturals’ Retinol Moisturizer is retinol, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin E. According to my research:&lt;br /&gt;• Retinol is a form of Vitamin A that is known for its effectiveness in treating acne and wrinkles and improving the appearance of sun-damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;• Hyaluronic acid helps the cells in your skin absorb and retain moisture. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a biopolymer naturally occurring is the skin and other tissues. Babies have a high level of HA (hence that soft, supple skin!) and as we age, we have less and less (hence the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles!).&lt;br /&gt;• Vitamin E has long been used and recommended for its antioxidant properties and providing protection against UV radiation and other free radicals. It is said to decrease skin roughness, length of facial lines, and wrinkle depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OZ Naturals’ Super Youth 2.5% Retinol Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin E boasts itself as “a powerful cocktail of antioxidants with Vitamin A, to diminish fine lines and signs of premature aging.” Packaged in a flip cap tube, the moisturizer is 71% organic and made in the USA. Instructions for product use include a warning that dryness may occur and recommends the use of sunscreen while using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Super Youth moisturizer to be practically scent-free. One of my favorite OZ Naturals products, it goes on so smooth and leaves my skin feeling replenished and primed for makeup. Unfortunately, I am sensitive the drying effects of retinol, so I have followed OZ Naturals’ suggestion to alternate days with a facial moisturizer without retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who frequently breaks out from skin care products, I was pleased to find that I experienced no breakouts from the Super Youth 2.5% Retinol Moisturizer. Yet perhaps the best testament to this product (and the other OZ Naturals products I have been using—please see my other reviews if you are interested) came just a few days ago, when someone asked me, “What have you been using on your skin? Your face looks fantastic!”days ago, when someone asked me, “What have you been using on your skin? Your face looks fantastic!”</li>
    <li> Love this product line. Made a visible difference in tone, evening out my redness in some areas and dryness in others. Monthly breakouts are no longer a problem. It&#x27;s gentle but wonderful. I loved it so much I bought the serum and Sea Minerals Facewash which made the most visible difference.</li>
    <li> Please be aware that Retinol does not work the same way for everyone.  You saw my initial raving review about this moisturizer and I still think the ingredients are great and it sort of improves the overall look of your skin - i.e. makes it brighter and smooter by minimizing pores etc.  However, I had some old acne scars before i started using it and...while using it I started noticing that my acne scars became wider and more noticeable. I kind of thought that my mind was playing tricks on me and that the reason my scars look worse than before is b/c I started paying more attention to my face. People, this is not the case!  Last night i came across a blog on acne.org where I found numerous stories similar to mine - i.e. complaints that Retinol (in any form - retynil palmitate, pure retinol, or prescription retin-a) made their indented acne scars much worse and resulted in appearance of new / rolling acne scars.    This is crazy, isn&#x27;t it?! Dermatologists prescribe retinol to fight skin imperfections including scars!  Well, i think my face got messed up quite a bit and I truly regret that I started using this product without consulting with a dermatologist and I now have to look into some professional treatment options to minimize the appearance of my indented acne scars :(    So just want to communicate across that I am not giving 1 star to OZ Naturals - I am sure this cream may work beautifully on acne/scar free tissue. I am giving this to Retinol based creams in general for their ability to mess up someone&#x27;s face while being advertised to do the opposite.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion. I was looking for something that I could use under my eyes and on my face. I am tired of using separate products on different areas. It was fine for traveling, but it did not work as well as the two products I usually use. My skin just did not have the same feel.</li>
    <li> I have thought about using retinol for a long time.  One of the main reasons why I like this retinol because it also has hyaluronic acid in it (I have the OZ Naturals Vit.C/Hyaluronic acid serum).  I love the Oz Natural products because they are majority organic ingredients without the harmful junk that is in so many products.  I like that this comes in a tube instead of a jar. I would highly recommend the Oz Natural products.!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement after 2 months of use</li>
    <li> So far it does a good job.  Will see if there is further improvement</li>
    <li> I liked it but I think its a bit to soon to post if it works...Need way more time....</li>
    <li> I think it works and I&#x27;m getting my sister a tube for Christmas.  I only use it 3 days a week because it tends to dry my skin, but I&#x27;ve noticed clearer, brighter skin tone and slight decrease in fine lines.  I also use the dermalogica microfoliant before applying the retinol moisturizer.  Friends have complimented me on the change.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on October 16th; received it about 5 days later. I am very fair skinned and live in a tropical climate so my propensity for wrinkles due to sun exposure is high. I use a daily moisturizer with a high SPF everyday but was looking for something I could wear at night that would help with the prevention of premature wrinkles and, maybe, the treatment of that one godforsaken line that I have between my eyebrows. I saw this product and it was reasonably priced so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I have officially finished the bottle today (so, as you can see, I didn&#x27;t use much daily but I did use it everyday). I decided to wait until I finished it in its entirety to write my review so as not to jump the gun.&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say it is a great product. It felt wonderful going on and I have seen a huge difference in the pronouncement of that previously mentioned devil wrinkle (it&#x27;s still there, just noticeably shallower). If you&#x27;re expecting surgical results...well, I suggest you contact a surgeon. If you are looking for a product that will definitely improve the look of fine lines and feel great on your skin, this is it!</li>
    <li> I think this is the best value in a retinol moisturizer I have ever used because you are getting so much of it. A lot of times you buy a retinol product and it comes in a very small tube . This one is a full 4 fl oz so it will last and last. I also found the ingredients to be a very effective blend of Retinol, Hyaluronic acid and vitamin E . This product will moisturize the skin as well as effectively reverse the signs of aging. The value is outstanding because of the size and a little goes a long way. When using a retinol product please remember to use a sunscreen with it . if you are wanting to try a retinol moisturizer I hope you try this one because it will really give you a generous supply to start with and that makes for a great value .&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own thanks for looking</li>
    <li> Very drying and actually made my skin worse.</li>
    <li> It really is the best. I love this moisturizer and the way it leaves my skin so soft. I use it everyday without any irritation or oiliness.</li>
    <li> My skin has never looked this radiant!</li>
    <li> Been using this for a week &amp; already can see big difference in my face &amp; neck! Would love free samples like the rest but don&#x27;t seem to receive them</li>
    <li> This is a nice moisturizer, but I did not see any overall change in my skin after 3 months of use. It did not appear to be any different than my normal moisturizer without retinol.</li>
    <li> I am 39 and my skin has large pores and a lot of fine lines .  I have not notice any dramatic improvement, but ok, I love the way it feels all day.  Goes really well under make up - not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Made my skin break out like crazy.  People were asking me what is wrong with me.  My skin isn&#x27;t normally that way. Had to quit using it.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is not greasy and is easily and quickly absorbed into the skin.  If you have very dry skin you might require extra moisture.  However, my skin tends to be drier in the winter and I have found that my makeup continues to go on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Love how this product makes my skin look and feel!</li>
    <li> Very hydrating&amp; will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, just perfect. My sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t had any weird reaction.</li>
    <li> I use this after I wash my face and before I apply my makeup.  I really like it, it doesn&#x27;t make my face look oily or shiny.  Also it didn&#x27;t cause any kind of breakouts.  I use this along with the OZ Naturals eye gel (which I really love and recommend!).  I&#x27;ve  also noticed the scars (caused by acne) on my cheek has almost disappeared and I&#x27;ve only been using these products for about a month.</li>
    <li> It is not a miracle cream like we all would hope for, but I am genuinely happy with this product. The best results I have had so far from any product I&#x27;ve tried and I have tried many of them. I will definitely be a returning customer!</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I also use all the other OZ Natural Products. I noticed an improvement in my skin texture and condition. I get a lot of compliments on how great my skin has been! I use the cleanser, the eye gel, the vit C serum (in the morning) and the Hydro acid serum (at night) and then I massage this into my face, neck and upper chest area. You only need a dime sized amount. It is concentrated and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and firm. I am on my 3rd tube already!</li>
    <li> I used my Oz Natural products last night and they felt great. They don&#x27;t have any overpowering fragrance or any at all, and a little goes a long way. To my surprise, all of the &amp;#34;congestion&amp;#34; on my forehead was completely cleared by morning. My forehead is completely smooth! Great products! I love that they are basically unisex and are completely natural with dermatological-grade active ingredients. They now only need to make a face scrub and sunscreen and then I am set :) Purchased the Vitamin C facial cleanser, Vitamin C 20% serum, Facial Toner, Eye Gel, and Retinol Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference in 3 days around my eyes</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is terrific.  I love that it has retinol for my fine lines.  Since using it for the past few weeks the crepey lines under my eyes have all but disappeared.  I can only imagine the improvements I will see with continued use.  The concentration of retinol is just right for someone who has not used it before.  I was able to use it twice a day with no irritation which surprised me as my skin is rather sensitive.  Today my skin is smooth and soft with far fewer lines.  I will continue to use this moisturizer; it has become my favorite.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt; - Skin feels immediately softer after use&lt;br /&gt; - Soothes my acne&lt;br /&gt; - Helps reduce my acne scars&lt;br /&gt; - Creates more radiant, youthful looking skin&lt;br /&gt; - Far less expensive than comparable products&lt;br /&gt; - No heavy perfumes. Very light smell. Actually, there&#x27;s almost no scent. It just smells... natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt; - None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt; - Be sure to put the moisturizer on your hands first and rub them together, rather than dotting the moisturizer directly onto the skin. This warms it up prior to application, which helps your face to absorb more of the application.&lt;br /&gt; - Always start with your cheeks and then spread to forehead, nose, and lastly: chin. This is because you want to work from most dry area to most oily area. We typically need more moisturizer on our cheeks than the rest of our face, so you want to apply there first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review helpful, please let me know. I really do appreciate getting feedback about what I have written. I wholeheartedly believe that all reviews should be open and honest, regardless of how the product was obtained: be it bought at a store, bought at Amazon, gotten for free or at a discount. In this case I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Not as great as expected.</li>
    <li> Made my skin break out so bad. I cant put any lotion or cream it hurts and its red and peeling now. I had to get special facial for all sensitive product brcause i didnt have any..and i spent $200 for buying sensitive cosmetics.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this product. I really like that it&#x27;s based on natural and or organic materials. I have noticed a big difference in fine lines and my over all skin tone. Does this without drying. Would by again!</li>
    <li> **EDITED after learning more about the product:    Two people wrote to me to tell me that this product, Oz Naturals 2.5% Retinol Moisturizer, does not, in fact, contain Retinol, but instead contains a different type of vitamin A product called Retinyl Palmitate. At first I argued, \\&quot;But it has 2.5% Retinol written right on the front of the tube!\\&quot; However, I went ahead, turned the tube over, and looked through the list of ingredients as was written there. Sure enough, the word \\&quot;Retinol\\&quot; was no where to be found among the list of ingredients. However, half way down the list, I did find the ingredient \\&quot;Retinyl Palmitate\\&quot;. So I did some research, and there is quite a bit of information about Retinyl Palmitate to be found on the internet. And one thing that I came across over and over is that Retinyl Palmitate is not the same thing as Retinol. It is an \\&quot;ester\\&quot;, (a chemical compound), formed from the reaction of retinol and palmitic acid. To be able to use it, the body has to first convert it into retinoid acid, then retinaldehyde, and finally retinoid acid. It is about 20% less potent than retinol and you need to use a lot of it for it to be effective. Plus, it does not have the same exfoliating effects as retinol...    I would encourage you to research this product--both Oz Naturals 2.5% Retinol (?) Moisturizer and the ingredient Retinyl Palmitate--to see if this is truly the kind of product you had in mind... Now to my original review---    For the past three years, I have been using a different retinol product which only contains 1% retinol, less than half the amount Oz Naturals 2.5% Retinol claims to have in it. However, it has done wonders for my skin, leaving it glowing, minimizing fine lines, etc. I was always getting compliments on my skin. And even though I had build up a tolerance for it, it would, at times, still make my face red while it was working, and sometimes my face would still even peel a bit. Still, it&#x27;s done wonders for my skin. However, as I am now 53 years old, I decided to up the ante a bit and go for a product that had more retinol in it. So, after reading the Amazon reviews, I chose Oz Naturals 2.5% Retinol Moisturizer.    I assumed because this product has 2.5% retinol in it, which is more than double the product I am currently using, that I would firstly experience some redness, stinging, etc. due the powerful strength of the retinol. I also assumed that it would make a more impressive difference in my skin, even better than the 1% retinol product I am using now. Well, I have to say that I am not impressed with the Oz Natural product at all. I have to say that I find it hard to believe that this actually contains 2.5% retinol as it claims to. I feel and see absolutely no effects from this product. No redness, tingling, stinging as one might expect. I see no glow, no improvement in my skin&#x27;s appearance. Nothing. If anything, it leaves a dulling film on my face, and I actually think my skin looks worse, more dull and blah, rather than better.    In my overall opinion, this product performs as well as any inexpensive drugstore moisturizing product would, but I feel it does absolutely nothing to actually improve the appearance of my skin. And as I previously said, if anything, I believe it has made my skin look bland, it&#x27;s dulled the glow that my face did have, and it has actually has worsened the appearance of my skin instead of improved it.    I will not be re-ordering this product. I plan to go back to my 1% retinol cream that I have been using, and I will stick with that until I can get a doctor&#x27;s prescription for Retin-A.</li>
    <li> I was contacted and asked if I would give an honest opinion of this product. I will not receive any money for this review, and I don&#x27;t respond to offers of merchandise for positive reviews. So here goes....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-has an extremely light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-goes a long way. Usually two small squeezes are plenty for my face, neck, and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-is right about in the center of most moisturizers. It&#x27;s neither thick nor runny. Just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-feels a bit tingly right after applying so I can tell it&#x27;s being absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-hasn&#x27;t dried my skin out, or made me break out, which has happened in the past when I&#x27;ve tried products that contain retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this product. I use it at night at the very end of my regimen. So I can recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and I didn&#x27;t expect it to work all that well, but so far it seams like it mite be better then I expected, we&#x27;ll see</li>
    <li> Great product! It moisturizes my skin like not other before!</li>
    <li> Saw changes to my face after a week of using (actually the first night) - it&#x27;s really mild or I must not have sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve never used any retinol cream before and being cautious by first using once every 1-2 days and I didn&#x27;t get a reaction I started using it every night without any irritation. Pretty good price and size so I use whatever is left after putting it on my face on the top of my hands and saw minor lines disappear. Of course always remember to use sunscreen even on days you don&#x27;t wear this.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used!  I love it, and hope it will continue to be available for years to come!  I noticed a difference in my skin the very first time I used it.  The tube is very large, unlike most for this price, so you get a lot for your money.  I highly recommend this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> OK, I was skeptical but the product had pretty good reviews.  I had previously used Retinol Rx creams and they made my skin very soft and smooth. So I started a new regime of cleansing at night with this Olay spinning brush and some cleanser then applying this.  In the morning, I wash gently and use the cream again. In a couple days all these &amp;#34;plugs&amp;#34; started coming out of the enlarged pores in my face and the pores got smaller.  My skin did get a little dry, so now I just use it at night after scrubbing my face and I have noticed smoother skin and less fine lines.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; about this... but certainly not the results.  Waste of $$$.</li>
    <li> nice moisturizer, really feels like it gets absorbed.</li>
    <li> To early to tell ,I will get back with you in thirty days</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling soft, &amp; not greasy</li>
    <li> Great product and FABULOUS price</li>
    <li> This is a nice light moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 1 month, and have not seen any results (e.g. smoother skin, line reduction, color correctness, etc. ). The moisturizer is not scented, which is nice. It seems to absorb into the skin fairly well, so it doesn&#x27;t sit on top. As for seeing any improvements in skin texture, I don&#x27;t see any changes. If seeking a moisturizer that will improve skin appearance, I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything they&#x27;ve touted it to be, a far greater quality than most out there on the market for a great deal more.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> This review is based on 8 weeks use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer has a smooth creamy texture, at the beginning it may feel a little oily at first but as it seeps into the skin that disappears.It is scent free, which is very important, because I find the older I get the more strong smells bother me. That is especially the case when it comes to skincare products. Just like the [[ASIN:B00L4HJX7O OZ Naturals Facial Mask - The BEST Moisturizing Face Mask Contains Rosehip Oil, Pro Vitamin B5 &amp; Amino Acids - This Anti Aging Face Mask Provides A Hydration Tsunami That Deeply Hydrates &amp; Nourishes Your Skin Cells For That Dewy, Youthful Glow! Results ...]], this also has a cooling effect on the skin. You also don&#x27;t need a lot of this product, a few pea size amounts suffice for the face.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using this a day moisturizer you need to be aware that it doesn&#x27;t contain a SPF factor, obviously this doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re using it as a night cream.&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using it on the upper chest and neck area with visible results. The skin is softer, smoother and less dry. Oz Naturals are quickly becoming a skincare favourite in our house.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free copy of this product courtesy of OZ Naturals for the purposes of reviewing it.</li>
    <li> I really like it. I&#x27;ll keep you posted.&lt;br /&gt;It feels like it penetrates and moisturizes and it appears as if it got rid of some crepey skin on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep you posted after I finish the entire tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Auretha,&lt;br /&gt;Visibility Expert &amp; Soul Stylist&lt;br /&gt;Auretha.com</li>
    <li> I do like the feel of my skin while using this.  Gentle peeling continues, smoothing out my skin.  Makes my crepe like skin look less dry. Plan to continue this product use.</li>
    <li> Love it! !!!! The best!!</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer, very light.  I only use it at night instead of daytime under my makeup, but it&#x27;s light and I like that. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Before buying any product, regardless of price or brand I check out all the listed ingredients and reviews. I was excited to find a product with such a high percentage of retinol and at such an attractive price.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the reviews were negative as they said it dried their skin, not my experience. I use Oz Naturals Hyuralonic acid prior to application and no dryness. Excited to see how I do with continued use.</li>
    <li> After about a month of use, I can see the difference in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles!  They seem to be evening out and becoming less noticeable----my skin is smoother and more even.  I&#x27;ve had questions asked of me such as  &amp;#34;did you do something to your face?  Your skin looks really good!&amp;#34; At 63 years old, this cream is a keeper!!</li>
    <li> I received this with a promotional discount. This stuff is amazing! You can tell its quality when you squeeze a little onto your hands! And yes you only need a little to cover your whole face! The smell isn&#x27;t atrong at all and my face doesn&#x27;t feel oily or too tight after!</li>
    <li> I feel this product works as a moisturizer but not as a retinol product. It is a bit misleading in that respect. It does not contain the proper type of retinol that you would normally want to see in this type of moisturizer to see the type of results that most people are going to be looking for with this type of product. It does however work very nicely as a light moisturizer and absorbs quickly into the skin. It helps me to have a nice light cream I can use and my face is not nearly as dry. The color might be slightly improved, but that is the best I can say. I do appreciate the fact that it is odor free and is not heavy. It is my least favorite product by OZ naturals though...</li>
    <li> What a great cream! Leaves my face refreshed and moisturized, and I wake up looking rested. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Soothing, refreshing and pleasantly fragrance free, this moisturizer smoothed out the appearance if your skin. You can see the difference after just a few uses. Works great under make up or as a night time therapy. I was lucky enough to purchase this at a reduced price but will buy again.</li>
    <li> I saw good reviews before I made the decision to buy this moisturizer. But I was a little disappointed as it is not as moisture as other cream I used, though I used their anti-aging serum. I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for several months, and I like it.  It moisturizes and absorbs well.  In addition, it does not cause me skin irritation - which is often a problem for me.  I am a long-time user of retinol (e.g., from Skinceuticals). But despite the high, 2.5% content of retinol in this product, I just don&#x27;t see any retinol-type results.  Therefore, I can only view the product as an excellent moisturizer. Still, I am very glad to have moist skin, with no breakouts.  The reason for my 3-star rating comes from two problems.  Firstly, the tube releases at least twice the needed moisturizer every time you squeeze it.  And that means you&#x27;re paying twice-as-much for a product that is already expensive  -  just to be an outstanding moisturizer.  In addition, the manufacturer advertises  &amp;#34;$6.25 off your entire purchase&amp;#34; if you buy the product.  But the code provided doesn&#x27;t work when you paste it in.  UPDATE:  After using this product for about 6 months, I found it to be &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; and well-priced.  However, as of July, 2016, the formulation has been changed.    I was wrong about the original 3-star rating.  It should have been a 5-star one.  But now the 3-star rating is justified, and I returned my second tube.</li>
    <li> I like this gentle retinol moisturizer for daytime, when it is overcast.  Also great for night time.</li>
    <li> Wow, nice thick product. If it gets your skin a bit too shiny, you&#x27;ve probably put too much on and it couldn&#x27;t soak in properly. It doesn&#x27;t really effect my makeup later when I apply, and I love that I am getting some vitamin E and anti-aging properties in this.&lt;br /&gt;My skin doesn&#x27;t feel refreshed or anything after using it, but that&#x27;s not really what this product was made for. I am unsure if I have actually seen results , however I will continue to use it(have for a few weeks now) until I feel like I need a change.&lt;br /&gt;I also use their Vitamin C  Facial Cleanser - along with my Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a retinol product in the winter since I spend most of my time indoors. This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used in awhile and my fine lines are noticeably diminished from using it, along with the other OZ product line. Youth in a bottle.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery...amazing product!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer but I only gave it 4 stars because during the cold MO winters I need a little more moisture. Sometimes my skin still feels a little dry using this. I think it will be great for spring and summer though! I have sensitive skin and I was worried the retinol might irritate but it has not! This company has some great products at great prices, and no I have not profited in any way from these reviews.</li>
    <li> My skin is so soft after using this moisturizer. It does make my skin a little more sensitive to light, but is otherwise amazing. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for soft, glowing skin! It is not greasy or heavy.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping for the results many others have stated they&#x27;ve noticed but it didn&#x27;t work for me. Will stick with what I know.</li>
    <li> Although I like OZ Naturals....I never received this product. Instead I got 2 bottles of vitamin c serum. I absolutely LOVE the serum</li>
    <li> Lots of compliments on my skin since I started using this.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome I use it everyday and my skin is so soft. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this moisturizer. I am in my twenties and I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or age spots yet, but I would really like to prevent them because I spend a lot of time in the sun. I like that this moisturizer is non scented and smooths onto the skin nicely. It is creamy and has a nice weight. I have been worried though about the note on the back that says to be sure to always wear sunscreen when wearing this product and for a few days after discontinuing use because of the retinal. I hate that I have to add another step in my morning routine and another cream to put on my face. I much prefer a face moisturizer that has some spf. Instead of one that requires sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Just got this today and used this evening. So far....LOVE it. So silky and FIRMing, so hydrating.  I am very impressed with the awesome quality of these OZ products and I am hooked! I am also astounded that the cost of this is only $27.49 for a full 4 oz. This is definitely the best value over the 8 oz. size, plus I received $5 off when I purchased the Hyaluronic serum.</li>
    <li> I use both the Sea Infused moisturizer (during the day) and the OZ Naturals Retinol moisturizer (at night). I love the retinol moisturizer, but the Sea Infused moisturizer is a bit too watery, has an odd color and doesn&#x27;t seem to really diminish the dryness I feel on my face. Especially since I&#x27;m using the retinol moisturizer which tends to be very drying. I use the retinol moisturizer to diminish lines and help reduce aging, but is not really a moisturizer. It actually dries out skin, turning over the top layer of skin cells more quickly, and a good moisturizer is very important. I will keep looking for a better daytime moisturizer, but am happy with the results of the Retinol moisturizer.</li>
    <li> One of the things that I love isthat  after I have used this at night is how smooth my skin is, even the next morning. It is also incredibly soft. I generally have a clear complexion anyway, but even starting from that point, there is a huge diffrencev in my skin.No more patches,dry scaly skin,wrinkles etc,smooth as a baby skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a number of products from OZ and have been really lovedwith their products. I swear by their products they are the best in the market,no other compares.I had used Clinique ,clairol.revlon, olay, meaningful breauty, But they do not compare oz,oz outstands them.It works much better ,I highly reccommend to anyone,you&#x27;ll be so happy with the results.I give the 10 out of 10 stars.#1. Im in love with oz skin care line it is a life saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer warns to use sunscreen outside for several days longer than you use this product. Luckily for me, at this time of year, this isn’t a problem.</li>
    <li> No noticeable results after several weeks of exclusive use.</li>
    <li> Yeah, didn&#x27;t do anything for my wrinkles.  Made me breakout like a 15 year old instead...if it turned my body back to what it looked like when I was 15, I&#x27;d take the trade...but alas, wrinkles and acne in my mid 30&#x27;s???  Yeah, not so attractive.  Sent it back. Hoping for refund. Already switched back to Neutrogena, and the whole line has taken at least 5-8 years off of my appearance.  I&#x27;ll never cheat again, Neutrogena!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff I have ever come across! I spend $400 for moisturizers at Saks Fifth Avenue and i doesn&#x27;t come close to this. I use it 2-3 times daily and in 3 days I look 5 years younger and it doesn&#x27;t stop there. AMAZING WORTH EVERY PENNY GR8 ALTERNATIVE TO SURGERY  I use a lot of things in the past but never again! I have found the best answer. I am 55 years old!!</li>
    <li> I like the texture and consistency of this moisturizer.  It absorbs nicely into the skin.  Is it &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34;?  I don&#x27;t know, as the product just arrived two weeks ago and I haven&#x27;t seen any results as yet.  I will give it another two weeks before reaching a decision as to its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I have normal to oily skin and in the hot summer months I don&#x27;t always need a facial moisturizer.  However, when the weather turns cold my skin can become dry, and I also want to prevent signs of aging - so I am beginning to moisturize my face regularly.  So far this moisturizer seems to be working very well for me.  I have chemical sensitivities and am allergic to some fragrances, so I appreciate that this product is 71% organic ingredients. It feels very natural and does not have any strong fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer after cleansing and any serums I choose. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin seems a bit tighter and smoother after using all of these products.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that my mineral makeup seems to stay on better after applying this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes. I plan to continue to use these products and hope to keep my skin smoother and prevent some signs of aging in the future.</li>
    <li> Awesome moisturizer!!!  I love everything about it.  My lines are less visible and my skin looks brighter.  I have VERY sensitive skin too, and this didn&#x27;t irritate it in the least.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Truly did see a difference in my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried Nerium for 3months and wasted my time &amp; money.  This with the Vitamin C showed big improvements in about 2wks.  Much less expensive and the science has been proven.  Hooked!</li>
    <li> Love this brand of facial products!</li>
    <li> I was considering buying this product until i got suspicious and i found out (on their website) that this contains Retinyl Palmitate, NOT Retinol - although it deceptively claims 2.5% clinical strength \\&quot;retinol cream\\&quot;. Retinyl Palmitate is not the same thing, and needs to be converted to Retinol then to Retnoic Acid to do its work on the skin - therefore, you need more Retinyl Palmitate compared to Retinol to get similar results. You can Google it for more detailed information on the differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In either case, just know that even though it sounds like you&#x27;re getting more and something stronger, it&#x27;s not 2.5% Retinol that you&#x27;re buying (generally more expensive). Seller is trying to pass off as if the two are the same or the terms can be used interchangeably - they are NOT the same. And it&#x27;s deceptive to label it as being Retinol when it&#x27;s Retinyl Palmitate.</li>
    <li> Great! I can really see a difference. The OZ products are the first products that actually changed my skin. I actually can see a difference in the size of my pores and a reduction in my &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer and while I have only been using it for a week, I believe I will continue to like it. It goes on well, is thick and creamy, but absorbs well, too, and makeup goes over it easily.</li>
    <li> I wear this as my nighttime moisturizer. Works well on acne-prone newly 30 skin (even when placed over benzyl peroxide cream). A little goes a long way with this stuff which is awesome!</li>
    <li> I see some improvement in my skin and I will continue to use this product until it&#x27;s all gone to see if I get the improvement I hoped for.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference yet.</li>
    <li> I put it under my eyes a few times a weeks and after a month or two it has gotten rid of the fine lines in that area.</li>
    <li> I am always very honest in my reviews and I really love this cream. My skin is sensitive so I thought that this would irritate my skin because of the retinol. I have been using it for weeks now and haven&#x27;t gotten irritated yet. The added, moisturizing ingredients really combat the irritation of Retinol. I have seen a definite improvements in my skins elasticity and fine lines. Great product</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally post a review after one use. And I am a HUGE skeptic by nature now, so it&#x27;s very hard to earn five stars with me if its not true. This stuff is AAAAAMAZING!!!!! After one use my face looks tightened, and toned again. I found my new Moisturizer. Thank You OZ!!!!</li>

    <li> This surprised me I am ready to order the whole line it really works!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. It is very hard to find a good moisturizer with my type of skin because it&#x27;s very dry. But I got a winner with this one. When I applied it to my face my skin absorbed it rather quickly and it didn&#x27;t feel greasy. My skin is looking so good and i feel my skin soft all day long. I also use the moisturizer when I go to bed and the next dry my skin looks hydrated and not dry like before. This is an amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer. I have really dry skin. I usually have to use  greasy moisturizer to cover it up. This is not greasy and works and feels great. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this product in the evening -since its retinol rather than day time.  Nice product - I have sensitive skin and this product doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.  I use this product along with the Hydralanic Acid can really see the difference these products are making.  The retinol product is not as moisturizing as my other moisturizers that I use.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is my second OZ Natural product (I purchased the eye gel and gave it a 5 star review).  I have been using it every night for almost 2 weeks, and all I can say is WOW!.. I loved it from the first night.  The texture is light like mousse and absorbs quickly into my skin making it feel soft but not greasy.  Every morning I have awakened with my skin looking softer and brighter.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product, it was free for review.  I liked it so much, I went ahead and bought it when I ran out.  It is definitely my favorite moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. Goes on smooth without feeling greasy and it helps with my fine lines. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> These past weeks that I have been using it, I have seen a difference in my skin. My pores are smaller and I see my skin has tightened. I prefer to use it at night since my skin is sensative and its gets a little red.</li>
    <li> My skin is oily, and I have been told it is acne prone, even though I actually rarely break out. Since I have started using this product, I have not had any zits, and I have been very impressed with the quality of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as part of a new &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; skin regimen I&#x27;ve recently started, and since starting this regimen, I have in fact noticed that the tiny forehead and neck lines I was starting to see in the morning don&#x27;t seem to stick around for very long or don&#x27;t appear at all. I should add that I am fairly young (around 30) and am mostly interested in preventing these temporary wrinkles from becoming more permanent establishments. I&#x27;m not sure how this works for someone with already established wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Aveeno sunscreen, a silk pillow for sleeping, a few drops of almond oil at night, a coconut oil washing once a day, an Aztec mud mask with apple cider vinegar once a week, a daily apricot scrub, a daily slathering on of an all-natural retinal product, and a frequently used rose water toner all at once. With that being said, I am not sure if one product had more of a role than the others. I have been very satisfied with the products I have purchased, though.  Whew, I feel like that is a lot, especially considering I was just washing with water a month or so ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in knowing any of the specific brands, please let me know! Otherwise, happy shopping! I hope you find what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> This product is ok. I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for about a month and I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Ive us it like that its natural very smooth texture-</li>
    <li> I do like this Retinol product, but I have to careful on my face, so I apply it over my regular moisturizer but only every 2 to 3 days. I still get dryness if I don&#x27;t . I do use it on my neck and upper chest over moisturizer and it&#x27;s helped some &amp;#34; sun damaged &amp;#34; areas. It&#x27;s a good price and a nice product, I guess I&#x27;m sensitive to any Retinol product .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy, because I have oily skin, but I like that it&#x27;s natural and contains vitamin E, rose hip, etc.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer sinks right in and hydrates right away.  After just one week of use, I can definitely see a difference- my skin feels firmer, less wrinkled and it appears softer and brighter.  Plus, this formulation is cruelty-free and vegan which meets my high ethical standards.  I will definitely be recommending OZ Naturals Products to all of my family and friends in the future!</li>
    <li> Below is a review of this product which i had been using for about 2 years.  I originally gave it 5 stars.  However last time I ordered this product it seemed different.  It was a lot thinner and it had a bad odor to it.  I couldnt believe it! It was so disappointing as I had previously been so pleased with it.  It didnt even feel good on my skin.  It may have been a fluke but I am afraid to order it again as I feel like the formula may have changed.  I regret not returning it, but really didnt even think to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PREVIOUS REVIEW:  I got this product right away and was very pleased with it. I love the consistency of this cream.  It has a silky feel that makes my skin feel softer as soon as it is applied. I have tried many drug store moisturizers and nothing compares to this. Also the 4oz size is a good buy (especially with free shipping) as compared to other products I have used in the past.  I use it with the Vitamin C serum . . . its a winning combination.  I&#x27;m sold on these products.</li>
    <li> I admit, I tried many regiments before and was skeptical that anything could produce such results as they claimed.  I purchased this product about 3 wks ago and have been using it daily.  I bought the vitamin C serum, eye cream, retinol moisturizer, and spray toner.  I have been using all 4 of these products as part of my morning and nighttime cleansing ritual. In just this short time, I have gotten noticeable results.  I am  41 years old with combination normal/oily skin and uneven skin tones.  I had horrible blackheads on my nose and forehead which have drastically shrunk in size and my face looks great!  The dark rings under my eyes have faded a lot, my uneven tones are starting to even out and I am happier than I thought I would be.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like in another 3 wks.  I have tried others and noticed they caused slight stinging or burning - I thought that meant they are working and was I wrong!  This didn&#x27;t cause stinging and actually felt great!  What impressed me the most was the follow up email I received from the selling company OZ!  they emailed me with directions for use, what to expect, and gave me their contact information.  I mean, what company does that these days?  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer cream was definitely a good choice. As far as anti-Aging, I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a comparable product in this price range. They really take the time at OZ naturals to make a product that&#x27;s safe, natural, healthy and works wonders for your skin. I&#x27;m used countless over the counter moisturizers, but I really enjoyed how this product made my face feel. I felt like I had healthier skin, it felt younger and less damaged. It really helped keep my skin healthy too and avoid excess dryness. Great product with no adverse effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was given this product to sample and provide honest feedback for potential buyers. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> am still using product, haven&#x27;t decided about results yet.</li>
    <li> This tube will give you younger looking skin and that beautiful youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to my mother that is in her sixties, and asked her to only use this product besides her nightly facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first week she started to see some improvement on the fine line and wrinkles. After two weeks, I was even able to see a change in here overall appearance. Her skin had a fuller youthful glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she swears by this cream. This is coming from a woman that has been using \\&quot;St. Ives\\&quot;, since I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</li>
    <li> I use this great product morning and night, it&#x27;s cold and my skin is dry this time of year. Gives my skin a nice glow and the best is the reduction in wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I use the product everyday, morning, night and it is really great.  It takes only a small touch to smooth over the entire face and throat. It is as good as the product ad.</li>
    <li> I am not one for daily moisturizers, however, since I am quickly becoming a huge fan of the other OZ Naturals products, I decided to give this a try and I am so happy I did.... I can honestly say that I am in love with this product and it is simply AMAZING!!! My skin has never looked so luminous or radiant and I have only been using this for a short period of time thus far... Even my husband has complimented me on how great my skin looks! Finally, a product line that delivers results in a natural way! Thank you OZ Naturals!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Makes my face soft.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell what it will do for my face.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift from a relative who liked it. Caused an instant rash on my chin which did not go away for a week. Had to spend money on a dermatologist. This product ended up costing me lots of money in the end. If its all natural. This should not have happened.</li>
    <li> This is my first review of any product on Amazon. I started using it over 4 weeks ago and I found my skin to be much brighter and clearer than before. I certainly have seen the changes in terms of my blemishes/sun spots reduction. I&#x27;m 28 years old so having a brighter skin with glow was my main concern. Wrinkles is not one of my problems even though I can see and feel my skin to be younger. I use it only 3-4 times a week, I&#x27;ll probably use it again.</li>
    <li> still waiting  for more results, so far so good.</li>
    <li> I love this retinol moisturizer, it leave my skin feeling soft and smooth.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin doesn&#x27;t have the roughness it used to have and it&#x27;s evening out my complexion.  This is the first retinol product I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;ll continue to use it going forward.  I&#x27;m 61 and my skin condition is very important to me, I believe this is just the product I needed.</li>
    <li> The return policy should have provided me insight into the quality of the product line but I was too impressed with so many glowing reviews.(Now I wonder how many are real).  I also read a business news item about  the products flying off shelves and how well the company is doing.  Great, I thought - and bought the WHOLE LINE.  It&#x27;s a sham.  Did nothing for my skin.  Beware of companies that don&#x27;t back up their product with a generous return policy:  there is a reason</li>
    <li> I love how this cream makes my skin feel.  It gives it a smooth texture and does not promote dryness.  Within a couple days of usage I can see noticeable positive changes occurring with the appearance, and texture.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer combines moisturizing ingredients such as aloe with vitamin E and hyaluronic acid. This is a white creamy lotion and could only detect a slight scent which is similar to what most unscented lotions smell like. It is not greasy on the skin and absorbs quickly and my skin feels softer, firmer and moisturized. This does not irritate my sensitive skin in any way. The one downside to this moisturizer is that it does make your skin a bit sensitive to the sun and indicates you should wear sunscreen. Early results seem promising with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Made my face oily and broke out in acne.</li>
    <li> This product is really good considering the price and it&#x27;s very firming ! So I must say it does what it promises, one thing I didn&#x27;t like in this cream is that it doesn&#x27;t give me a glow or doesn&#x27;t make my skin look dewy healthy. But it&#x27;s good for mature skin I guess.</li>
    <li> I love all of Oz Natural products. I have a regimen going with them. I use this one morning and night. The only reason I haven&#x27;t given it 5 stars is that I wish my skin had more of a glow from it. I have noticed an improvement in my skin after starting Oz skincare. I use the Organic Skin Toner (am/pm), Vitamin C Serum (am), Hyaluronic Acid Serum (am/pm) and the Retinol Serum (pm). I&#x27;m 51 and look younger for using these products. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I have become so accustomed to this basic, yet necessary, step in my skin care that I can&#x27;t imagine how I ever did without it.  This moisturizer literally gives my skin a new feel every morning.  It moisturizes like no other product I have used. And the list is pretty lengthy!  My skin goes from shower dry to youthfull smooth in a matter of seconds.  I prep my face with the serum first and this lotion is just soaked up by my skin.  It feels wonderful and looks great to boot. I cannot go without it for even a day...it is fabulous!</li>
    <li> Soaks in, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy....like this the best of  all the ones tried, seems to be making a difference!</li>
    <li> It has taken me 36 years to find a product that doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greesy. I love live love this stuff and recommend it to any one</li>
    <li> I like the product so far.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturiser. I have only used it a few times but already I think I&#x27;ve seen a slight improvement to the appearance of fine lines. I haven&#x27;t had any adverse reactions or sensitivity to it either. Note that you do need to wear sunscreen while using the product and for a few days afterwards as it can make your skin sensitive to the sun, but as I wear tinted moisturiser with SPF a lot of the time anyway, it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals products are amazing !!  After years of total neglect and abuse from sun damage and cigarette smoking my face had paid the price.  I had  wrinkles around my upper lip, cheeks, deep crows feet, and a neck that looked like a  crumbled up paper bag.  I decided to give OZ Naturals a try and purchased The Best Retinol Moisturizer and the Vitamin C 20% Amino Blend Hyaluronic Acid Serum, The results for me were immediate ! I noticed that my skin was softer, smoother and after about 1 week the wrinkles were markedly improved. I have since purchased the  Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Vitamin C Serum, 2.5% Retinol Astaxanthin &amp; Vitamin E Serum and the Sea Infused Herbal Moisturizer(which I love). I  I know all products are making a great difference overall with skin tone, softness and most of all the wrinkles. Best products I have ever used and will continue. Looking forward to any new products.</li>
    <li> Product leaves face too dry even after moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Once again, OZ Naturals has done it! You can&#x27;t beat the product for the price. I love their Retinol Moisturizer. A word of warning: It did not sting like some others do but, for about the first week or two of using it, my skin would get a little red and itchy. I started using it every couple of nights and worked my way to every night. I no longer have a problem so I think that your skin (at least mine did) needs to get &amp;#34;used to it&amp;#34;. I love the fact that it&#x27;s natural, affordable, and works just as well, if not better, than the high priced brands.</li>
    <li> I was a bit sceptical about using this product as it wasn&#x27;t cheap and I didn&#x27;t want to feel like I had wasted my money. I haven&#x27;t, I love this moisturiser and for some one who suffers from tiny spots under the skin in her forties the benefits have been really good. The spots are starting to go and my skin  feels and looks lovely. Thank you OZ Naturals</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have used. Love the OZ products. Works well with my skin</li>
    <li> Just started using this thinks it&#x27;s wonderful! My skin on my neck is starting to improve and the brown spots around my hairline are beginning to subside.  So far so good! My skin feels amazing!</li>
    <li> The absolute best moisturizer I have ever used! It&#x27;s great on hands, face, elbows, knees and feet! Instant results! Love love love!&lt;br /&gt;*received for free but my opinion is my own</li>
    <li> I have been using Super Youth Retinol Moisturizer for two months now, and am very pleased so far. Since I am over 70, I thought I should use this product a bit longer than most before I reviewed it! I can see improvement in both  wrinkles and  dark spots, so it is addressing my main concerns. I plan to continue using it, and expect to see even more improvement over time. Thanks, Oz Naturals!!!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for 2 months. It leaves my face with a comfortable feeling. I do noticed my fine lines have been faded after using the products for 2 months. My breakout had cut down so far but still have one or 2 once awhile. Like it so far.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I am a 49 year old woman who&#x27;s skin is showing the signs of ageing and wanted a natural product that really works and is reasonably priced ... I have found it ! I use it over the Vitaminc C oz naturals serum and my skin seems to have rejuvenated and the wrinkles are less noticeable but most importantly I have recommend OZ naturals to to my mum who has had skin cancer on her face and I have been searching for natural products for her delicate skin and this fantastic moisturiser works perfectly and she now is a regular user of all the Oz Naturals products .</li>
    <li> Very Good Moisturizer.  I am hooked on OZ Naturals. I was introduced to them on Amazon and this is where I go for all my OZ products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend.  Easy on the skin and does the job!</li>
    <li> Wow! This stuff really, really works. And I never say that. Just be patient and apply after thorough cleansing morning and night. It absorbs very well and isnt greasy, can be used in day as well as night, according to the enclosed info. I also use the OZ Naturals Vit C serum with it. Great stuff I wish Id found ten years ago.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 10 days and really like the formula. It goes on and absorbs easily with no residue. I have yet to notice a change in sunspots but do find my skin has gotten smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product for a true and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Tried it for months and didn&#x27;t see any results. I don&#x27;t recommend it!</li>
    <li> Unbelievable. This stuff is magic. Much less expensive than famous and expensive product I was buying. And it works, ladies.</li>
    <li> I have used LOTS of different products in my 55 years but I have to say I have seen more improvement on wrinkles and fine lines with this product. It is non greasy and leaves my skin so soft. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 months and am very pleased. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This Product really bring a healthy surface.</li>
    <li> Holy grail night cream! Fades spots, moisturizes, and plumps!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this moisturize for a couple of weeks, and I can already see a difference in the pain lines around my mouth. My skin also has a better texture - I had dry, flaky patches, especially around my nose that are already smoothing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum. After washing my face I use the serum and then the moisturizer. I got the Serum at the request of the company for a review. As I needed moisturizer anyway I picked up this product. I am glad I did - I look forward to seeing what my skin is like after I have used the product for a couple of months.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for 3 months and do not see any difference at all. Using argan oil for 2 weeks shows a much greater difference. Also I would think with this product you should feel it working - I do not.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it! She noticed a positive difference in the complexion and texture of her skin.</li>
    <li> ***** I WAS GIVEN A COMPLEMENTARY SAMPLE OF THIS PRODUCT FOR AN HONEST REVIEW*****  Really hydrates and protects through the rough dry winter - my skin is smooth, and clear with out any build up. Just a small amount and it spreads and covers well. I really like the OZ Naturals and the BEST Retinol Moisturizer is exactly that &#x3D; THE BEST!!!!  Clean, clear skin that is beautifully hydrated!</li>
    <li> First of all I have to mention that this is a large tube, most tubes or jars of moisturizer that I have bought come in such small containers with a high price tag.  Another big pro for me is that this is made in the USA.  This moisturizer claims that it is a cocktail of antioxidants with vitamin A, that will help diminish fine lines and signs of premature aging. I am over 40 so thought this might be perfect for me, I have been using it at night after washing my face and applying either argan or avocado oil and it is very smooth, goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  Be careful not to use to much, you don&#x27;t need a lot to do your face and neck.  There isn&#x27;t really any scent to this lotion.  I like it and am hoping to see a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is white, moderately viscous, and has a neutral odor.  It leaves the skin silky after application.  It is packaged in a generous 4 oz. tube with a flip cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains multiple ingredients to moisturize, soften, and protect the skin, from aloe to shea butter, plus hyaluronic acid and vitamins that support skin health and structure on a cellular level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is especially helpful on problem areas with dry and flaky or cracked skin.  I apply it several times a day and it definitely promotes healing.  It also does not irritate my sensitive skin, even around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (71% organic):  organic Aloe barbadensis (Aloe vera), isopropyl palmitate (palm oil), kosher vegetable glycerin, cetyl alcohol, stearic acid, glyceryl stearate, organic Carthamus tinctorius (safflower oil), Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond oil), hyaluronic acid, retinyl palmitate (vitamin A), tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E), organic Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba oil), organic Camellia sinensis (green tea), organic resina propoli (propolis), Butyrospermum parkii (shea butter), panthenol (vitamin B5), phenoxyethanol, ethylhexyl glycerin, xanthan gum, allantoin, citric acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OZ Naturals provided a tube for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I really like these products, they seem to be very effective and working!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Skincare products are very personal. It might just be me, but I found this moisturizer to dry my skin clog pores and make my face sweat</li>
    <li> ** Buy a sunscreen of some sort..  This has no protection!!  You need SPF if you are trying to PROTECT further damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, so far this feels really nice.  The first few days it was greasy... don&#x27;t panic.  Stay with it a few more days and that should change for you. I have extremely sensitive skin, super large pores on my nose and chin, wrinkles around the eyes and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;This isnt a miracle.  My pores didnt disappear (not physically possible.. dont trust anything that claims otherwise!). My wrinkles are still there, damage, etc..  but my skin feels softer.  It looks a tiny bit brighter.  I&#x27;m happy.  I&#x27;m not thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably keep looking for something that I LOVE.  But seriously, I have nothing bad to say about this, other than I wish it had SPF.</li>
    <li> So far so good....just started using it.  Will check back when I have been using for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I have only used this for one day, but I am already noticing a difference in my skin. I would absolutely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Update!  I&#x27;m 50 now and still using OZNaturals Retinol.  My fine lines have definitely decreased and I love this stuff!  I have sensitive skin and recommend this cream to anyone who does!   At 49 I have never used any anti-aging products so this is the first time I&#x27;ve used a retinol product (which is why I&#x27;m giving 4 stars since I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to).  I have been pleasantly surprised and definitely have noticed a difference in the week I have been using it.  My face feels fresher and brighter without a lot of harsh chemicals.  I also love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell.  I have very sensitive skin and have had no problem using this moisturizer - love it!</li>
    <li> Not for me can&#x27;t use it dried my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pharmacist &amp; many years ago anything with retinol or by products of it. Had to have a prescription. It was initially used for acne but dermatologists were inundated with requests once the word got out that it took away wrinkles . The thing is that chemical is very sensitive to sunlight , so you had to stop it around beach time or just apply at night.. OZ has made a really nice cream &amp; my skin is so oily in places, I used to make my own . It&#x27;s not oily as the day progresses and just feels great.</li>
    <li> An &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; moisturizer.  I found it to be drying but that was expected.  I wont purchase it again, I need something less drying.  I think will work for you if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or dry skin.  My skin is a combination, I have certain areas more prone to being dry like my forehead and eyebrows, while my nose and especially my chin area tend to be more oily, so it isn&#x27;t the products fault really its my skin, and this stuff just didn&#x27;t work for me, but it might work for you!  I didn&#x27;t request a refund or anything bc I gave it longer than the money back period, but if you buy it and don&#x27;t like it you can get your money back within 30 days! That is a GREAT policy!</li>
    <li> Fair not sure of any results.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizing cream I&#x27;ve ever used! It goes on very smoothly and feels great all day long.  I don&#x27;t have problems with aging skin yet, but I think that using this cream will prevent that.  I love that it&#x27;s made with many natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Oz Naturals products now for about six months and am pleased with the results. My allergies and sensitivities make it difficult to find a facial care regimen that doesn&#x27;t cause me problems. Before discovering the Oz Naturals products, I was using a natural, olive oil based soap and moisturizer. This was working better than anything else I had tried, but I still had frequent breakouts and a couple of dry, rough patches that wouldn&#x27;t go away no matter what I tried.  My skin was always blotchy looking, so I constantly used foundation to help cover my uneven skin tones. I started using the Oz Ocean Minerals Facial Cleanser, then added the Hyaluronic Acid Serum, the Eye Gel and the Super Youth Moisturizer. Those rough dry patches I&#x27;d had for several months completely disappeared within the first week of use and in less than two weeks, my skin tone had improved significantly and my breakouts were gone. The Retinol Moisturizer leaves my skin feeling better moisturized than the olive oil product I was using prior to this.  It goes on a bit heavy, but quickly soaks in and leaves my face feeling smooth and nourished, with no irritation.  Within five to ten minutes of using the moisturizer, I can apply my powder foundation with no stickiness or other problems.  With the tube lasting me six months or more, I feel the product is not only effective, but also a good value.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have noticed considerable improvement in my complexion. Fine lines around my eyes have disappeared. I would definitely recommend these product.</li>
    <li> This is the best retinol cream I&#x27;ve used so far.  I like the way my face feels in the morning.  What I love most of all is that the retinol doesn&#x27;t dry my face at all!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is fabulous.  I have been using it for only a few days and I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.  I like it so much I am going to buy it as a gift for others.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is awesome! It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or thick and your skin will love it! I love how it can be used in the neck and décolleté area as well. OZ products are affordable products that do the job over and above.</li>
    <li> Will be a part of my 50+ skin regime.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it for a month yet, but so far I like the product. A little goes a long way so you&#x27;ll get a long use out of it.</li>
    <li> I can see my wrinkles turns better by just using about 3 times later. It&#x27;s amazing! They are still there right now, but it gives me confidence that this product works for my fine lines. And my skin looks tighter after using in about one week.  The only concern is, you have wear sunscreen when using this product. So, I use it only at night and then put other moisturizer with 15 SPF during daytime.  Update on 2/10/2106:  It is OK for my wrinkles but I feel it&#x27;s a burden for me to worry about the sunshine all the time. And it is little bit dry for my skin. So, I changed to use the Bee Friendly products now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say I love it but I just received it 2 days ago.  so far so good</li>
    <li> I purchased three OZ naturals products: this one, the hyaluronic acid serum, and Vitamin C serum and started using all at the same time. I don&#x27;t know which one works more than the other, but in concert (which is recommended), they work fantastic! Just like any Retinol cream, this one smooths and evens out the texture, tone, and consistent pigment of my skin. I don&#x27;t have any actual wrinkles, although I do have minor fine lines and expression lines.  It made the former less noticeable, although the latter--hmm, dunno if anything can be done about them (I am thin and have little subcutaneous fat, and in addition the years--and decreasing collagen--are catching up to me). :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the same, I am pleased with the results.  I used to have some sun marks on my forehead due to the sun and my sensitive skin, but now it is completely gone--not a trace! As I mentioned, overall, the tone, color, and surface all seems a lot more consistent and even.  I have a lot of past damage from being young and dumb with regards to the sun and also a lot of stress.  It seems to have done a lot for my skin.  I do add Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream on top of these at night--although you could probably save some $$ and put on Petroleum Jelly instead, since that is essentially what the 8 hour cream is.  I might add that I don&#x27;t break out at all from this regimen, and I do have acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> This cream makes my face feel lifted  not tight but as though I have  had a good facial</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I found OZ Natural Products, this mosisturzer is AMAZING, Its a thick and rich moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling amazing..perfectly balanced and  not greasy at all.  I started using OZ natural products about a year ago, and I have been getting many compliments on my skin ever since.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;re counting the percentage but it&#x27;s in such a way that it&#x27;s not co portable to prescription or other retinol creams. It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I use this every day and love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really surprised that this works on my very sensitive skin. I am very weary of using just any product on my skin but glad I tried this one</li>
    <li> Been using this product twice daily for 3 months. Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.  No better than any other retail mosturizer. Plus you still need to add sunscreen which requires an additional step. Better off just buying a moisturizer that already has sunscreen included.  Save your money for better products that are out there that actually willdo something positive for your skin.</li>
    <li> This product is an excellent retinol moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Nice cream, happy with it so far. I use it twice a day</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product because I&#x27;m a fan of the Oz Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I am quite satisfied.  It goes on smoothly, is odorless, and non irritating.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping, like the Oz vitamin C serum, it will be another good skin care investment.</li>
    <li> Skin is softer and bouncier? Use on hands legs face arms.  I am shocked. It really really works. Throwing everything else out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this  cream  for about 3 weeks and like it. I have combo skin but don&#x27;t find this cream greasy at all. A little goes along way. I haven&#x27;t experience any acne episodes with this product either. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Awesome moisturizer! I use only at night. I use it with the OZ Naturals Organic Vitamin C + Amino + Hyraluronic Acid Serum and I swear my skin and complexion are noticeably different. I will continue to buy both of these products.</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for a few months, and liked the texture, it soaks in well, but its more a day cream then a night cream.</li>
    <li> I wanted to share my experience with using the OZ Naturals Retinol Moisturizer, as well as my mom&#x27;s experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many retinol moisturizers before, and most have not given me any issues. But when I tried the OZ Naturals Moisturizer, my skin turned very red, and I was very worried about the condition of my skin. The redness eventually went away, and I contacted Oz Naturals Customer Service. I explained to them the problem, and they were very helpful in explaining why my skin might be turning red. Oz Naturals Customer Service suggested that I can try to exfoliate my skin to rid of dead skin cells that might be drying out my skin even more. So I tried exfoliating for a few days, and when I went back to use the moisturizer, my skin was still experiencing redness. So I decided to give this moisturizer to my mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother tested a small portion of this product on her skin, and there was no reaction like the one I had. She has been using this for the past week, and I can definitely see a difference in her skin. She feels that her skin has more elasticity and firmer than before. I have even noticed that her face looks brighter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this moisturizer was not for me, and may not be for everyone, but it has definitely worked for my mother! She is impressed with the quality and the natural ingredients of this product. I will update this post once more results have been reported. I hope that this review was helpful in making your purchase decision.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of OZ Naturals products. My routine includes use of the cleansers, serums, and retinol gel and retinol moisturizer.  I alternate using the retinol gel and moisturizer at night and have noticed a improvement in the texture of my skin as well as some lightening of sun spots. Prior to discovering OZ Natural products, I was spending much more money on a retinol product that had harsh drying effect on my skin. This is a gentle retinol moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using anything with retinol, and I&#x27;m amazed on how well it works to get rid of dark spots. I have very light skin, so everything shows. 3 days in using it at night with the vitamin C serum, I&#x27;m seeing instant results.</li>
    <li> It works best with the vitamin c surem a little goes a long way so it last for quite awhile.</li>
    <li> Feels great.  I use it usually just at bedtime.  Makeup goes on better following Day because skin is hydrated.</li>
    <li> Face broke out awful.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this products and the whole OZ naturals line! Please check out my full review here on YouTube! Click on this link: [...]</li>
