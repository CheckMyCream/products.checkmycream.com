      <li>i&#x27;m super happy Amazon has it....</li>

      <li>better packaging would be nice.</li>

      <li>I have to admit this is much better than I thought it would be.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap and effective - my curls have never looked so curly.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t 100% satisfied with the way it made my hair feel.  </li>
      <li>Really a fantastic product for curly hair!</li>
      <li>I love the Suave Whipped Cream Mousse.  </li>
      <li>This mousse is ok but is sort of gummy</li>
      <li>think it might be because of all the hair I have, might work better on someone with thinner</li>
      <li>Let me start by saying that I love this mousse.</li>
      <li>more like an every day product</li>
      <li>Adjusting Curl Defining Mousse, 7 Ounce,  but does an okay job for the price.</li>
      <li>That just more solidifies that this is an HG product for anyone with curly hair.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t know why beauty companies discontinue products that so many people love.</li>
      <li>It took a couple of times to get used to this one,but I now like it just as much or more than I did the Redken.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ok, so my last favorite curl product (which I stockpiled when I thought it was being discontinued but later found it on Amazon) was the Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Curl Define Hold Creme.  I gave that product 5 stars also and have been using it for past couple of years.  I&#x27;m also a fan of Suave products and find them (like Consumer Reports reported) to work just as well as any of the higher end salon products.  So I kind of go between Suave and trying other products, and even recently got talked into buying a $32 salon styling cream last time I got my hair done at a very well-known and pricey salon in Atlanta.  Well, I wish I had saved my money as my conclusion after comparing this product to the salon purchase and to the Herbal Essences Curl Creme is that I hands down prefer this Suave curling mousse and it is my new favorite.  It gives me great curl definition, lots of shine and plenty of hold (even in the Atlanta area where the summers are super hot and humid).  Definitely worth the price and value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, here are the steps and tricks I follow and I get lots of compliments on my curls:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Towel dry then put the curl product in when hair is still fairly wet.&lt;br /&gt;2.  If winter and you need to dry out roots a bit, do so gently without moving hair around too much as this will make it frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Run a comb or brush through your wet, product treated hair to smooth out curls and get rid of frizz.&lt;br /&gt;4.  If you want more curls, scrunch your hair all over to help with curls (push from ends up)&lt;br /&gt;5.  Let it air dry naturally.&lt;br /&gt;6.  If hair is a little stiff after it&#x27;s all dried, run you hands gently over and slightly pull on hair to soften curls and waves.&lt;br /&gt;7.  If more volume is desired, flip your head down and gently run your fingers through your hair to break up curls then gently flip your head back upright.&lt;br /&gt;*** And I never use a blow dryer on my curls (even with a diffuser), only to blow out bangs or dry the roots in winter when I don&#x27;t want to go out with completely wet hair.  The blow dryer always causes frizz.</li>
    <li> This product holds curls nicely but leaves a nasty crunchy texture behind. Less is more with this one. I&#x27;d use half the product you normally do to limit the crunchy curly texture, unless you like that. :)</li>
    <li> OK, so I&#x27;m older than most of you, but I still have my own hair, and periodically I perm it.  Generally, the general population of hair products labeled \\&quot;mousse\\&quot; are designed to create volume, NOT curl.  Often times, curly hair will become frizzy if the wrong product is used.  Well, I found this product, and I will not buy any other mousse product - EVER.  This really defines and holds the curls AND creates volume without weighing down the hair.  I have even used this product without a perm and was happy with the result: the look of a fuller crop of hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on products for my naturally wavy hair and so far this has worked the absolute best and it was the least expensive of all the rest!</li>
    <li> This mousse did absolutely nothing for my curls. Very disappointing :(</li>
    <li> I have thick, partially curly, partially wavy, frizzy hair which is a nightmare to control. Having tried many, many products, this is the first I absolutely love. My curls are soft, not frizzy and hold all day. I recommend it to all my \\&quot;curly\\&quot; friends!  Cannot beat the price either. My advice is to use when hair is still wet, not damp for the best result.</li>
    <li> I have always used the standard mousse by Suave, the pink bottle....It was good but did dry out my hair...Then I used this product and it leaves my hair so soft and when I style it, it looks awesome!  I have thick and course hair, and its hard to tame, but this stuff really fits the bill...It leaves my hair so soft and manageable...Love it!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, frizzy hair. I have shoulder length hair and I apply this product 1 or 2 times, then allows my hair to air dry. My hair looks great! It does not make my hair feel stiff or look wet. And it does not turn into white dust after one day. I do sometimes pair this product with Morroccan Oil, but more often I use only this product. I hope this stays around, I&#x27;ve tried many other products and this is the ONLY hair product that works for me!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for people with thick, wavy/curly hair. Unfortunately the Suave company decided to discontinue it and now it&#x27;s available here, and almost four times the cost. I don&#x27;t know why beauty companies discontinue products that so many people love. That&#x27;s stupid.</li>
    <li> I have totally straight hair and I use this mousse to provide some bounce and hold some body and it works great. I know its for curly hair but it works wonderfully for my straight hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of hair products over the years.  I have naturally wavy hair and it needed some frizz and softness control.  I have tried other mousse products but have not found them to be something I would purchase again.  I love the Suave Whipped Cream Mousse.  It is part of my hair regiment these days.  It controls the frizz and keeps my hair looking and feeling soft.  I will continue to use this product and hope others will love it as much as my hair does.  It is not runny and does not build up on my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what kind of magic they put into this product, but it is hands down, the best hair product I have ever used in my life (I have 3a curls). Every hair on my head is in perfect ringlets when I use it. It looks like I&#x27;ve spent hours meticulously forming each curl into the perfect ringlet. I have used my fair share of different products and none of them even come close to beginning to start to approach how awesome this product is. I hope they never stop making it because I will never stop using it. It&#x27;s so good that when I travelled recently and realized I forgot it and would have to go a whole week without, I went out and bought another (good thing it&#x27;s only $3). You have to use quite a bit more than you think you&#x27;ll need, at least a golf ball for just below the shoulder length. It feels disgusting and sticky and horrible right when it&#x27;s first in, but if you massage it around until there&#x27;s no white showing and let it dry, it is not crunchy or sticky at all. It&#x27;s very important you put it in when your hair is very wet. Don&#x27;t towel dry it first. After using this my curls are soft and touchable, something no other mousse has ever allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;This mousse is weirdly good as a straightening treatment. I applied this like normal, then decided I wanted straight hair that day. So I let it air dry until damp and got to work. My hair cooperated and then some. I straightened it, put it up in a bun and let it sit, then when I let it down my hair was glossy, sleek and looked JUST like Kate Middleton&#x27;s hair. I was told multiple times I had princess hair and how amazing it looked. How odd! That just more solidifies that this is an HG product for anyone with curly hair.</li>
    <li> this mouse really helps my curls to come out- I have longer hair &amp; my natural curls do not last after a few hours, but this mouse really held the curls all day- it can be stiff if use too much. But I do like this if I want my natural curls to be seen</li>
    <li> It seems ok at first but I have thick curly hair it&#x27;s so dense it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb well into the hair. I tried it and even tried using less but it&#x27;s still weird just too thick..and doesn&#x27;t quite give me the hold I would like. I still prefer Tresemme for curly hair...better hold.</li>
    <li> I think people are surprised by the lack of air in the product when it comes out, and think it&#x27;s not dispensing right.  It is like a deflated whipped cream even when it comes out correctly, and that&#x27;s just the consistency of the product.  It goes on a little thick, and the first time I used it, I was tempted to get back in the shower and wash it out, it was so heavy.  I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t though, because after you blow dry, and I use a diffuser, the result is amazing!  Super soft curls with great definition!  Never that crunchy wet look that I hate so much!  Really a fantastic product for curly hair!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling weird and dirty.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous, inexpensive mousse that cuts down the frizz and adds definition to the curls. Love this product and would be sad if they discontinued it.</li>
    <li> Does not work as the reviews posted</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve SUPER curly hair. I do use other products that are a bit more expensive, but this has been a must for a few years now. I wear it about 3-4 times a week... more like an every day product and I use about two dollops on damp, de-tangled hair. I spread it all over my hair and let it air dry. If I am in a hurry, I just use this alone and it looks great. It&#x27;s not crunchy and the consistency of this product is really like a mousse. It&#x27;s super affordable and you just have to know how to work with your curly hair.</li>
    <li> Too sticky and impossible to get out of the bottle. Might as well call it gel! I would never recommend this. I stopped using this after 2 weeks (I thought I&#x27;d like it as  time went on).</li>
    <li> Great for my wavy frizzy hair.. Holds the wave without waying it down gives shine and manageability. I love it!</li>
    <li> This made my hair flat. It didn&#x27;t do much for me, and it seemed excessively sticky. After a dozen uses, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve brought almost every mousse sold at the drugstore and this one was one of my least favorites. I think the whipped cream texture makes it sort of thick to apply to the hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and let me just say: IT&#x27;S AWESOME. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; like Aussie. It looks like your hair is product free, which I love!  And its like $2.50! The curl holds all day even with my super thick, super stubborn hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is very, very sticky though (which is why I gave it a 4 and not a 5). My hands always feel really weird after applying it even though I washed/dried them.</li>
    <li> I had no idea that my hair could be so curly!  I have tried so many different products, and finally found one that works.  It holds all day, even in high humidity.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! I&#x27;ve had issues in the past with taming my curly hair but this works really well. It&#x27;s cheap and effective - my curls have never looked so curly. I&#x27;m really happy with it, although I am still learning about how to make it so that my hair doesn&#x27;t get all frizzy later. I used to use leave in conditioner and shine but this is all I need. Taking care of curly hair is a multi step process, but this makes it easier. I&#x27;m glad it was recommended to me and would recommend to others for a simple, effective way to manage curls.</li>
    <li> This is the only mousse that makes my hair not crunchy but can control my hair and not be frizzy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now. I have fine, slightly wavy hair...when I put this on my hair when it&#x27;s damp, scrunch with a towel, and air dry (or blow dry while scrunching), it gives me soft, defined waves. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy like so many other mousses do. This is one of my all-time favorite hair care products, and really can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>
    <li> So after years of gel used I&#x27;ve officially switched over to Mousse because the gel leaves my hair too hard and stringy.. I have thin curly hair and the wrong product can leave my hair feeling weighed down, lifeless, and straw-like. This one left my hair full, soft and bouncy. The curls are always just right - not too curly, not to droopy.. perfect! After trying to hunt this down in several stores with no luck, I looked on Amazon and found it here at a better price! I am so happy!</li>
    <li> Try Beyond Zone Noodle Head or Got 2 B Smooth Operator, I think they work best to manage curls.  This was an ok product.</li>
    <li> Having read all the great reviews here, I was expecting a much better product! it works just like other cheap products! you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I had been using the old formulation of Redken Spring Curls Mousse for years and was in mourning when I couldn&#x27;t find it any longer, even online.  Then, I read reviews on this and decided to try it as the price is certainly good.  It took a couple of times to get used to this one,but I now like it just as much or more than I did the Redken.  My hair is baby fine and very stubborn with lazy waves in the back.  I don&#x27;t scrunch, just apply a small amount and the result is perfectly formed waves on my short, layered cut.  Thanks Suave!</li>
    <li> Works really well, better than some of my other products. Makes my frizzy wavy hair controllable and tamed into actual waves&lt;br /&gt;You do need to follow the instructions for how to apply product. I found that my hair needs to be on the drier side of damp and it does help to scrunch you hair with a towel to remove excess moisture.&lt;br /&gt;This has been my best hair find in a long time.</li>
    <li> Not as good as Finesse Self Adjusting Curl Defining Mousse, 7 Ounce,  but does an okay job for the price. I usually buy it if I can&#x27;t find Finesse or if I&#x27;m low on cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m have thick, curly hair so use a relaxer (at home) every couple months to make it easier to manage. I am not a huge fan of spending hours and hours at salons to get my hair done and like a low maintenance hair regimen.  So every morning I wet my hair while in the shower, towel blot, apply mousse, comb through, style and let air dry. Once dry, my hair is not sticky or stiff but soft to touch and wavy/curly. My hair ends tend to dry out a little with this product but does not with the Finesse Self Adjusting Curl Defining Mousse which is why I prefer Finesse.</li>
    <li> Its what I expected for the price.  Its not the best product on the market, but it does help manage my curls and frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a litltle too heavy and sticky for me.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery; good packaging.  Performs as well as or better than more expensive mousse.  Need very little to do the job on short hair.</li>
    <li> I saw this on Facebook, and I have curly hair and the product I was using didn&#x27;t help with frizz. I decided to try this and I absolutely love it. Takes the frizz away and gives definition to my curls. It only takes a small amount to put in your hair because it is whipped and thicker than any other mousse I have used. Just distribute it through your hair really well. I recommend this product to anyone fighting frizz.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every product out there for curly hair! Gels, sprays, serums, mousse... and I always come back to Suave Professionals Mousse Captivating Curls, Whipped Cream Mousse! LOVE IT! It leaves my curls well defined, with bounce and movement and most of all Soft! I hate hard crunchy curls. If you want softness to your curls I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> If you have naturally curly hair this product will work perfectly to help define your curls instead of having them friz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only downside was all lids had popped off of the bottles and the bottles felt like they had gotten mousse on them. better packaging would be nice.</li>
    <li> no more doubt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best mousse , it keeps my hair superb firm. I always wear this for party and looks so nice</li>
    <li> I have been using this mousse for years, and I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;more expensive products&amp;#34; only to go back to this because it is simply better. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out like most products, helps define my curls, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy. I honestly don&#x27;t buy this product off of Amazon but after trying yet another &amp;#34;more expensive product (always curious and I like to experiment) I specifically came on here to leave a review. This is simply a great product at a great price. (I have short, fine (but lots of it), blonde curls).</li>
    <li> AWESOME!! This is my favorite type of mousse and has been for awhile. It works perfectly to hold my curls and style my hair! LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Hated this. It&#x27;s gooey and heavy. Used only once.</li>
    <li> This product is the only one that takes care of my curly hair so thankful and love the price ! Leaves my hair friz less and well defined curls !!</li>
    <li> This hair mousse is great. I&#x27;ve struggled with curly hair my whole life, and this is something that makes my curls look natural; not gelled up. The first bottle I used  I wasted too much because I clogged it,  but now every day I clean it with a q-tip and that eliminates the problem. It&#x27;s worth the extra effort.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and then borrowed it back for myself as I was out of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros... I used two golf ball sized amounts and it was really easy to work into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your hair smell amazing after it dries&lt;br /&gt;Curls were a wee bit crunchy but I could live with it. The curls  looked amazing all day long.&lt;br /&gt;Really tames down the volume. That is one of my biggest problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I could think of is the fact that my hair doesn&#x27;t look as good on the second day as it did the first. :(  but that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;Oh one more thing... my hair is really thick and it took a little time to work the tangles out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for the price of this mousse, it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
    <li> I have to admit this is much better than I thought it would be.  I use it along with a curly hair spray like Pantene.  Nice curl shape.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this mousse because I have tried the suave alcohol free spray gel and really liked it. This mousse, however, does nothing. It doesn&#x27;t define or keep curls any better than water and the small amount of &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; it does have wears off in about an hour and leaves your hair with a greasy film. Don;t bother with this one</li>
    <li> I have short wavy/curly hair and I use this to keep my curls nice and neat.  I used to use Tresemme mousse which worked pretty well also but left my curls a little harder and kinkier than I wanted them to be.  This mousse is a little different, a little softer and gives a more lotion-y texture to it, like a cream (but it is called whipped cream mousse..) so it might not be great for some people.  I like that it keeps my hair locked down but not in that &amp;#34;wow she is wearing so much mousse/gel her hair won&#x27;t move when the wind blows&amp;#34; type of way.  I was afraid that for the price, this product wouldn&#x27;t be so great but it blew me away and is great!  I definitely recommend this to anybody who wants neater curls!</li>
    <li> It has the perfect texture, not too thick or too thin. It works good to prevent frizziness on curly hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this mousse because it was cheap and I wanted to give it a try to see if it was as great as the expensive stuff.  I wasn&#x27;t 100% satisfied with the way it made my hair feel.  It made my hair feel sticky, some what dry, and very hard.  It does an OK job of holding my curls for half the day but by the end of the day my hair is a little frizzy.  I tried it three times before I gave up on this stuff and bought my usual hair products.  I find a great alternative is Tresemme&#x27;s Curl Life.  It&#x27;s a few bucks more but well worth it.  It leaves my curls soft and prevents my hair from humidity all day long.</li>
    <li> I bought two bottles of these in hopes it would be similar to Pantene or Blow.  I don&#x27;t like this product at all.  It weighs my hair down and isn&#x27;t whipped, but more watery/sticky.  I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to like like this but it didnt give me the definition I need. I have dry curly hair and this didnt work for me. It made my hair dull and fluffy.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about the new Suave line because of how cheap they are.  However, this mousse is the best that I have found.  It is a different consistency than most and it makes your curls just lovely. They are soft, full of volume, and defined.  I will continue to purchase this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s funny, the first time I used this the first thing I thought of was cake icing. That&#x27;s kinda what the consistency reminded me of. I have long naturally curly hair, and I don&#x27;t like to pay a lot for hair products since I go through so much. This product is inexpensive, but I&#x27;m not crazy how it works on my hair. I feel like it doesn&#x27;t hold the curls as well as other products. I also don&#x27;t like how it feels if you run your fingers through your hair once it dries. (maybe I&#x27;m using too much) I would give it 3 stars out of 5. Not the best I&#x27;ve ever used, but I could use it in a pinch if my other stuff runs out.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product leaves my hair - soft, manageable, touchable, and bouncy, my curls have never looked so good. And, having used a dozen other mousses, I am in love with the texture of this product. It has a nice \\&quot;whipped\\&quot; consistency that makes it fun just to put on, not to mention what it does for your hair. It also smells incredible and lasts throughout the day. I&#x27;ll never go back to other mousses.</li>
    <li> First let me say I was cautious of buying this because of some bad reviews. I got this at a local Wal-Mart for $2.88 (I also purchased the gel spray). I have very thick and voluminous curls to the middle of my back. I didn&#x27;t think it would actually hold or define my curls because every mousse I tried failed. Usually use this on damp hair and then use 2-3 pumps of the gel spray and a finishing paste afterwards and OMG ! My curls are soft and defined perfectly! This leaves my hair feeling weightless and amazing. I would definitely recommend to anyone with frizzy, curly and long or short hair.</li>
    <li> I am not sure this is the same product I ordered.  It says it is new look but supposed to be the same as the original product.  It really does not feel the same when I put it on my hair.  I will continue to use it for the present, but will debate reordering</li>
    <li> I have very thick, long, curly hair (big, loose curls, not like afro type curls) that tends to get frizzy, but otherwise has a pretty ideal texture...my hair is soft, never seems dry, and I never get dandruff. I have a few go-to products that I like to use depending on what I&#x27;m going to do with my hair or what the weather is like, but I&#x27;d heard great things about this mousse, so I wanted to give it a try - and for the price, I couldn&#x27;t NOT try it, right? When I first dispensed the product, I was impressed at how thick it was, as many mousse products seem to fizz away right after you spray them out. I applied just the tiniest bit on the top of my head as I need a little something for frizz control, but don&#x27;t like putting much product near roots; then I applied a fair amount to the rest of my hair. When I finished, I was surprised how my hands felt....it felt like they were covered in butter or some other really greasy thing! The regular hand soap in my bathroom wouldn&#x27;t wash it off very well, I had to go to the kitchen and use dishsoap. This did help cut down on the frizz, but it also made my hair look stringy and my scalp and the area surrounding my face and ears were flaky and looked like I had really bad dandruff or something (ewww!). I gave it three tries, doing things slightly different each time and I just didn&#x27;t like this product at all!! So into the trash it went! Some other reviewers seemed to like it, so maybe it would be good for someone with really dry hair, but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all. Though for the price, I&#x27;m not all that disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I could not tell you whether it was good or bad as the can did not work and I was unable to use the product. Of all the mousse products I have tried this is the first one whose can design was so faulty to prevent the product from escaping into my hand for use. So save your money and buy another brand as this one is bad from the get go.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy hair. I read about this product in a magazine. I think Self Magazine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my hair soft with nice waves to it. No friz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also liked that my hair didn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, I cant believe how well it works. Makes my hair super curly whenever I use it and it smells pretty good, not to strong which I like. I wasn&#x27;t even expecting it to work, since it was so cheap. Very happy with this purchase and I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> My hair is curly but fine and a little dry. I love this because it not only takes care of the curls, supporting them in a nice bounciness, but also gives a bit of conditioner in the mix too. (you can feel it as you rub your hands together) Many mousses I have tried have made my hair dry feeling, but this is a wonderful and surprising change. If you use too much, it may seem crunchy, but just scrunch your hair again when dry and the seemingly crunchiness goes right away.&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to use any other brand. I usually buy it at a store, but they have stopped carrying it....grrrr. Glad to see I can buy it here and join it to other purchases to get it shipped for free.</li>
    <li> This mousse is ok but is sort of gummy and I find it hard to spread it through my hair evenly. I like a lighter consistency mousse that is faster and easier to work through my quite thick hair. This mouse does do a good job of keeping my hair from getting frizzy and doesn&#x27;t get hard or crunchy which is a good thing. Overall it is not my favorite mousse of all the many kinds I have tried and probably won&#x27;t get it again.</li>
    <li> The quality of the mousse is great but it stops working after a few uses (the product does not come out of the bottle). I had purchased two bottles, and both of them are going to the trash with about 80% product still left in the bottle. What a faulty design and waste of a good product.</li>
    <li> This is a truly excellent hair product. It keeps hair looking beautiful and really enhances curls. It is so great for keeping beautiful hair throughout the day.</li>
    <li> OHK! SO I HAVE BEEN GOING NATURAL FOR ALMOST 10 MONTHS NOW. I HAVE THAT TYPE OF \\&quot;EXTRA THICK/NAPPY\\&quot; KIND OF HAIR. I HAVE TRIED SO MANY TYPES OF HAIR PRODUCTS TO TRY TO KEEP MY HAIR MOIST &amp;&amp; CURLY, BUT NOTHING HAS WORKED. JUST LAST WK, I DECIDED TO TRY THIS MOUSSE OUT. I BOUGHT MINE AT TARGETS FOR $10 SO THIS AMAZON PRICE IS A LOT CHEAPER. I INSTANTLY FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS MOUSSE. I LOVE HOW IT TRULY DEFINES MY CURLS AND KEEPS MY HAIR MOIST. I DO A WASH AND GO IN THE MORNINGS; WET MY HAIR, APPLY THE MOUSSE, THEN APPLY OLIVE OIL TO LOCK IN THE MOISTURE. I JUST LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT. ONCE IT DRIES, MY HAIR ISN&#x27;T SUPER DRY NOR HARD LIKE MOST MOUSSE DOES TO UR HAIR. AS A MATTER OF FACT, MY HAIR STAYS SOFT THE ENTIRE DAY. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ALL OF MY NATURAL HAIR GIRLS. ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAVE MY TYPE OF HAIR. ENJOY !!!</li>
    <li> Nice Mousse and great price.  Dosent make hair feel weighed down but gives you control of your hair &#x3D;)  Smells nice as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and keep coming back to this one.  It helps shape my curls but doesn&#x27;t leave them with that &#x27;crunchy&#x27; feeling that I get from other mousse.  It&#x27;s a great value, too.</li>
    <li> This is the first product of its type that I&#x27;ve tried, but yeah, it makes my hair curly and gives it volume.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS BUT WHEN WEARS OFF PRETTY FAST SO IT WEIGHS DOWN THICK HAIR ENOUGH TO LOSE THE CURL PRETTY QUICKLY. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR PEOPLE WITH THINNER HAIR.</li>
    <li> What a great price! I mean, as I write this, it&#x27;s under $3 delivered in two days! That said, it&#x27;s nothing supernatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, this stuff gives more a glossy look. If you want matte/transparent look, this might not be ideal for you.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don&#x27;t like is how messy the top/cap get after several uses. The tip design just sort of allows for a mess to happen. Not a deal breaker though.&lt;br /&gt;Other thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, it&#x27;s just a big too strong. This is coming from someone that has to get hypoallergenic everything, so keep that in mind. Most people won&#x27;t be bothered by it.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite mousse. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crispy, even if I put too much on. It gives it bounce and looks soft throughout the day. I also don&#x27;t need to use much; spreads well.</li>
    <li> i tried this product a few months back and was extremely pleased with the result.  i have naturally curly hair and have had a difficult time finding a product i love.  i have tried finesse, herbal essence, garnier fructis, the suave mousse in the pink can, pure shine just to name some and none of them leave my hair as nice as this product.  it is really thick so a little goes a long way.  i put it on when my hair is still wet so i need to make sure i am putting on little bits at a time otherwise it will look like you didn&#x27;t rinse your hair out. i also put a little bit of hairspray so it doesn&#x27;t frizz out.  i don&#x27;t like that not all retailers carry it...they all should!  so when i find it in a store i&#x27;ll buy at least 3.  i&#x27;m super happy Amazon has it....but what don&#x27;t they have!  love you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Works well - it takes a little work to go from white fluff to invisible material though. But it has a nice hold for the price.</li>
    <li> Finally found a mousse that maintains my curls without weighing them down or making them extremely stiff (like most gels). I have wild hispanic curls and this is the first mousse I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff and knotty. My curls maintain there volume and settle fizz. A curly hair women&#x27;s dream! Try it!</li>
    <li> I have extermlely thick hair that, since pregnancy, has turned from shirley temple curly to a mix of curly/wavy. While this does take away the frizz, it makes me hair look &amp;#34;droopy&amp;#34; and have no life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it might be because of all the hair I have, might work better on someone with thinner hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just use it now to help the frizz if I just want to tie my hair back, if I want to wear it down I do not use this as I would look like chewbacca.</li>
    <li> No bad side effects, this gives body and style.  Easy to wash out with your next shampoo.  I  like it much better than the expensive ones sold at the salon.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I love this mousse. As someone who refuses to spend boatloads of money on hair products, I was very excited to see the new Suave Professionals line for curly hair. I tried it and was definitely not disappointed. It gives my hair great volume, my curls are well defined and it holds up pretty well against humidity. And, bonus, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like straw when I use it. For all these reasons I would not hesitate to give it 5 stars, but..&lt;br /&gt;I keep having problems with the dang cans!! I have probably bought 5 or 6 cans of this mousse now and only 2 have I been able to use until empty. I bought one and it wouldn&#x27;t even spray at all (now I&#x27;m sure to test it in the store before I buy!) and 2-3 other times I got about halfway through the can and it just stopped working! You could definitely feel that there was still a ton of mousse left (and hear it when shaking the can). Some would dribble out little by little, but the mousse wouldn&#x27;t \\&quot;fluff up\\&quot; anymore, and eventually the dribbles stop coming, leaving a bunch of unused mousse to be tossed. It&#x27;s not a clogging issue, it&#x27;s like the can loses pressure or something and just dies. The price is great, but if I only get half a can, the value is lost! But, I will continue to buy it because now I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great mousse for curly hair, but could use a little help in the execution!</li>
    <li> greasy and flattens hair......a waste of money.  Dove is much better and only a few cents more so worth it</li>
    <li> My hair isn&#x27;t pin-straight, but it isn&#x27;t curly either. This product left my hair stiff and greasy, nevermind the fact that my hair didn&#x27;t really have curls, just blobs sticking together. I would recommend this only if you&#x27;re using a curling iron and/or have curly hair already. For straight-haired girls who want to stay away from hot tools, this would not work. The only plus for me would be the nice scent.</li>
    <li> I have never been much of one to use mousse, but since I&#x27;ve tried Suave products I&#x27;ve been so happy with their whole line. I have fine hair and I love that if I put this mousse in after I&#x27;ve washed my hair, my hair isn&#x27;t super fine and fly-away-ish once it has dried. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the Mousse, have spent more money trying to find something for curl and body.  This is it!.. and the price was nice!  This gave me body, texture and bounce.  (Mrs BB)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mousse for years. It&#x27;s the only drugstore mousse with a whipped soft and moisturizing texture. It doesn&#x27;t make my curls hard but beautifully bouncy and soft. It&#x27;s a soft hold but eliminates ALL FRIZZ LIKE MAGIC. I feel like a less pretty, brunette version of Shakira. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for individuals with straight hair or those who are looking for extra firm hold.</li>
    <li> Works well. I relied on Amazon reviews and didn&#x27;t go wrong! Perfect to keep my curls in place especially during humid weather.</li>
    <li> This mousse is better than the costly ones. It defines the curl,&lt;br /&gt;has great hold,and keeps your hair soft. I Love it. You can&lt;br /&gt;spend all your money looking for that perfect mouuse for curly&lt;br /&gt;hair,or you can take my word for it and try this mousse.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone with curls.</li>
    <li> A very good product that does it&#x27;s job well.  The money is right, my head feels moist and soft  and has the hold.  It&#x27;s not itchy either.  Why pay more?  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great at defining curl and holding shape. However, my hair becomes dry like sandpaper after washing this stuff out. It takes me a week to restore balance to my hair. Therefore, I can only use this once in awhile when I have the patience to restore moisture back in that this stuff sucks out.</li>
    <li> I have super curly frizzy hair and I use this every day.  My favorite mousse for curly hair as i have tried literally dozens.  Keeps curls still soft and doesn&#x27;t flake or anything.  Minimizes frizz, but not completely.</li>
    <li> I love this mousse!  It leaves your hair soft and manageable and I got it for a better price than Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> I use this every day to hold my curls in and keep friz away and it works great for me!</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
    <li> I bought this mouse because of the price.  It work ok on volumizing my hair but i do not like the film it leaves on my comb.  Not a bad product for the price.</li>
    <li> I use this on every hair washing day.</li>
    <li> Great price. Super hold without the crunchy hair.  Holds up great to humidity. The fragrance is not over whelming which is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite mousse.  She has very long very curly hair and uses tons of mousse.  She is away at college and the auto ship is great.</li>
    <li> after 3 deliveries it finally arrived with a lid/cap so I can take it on vacation with me soon!  Thanks for making it right!&lt;br /&gt;Product itself smells great and keeps my naturally  curly hair from getting frizzy!</li>
