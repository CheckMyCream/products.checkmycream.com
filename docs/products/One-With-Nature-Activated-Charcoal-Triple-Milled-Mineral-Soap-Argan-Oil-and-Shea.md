    <li> It is o.k. And very reasonable $</li>
    <li> very nice, smells good but watch out when washing girl parts, paprika...</li>
    <li> Nice large bar, great smell without being too strong. Stays firm without the mushy feel of some soaps.</li>
    <li> Nice size and smells great, love the way it lathers</li>
    <li> I like this soap and the bar doesn&#x27;t melt real fast</li>
    <li> It smells a bit like ginger. Light and foamy.</li>
    <li> All the One With Nature soaps are great! Gets you clean without drying out your skin. Nice scents. All natural.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap, and so do my co-workers whom have complimented me on it. The only issue is that I have really sensitive skin and it dries it out. I bought a variety of the scents which I distributed with friends.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a soap nothing special about it or the smell won&#x27;t bother purchasing on the internet.</li>
    <li> Smells great, very gentle on skin. Does not leave me feeling waxy or dried out like other chemical-laden soaps have in the past.</li>
    <li> Absolutely delicious smell. You will love this soap. It is one of my favorites for sure. It lasts quite a while, too. Even my husband notices how good I smell after I have used this grapefruit guava soap. It is great and I am glad that I found out about it. Yum.</li>
    <li> I love this soap/ poor mans water softener / invigorating and gets you literally squeaky clean. Scent is fresh and clean. Nothing overpowering. I occasionally also use as a shampoo because my head gets jealous. It leaves my hair feeling fuller but gives me fly away hairs and static. I am hooked. If you have hard water in your area, I bet you will be too. Ultimately, it keeps my dermatitis prone skin improved from the scales and itching I had before using. FYI 7 ounces and the biggest bar of soap I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I read some pretty good reviews on this brand of soap(have never used before) and thought I&#x27;d try this scent. I&#x27;m a tiny bit disappointed because I thought it would be more fragrant. There is no lasting or lingering smell at all (which some people don&#x27;t like, so if you&#x27;re one of those people, I recommend this because you can barely smell it even while in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;I also thought it would be a little more moisturizing. It didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry, but I kind of felt squeaky clean. Which maybe is a good thing since I&#x27;m so used to using body washes with unnecessary ingredients?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only using this on my body, not my face, but I might do an update if I see skin improvements.</li>
    <li> Wow. I realy loves this soap. I loved the smell refreshing, and the size is good matching with the price.</li>
    <li> This soap isn&#x27;t as nice as the Vanilla Oatmeal soap, in my opinion. The scent is good but light. The soap is smooth and doesn&#x27;t have any exfoliating mud like the other One with Nature soaps I&#x27;ve tried have had.</li>
    <li> This soap smells great!  Another reviewer said they didn&#x27;t like that the smell does not linger.  They&#x27;re right, it doesn&#x27;t linger, but that&#x27;s probably because this soap is completely all natural.  Bath products that have a strong, lingering smell, usually have chemicals that are designed to smell like the original desired scent.  It&#x27;s these fake scents that smell so strong.  But the soap does smell good when you&#x27;re using.  It&#x27;s fresh and citrusy, and not overpowering.  I like that, unlike their dead sea mud, this one doesn&#x27;t leave a mess of exfoliating beads in the tub.</li>
    <li> Product arrived damaged. Cannot give as gift.</li>
    <li> Love the fresh scent as well as all the lather!!!  The only downside is the huge bar is hard to handle in the shower.  Would rather it came in two smaller bars.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizing soap and the price is good also. My only issue is the dyes they put in this soap bleeds on everything.</li>
    <li> Have been using this soap for some time now. I love it.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful in the shower.</li>
    <li> Great soap, as always with this brand.</li>
    <li> Great sent, makes my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> Best scent! Soft skin. Couldn&#x27;t really smell the lilac but this one is refreshing</li>
    <li> Good soap with out the perfume.  Cleans well.  Not drying.  I feel fresh and clean after using it.</li>
    <li> great soap and long lasting</li>
    <li> I liked it at first but as I used up the bar it started to smell like fruity pebbles...yuck.</li>
