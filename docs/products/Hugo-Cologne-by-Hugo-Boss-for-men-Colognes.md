<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got this for my BF for x-mas. I love the smell. It&#x27;s clean and fresh. Fast shipping. Good price. Will order again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite men&#x27;s cologne, so I purchase this for the close men in my family. It makes us all happy.</li>
    <li> Didnt like the S M E L L. It lasts long but this wasnt what i was looking for the price. One man show perfume lasts longer than this one and is dirt cheap compared to this one.</li>
    <li> Not really my type of smell. Heard a lot of great things about it so I decided to give it a shot but it&#x27;s a little too sweet/overpowering for me.</li>
    <li> i love this product. i get compliment&#x27;s every time i use it. it come well packaged and is delivered fast.</li>
    <li> I think this is one of the better fragrances I have ever used. It lasts long and is very soothing.. It might initially be little overwhelming but I liek that kinda cologne. Its definately worth a try</li>
    <li> I ordered this cologne for my husband because its his favorite. I shopped in local stores for it and it was hard to find and when I did find it, the cologne was much more expensive in the stores.  I knew I could get a better deal for the money from Amazon, which I did.  Great price and great speedy delivery. Thanks again Amazon.</li>
    <li> The real deal , last forever buy this one for sure great dela guys .Hope this helps peace</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fragrance since it first came out and will use it; until I die or the product dies. At my last purchase; Amazon was not the best price and I bought it from Perfumania.com. NEVER order from that company; even if you do find they are less expensive. The misery their customer service will put you through it NOT worth the savings.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas and we both LOVE it!  I love smelling it on him and he enjoys wearing it.  It seems to be a powerful scent but definitely not too overbearing.  He&#x27;s also received a lot of compliments about how nice he smells so it&#x27;s not just us!  I was thrilled to find such a good buy on this large bottle of this cologne on Amazon -- better price than I could have found elsewhere.  Both my husband and I are delighted with this purchase and will look to do more cologne/perfume shopping on Amazon in the future as this was my first scent purchase online.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this before a few years ago and just ordered it again yesterday.  I bought it for my man and he loves it so much that he wanted another one.  I love to smell it on my man too. :o)  I looked all over the place and could not find it.  I think I bought the first one at SAMS years ago, and I don&#x27;t see it there anymore.  I bought him another Hugo Boss cologne, and he didn&#x27;t like it as much as this one.  Anyway, I&#x27;m so glad I found it here at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift from my wife, this is my first time i used it. My initial reaction to the bottle was - that looks ok except that it has to be screwed and unscrewed to use it. That is one small extra stuff ritee in the morning. The fragrance is outstanding, its a day long perfume- nt the bold strong types. So I really find it as great office perfume or for that matter a any day perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last not so positive observation - the outlet of the perfume - does spray instead more like shoots out in a straight stream like manner. I have used only Ralph polo - all of them till so. SO this seem like a all together diff one - but equally good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one line - Fragrance is amazing , bottle needs a lot of work</li>
    <li> 2 Stars for the quick delivery of the order.&lt;br /&gt;The scent was good, but was very disappointed with the longevity of the smell. Had to put on 5 to 6 sprays everyday and the smell wud go off within 2 to 3 hours. Now i know why they provide a 5 ounces bottle, becaus u wud hav to put 5 to 6 sprays everyday so that the smell would last alteast 2 hours, and 5 ounces will come for atleast 2 months at this rate of usage.&lt;br /&gt;Im of the opinion that Amazon doesnt sell fake, so considering this as an original, i would not reccomend this perfume.</li>
    <li> The very fact that this product is a favorite for many folks even after 15 years of its release speaks volumes about it quality. Got 5 oz for $38, which I believe was a very good price. Definitely lasts long (some reviewers said it doesn&#x27;t). I am very happy with the product and the purchase.</li>
    <li> Really like this scent, very masculine and lasts a long time. 5oz size is a good value if you can get it for a good price.</li>
    <li> love it, good buy, packaged well...no problems</li>
    <li> This scent drives my wife absolutely crazy. To top it off it is significantly cheaper here than at our local stores.</li>
    <li> Electronics hobbyists, beware...&lt;br /&gt;Read on for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that this is an oldie and a well-loved cologne, but I absolutely could not stand it. Personally, it would be a 1.5 star rating out of 5. But since I will factor in others&#x27; opinions about it, I will give it a neutral 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 21 year old college student. I&#x27;m quite mature (I&#x27;ve been told) for my age, and I think my colognes tend to reflect it. I have only started getting into colognes recently, so I do not have the best nose. I can&#x27;t tell you what notes are in each colognes, or what the base is of each one. But I do know what smells good to me and what doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve currently got UR by Usher, Chrome, Burberry London, 1 million, Le Male, Armani Code, and Blvgari Black in my regular rotation/collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this cologne the other day, and my initial impression was that it was very strong. The alcohol content of this cologne must be much higher than comparable EDTs. The only one I have smelled with more alcohol has been Nautica Blue. The alcohol overpowers the top notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dry-down is where it gets interesting. I can swear that Hugo smells exactly like breathing in the saccharin-sweet fumes from using rosin-core 60/40 lead solder while chewing 2-hour-old spearmint gum. It&#x27;s uncanny. And it&#x27;s not just my skin type. I let several friends and family members borrow it, and I smelled exactly the same thing on them. Soldering fumes and gum. I did notice that, for my friends and family that have never soldered anything before, they found this scent to be quite pleasant. However, anyone I knew that had soldered anything before or has been around someone else soldering knew the smell without me having to tell them anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t ruled out the possibility that I got a bad bottle/batch. I will certainly give it another try if I see it in a dept store. So although this is a classic frag, beware. Try it out before you buy it. Especially if you&#x27;ve ever soldered anything before and you didn&#x27;t enjoy the fumes. It&#x27;s definitely a unique scent.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed to receive the Hugo Boss Cologne today to find that it was an open box and not cellaphaned wrapped.  If I would have known this, I would not have purchased this product for the holidays.</li>
    <li> One spray everyday keeps me smelling fresh even though i have two physical classes which makes me sweat throughout the day this helps me smell like a boss</li>
    <li> After using various colognes throughout the years, I picked this up to try as a new scent as I was sick of my old CK cologne. I have never received more compliments on a scent than I have wearing this. Definitely good for attracting attention from the fairer sex, it is the one they grab to remind them of you. A great, long lasting scent, I use 2 sprays in the morning and it&#x27;s still noticeable in the evening. It never overpowers your sense of smell. If you&#x27;re considering this scent, do yourself a favor and buy it now.</li>
    <li> Pleasant aroma, can be used on any occasion. He has good size and packaging. With a spray enough to smell it. recommended</li>
    <li> the package wasn&#x27;t tampered with. great cent from the item. you pay for what you get for so great on that part.</li>
    <li> This is my and my husband&#x27;s favorite men&#x27;s cologne.  Since we&#x27;ve been on a tighter budget, we haven&#x27;t purchased it in a while but what a great price for the large bottle!  It&#x27;s bigger than the last bottle we bought at full price and we paid less this time!  It also arrived a few days ahead of schedule so it&#x27;s here in time for Christmas.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick.  Great price.  The real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little leary about ordering a fragrance online, as you just never really know.  The sent is good, it lasts a long time, and was a great price.</li>
    <li> i got this as a gift for my husband and the price for this 5oz version is similar to what i would have paid for the approx 3oz version in the store... same great quality. it&#x27;s a great every day cologne that i still enjoy getting close to, even after two years.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great and always gets compliments. This is my standard date cologne, and it has a proven track record, as far as I am concerned. The smell wafts out and draws her in closer without being overpowering. Once she gets close, it locks on like a JDAM and explodes in her brain.</li>
    <li> SMELLS GREAT...MY HUSBAND LIKES AND ME TOOO ON HIM...I RECOMMEND.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OHHH AND WE ARE SENIORS ;)</li>
    <li> As advertised. Genuine product.</li>
    <li> The number of sales this product has itself speaks the quality and the fragrance this has. I have made it my trademark fragrance. Its classy + sporty. You can wear this while going for a meeting while going for a game of snookers you can wear it on when u go clubbing. This is one perfume I have come across which can be worn irrespective of where you going to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am waiting for atleast one competitor close to this product. I bet there will be none in the near future. I have tried different perfumes of different brands and classes. Nothing could match this one. You can be sure if you are in a crowd, some one would say wow... If you are driving or in a closed group of people, you may be asked, which one are you wearing?? Trust me, its worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love this Fragrance on my husband! It&#x27;s one of our favorites.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I ever got it for him was 10 yrs ago and we&#x27;ve loved it ever since.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my brother as a gift and he absolutely loves it. My brother had asthma when he was younger so he is very finicky when it comes to perfumes. The scent is easy on the nose (I&#x27;m a girl) and not overpowering like some men&#x27;s perfumes are. The only thing that confused me at first was that several sites did not list the perfume as Hugo by Hugo Boss. Instead it was listed as Hugo Boss period. There are two divisions - Hugo and Boss - so it is very important to separate the two. Anyway, I would buy from this seller again. I would recommend this to any guy who wants to smell great and classy.</li>
    <li> this is a great product i will purchase it again, through my favority shopping site AMAZON</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my son, he loves this stuff. Not only was the price great but the service was as well.&lt;br /&gt;I received my tracking number the next day, and the cologne came earlier than expected. My son recommended this seller because he has always had a smooth experience with them. Definitely look to this seller for low priced perfume &amp; cologne you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Classy scent that stays all day long. Suitable for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stains on light colored fabric. However, it does wash away after laundry.</li>
    <li> This product was great and for an amazingly low price.  Will definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> bought to give gift to me, it&#x27;s good products. rest of the words for amazon 20 counts one two three four five six seven eight</li>
    <li> My latest obsession is with colognes and fragrances and I bought all 5 of the ones mentioned in \\&quot;So you want to start wearing cologne\\&quot; guide on amazon.com that was great, and others. They haven&#x27;t all arrived yet ( darn it), but I have to say that this cologne is good- 3.5 stars. It&#x27;s a brighter and more cheery scent (if there is such a thing) than Cool Water which is also pretty dern good, and less citrusy than Tommy. The price is pretty mid-range for the designer colognes that you might see at the mall.</li>
    <li> I have about 6 to 8 different cologne.  This is the only one that I use reguarly.  I already finished one bottle and bought a 2nd one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many and I keep coming back to this one.  Noteably, of the many I&#x27;ve tried, this one always draws compliments.  Also, this does have a hint of citrus, and if you&#x27;re the kind of person who gives weight to studies of human sexuality you might be interested to know that it&#x27;s been shown that women are turned on by citrus scents.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the smell of Hugo Cologne, and so does my wife. This scent is awesome, and very attractive. I always get compliments on how great I smell when I am wearing this brand of cologne. And at the price I paid here it was very worth it, anywhere else I had found it was a bit more expensive.</li>
    <li> My late wife bought me the first bottle of this in the mid-90s, and it outlasted her (she died in 2001, but the perfume lasted until 2009 - apparently I didn&#x27;t use it much after I lost her). Anyway, it finally ran out and I bought a bottle at WalMart and it was painfully expensive. I started going to church and also singing in the community choir, so I started using more of this stuff, and I ran out again in 2011. This time I found it cheaper on Amazon. I ran out again recently, and ordered this larger bottle, which was somewhat cheaper on a per-ounce basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cologne is a personal thing - they smell differently on different people according to body chemistry (among other things). This cologne smells awesome on me - that is why I continue to buy it. This is not a prideful statement - Polo cologne on me smells like I rubbed myself with rancid bacon fat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this review is not really based on the smell of the cologne, since that will vary from person to person. When I was considering ordering this from Amazon and I was reading the reviews (*always* read the reviews on *everything*), I noticed that some people were complaining that what they got was fake, and didn&#x27;t smell right, or as good, or w/e. There is no doubt in my mind that the smaller bottle that I purchased last time was exactly the same as I had been using up to then. However, and this is why I am giving it a 4 rating instead of a 5, the larger bottle (5 oz.) that I purchased this time does seem to smell a bit lighter, and its &amp;#34;duration&amp;#34; seems to me to be a bit shorter, almost like it was &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; a bit. This is purely subjective, and could be due to changes in my own body chemistry or several other things. It is not a big enough difference for me to be dissatisfied with my purchase, but I felt that I should mention it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hugo Boss original (this review is only for original hugo boss) since 1999 when I received it as gift. Bingo! I fell in love with this perfume, not like I fell in love with women. My love for this perfume still going, but love for women has changed many times since then))).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy it again and again without any  reservation.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, women love this perfume, very \\&quot;mennen\\&quot; as they say and tender at the same!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried several colognes before, but this one is one of the best...Also it stays all day long on your clothes...I loved it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Hugo Boss for the last 10 years and I love the way it smells.. all the ladies love how I smell in the morning when I walk into the office building. I tottaly recomend this item for any guy that like to get attention.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Hugo Boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh the purchase and delivery from AMAZON was amasing also. super fast. even tho they said it was going to take up to 8 days to deliver it was withing 3 days. Awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Ive been wearing this cologne for years and had run out.  This is a very large bottle and should last a long time.  I am not an expert on colognes by any means but this is an understated and not overpowering smell which is pleasing to me and exactly what I prefer in a cologne.</li>
    <li> The item arrived in great shape. This is a great scent for men! You can&#x27;t go wrong at this price!</li>
    <li> My friend told me this one was good, and I trusted her choice so I actually bought Hugo Boss without smelling it first, but it turns out to be a great cologne for men. It is not for you if you don&#x27;t like a mild strong sense like lacoste essential, but it&#x27;s got a good every day smell, and I wear daily. So if you are looking for a cologne that you can wear everyday, hugo boss is a good choice, or just something from like Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger will do the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the store the other day after reading some of the reviews.  I have to say after two sprays it was very potent but after 5 minutes or so the potent smell goes away and your left with a very pleasant cologne which lasted all day.</li>
    <li> Simple: it melts my girlfriend and i like the smell (personally). Other than that i think it&#x27;s a pretty good perfume for that price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cologne!  It smells fantastic, lasts a long time, and always gets great compliments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had used this cologne several years ago, but had moved on to trying others since then.  Other colognes smelled nice, but just weren&#x27;t quite of the same caliber as Hugo.  So, when it was time to buy a new cologne, I had to have this fantastic fragrance again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I decided to buy this one again!  It was like coming back to an old friend.  This fragrance is the best around, in my opinion.  It&#x27;s also well priced for the 5oz. bottle.  Do yourself a favor and buy this cologne NOW!</li>
    <li> Hugo by Hugo Boss is unique enough to warrant compliments whenever you put it on, but still light enough for everyday use. A little bit goes a long way and the scent will stay with you all day. My last bottle went almost a full year before going empty, and that was with constant use. My favorite cologne!!</li>
    <li> I love this cologne on my husband! It arrived on time and in perfect condition. Great scent for every occasion.</li>
    <li> Great scent - very masculine. Too bad it fades so soon. Musky herbs and freshly overturned mossy rocks in a coldwater stream. Makes you want to go out and strut your stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Hugo Boss needs someone to explain why the ingredient ambergris is such a very important component to their products and their research department.</li>
    <li> AFTER READING YOUR REVIEWS , I THOUGHT I TRY THIS PRODUCT FOR MY HUSBAND AS A GIFT. BOY, WAS I IN FOR A SUPRISE.&lt;br /&gt;THE HUGO BOSS WAS AWESOME. A SEXY SMELLING COLOGNE I COULD JUST NOT QUIT SMELLING UP CLOSE ON HIM, LOL.&lt;br /&gt;BUT A LITTLE OF THIS PRODUCT , ONE SQUIRT , GOES A LONG WAY AND LASTS ALL DAY.&lt;br /&gt;MY HUSBAND WEARS THIS EVERY DAY STARTING AM AND I GOT TO CALLING HIM MY HUGO MAN. I HAVE ONLY POSITIVE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS PRODUCT AND WE BOTH JUST LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.&lt;br /&gt;VERY HAPPY CUSTOMERS FROM MAINE</li>
    <li> After sampling this fragrance in department stores (too many times), I finally decided to pay for it.  I believe this eau de toilette/ cologne is the original made by HUGO BOSS.  There seems to be so many different shades/ names being marketed by BOSS that I&#x27;m no longer sure which came out when.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is \\&quot;spicy\\&quot;, \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot;, light, and lasts about 2-3 hrs.  I&#x27;ve used FAHRENHEIT for years, and although THIS HUGO is cheaper and more readily available, it really does not compare to Christian Dior&#x27;s product (which has had only one incarnation).  To my nose, this HUGO is passable, but its major drawback is its short \\&quot;halflife\\&quot;.  I think I&#x27;ll go back to FAHRENHEIT after this 5 oz. bottle runs out (which I expect will be soon based on its \\&quot;short-lived\\&quot; fragrance).</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s signature fragrance so of course we love Hugo. This review gets a three-star b/c when the 5 oz bottle arrived the packaging was without the plastic wrapping. The box looked a little worse for wear. I was not too sure why. The bottle was full though and the fragrance is authentic - it smells right and lasts as long as it should. May be it was some kind of overstock item but amazon did not specify that (if it is indeed the case) when I placed the order online.</li>
    <li> I have not strayed from the couple of colognes I have worn over the years until I discovered Hugo a couple years ago and pretty much use nothing but this all the time.  I don&#x27;t have a great sense of smell so I can&#x27;t smell it too much about an hour after having put it on.  But the first time I went out with my girlfriend, I had met her 12 hrs after I had put it on and she commented on what an unbelievable scent it was and that was from only two sprays early in the morning.  So definitely a strong scent for sure, which in my opinion, the combination of both lasting and great smelling makes this potentially the best cologne out there.  After all, why spend $80 for a cheap little bottle of some other name brand cologne that smells like scented alcohol, when you can get a 5 oz bottle of this for under $50.  Not only does the scent last throughout the day, but the bottle lasts a long time too.  I have never worn a cologne that gets so many unsolicited positive comments from women, they truly LOVE the scent.  So single guys, if you want to show women you have a \\&quot;classy\\&quot; scent and don&#x27;t want to overwhelm them and be the subject of jokes behind your back, buy this cologne, you won&#x27;t be sorry.  And ladies, if your boyfriends/husbands are stuck wearing old school products that their dad&#x27;s wore in the 50&#x27;s and want your man to smell a bit \\&quot;regal\\&quot; and nice, then buy this cologne for them, because you wont&#x27; be sorry either.  Thank you Hugo Boss for such a tremendous product</li>
    <li> 40$ worth Spent, The fragrance is simply breathtaking.&lt;br /&gt;Loved by all....every single person asks what perfume is this....my girlfriend adores it....and i m loving it :) Thumbs up Hugo :)&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> Very fresh, clean, summery, &amp;#34;citrusy&amp;#34; scent which draws lots of compliments. BEAWRE: some people are allergic (sneezing, runny, burning eyes&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I was skeptical if i should try this scent without smelling it first, but i did anyways.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest I&#x27;m kinda let down.I loved Hugo Boss&#x27;s In Motion. So i hoped i would love this one as much, but i didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think that this a bad scent,its just not for me and compared to In Motion, its just not as great.</li>
    <li> Not too sweet and not too spicy. Hugo Boss is one of my old school favorites, ya know, high school, where you would put on half the bottle in the morning and then the other half before lunch. Definitely a smooth fragrance that has pretty good longevity throughout the day. Would definitely recommend this item to friends and strangers alike.</li>
    <li> Of all the colognes I&#x27;ve tried in my life this is unmatched by any other. Absolutely fabulous smell that won&#x27;t go unnoticed. Hugo makes great colognes and this tops them all.</li>
    <li> Have had this for quite some time now and it smells very manly and has a strong aroma to it. Last for hours with only a couple of sprays! Would buy again and the price is great for 5 o.z</li>
    <li> you cant go wrong with Hugo by Hugo Boss...&lt;br /&gt;still the same..kind of a gold standard fragrance for men..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mild yet smells wonderful...Can wear it everyday...&lt;br /&gt;great price at Amazon for a 5 ounce bottle...</li>
    <li> Great Colongne. Last all day, smells very good. I love hugo boss and i have never had any complains. 100% recomended.</li>
    <li> ordered on saturday an dgot it tuesday evening. what else should i say?&lt;br /&gt;i am really happy, by the product and the service.&lt;br /&gt;keep up the good work!!</li>
    <li> A classic cologne that won&#x27;t get you any originality points but will definitely get compliments.</li>
    <li> Tons of compliments on this fragrance from the ladies.  Been my favorite for over 4 years now, I wear it everyday!</li>
    <li> this is not very strong and is perfect for day to day use at work. It does not irritate my nose either :-)</li>
    <li> One of my favorite choices</li>
    <li> Thanks a lot, I have always liked this cologne. This bottle has lasted 6 months sooo far and I&#x27;m only half way. Goodness!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is clean and not overly perfumed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot go wrong with this cologne.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that the scent is not overpowering, yet it LASTS all day long!  It is really great.  I love wearing it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the smell. This is a convenient way to find it, plus the price is much better than when it is found in a store.</li>
    <li> it was a good deal for me, nice gift with a very affordable price. thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne for eight years and still smells as good as it did the first time I put it on. My wife loved the fragrance on me when I first tried it on a cruise vacation. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this scent. It&#x27;s Great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E. Schinasi Long Island N.Y.</li>
    <li> 100% recommended for everyone, its smell is good</li>
    <li> Love the product. And thanks Amazon this is the only place i can find it anymore.</li>
    <li> Ive worn  hugo ALL. my life. I use to say,&amp;#34;If my clothes smells like hugo its dirty, if it smells like soap its clean&amp;#34; this particular hugo doesnt last ALL day, and the label is different</li>
    <li> Dont buy from stores123. Its duplicate. When I bought from the stores, I can see the difference. Dont buy from stores123 :(</li>
    <li> This is a really nice scent...At least so I&#x27;m told.  I lost my sense of smell to a car accident.  So, I have maybe 20 different products and don&#x27;t know what any of them smell like.  I&#x27;ve received the most compliments with this scent, Bulgari Aqua and Bulgari Blu.</li>
    <li> This is a huge bottle for the price, most bottles are half this size for the same price.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Can&#x27;t beat the women off me with a stick!! ;}</li>
    <li> The strong yet pleasant smell lasts long. Almost the entire day. Something that some of my more illustrious choices like Issey Miyake, Armani Mania, Burberry Brit had failed to do in the past. And the price is great too. The wife loved it. So I know that I will be buying it again and again.</li>
    <li> So 3 stars, one for delivery, one for well-packed package and one for the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was super quick, the item arrived within 2 days. I think that&#x27;s a new record for my experience with Amazon. The package was packed very well, HOWEVER, the perfume box itself is very battered and the bottle appeared to have been used. I&#x27;ve bought Hugo at department stores a couple of times but the box or bottle had never looked like the one I just received. This purchase was meant to be a gift, but considering the condition I am now embarrassed to give it away. Amazon has always been my go-to store but this time...what a disappointment!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Manly perfume for sure!  I would definitely buy that again.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend and WOW !!!  I absolutely love how he smells wearing it plus he really likes it too.  I recently got him the large size bottle so he doesn&#x27;t run out.....  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells wonderful, is not nauseating, and lasts a long time. However, these opinions are only mine. Smell it for yourself before you buy. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The item looks and smells just like the real thing, but the scent disappears within minutes of putting it on.  If it lasted only a few hours (versus all day long like the same brand I buy at the mall) it might still be worth it because of the discounted price, but to be almost undetectable within minutes of putting it on then I would say its still way over priced!  I would not recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> Hugo Boss is definitely an interesting and yummy cologne for men. I bought Gio Armani for husband in the past. However, the price for a small bottle turned us away from it. The size of the bottle and the price makes this a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution is to go easy with the amount that you spray on. It is potent. My husband normally squirts 3 sprays onto his neck. He started out with one spray and it is strong. The aroma lasts all day. It is sweet and spicey which makes it unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was nervous to buy a cologne without testing it first, it was a no-brainer after reading reviews on other websites. You will not regret purchasing this cologne!</li>
    <li> Got this product 2 months back with a lot of expectation.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m slightly disappointed with the fragrance. It&#x27;s good but I probably expected heaven :)) . But the price here is definitely worth the product.</li>
    <li> M u y  b u e n a  l o ci &amp;oacute; n . La r e c o miendo.</li>
    <li> Please do not purchase this product. The product i received is not the original Hugo Boss. Hugo fragrance lasts long and the fragrance of the product i received does not even last for 10 minutes.  Amazon does not even have a return policy for perfumes.</li>
    <li> Got this for my hubby for our anniversary and he was so delighted. I received it in time and packaged very well, and the price was excellent! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my significant other and it was a great gift.  We used it already and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price of this cologne. I will be buying it again for sure. Fast arrival as well right before Christmas</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume last month and the smell is fantastic. I want to warn anybody who wants to purchase this product the smell only lasts for 1-2 hours and I was disappointed with that and I was hoping for more. If you are going to use it for a short period then that is OK otherwise look for something else.</li>
    <li> una fragancia muy suev y exclente de las fragancias que he comprado de hugo boss esta es la mejor me encanta</li>
    <li> It is a great product. Good price for the quantity.It will last a long time. Glad I could find it online.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the way this cologne smells on my husband.  In the past every time I found a cologne that smelled good, and lasted all day, it ended up being discontinued soon after.  So far (4 or 5 yrs), we have been lucky.  The 3 oz size runs @$50 at most retailers.  Amazon&#x27;s $40 price for the 5 oz. size is a REAL VALUE!!</li>
    <li> This is probably my boyfriends favorite cologne. I like it also. I would definitely be care as to how much you use because it can be very strong. Also Amazon is definitely the place with the best price for it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get all of the 1 star reviews saying that this is a fake version of this cologne. I just bought a bottle from Wal-Mart last night, and then my bottle from amazon arrived today in the mail. They are EXACTLY the same. Same bottle design, same scent, same everything. This is my favorite cologne and I am completely satisfied with this amazon purchase.</li>
    <li> el aroma de este perfume es muy particular me encanta, Se lo regale a mi novio y es perfecto para el .</li>
    <li> Awesome, came fast lowest price I could find on any website. No longer can get it in store. Will purchase again in future.</li>
    <li> la compre para un regalo y la persona qued&amp;oacute; muy contenta y agradecida asi que 5 estrellas por hugo boss</li>
    <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it is exactly what I thought it would be.  Smells nice on my fiance!</li>
    <li> Yo recib&amp;iacute; este producto en perfectas condiciones. El pedido se correspondia con lo que yo compr&amp;eacute;, Fue una muy buena experiencia de compra</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance on and off for years. I love the smell. It&#x27;s not overpowering at all and has a sweet clean smell to it. Each time I buy it I get a very nostalgic feel</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. Very strong and stays on your body for a long time. I initially was doubtful if I will be getting the original product or not..but yes it is...the seller can be trusted..completely.</li>
    <li> Yo uso 2 perfumes este lo utilizo diariamente, desde hace unos 8 a&amp;ntilde;os, es muy rico. Se los recomiendo. A todas las mujeres que se les acerquen les encantar&amp;aacute;</li>
    <li> Excelente Producto y vendedor Muy atento lo recomiendo al 100% era Justo Lo Que estÃ&amp;iexcl;ba Buscando saludos desde venezuela Erick Lopez</li>
    <li> This is certainly an extraordinary fragrance, however to have some time out to have highly competitive market. It&#x27;s a classic!. I am very grateful</li>
    <li> This was a great deal! The customer service was great &amp; the cologne was as described! I will shop with you again!</li>
    <li> This product has always rated 5 stars in my book...Women take heed: Only let your man wear this cologne when he&#x27;s with you; it&#x27;s an attractant for cougars (two-legged)...lol...Large bottle, economically priced...Recommend highly A++++++++.</li>
    <li> My GF has worn this for 2yrs, and by general &amp;#34;relationship&amp;#34; rules, this meant I could only enjoy the amazing scent. HAHA, LIZ!! It&#x27;s MINE NOW, BABYDOLL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a guy, it will definitely drive the ladies wild! Good for you, but be respectful of women&#x27;s issues - they matter to all women,&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a gay guy, you&#x27;re probably all over this &amp; don&#x27;t need MY fashion advice.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a straight woman, you&#x27;d be shocked at how amazingly hot some men&#x27;s scents on you...very nice.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a non-straight woman, (myself, for example), you KNOW this scent is subtle, clean, fresh w/something in it, pheromones that don&#x27;t stink like other pheromones...BUY IT, you will not be sorry. And neither will your SO, 1st date, whoever your crushing on.....</li>
    <li> Ordered this items and another, both were Prime Eligible and Both did not get here till a Week later.&lt;br /&gt;This was a gift,and I ended up buying locally...</li>
    <li> Excellent product and seller.</li>
    <li> The best fragrance , this is my Fav. preferred use as Day time.it is clearly evident that the smell is not huge and it is simple and pleasant.</li>
    <li> I love this Fragrance. First time I used it I wasn&#x27;t sure but it has really grown on me and my wife loves it too :)</li>
    <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite.  It arrived even quicker than promised!  Very pleased all the way around.</li>
    <li> I had it very soon. The bottle was good, and the size was the correct. I&#x27;m using it every day</li>
    <li> BIRTHDAY GIFT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it as a gift to a man who lives in Brooklyn and uses Hugo Boss Orange all the time.</li>
    <li> excellent product, service, time, everything</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colognes that I like to keep around.  Flowery/perfum-ie yet very masculine with a hint of sandalwood.  I recommend this product.  Lasts most of the day.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this scent at first.  It reminds me a lot of \\&quot;Liz Claiborne for Men\\&quot; cologne (which I had a couple bottles of when I was younger &amp; loved).  I just went with my memory of smelling this at a random mall when I was a kid, and all of the 5 star reviews on here.  The package arrived on time and in great condition.  Upon opening, I noticed that the bottle (which is a HUGE 5 ouncer btw)...was a \\&quot;tester\\&quot; bottle.  This doesn&#x27;t concern me, but I figured I would let any collectors beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I basically just got this for something casual I could wear at work.  When I first sprayed it on me, I thought it was a bit too girly (perfumy), but it must have just been me, because I got a few girls (older &amp; younger) and they all agreed it wasn&#x27;t too girly, and they seemed to just love it.  They said it wasn&#x27;t too over powering (like a lot of men&#x27;s cologne) &amp; it was a nice \\&quot;clean &amp; fresh\\&quot; smell.  I also noticed that only a couple sprays to the shirt seemed to last throughout my work day (a good 8 hrs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, I would definitely recommend this &amp; make sure you take advantage of the always awesome Amazon sale price.  I looked at a few other sites online and this was by far the cheapest.</li>
    <li> Este art&amp;iacute;culo es muy bueno, yo qued&amp;eacute; muy satisfecho con &amp;eacute;sta compra, creo que la relaci&amp;oacute;n costo-beneficio es excelente, por lo tanto recomiendo este producto.</li>
    <li> Nice smell same I brought from Europe but not long lasting. I don&#x27;t know but not long lasting at all. I love perfumes long lasting. Daytime use with casual wear only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-HP</li>
    <li> I just found this product when i met my new boyfriend. This is all he wears and i just love it. He gets compliments on it all the time.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne of all time.  Ensuring its the Eau De Toilette, 3 squirts will last you all day.  Very strong but subtle fragrance.  Well done Hugo Boss.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t keep the ladies away... but who really wants to do that.  It is a very smooth scent and not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> terrific product. my wife purchased this for me years ago and i am still using this.  she likes it and its a sporty scent that can work well in any situation, whether in formal black tie occasions or jeans.  versatile, smells great and ladies love it :-)</li>
    <li> The fragrance is subtle and yet lasting. It is not loud and I can wear it on most occasions. The fragrance seems masculine though slightly fruity. I like it.</li>
    <li> I love it, great smell, at a great price, every one that I know is always telling me how nice I smell !!!!</li>
    <li> Great product I have worn for years great price</li>
    <li> I believe this is a knock-off. I have used the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; product before. What I received looked and smelled similar, but dissipated in no time. I called Amazon and was immediately issued a credit. I dumped the cheap stuff.</li>
    <li> it was excelent, on time, good quality and good price for these classic! i really like these product for everything.</li>
    <li> First off, let me say that Hugo has been my favorite cologne since it came out and I give it 5 stars but I am rating the 5 oz bottle I received a few days ago that is sold by Amazon. I don&#x27;t know if Hugo Boss changed the cologne or if Amazon is getting imitations but this is not the same as it use to be. It did come in a cellophane sealed box and looks genuine, but... I haven&#x27;t bought any in a few years because I had stocked up and this new bottle not only smells weaker but last for far less time on my skin and clothes (yes, I always get EDT,Eau de Toilette). In the past, the Hugo I had would still smell on my clothes when I was doing laundry several days later and with this new bottle, the scent is gone before the end of the night. I will buy it again and hope that when bought somewhere else that it is like the older product but if not I will stop buying it altogether. I see that Amazon added an explanation to the description, which is true, but that just isn&#x27;t the case here.</li>
    <li> Nice item and works great! If you are considering buying one such thing, this one must be a good buy.</li>
    <li> The Hugo by Hugo Boss came in a different bottle than the one pictured here. The front of the bottle simply read HUGO in red large capital letters with HUGO BOSS underneath in smaller red capital letters. Aside from the difference of labeling,  the fragrance is exactly what it should be and priced right.</li>
    <li> The cologne is counterfeit!  I have been a buyer of this brand (Hugo Boss) for 6 years and know what it smells like and how long it last.  I went to my usual store to purchase and they were sold out so I decided to look for it on Amazon.  After applying this cologne the smell was gone in 5 minutes!  I notice the typeface print on the bottle is a little off from the normal bottle as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy for this; this is not an authentic product be sold.</li>
    <li> Great cologne and there is no way you will beat this price. I have looked in malls, stores, online, and in duty free shops in airports all over the world.</li>
    <li> My father has worn this cologne, and only this cologne my whole life. The fragrance is a very clean, masculine scent that doesn&#x27;t over power the senses of everyone around the wearer (if they stick to the &#x27;dab will do ya&#x27; motto). When he asked us to purchase it as a Christmas gift, retail stores had it marked at near $100 everywhere we went. I found it on here for less than half the price, for 2 more ounces than what stores offered for that outrageous price. The 5 ounce bottle will last him at least two years, and again is the only fragrance he will wear. It&#x27;s worth the investment, especially at that price tag!</li>
    <li> I do not know why this cologne was so cheap.  It arrived in brand new condition with the excellent long-lasting smell that this cologne offers.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> super buena locion me llego super rapido, cumplio todas mis espectativas, y el tama&amp;ntilde;o es ideal para q le dure</li>
    <li> Smells great!!! Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Hugo by Hugo Boss is an excellent cologne, to be worn in the fall and winter seasons. It is by far my favorite cologne and I had much high expectations for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me make one thing clear, DO NOT BUY COLOGNE OFF AMAZON. My cologne came still wrapped in plastic, unopened and untouched. That was a good sign, or so I thought. As soon as I opened it and sprayed it I IMMEDIATELY I noticed the scent had become \\&quot;sour\\&quot; or basically had expired. It smells too acidic, too \\&quot;sour\\&quot; to be the cologne I came to regard with such high merits.&lt;br /&gt;Some people may have ordered a good bottle that was not past its expiration date but mine had gone bad without a doubt in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this cologne very fast, probably 2 - 4 days after ordering. Amazon has always been good with expediting the delivery process so I am satisfied with that aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Id rather pay the 50$ for a 3oz off the Hugo Boss website than be skunked by Amazon again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love this scent like me, than don&#x27;t be afraid to pay the premium for a genuine bottle.</li>
    <li> recommend the product is absolutely perfect and original, responsible and sent within the stipulated time without any problem! thanks for serving</li>
    <li> GOOD SCENT! CANT BEAT THE PRICE WOULD DO BUISNESS WITH AGAIN......THE SCENT LASTS FOR AWHILE AS LONG AS YOU DO AS LEAST THREE GOOD SPRAYS</li>
