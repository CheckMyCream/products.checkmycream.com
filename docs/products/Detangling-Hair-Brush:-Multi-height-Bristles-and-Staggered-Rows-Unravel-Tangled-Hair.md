      <li>and it&#x27;s light weight.</li>
      <li>When i first used it i wasnt sure that it was going to get through my thick/coarse/super tangled hair, but it glided through like a champ.  </li>
      <li>Hair and the brush are clean after wash.</li>
      <li>To clean it, I just take it with me when I wash my hair, and brush through hair with shampoo while washing it.</li>
      <li>It really helps to detangle hair and makes hair very smooth.</li>
      <li>it flying out of hands like the other detangling brushes lol.</li>
      <li>shape is easy to hold on to, plus the fact that an angel wing really appeals to my daughter!&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>

      <li>This has made her hair journey much easier.</li>
      <li>She absolutely loves this brush.</li>

      <li>Highly recommended as they really do get the knots out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty and it has soft brush</li>
      <li>Thought the rippled surface pattern on back of brush and handle would make gripping easier, but handle style still too short and slippery.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s one of the main reasons I don&#x27;t brush it.</li>
      <li>It is not a small brush</li>
      <li>I switched out my usual brush for this one a few times, and found that it does, in fact, detangle pretty nicely.</li>
      <li>I have thick  long hair that get tangled very easy</li>
      <li>Just some slight easy brush, my long thick hair is detangled and smooth.</li>
      <li>Seriously haven&#x27;t been able to review the brush because I could not get it away from my daughter long enough to do the review.</li>
      <li>It has really cut down the time that it takes her to detangle her</li>
      <li>The first time I tried it was on wet hair and went through my hair with minimal problems.</li>

    <li> Me and my girls absolutely love this brus!  When i brush my hiar i feel the buush message my head too</li>
    <li> It really helps to detangle hair and makes hair very smooth. It is not a small brush so I don&#x27;t take it with me in the purse. Just some slight easy brush, my long thick hair is detangled and smooth. Very light weight and comfortable to hold too. To clean it, I just take it with me when I wash my hair, and brush through hair with shampoo while washing it. Hair and the brush are clean after wash. Easy!&lt;br /&gt;I got it at discount in exchange for my honest review. A nice detangling hair brush I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Really nice detangling brush. I have really long hair that tangles easily wet or dry. This brush is now kept with me at all times in my purse. The first time I tried it was on wet hair and went through my hair with minimal problems. The next time I used it was after waking up in the morning and the brush went through easier than when my hair was wet. The brush also feels nice in my hand and is easy to grip when using it. Overall it&#x27;s a nice addition to the different brushes I use on my hair. This has definitely become my everyday brush since I keep it with me at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair and usually try to avoid brushing my hair altogether. The bristles have three different heights that help to detangle your hair but not pull it. That&#x27;s a huge plus for me! Trust me I&#x27;m used to my hair getting pulled by brushes, but it&#x27;s not the pulling that bothers me...I&#x27;m pretty much numb to the pain of hair pulling from brushes lol. When regular brushes pull at my hair, they also pull OUT my hair! That&#x27;s one of the main reasons I don&#x27;t brush it. That and split ends. I still won&#x27;t be brushing my hair everyday, but I&#x27;m glad I found a brush that won&#x27;t be full of hair after I brush my hair out. I purchased this product with a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Love love love it!!! My daughter has coily curly hair and it can be hard to manage at times. This has made her hair journey much easier. The quality of the product is great. Easy to use and it&#x27;s light weight.</li>
    <li> We own several types of Detangling Brushes, this is my 9 year old daughters favorite, hands down.&lt;br /&gt;The shape is easy to hold on to, plus the fact that an angel wing really appeals to my daughter!&lt;br /&gt;Use with care, can scrape scalp just like with anything else, unless used correctly. Start at the bottom and work&lt;br /&gt;your way up, you will love these.</li>
    <li> I used this brush on my wet hair. I have thick  long hair that get tangled very easy but this brush could handle that with ease. I does not pull your hair put like most brushes.  I recommend these for the little ones.  They will love it.  I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Awesome detangling brush. Seriously haven&#x27;t been able to review the brush because I could not get it away from my daughter long enough to do the review. She absolutely loves this brush. She uses it to detangle her hair right after she gets out of the shower. It has really cut down the time that it takes her to detangle her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review of the product. The opinions of the product are based on my experience with and use of the product.</li>
    <li> Great brush! The shape fits well in my hand. Helps me to have move control when brushing vs the regular handles on brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It is light &amp; untangles my hair without hurting. Wonderful hairbrush!</li>
    <li> I was given this product at a discounted rate in return for a review. My hair is very long and Very thick. This means it is a process when brushing it when it is wet. I switched out my usual brush for this one a few times, and found that it does, in fact, detangle pretty nicely. My only downside to the product, it the holding of it. My current brush has a rubber grip on the handle, which helps to pull it through my long and thick hair. This brush can be a little hard to hold onto.</li>
    <li> This is the cutest detangling brush ever. Highly recommended as they really do get the knots out.</li>
    <li> works great on my 7 year old hair and it is very long</li>
    <li> I love it.  As promised, it works on tangled hair.  Both my boys love to use it.  They don&#x27;t think brushing hair is cruelty done to them by their mother.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty and it has soft brush</li>
    <li> My 6 yr old has extremely thick hair that tangles like crazy. The flexible bristles on this brush move with the tangles so there is less strain on tangled hair. I add coconut oil to her hair daily to limit the tangles, and I have previously tried the Knot genie brush. The biggest problem with the genie brush is that it doesn&#x27;t have a handle like this brush. I LOVE the grip on this brush bc I don&#x27;t have to worry abt it flying out of hands like the other detangling brushes lol. It also looks very cute and my daughter likes using it bc of that.  I&#x27;m glad I got this brush and happy with the price as well.</li>
    <li> Great brush.  When i first used it i wasnt sure that it was going to get through my thick/coarse/super tangled hair, but it glided through like a champ.  My advice is to comb from the outermost bristles and slowly bring down the brush as your going down your hair.</li>
    <li> When trying to detangle, the bristles get stuck and bend out of shape and do not spring back to upright position -- even when using detangling spray or cream rinse.  Thought the rippled surface pattern on back of brush and handle would make gripping easier, but handle style still too short and slippery.  Not a successful product for long, thick wavy hair.</li>
