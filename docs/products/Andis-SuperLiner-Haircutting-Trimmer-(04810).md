      <li>Worth every penny!!!!</li>
      <li>Good clippers.</li>
      <li>These are just as good, and they do a goods job.</li>
      <li>best detachable trimmer they have out right now!</li>
      <li>and luckily they work perfect with the transformer.  </li>
      <li>Another fine trimmer by Andis!!</li>
      <li>nice close cut when u bump them all the way up, waiting on my shaver attachment.</li>
      <li>The end result leaves an excellent line and fast cut.</li>
      <li>Does not cut the skin like other&lt;br /&gt;reviewers claim and it cut perfect straight out of the box.</li>
      <li>This is one of the best trimmer machine I ever had I really recommend it</li>
      <li>I tried a lot of trimmers and these are the best so far...</li>
      <li>; Panasonic wet-dry: ingrown hairs (but the best electric shaver as far as fewest ingrown</li>
      <li>my new best friend! :)</li>
      <li>It is a very powerful rotary motor trimmer that cuts very well and is especially great for beards.</li>
      <li>This is also a great tool when doing close fade haircuts (to create the first fade section bottom-up)..</li>
      <li>If there are any drawbacks to it, it sure isn&#x27;t the motor.</li>
      <li>I believe that the T-Outliner might be better if you are a barber</li>
      <li>Have NO idea how any of the models have had more than one star.</li>
      <li>The trimming angle is also excellent, the hairs grow back with a smoother edge</li>
      <li>The blade is efficient (though it could stand to trim better with fewer passes) and trims hair quite close.</li>
      <li>i love them</li>
      <li>Way better then</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>As far as creativity goes I give it a 4/5 the detachable blade was a brilliant idea........</li>
      <li>, that&#x27;s why about .5 is about as close and safe as you can get for shaving with the T-blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But I am glad I bought this, because it gives a close cut when I mark out my hair line</li>
      <li>cut better around neck line and my sideburns ..........</li>
      <li>most trimmers i have purchased have had not issue.</li>
      <li>This is a great edger that I now use as my main edger.</li>
      <li>These clippers are excellent, I use them to shave super close, using the T-blade, they trim/shave super even, and super precise.</li>
      <li>and these are the best there super comfortable and a better produce then the wahl Detailers which are very cheaply made and brake super Fast   and</li>
      <li>no bumps and easy to use I love it ...</li>
      <li>would get one side perfect, and the other side would be overlapping with the non moving</li>
      <li>Lightweight, easy to use</li>
      <li>no tug or pulling,and has an easy detachable blade for cleaning...</li>
      <li>do not apply a lot of pressure on the skin because these trimmers will EASILY cause redness on your skin.</li>
      <li>It is a great product, no regrets about my purchase.</li>
      <li>Very light but powerful machine.</li>
      <li>Cheap.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t cut as smooth as I&#x27;d like, but by adding blade oil it helps</li>
      <li>Would recommend to anyone trying to get a close and smooth shave.</li>
      <li>Very smooth and close shave on the first pass.</li>
      <li>I cut my own hair and to me, the lineup achieved with these liners are on par with the classic T-outliners from Andis.</li>
      <li>the classic Andis T-outliner that i own does not work even with the use of a transformer.  </li>
      <li>I use a shaving foam brush to clean the blades after every use, and I oil the blades before every use.</li>
      <li>and it gives me a clean shave.</li>
      <li>The trimmer is perfect, It&#x27;s cut fine, has a long power cord, It is not heavy at all.</li>
      <li>so all my Shape ups come out super Clean and Crispy</li>
      <li>Good cut if u adjust properly ....</li>
      <li>other than that, the trimmer does a great job cleaning up my lineups.</li>
      <li>This trimmer is super awsome.</li>
      <li>It cuts a straight edge and precise line.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t unscrew it too much, so that you get precise movement of the blade, and get your blade to the desired place.&lt;br /&gt;7-</li>
      <li>not for professional use that&#x27;s for sure .</li>
      <li>the blades are NOT zero-gapped, but they are very, very, very close to zero gap.</li>
      <li>i love these trimmers a lot, but this will be my last time purchasing a rotary motored trimmer.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what I need it to do..</li>
      <li>the &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34;) one: ingrown hairs and scratches; Norelco 3-head circular rotary shaver wet-dry: ingrown hairs;</li>
      <li>Like that crisp line up???</li>
      <li>This is the first Andis product that I have purchased that I have used immediately that did not require sharpening.</li>
      <li>I have had no nicks or cuts with it nor have I had any sore skin after using it (since I don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot many times).</li>
      <li>They do not run hot.</li>
      <li>Too much talk without real demonstration!</li>
      <li>Too much talk without real demonstration!</li>
      <li>Other than I&#x27;m pretty much satisfied.</li>
      <li>it took me much longer to adjust these blades than when i adjusted my t-outliners.</li>
      <li>So, be careful with adjusting the blade :)</li>
      <li>they are very sharp,nice looking</li>
      <li>so they do not curl as fast, and they feel softer rather than sharper to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>The trimmer allows him to get very close without damaging the skin.</li>
      <li>or if you really know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
      <li>So, be careful with adjusting the blade :)  </li>
      <li>So take care of your high quality Superliner!  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t given much attention in oiling the blade, which made the blade rust, and also, the trimmer have fallen from me, and the blade misaligned, and I tried to align it back,but it seems to misalign again.</li>
      <li>if you know how to cut and line, sharp, snap on blade, what more can I say</li>
      <li>Bump Fighter disposable shavers are a second best but they always resulted with ingrown hairs, less than other shavers though.</li>
      <li>The motor runs too fast and the normal &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; is unbearable.  </li>

    <li> Best clippers I have owned</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas Last year and he absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> This Andis trimmer is very good. If there are any drawbacks to it, it sure isn&#x27;t the motor. It is a very powerful rotary motor trimmer that cuts very well and is especially great for beards. Like that crisp line up??? This will do the job perfectly. My issue with them is the blades&#x27; tendency to misalign when set even. I returned them and got the Wahl 5-Star Detailer. Still, a great trimmer with an awesome feel and grip. I&#x27;d take those over T-Outliners any day.</li>
    <li> The facts is these i&#x27;m a Barber and i use these all day every day i love them cause there real sharp so all my Shape ups come out super Clean and Crispy just how i like the i used every big out liners out there and these are the best there super comfortable and a better produce then the wahl Detailers which are very cheaply made and brake super Fast   and as for this not having power i don&#x27;t know what that guy was talking about in that other review these have alot of power if anything to much power he must of got a bad defected one</li>
    <li> It does exactly what I need it to do..</li>
    <li> As far as creativity goes I give it a 4/5 the detachable blade was a brilliant idea........but the name of this clipper DEFINATELY doesn&#x27;t match the quality!!!! Adjusted blades or not, this clipper doesn&#x27;t give the sharp look that every barber loves, the motor is just too weak!!!</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I expected. The trimmer cut with great eased.  I shall look at other products from this dealer.  Thanks</li>
    <li> nice close cut when u bump them all the way up, waiting on my shaver attachment. best detachable trimmer they have out right now!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best trimmer ever purchase. Way better then those cheaper version I purchase in the pass. thank you</li>
    <li> Blade does not cut at all. Shakey and load . not for professional use that&#x27;s for sure .</li>
    <li> The trimmer is perfect, It&#x27;s cut fine, has a long power cord, It is not heavy at all. I like it</li>
    <li> and is super liner haircutting trimmer does not cut hair horizontally over comb :( most trimmers i have purchased have had not issue. yes, i am 47yrs veteran hairdresser.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed as I got used one instead on new time; I returned back. Just be carfuall with condition of the item you are buying.  I had this  very disappointing experience with Amazon three times when I paid for a new item and received used in return.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Cheap. I want my money back.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best trimmer machine I ever had I really recommend it</li>
    <li> Have bought two Andis buzzers. Have NO idea how any of the models have had more than one star. Terrible product. Both fell apart, LITERALLY stopped working, after about 10 uses. I beg of you, save your money. Find another product.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great AFTER you adjust the blades to your liking. Out of the box they aren&#x27;t the closest cut. I use the SuperLiners to dry shave my face and it cuts very close.</li>
    <li> you will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who cannot use a razor blade or any other shaver. The trimmer allows him to get very close without damaging the skin. He loves it and the beard is less scratchy too!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cut as smooth as I&#x27;d like, but by adding blade oil it helps</li>
    <li> The Andis Trimmer absolutely terrific. It great at performing the job that it was created for. It sharp at trimming my mustache. It cuts a straight edge and precise line. It a great trimmer to have an I am glade I chose this fine and efficient cutting tool todo the job.</li>
    <li> I really like these liners you can easily adjust them by tampering with the screws on the blade to make them as sharp as you want. Lightweight, easy to use if you know how to cut and line, sharp, snap on blade, what more can I say</li>
    <li> I will give 4 stars for this product specifically because adjusting these blades took a LOT of trial and error. blade adjustment is not the same as the t-outliner / outliner 2. it took me much longer to adjust these blades than when i adjusted my t-outliners. the key to this adjustment is to adjust the blade one side at a time. i also don&#x27;t recommend using the shaver attachment because when you detach the shaver to attach the t-blade, the cutting blade on the t-blade moves by itself, which was a frustrating experience to go back and re-adjust the blade. other than that, the trimmer does a great job cleaning up my lineups. i love these trimmers a lot, but this will be my last time purchasing a rotary motored trimmer. the blades are NOT zero-gapped, but they are very, very, very close to zero gap. do not apply a lot of pressure on the skin because these trimmers will EASILY cause redness on your skin.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for and works great on my skin ...no bumps and easy to use I love it ...my new best friend! :)</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying this product. I was stuck in between buying the Andis Superliner and the Wahl Detailer. But I am glad I bought this, because it gives a close cut when I mark out my hair line and it gives me a clean shave. Plus base on other reviews it is more durable than the Detailer.</li>
    <li> How to Zero Gap the blade:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steps:&lt;br /&gt;1- Detach the blade.&lt;br /&gt;2- Unscrew the two screws to 90 degree angle.&lt;br /&gt;3- Position the blade on a flat surface &amp;#34; Mirror &amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;4- Angle the blade 75 degree - 85 degree to the moving blade side, and push the moving blade down so that it align with the non moving blade.&lt;br /&gt;5- Screw the blade CAREFULLY. Don&#x27;t move the hand that holds the blade, so that you get an even result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this worked for you then you are lucky.&lt;br /&gt;Many would get one side perfect, and the other side would be overlapping with the non moving blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6- unscrew the side that is overlapping just a tiny bit &amp;#34; Less than 45 degree &amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t unscrew it too much, so that you get precise movement of the blade, and get your blade to the desired place.&lt;br /&gt;7- With your naked eye adjust the side that is overlapping till you get the result that you wish for.&lt;br /&gt;8- CAREFULLY, screw it back again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now your blade is zero gapped.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;If overlapping occurred, then, go back to step 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution when Zero gapping the blade!&lt;br /&gt;When zero gapping the blade, you would think that it is perfect, but it might not be.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest using it on your hand, and wait to see it if it&#x27;s RED or not. If there is no redness.&lt;br /&gt;Then, use it on your face on only one spot, then wait seconds and check if it&#x27;s red or itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to oil your blades. They will be around for years. So take care of your high quality Superliner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#UPDATE: 03/07/2017&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 3 years, with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;I did replace the blade once.8, until you get the desired result. With skill, you&#x27;ll need 2 minutes maximum to accomplish this method.  Caution when Zero gapping the blade! When zero gapping the blade, you would think that it is perfect, but it might not be. I suggest using it on your hand, and wait to see it if it&#x27;s RED or not. If there is not redness. Then, use it on your face on only one spot, then wait seconds and check.  Having your face RED, and itchy is not fun xD So, be careful with adjusting the blade :)  This is the video that helped me. Andis video was NOT helpful at all. Too much talk without real demonstration! Amazon seems to not allow external links. So, go to YouTube, and type &amp;#34; Andis Superliner adjusting freestyle &amp;#34;.  Don&#x27;t forget to oil your blades. They will be around for years. So take care of your high quality Superliner!  #UPDATE 21/12/2014:  It&#x27;s been around 2 years, and this trimmer work great. I haven&#x27;t given much attention in oiling the blade, which made the blade rust, and also, the trimmer have fallen from me, and the blade misaligned, and I tried to align it back,but it seems to misalign again. Which made me purchase a new blade. Other than I&#x27;m pretty much satisfied. I would buy it again.ll you get the result that you wish for. 8- CAREFULLY, screw it back again.  Now your blade is zero gapped. If overlapping occurred, then go back to step 6 to 8, until you get the desired result. With skill, you&#x27;ll need 2 minutes maximum to accomplish this method.  This is the video that helped me. Andis video was NOT helpful at all. Too much talk without real demonstration! Amazon seems to not allow external links. So, go to YouTube, and type &amp;#34; Andis Superliner adjusting freestyle &amp;#34;.  #UPDATE 09/07/2014:  Caution when Zero gapping the blade! I have done it so close that I did a very great shave with it. When I finished shaving, my face was RED from the blade cutting me. Didn&#x27;t feel the pain while it happened, but after the shave it really gets itchy, and uncomfortable!  So, When zero gapping the blade, you would think that it is perfect, but it might not be. I suggest using it on your hand, and wait to see it if it&#x27;s RED or not. If there is not redness. Then, use it on your face on only one spot, then wait seconds and check.  Having your face RED, and itchy is not fun xD So, be careful with adjusting the blade :)</li>
    <li> These clippers are excellent, I use them to shave super close, using the T-blade, they trim/shave super even, and super precise. The trimming angle is also excellent, the hairs grow back with a smoother edge so they do not curl as fast, and they feel softer rather than sharper to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adjusted and aligned the T-blade using a magnifying glass to see up close, and a metal ruler as a straight edge, to get as close to as close to a .5mm gap as possible. I use a shaving foam brush to clean the blades after every use, and I oil the blades before every use. I use these to shave every 36 hours as my Dermatologist recommended rather than every 24 hours, so that&#x27;s shaving in the morning one day, next day in the evening, and so on. NOT had a single ingrown hair after 1 week using the clippers to shave with, been a solid 4 weeks now and no ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also quieter than any electric shaver I have used in the past. What else have I tried? Bump Fighter disposable shavers are a second best but they always resulted with ingrown hairs, less than other shavers though. Tried 2 Braun electric shavers: ingrown hairs; RotoShave: ingrown hairs and have friction burns; Remmington &amp;#34;Smooth&amp;#34; electric shaver (the &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34;) one: ingrown hairs and scratches; Norelco 3-head circular rotary shaver wet-dry: ingrown hairs; Wahl cordless with a T-blade, good but did not trim close enough and somewhat uneven; Panasonic wet-dry: ingrown hairs (but the best electric shaver as far as fewest ingrown hairs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Andis Superliner Clippers cost $65. and arrived in a week and in brand new condition (you gotta check that when you buy anything online). Does take a little practice, cause if you get close to 0 or 0 the blade, then you can cut yourself if you hold at the wrong angle, that&#x27;s why about .5 is about as close and safe as you can get for shaving with the T-blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, I line my forehead very week and go to the barber every 3 weeks now rather than every 2 weeks as before. No more disposable razors, no more shaving cream, no more face scrubber with moisturizers, no more razor bumps, NO MORE INGROWN HAIRS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gonna buy the Andis Sperliners for my brother as a birthday gift next month!3 weeks now rather than every 2 weeks as before. No more disposable razors, no more shaving cream, no more face scrubber with moisturizers, no more razor bumps, NO MORE INGROWN HAIRS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gonna buy the Andis Sperliners for my brother as a birthday gift next month!</li>
    <li> Good cut if u adjust properly ....cut better around neck line and my sideburns ..........&lt;br /&gt;The Best andis superliner excellent</li>
    <li> I have used this to shave my beard, neckline, and back hair. It is a great all purpose tool the way I see it. It is quiet, solid and the cord is long enough for anything I have needed. The blade is efficient (though it could stand to trim better with fewer passes) and trims hair quite close. I have had no nicks or cuts with it nor have I had any sore skin after using it (since I don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot many times). I believe that the T-Outliner might be better if you are a barber or if you really know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
    <li> They work great, I readjusted the blade to cut absolutely perfect. They do not run hot. Excellent trimmers to have.</li>
    <li> This is a great edger that I now use as my main edger. Although this does not produce a sharp line-up/edgeup straight out-of-the-box (unlike what people have said), you can easily adjust it if you want to use this for edging. I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t adjusted mine yet because I usually go over my lineups with a straight-razor. This is also a great tool when doing close fade haircuts (to create the first fade section bottom-up)..</li>
    <li> This trimmer is super awsome. Very smooth and close shave on the first pass. Does not cut the skin like other&lt;br /&gt;reviewers claim and it cut perfect straight out of the box. Love it. Would recommend to anyone trying to get a close and smooth shave. Very light but powerful machine.</li>
    <li> This is the first Andis product that I have purchased that I have used immediately that did not require sharpening. It cuts close and does not get hot like other trimmers. Another fine trimmer by Andis!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t but this because I bought one and it did not cut hair at all I returned it and got a new one I used it for two weeks and it nips and scratches skin IT SUCKS</li>
    <li> The end result leaves an excellent line and fast cut. But the length of the the T-blades cause it to be extremely painful for anyone with sensitive skin. Trimming beard on neck was hard to bear. Left skin very irritated.</li>
    <li> Plenty of people commented on the positives and i agree with all of them.  One thing no one mentioned and is a plus if you are stationed overseas like me is that it works perfect with 220V transformers.  Being in Germany the classic Andis T-outliner that i own does not work even with the use of a transformer.  The motor runs too fast and the normal &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; is unbearable.  Went out on a limb for these and luckily they work perfect with the transformer.  I cut my own hair and to me, the lineup achieved with these liners are on par with the classic T-outliners from Andis.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny!!!! Recommended for a long lasting fresh hairline...no tug or pulling,and has an easy detachable blade for cleaning...warning blades are very sharp so be careful</li>
    <li> It is a great product, no regrets about my purchase. My barber teacher recommened it to me and I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Works very well to create sharp lines.</li>
    <li> Good clippers. I&#x27;m am extremely impressed by these edgers. I have the wahl retailers and I like them. These are just as good, and they do a goods job. The detailers are smaller,soon give them the edge.</li>
    <li> I tried a lot of trimmers and these are the best so far...they are very sharp,nice looking and they do not get hot if your in need of a close shave and a sharp line up, look no further.</li>
    <li> These suck bad. The blades arent sharp at all. I hope that promate makes some blades for these soon. The shave attachment is pretty decent although you will need to be careful because it pops off from time to time.</li>
