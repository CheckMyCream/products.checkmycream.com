<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good eyebrow brush</li>
    <li> I am always trying to tame my wild  eyebrows.  This little tool helps a lot.</li>
    <li> i use this brush everyday with the dipbrow pomade. I like the brush i just wish it was a little more stiff</li>
    <li> I love this brush. SO easy to do my eyebrows now. Love how the brush isn&#x27;t too thin for hairlike strokes (which i don&#x27;t have the patience for, honestly), and the spoolie at the end to brush excess product off. Perfect.</li>
    <li> This brush is great to do your eyebrows, and it also works if you like to use eyeshadow as a liner. The brush end is perfectly shaped and easy to clean. The want is the perfect size to fix your eyebrows up, and make sure everything is in place. Definitely worth the price, and it fits great in my brush bag as well! Every girl needs one!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tool to get my eyebrows perfect. I love it!</li>
    <li> I use this with my NYX brow powder kit and it makes my eyebrows look better than ever. It isn&#x27;t super stiff, but I am very happy with the way it is.</li>
    <li> Great brush totally worth it</li>
    <li> It gave up working after just 1 month the hairs on the side parted..unsatisfied. wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, not bad, not great.  Good value so will not complain.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t even compare to the Anastasia Brush. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Wish it could be returned! :(</li>
    <li> This is a cheap brow brush. The brush was bent and is crooked. I guess you get what you pay for. I had to order another more expensive brush from another company. I cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Too soft. Useless for me actually. I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Helps with applying my Anastasia dipbrow precisely!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Yes, i personally think so! This is the second Duo Brow Brush I&#x27;ve purchased to use on lashline and brows. One to apply powder/mineral and the 2nd for gel/cream... it works perfectly!!!</li>
    <li> very convienent, i have one less brush to use.</li>
    <li> I use this brush to apply my eye brow gel - I saw it in the store for $20.  Can&#x27;t beat this!</li>
    <li> Too flimsy, does not work for eyebrow powder.</li>
    <li> Its a great brush but broke upon taking it out of its packaging. I just glued the broken part back on.</li>
    <li> Brush got soft after a while</li>
    <li> Not comparable to high-street brow brushes. The bristles are too long and not hard enough to hold product properly, so if you&#x27;re using it with a gel or pommade, it moves around sloppily. The spooly is fine, but I had to trim the brush. I&#x27;d still recommend Anastasia&#x27;s brow brush over this.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than the Anastasia Beverly Hills Duo brow brush and does the job good!! I use this for my dipbrow pomade and so far it has been money well spent!!!</li>
    <li> I really wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this brush.  The bristles are so cheap, they end up fanning out in all different directions.  Definitely not a good brush to use for precision application (i.e. the whole point of an angled brush for eyebrows or liner).</li>
    <li> I did like this Brow Brush because it has 2 different types of brushes. I would have liked it more if the brush to apply brow powder was a bit bigger and firmer.</li>
    <li> I love this brush I use it everyday.  Great for highlighting my eyebrow.</li>
    <li> Like people have said before, the angled brush bristles are too soft. I use an ecotools brush instead which has a similar shape but more firmness. The spoolie is good but nothing special. That said, the current price of $6 is quite a good deal compared to the ABH one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never enhanced my brows before. I purchased this along with the Dipbrow Pomade (Soft Brown) and absolutely love it. You don&#x27;t need to have a skilled hand and it&#x27;s so precise.</li>
    <li> The brush is good. However, the opposite  brush to fill in the brows is a little thick. I just have to be carefully with applying. Overall, it&#x27;s decent for the price point.</li>
    <li> Does the job - good value</li>
    <li> I love that this brush is so affordable. I usually use a pomade-like product to give my brows some structure in the spots that are sparse. I really wish the bristles were a little bit stiffer, but it otherwise performs well. And it&#x27;s so convenient having the spoolie on the other end so I don&#x27;t have to pull in a separate one!</li>
    <li> I love this my eyebrows look amazing! The brush is very convenient and professional</li>
    <li> Super handy brush. Not much i can really say except it rocks and i use it everyday! totally recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent for putting on dip brow pomade.</li>
    <li> It makes my eyebrows pop !!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The spoolie is great, but the applicator brush is not stiff enough. I ordered a brow kit that came with a cheap applicator brush and it works better. To have good control you have to have a stiff brush and this one just doesn&#x27;t work good for me.</li>
    <li> Really like this brush, I&#x27;m able to apply the right amount of brow powder and smooth it out to look natural.</li>
    <li> Nice quality brush, just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Very cheap but I guess you get what you pay for. Bristles fall out every time I use it and it feels like it&#x27;s about to break.</li>
    <li> Great brush &amp; fine tip</li>
    <li> Better than some expensive eyebrow brushes I have. Very good product</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I use the Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild eye/brow liner, which is pigmented and waxy, but too soft to apply directly. So I use this brush with it, and love how it applies. The brush is actually sold in Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply stores as well, if you&#x27;d prefer to pick it up in person. Would totally recommend this brush for this price. Hope this was helpful!</li>
    <li> I love how fluffy the spoolie is and how great the angled brush is for concealer. I reach for this DAILY.</li>
    <li> Same quality as department store brushes for a lot less money!</li>
    <li> Love this brush it&#x27;s so soft and thin that it&#x27;s easy to apply my eyebrow pomade and the spool brush is perfect for blending and brushing out the brows.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is well made and allows for easy application of shadowed eye liner or brow liner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with all aspects of this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Better than Anastasia&lt;br /&gt;Great brush!!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size</li>
    <li> amazing, makes my eyebrows look nice.</li>
    <li> My previous brush (the hairs part) used to be more rigid, so I&#x27;m used to that. This one does the job, but I need to get used to still getting definition with a softer/more bendable head. Very nice though. So, if you&#x27;re used to more flexibility than you&#x27;ll like this one.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this item. It arrived on time and was just as it was described.</li>
    <li> Love this brow brush. Cheaper alternative to the more expensive name brand brushes I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> I like that this is 2 tools in one. Personally, I like angled brushes to be a bit more on the stiff side and this brush is a little too soft. It&#x27;s still a pretty good brush but it&#x27;s not very precise. Other than that I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was using an ELF brush for my eyebrows. This is so much better! The bristles are thick and the handle is well made. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this for my eyebrows. I use a mix of powder and a gel and I use this brush with both products. It&#x27;s just the right size and stiffness to get my brows looking great. Plus having the spooley attached makes the job easier cause I only have to get out this one product.</li>
    <li> Finally, a dual eyebrow brush that is stiff enough to really work.  The curved end tames your eyebrows.  The brush end properly applies eyebrow color that looks natural.  I wish I had bought one of these years ago.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this more then any other one I&#x27;ve tried! It&#x27;s amazing and works perfectly! Get compliments on my eyebrows all the time. Really great price to</li>
    <li> Works ok but the brush is too soft.</li>
    <li> This brush is incredible! It&#x27;s affordable but it still Dosent the job. Well made and great for the brows! Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> It fits into my hand easily. Brushes the brow to a natural arch and picks up the brow powder so you can easily apply. The result is a natural look.</li>
    <li> This little thing comes in very handy. Really gets the job, I love it. Really helps with getting my brows perfect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but I wish brush is a little bit firmer than this. To me, it&#x27;s a bit soft.</li>
    <li> This does the job perfectly for a fraction of the cost! I use it every day and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet :)</li>
    <li> Product looks good and lasts all day</li>
    <li> terrible quality brow brush, nowhere near as dense as it needs to be. If you&#x27;re looking for precise eyebrows, definitely look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> works lke how its suppose to</li>
    <li> the silver parts on it are a little weekly made but thats y only complaint! its amazing! just like the Anastasia Beverly hills one!</li>
    <li> Brush is angled nicely but a little too soft, somewhat difficult to control vs. a stiffer brow brush.</li>
    <li> Works great. Very much worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Got this brow brush today and am quite pleased with it so far. I am hoping and praying it is as strong as it looks and feels. The appearance is quite sleek and I am looking forward to using this for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> The brush to brush my brows was cool, but the other end for me to use my pomade to fill in my brows sucked. the brush was to soft , I need a more firm brush.</li>
    <li> The brush works for me. I only wish the hairs were a bit harder.</li>
    <li> Works very well. The angled brush bristles are still stiff and work well with eyebrow powders. The brush works well on my eyebrows. Had others which lost stiffness after a while, but this one definitely held its form.</li>
    <li> I use this to apply my Anastasia Dip Brow pomade but the brush is not firm enough for me and the spoolie collects small hair.. Otherwise, It does the job, I just expected more from all the great comments</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS BOY/GIRL BRUSH! It&#x27;s amazing and does the job for my eyebrows . It is easy to wash and doesn&#x27;t shed. The angle brush is stiff enough to do my eyebrows yet soooo soft and nice on the skin and eyebrow hair. The spooley is great. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find a great angled eyebrow brush for the longest. They are either too wide and stiff or too flimsy. This product, the Ardell duo brow brush was as pictured and described. The spooly was a plus! It&#x27;s priced reasonable. Shipping was super fast. I would order from this store again.</li>
    <li> The first thing I have to say is that the order came really fast. I ordered it on the 23 and it came the 25. As soon as I got the product I tested it out and it does what its suppose to do. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to find a good spoolie. I also used the angled brush to apply concealer under my eyebrows and it works really good as well. One thing I might complain about is that I wish the bristle were a little harder but thats just me, other than that it awesome.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Great product for a affordable price. Great for doing my eyebrows or applying eyeshadow on the  crease for a smokey eyed look.</li>
    <li> My sister wanted this item for her Kwanzaa gift.  I do not wear or use make up.  However, she loved her gift.</li>
    <li> very fine eyeliner brush that does not shed</li>
    <li> I was hoping the angled brush would be more stiff than it is....usually brow brushes are quite stiff.</li>
    <li> BEST PRICE ON THIS BRUSH THAT I FOUND ONLINE! WORK LIKE A CHARM FOR EYEBROWS</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Applies the product very nicely and evenly.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good little brush.  I wanted something a little stiffer... this one is softer on both ends than i thought it would be... but it is still totally useable for what i needed it for &#x3D;eyebrows.  The brush side is good for filling in, the bristle side is good for sealing.  Not bad.</li>
    <li> This brush works great. I use it with the Anastasia brow powder and I love the results. I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to ..the angled brush is really good with outlining ..it is not as stiff as I would like to use to define my brows but it gets the job done and I am always getting compliments on my eyebrows !! I&#x27;ve purchased two so far ..the first one my dog chewed up and immediately bought another one ...it&#x27;s worth it !!</li>
    <li> The product came fast and it was exactly what I expected. The brush was a good price and works as well as the more expensive items.</li>
    <li> I love using this brush I&#x27;m new to applying powder on my brows and this brush makes it so much easier.</li>
    <li> I use it with the NYX pomade and I think the brush is perfect for it!</li>
    <li> This has the best spooley,better than Anastasia&#x27;s brow wiz spooley everyone raves about for some reason. It&#x27;s way cheaper and a great buy. 100% a staple in your makeup bag.</li>
    <li> Does the job perfectly</li>
    <li> Ok, this is super handy.  I use this with the Elf Brow Duo.  I shape my brows first with the spoolie end and then apply the wax and powder combo with the angled end.  I will sometimes soften the look again with the spoolie end.  Just super practical.</li>
    <li> I use this almost every day between brows and applying/smudging eyeliner. It&#x27;s much more comfortable than using a flat smudger. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery, the product is of good quality, the brush doesn&#x27;t bend easily and feels supper soft, the spoolie bristles also feel very soft and the size is perfect. I guess the only complain would be that it feels too lightweight in my hand so it makes it a bit difficult to have control of it. Overall I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This terrible don&#x27;t buy it! If you&#x27;re looking for a good brush to fill in your eyebrows buy it from somewhere else because this is not worth your money.</li>
    <li> The product is very easy to use with wonderful results. I have very little natural brow, this really looks natural.</li>
    <li> Love it, best quality ......</li>
    <li> Great product if the ends had covers it would be a 5 star item for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried several brow brushes, and find this the best for me of all of them.  I have very sparse eyebrows and this brush helps me shape them perfectly!</li>
    <li> I like this duo brow brush which I use for my brows and to line my eyes with eye shadow.  Works great!</li>
    <li> The brow part is really really soft</li>
    <li> I really love the spoolie on this brush. Although the angled side isn&#x27;t firm enough for my to use as a brush to fill in my eyebrows</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see why you would need to spend 30$ on a brush like this at Sephora. This one is the perfect size for me and I useit every morning. I love the dual action usage out of this, and the duo brow brush works perfectly with my Anastasia Beverly Hills pomade jar. Try it :)</li>
    <li> I love it it works perfect for my eyebrows .this brush give me the look that I was looking for.it affordable for the price and it does the same work as other expensive brushes..thank you salon guys..</li>
    <li> great for applying eyebrows</li>
    <li> Two birds- one stone.  I use this every day and I love it a little too much, considering it&#x27;s just a makeup tool.  Anyone who is even looking at this might as well purchase with one click- it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I had a Clinique eyebrow brush that came with eyebrow powder which I bought many years ago. It was a GREAT brush, because it was stiff and helped me fill in my eyebrows. That brush got somewhat worn, and I thought the Ardell brush would be comparable. However, it&#x27;s not stiff enough, so I&#x27;m going to try a different brand (that starts with a &amp;#34;J&amp;#34;). Hope the new order will work better.</li>
    <li> nice sturdy brush for eyebrows. The spoli part is also good</li>
    <li> Use daily. Perfect with Anastasia dip brow.</li>
    <li> Very easy and handy to use when filling in your eyebrows. The spoolie is great to brush the hairs into place and the angled brush is great and sturdy.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday to fill in my eyebrows and the angle on the brush and the texture is perfect for that. I also like the comb on the end as well. I have actually ran out of eyebrow powder before, but with this brush even brown eyeshadow works if you&#x27;re in a pinch. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This works perfectly! I&#x27;ve never seen my brows look so perf. I&#x27;m new to the make up world and this is a must!</li>
    <li> Does the job. the spoolie is not too rough. the angled brush is soft and maneuvers well. Excellent tool to add to your arsenal.</li>
    <li> I think this product works just fine for me. Im not really amazed with it because im kind of disappointed with the angled brush, they are not stiff! They are actually very soft which makes it hard for me to draw my brows it it.. But it works just fine...</li>
    <li> This brow brush has soft bristles. It helps blend really well. I live that it is 2 in 1. It is really thin so it helps make sure your eyebrows look natural. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I&#x27;d reccommend it to anyone, it makes the straightest lines on my brows. love love love.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for the new Anastasia of Beverly Hill dip brow pomade. It works great for the price, not to stiff, not to soft.</li>
    <li> Worked just as well as expensive Anastasia brush I was replacing</li>
    <li> My go to brow brush!!</li>
    <li> When it arrived, the brush was too thick and was dented. I cannot use it to create a sculpted eyebrow. The spooly although, was alright.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is exactly as described.  The only thing I wish was different is that I wish the brush side was a little more firm for filling in brows.  Spoolie is great, this really is a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this item thinking I was buying a s somewhat higher quality brush. Nah. Make yourself a favor to the 99 cent store and get one there, or any cheap brush. I thought this was an eyebrow brush, but the bristles are too soft and limp to apply anything on. Junk, junk. too much hassle to return.</li>
    <li> great price and works great</li>
    <li> I use the soft, angle end to add WOW brow color to thicken and to extend the length of one of my brows.  It along with the WOW medium, brown color I ordered online work great</li>
    <li> This is the best brush ever and the bristles are strong and durable!!! I only bought a back up brush bc a) I love it and b) my current brush got a little smashed up during a location move. Make sure your bristles don&#x27;t get bent for a long period of time and remember to clean your brushes in a little bit of vinegar and water (soak and set to dry)!</li>
    <li> I love the spooly especially. The brush is great in puttiing my brow shadow (eye shadow mix of 2 cheap sleek shadows) in between the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love this niffty little tool.</li>
    <li> I like this brush fall.</li>
    <li> The brush appeared larger, but was still a fine size to work with.  I bought several to have a back up.</li>
    <li> Sturdy brush on both ends and blends my powder with ease.  I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve survived without it for so long.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and it worked well.</li>
    <li> Tip could be thinner but a nice addition to my brush set</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. The only other double ended brush like this I could find was the anastasia one and I just didn&#x27;t want to shell out the $20 for an ordinary eyebrow brush. The liner tip is a bit soft which works great for brows but might not work if you are trying to do a very precise line as it isn&#x27;t firm.</li>
    <li> My favorite eyebrow brush. I refer this brush to everyone. Easy to grip and maneuver. Sounds silly but some things are made to be harder than they need to be. This little brush isn&#x27;t one of them and the price point is good as well.</li>
    <li> Love it but wish the bristles were a bit stiffer. It feels like a paintbrush</li>
    <li> this wasnt for me and im not a girl so idk what to say but im assuming it gets the job done</li>
    <li> This is a very good tool to have for brows, and not just that but very affordable. I purchased this when i purchased my model in the bottle (eyebrow sealer) and I have to say this is Amazing... Groom very very good.</li>
    <li> This is a great option for anyone applying a brow pomade or gel. I used this in place of a brush that was recommended with a brow product I bought  but this was half the price. It applies with precision and then allows you to blend which is SOOOO important for a natural looking brow. Save your money and buy this brush!</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s not at stuff as I would like for it to be it still gets the job done! So glad I purchased it!</li>
    <li> This product works great. I was tempted to buy the Anastasia brand brow brush and just happened to find this one on Amazon, best thing that could have happened. Why pay $18+ when you can get this great brush for under $7!</li>
    <li> Great little brush at a good price.</li>
    <li> this makes doing my eyebrows a dream. I love that it comes with two sides so you don&#x27;t have to have more than one tool.</li>
    <li> works great, no flaws. perfect for brow sculpting, got here on expected date, overall it was a good buy</li>
    <li> Love it! will order again</li>
    <li> Fast shipment and exactly what was on the images, was the product I received!</li>
    <li> The best tool ever...... This keeps my brows well groomed and I can also shape them perfect</li>
    <li> The bristles are a little softer than I would typically like on the wand end, but it gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Kind of flimsy. Not the worst but not the best. Go to Target, you can get better.  Tsjs nsjs jsjs</li>
    <li> This does the job and then some. Great dupe for other brand name brushes. I use it daily and love it!</li>
    <li> Nice product. It works well on my eyebrows and my eyelashes.  I find it helpful for separating clumps of mascara.</li>
    <li> Draws a nice clean, fine lines when I use it to fill in my eyebrows with brow powder. The brush on the end gives my brows the finishing touch as all the hairs are swept into the natural direction of their growth. Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Best eyebrow gel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Brush is to weak, its hard to fill in when a brush is not firm enough. I am only using the opposite side now to brush out my brows. I&#x27;ll get my monies worth that way.</li>
    <li> Super brush!  Only wish I had ordered two at the time. Will definitely order this one again.  I use it for the Anastasia DIPBROW and it works beautifully.</li>
    <li> I wish I order 2 of this items so that I can have one at home and 1 in my purse.</li>
    <li> Great quality I loved this brush!</li>
    <li> I use this brush every day, wonderful quality. Easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
    <li> The product arrived very quickly and was completely as advertised.  The price was very reasonable and the brush is of good quality.  The one disappointment is that the brow brush itself is too soft ... I would prefer a firm brush for brows.</li>
    <li> I know there are other brow brushes out there of better quality, (like the Anastasia one), but they also come with a hefty price tag. This brush was an &amp;#34;Add-On&amp;#34; item, and I decided to give it a go. I&#x27;ve used it several times, and it&#x27;s held up well. Does just fine and gets the job done. The spoodle end is stiff enough to get those brows in shape,  and also blends color application (both pencil or powder) seamlessly. I really wish I&#x27;d ordered more. I give this the thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! Doing my eyebrows with this brush makes it easy and they always look on fleek! Highly recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> It all around does a good job, but it is just a bit too thick for precision. If you don&#x27;t really need too much except just fill in, this is great, but not if you need that real clean, sharp brow.</li>
    <li> The brush isn&#x27;t my favorite.. I like my Sigma small angle much better to be honest.. but the spoolie part is great for separating lashes after mascara and also for brows. Its not bad to have an extra brush around either I suppose.</li>
    <li> worked amazing no shedding very precise picked up a lot of color and showed the color very well when used</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t the best eyebrow brush I got but def. not terrible. It is short and blunt I feel more like a filler brush than a brush that&#x27;s thinner. The brush is the best combination</li>
    <li> The bristles on the angled brush is too soft that I can&#x27;t achieve the winged liner on my eyes.</li>
    <li> Finally, a brow brush and applicator in one, that fits comfortably in your hand. Usually brow brushes that come with brow shadow are very tiny and impractical.</li>
    <li> Excellent brow brush compared to the high-end brow makeup companies. I highly recommend this brush because it combines both ends needed for a great eyebrow. It&#x27;s very sturdy and gets the the job done! The slanted tip is the right stiffness and is great for precise brows. Don&#x27;t spend more on other brands for the same quality!</li>
    <li> I use the angeled side of the brush to fill in my brows and the brush to blend once I&#x27;m done. It&#x27;s a great brush and good quality. Get it!</li>
    <li> Its a cheap brush and will not do the job for a sculpted brow I suggest purchasing a Mac Cosmetics 263 brush for perfecting brows.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Clean often or your bristles will give you problems.</li>
    <li> Does a perfect job! At a department store this same brush is $18.00</li>
    <li> This brush eyebrows I love. It is very elastic and moderately stiff. I use it with lipstick eyebrow from ABH</li>
    <li> Love the dual functions.</li>
    <li> Wish the end was a little firmer. I did cut a little off and it helped. Overall I do like it and use it daily.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use really like it though sometimes it is hard to shape the front of the eyebrow with it</li>
    <li> The brush was exactly as described, and the comb is very convenient. I would prefer a more dense brush, but this one gets the job done pretty well too. It&#x27;s nice and thin but it bends too much in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for brushing through the brows, then applying powder or pomade, with the other end.  You can brush through again with gel if desired.  This brush is so great, that I bought a second one.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush, I&#x27;ve had it about 6 months and use it almost every day. It is a useful tool for my daily beauty regimen. It hasn&#x27;t shed at all, though the bristles are a bit on the long and soft side compared to some of my other angled brushes which makes it a little more difficult for me to ensure that it maintains it&#x27;s shape. Other than that It&#x27;s a great brush and I love how I can use both end to keep my eyebrows looking nice and perfectly groomed.</li>
    <li> Cute little brush, the spoolie is great, because is stiff enough to put all the hairs in place and also blend well the ocassional excess of brow powder, gel or pomade. The brush works just fine with powder, but I find it too soft for defining the brows edges, which I think is exactly the job for an angled brush. Anyway is a pretty decent tool for the price!</li>
    <li> I use this brush with the anastasia eyebrow color and it works flawlessly</li>
    <li> My wife loved the product</li>
    <li> Luv it! I use it for applying my tarte brow mousse. Though the Tarte comes with its own angled brush/spoolie I actually prefer this one as it&#x27;s stiffer than the Tarte. It&#x27;s very handy. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Generally makeup brushes of quality can get fairly pricey, but I found this brush just as comparable as the more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Awful, I&#x27;d give it no stars if that were an option</li>
    <li> Fantastic brush.  Of all that I&#x27;ve tried, this is the best.</li>
    <li> This broke after about 3 months.</li>
    <li> This brush is just okay. The brush end is way too soft for eyebrows and the powder/pomade tends to go flying. I find myself spending a lot of time cleaning up my outline than I&#x27;d like. It&#x27;s not horrible or anything but not the greatest for an eyebrow brush. Plus the brush it pretty thin so coverage isn&#x27;t too hot either.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works just right.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with my Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow Pomade but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t pair all that great with it. I found that the angled brush side of it was too thick and stiff to be able to fill in my brows. The spooly side of it i do like. I still use this brush on a daily basis but not exactly the way i though i would. I ended up using the angled side to clean up and sharpen my brows after I fill them in. I just dip it in some concealer and &amp;#34;carve&amp;#34; out my brows and do a little cleanup too. I also think its a little small but hey it is under $10. If you&#x27;re buying it to go with the dipbrow I would not recommend it. I ended up using a random angled paint brush from the arts and craft section in Walmart.</li>
    <li> I am an eyebrow snob, and this brush is glorious!</li>
    <li> This brush is OKAY for the price. The actual brush end is a little stiff and cheap-y for me, might be worth to splurge a bit on a better quality brow brush if you&#x27;re looking for a good daily brow definer.</li>
    <li> Great eyebrow filling tool! I liekthe duality of it - reallly helpful.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best brushes for eyebrows and eyelashes I&#x27;ve found.  I use the angle brush end for applying eyebrow powder/gel and the  wand end for taking the inevitable &amp;#34;clumps&amp;#34; out of my mascara.  It&#x27;s really good at the latter!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. As pictured and stated. Love the color. It&#x27;s hard to find the right color for a redhead but this seems to be perfect</li>
    <li> Great buy for such a great price. I use it everyday to do my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Perfect eyebrow brush</li>
    <li> Both sides of brush work great.</li>
    <li> I really get precise smooth eyebrows when I use this brush!! You have to make sure you clean it every day because the build up of the brow gel will make it stuff and thick.. 😒 but my eyebrows always come out bomb.com with this brush!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with eyebrow pomade and it works perfectly. The angled part of the brush is firm without being stiff which makes it easy to be precise when applying your makeup. The spoolie side turned out to not help me much because my eyebrows are so fine and sparse that there isn&#x27;t much to comb, but it does help sort of diffuse the look of my makeup and makes my brows look less harsh. I am very impressed with this brush and I think the quality is on par with some of my MAC brushes that cost much more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of brushes to try to fix the mess I&#x27;ve made of my brows over the years. The Ardell Duo is great. One side brushes the brows and the other side easily applies the brow powder to fill in.</li>
    <li> It is honestly very comparable to the Beverly Hills Anastasia Brush #12 which retails for $18 at Sephora. It is a little* softer which isn&#x27;t as good for eyebrows. Also the comb at the other end isn&#x27;t curved like the Anastasia brush, which is a little inconvenient and harder to use. I do however recommend this if you don&#x27;t want to spend $20 on a duo brush.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Does the trick for me.</li>
    <li> This Duo Brow Brush has definitely become a must in my makeup toolkit and seriously rivals Anastasia Beverly Hill&#x27;s #12 Brush. I use this for my brow pomade and it has drastically improved how my brows go on each day.</li>
    <li> Affordable and gets the job done. As previous buyers have said, the angled brush side is more on the flimsy side so it isn&#x27;t the best for brows but hey! Like I said, it gets the job done! The spoolie works just fine. I love using the brush with my Anastasia Dipbrow Pomade.</li>
    <li> Quick, fast, precise love the combination of the two tools together. As a &#x27;ginger&#x27; if I want eyebrows I have to give mine some help and this little baby is a good send. Especially when you get the Fisher Price sized brushes in the eyebrow kits, no matter how expensive the brand.</li>
    <li> I love this brow brush. I use it everyday to blend my brow pencil.  I use it to comb the brow hairs in the same direction. It gives a nice finish. I could not find a brow brush like this in the stores. I plan on ordering another one as a back-up.</li>
    <li> this is a good item for the price.</li>
    <li> My favorite tool for my brows</li>
    <li> Nice brush &amp; applicator</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this brush! I use the mascara brush side to brush my eyebrows and blend the powered I apply there. I use the angled brush to apply gel eye liner. I use this almost every day so one day I may buy another just so I don&#x27;t have to keep washing it every day. Also, it&#x27;s a great brush if you&#x27;re still struggling to perfect the winged eye liner. This angled brush will give you control over the thickness of the gel eye liner and create that sharp angle we all strive to achieve. I&#x27;m also a huge fan of the MAC 210 brush for eye liner.</li>
    <li> Brush too soft to apply effectively.</li>
    <li> There is nothing negative about this product at all.  It&#x27;s got great and lasting quality.</li>
    <li> I had it for about a month before the spoolie part broke off. I have since replaced it with Anastasia&#x27;s spoolie / brow combo and that has been in my purse for about 4 months.</li>
    <li> Great tool!! Use it almost everyday!</li>
    <li> The duo brush works well;can use one brush for two uses</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to for a fraction of the price of the leading brands. Goes to show you don&#x27;t have to spend lots to look beautiful!</li>
    <li> Decent brush, it is quite a bit softer than I had hoped (so if you want a stiffer brush, this is not for you), but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Great dual purpose brush.  Wonderful value.</li>
    <li> Perfect brush to apply my new brow cream. Love both ends and it&#x27;s also a super price! Arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> Just what I thought it was works wonderful</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect eyebrow brush.</li>
    <li> The brush is really soft. I thought that would be a good thing, but it just doesn&#x27;t get a crisp line. It would be great for a soft gel eyeliner look, but it just doesn&#x27;t do the trick for me with brows. I just bit the bullet and paid $18 for the anastasia of beverly hills version, which is so much easier for me to use.</li>
    <li> Love the spoolie but wish the wand would have been made of sturdier material.  Seems like it could easily fall apart or break apart after a few months of use.</li>
    <li> Grooms and shapes eyebrows perfectly!  A must for your make-up bag.</li>
    <li> I love this brow brush.</li>
    <li> This brush its really good the only thing i would rather the bristles to be a little harder since this is a duo brush its a cheap price its a bargain :)</li>
    <li> Works as needed, like it. Good ptice fast delivery</li>
    <li> Just the right level of firm and soft, really applies the powder on great.</li>
    <li> This is a great make up tool! Helps tame and shape eyebrows beautifully!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing! I just used it to apply my brow pomade by Anastasia Beverly Hills and I love the result. I have long eyebrow hair and this brush helped me sculpt them beautifully.</li>
    <li> This is a great brow brush! I had been using a brush from Anastasia that was too flimsy and ended up breaking off the barrel after a week of use. This brush is firm enough to place pigment exactly where I am trying. Love it! Great price, quick shipping, perfect!</li>
    <li> Not firm enough for me</li>
    <li> Way better than paying 18 at Ulta. Don&#x27;t get fooled  by brand name stuff that works just the same if not better. Great product. Will buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> Works great. Price is even better!</li>
    <li> highly functional, great product</li>
    <li> Great brush. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I use it with my anastasia beverly hills brow pomade. Good quality and cheap :)</li>
    <li> The chiseled tip is very thin, and makes a really thin line. I&#x27;ve been using it to apply my eyeliner, and using a slightly thicker brush for my brow powder. The spoolie end is nice and sturdy. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> It looks just like how it does in the picture. I&#x27;m satisfied with its use! I went to Sephora the other day to check out their version of this brush. Obviously, it had better quality. The only difference that I noticed was that Sephora&#x27;s brushes were able to pick up more product and have more condense, pigmentation for the brows (But people tend to try to drop some product, unless they like the sharpie effect- so no biggie).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great with the products I have. I&#x27;m currently using the Anastasia Beverly Hill&#x27;s pomade and brow duo powder.</li>
    <li> Great brow brush! I bought this mainly for the spoolie but the brush end is an unexpected bonus! It works so much better than any other brush I have to apply brow powder.</li>
    <li> I love this brush...I use it everyday</li>
    <li> No complaints here loved this item fast shipping and works well</li>
    <li> The brush is too soft for applying on eye brows.  Wasn&#x27;t very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Good value, and works as intended.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because I have the Anastasia dip brow, and quite frankly I did not feel the need to spend almost $20 on a brush. So I turned to this brush and I love it. It works great. 5 stars !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a brush like this, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but it works very well for me.  I&#x27;ve always used a regular comb/brush combo for brows, but the brush end of this works much better than that - it separates hairs much better.  The angled end also works well for my application, but I&#x27;m wondering if other brands are stiffer because I see things on Pinterest and YouTube about lining the outline of your brow and I don&#x27;t think I could do that well with this, but I am makeup/hair/all things girl challenged, so it could just be me.</li>
    <li> This is a great little tool for the makeup arsenal.  I had my picture taken and the makeup artist at the studio had one like this that she used with brow pomade and it really did an excellent job.  Naturally, I had to have it and the product to apply with it.  Wow.  I am happy it gives just a bit more color to my brows and doesn&#x27;t look like brows drawn on with a brow pencil.  I highly recommend this tool.</li>
    <li> Brown brush shrinks and bunches up which makes it difficult to use. . Not what I expected. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done and of course loved the price. I bought the anastasia dipbrow pomade,  the separate duo brush was another $18 so I was like they crazy. Lol so looked on here and got this one which is basically the same just cheaper.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Thanks for the great product and service!</li>
    <li> Pretty good but I wish the fibers of the angled brush were more firm. I feel it&#x27;s too soft for eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Great and useful brush at an excellent price. I ordered a second as a back up.</li>
    <li> Ok not great. The brush end isn&#x27;t stiff enough...</li>
    <li> I use this brush everyday. I like how its long and the angled portion is pretty flexible so you can easily obtain that natural looking brow youre going for. Just make sure you have a good eyebrow powder for it to latch on to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what end I like best, the angle brush or the curly end.  I have used both several times already&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used both ends of this brush several times already and like them both equally.  The quality is great and the price very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
    <li> Like the quality for this price. I use it with ABH Dipbrow Pomade. I find the angled side hard enough to fill in my eyebrows. But I can&#x27;t use it for creating a shape or drawing a line.</li>
    <li> Tempted to buy three more, one for my bestie, one to keep in my make up \\&quot;car kit\\&quot;, and one spare!  This brush you will use EVERY SINGLE DAY.  You can draw your brows, fill them in and use spoolie to comb and blend.  Good price too. I&#x27;m not usually a fan of dual tipped brushes, but it&#x27;s VERY NECESSARY on this brush...they go together like PB&amp;J!</li>
    <li> I have been looking everywhere for a good spoolie and angle brush  and i believe this is it. The brush glides on well and is the best brush i have ever used to conceal my brows. The spoolie is very durable and helps me keep my brows in place. I love this product and the pricing is just right.</li>
    <li> brow bristle is soft, I prefer mines on the stiff side.  But nice liner...unexpectedly good quality!</li>
    <li> This is a really good quality brush. Thick and soft. I was really worried about the quality but this is great. Great value for money and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love the bruch its soft and cheap compare to ulta brushes. 25 or 30 dollars for a brush um no love my new bruch</li>
    <li> This is really an excellent brush.. Does everything it&#x27;s supposed to for half the price of more famous brushes.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> This brush is soft, but compared to the similar brush in Sephora, it doesn&#x27;t pick up the color very well at the first place. It costed me so much effort to color my brow at the beginning that I almost wanted to pay $18 to buy the one in Sephora. Luckily, I gave it more trials. After about 10 times uses, it starts to work better, so now it doesn&#x27;t bother me any more. So happy for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> It works, but easily gets sticky build up and dirtiness.</li>
    <li> Brush is too thick and soft. It did not give me a straight sharp line. I wanted to avoid spending $18 on the Anastasia brush but maybe it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> Just like a lot of other people, I used the DIPBROW pomade and it was great, but I couldn&#x27;t justify buying their eyebrow brush for $18.00. I looked for an alternative eyebrow brush, and let me tell you ladies, I love it!!!! It was a fraction of the cost and works so well. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I just use this for the spolly (however you say that) because my eyebrows are kind of thick and crazy, so I just shape them a little bit more with it. Since I really don&#x27;t have an eyebrow filler I don&#x27;t use the other side, but it will come in use one day once I start to try filling in my brows!</li>
    <li> A great brush for the price. Does it&#x27;s job~!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best. The brush tip is very soft so it&#x27;s almost impossible to fill in your brows. The spoolie end is alright but not worth the money. Will NOT be buying ever again.</li>
    <li> Perfect brush, perfect price. I use this daily for my eyebrows. Other versions of this brush (anastasia) are like $20!</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s definitely cheaper than the Anastasia Brow Wiz Brush. It works well, doesn&#x27;t leave streaks or anything like that. Very portable, and fits well with my small hands.</li>
    <li> I usually use this to come my eyebrows before during and after penciling my eyebrows or tweezing. I have unruly eyebrows and my hairs are usually all over the place so this actually tames them so I can be able to do my eyebrows</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush.  I wanted to get the Anastasia brush ($18), but saw this one instead.  I love the stiff angle brush -- it works wonders for filling my brows in with powder.  And I love that the spoolie is attached and that I don&#x27;t have to use a separate brush for that.  I want to buy one of these for all of my sisters!</li>
    <li> awesome eyebrow brush! The angle is very thin which helps you control the brush very easily. The spool end is very useful as well. I love this eyebrow brush!</li>
    <li> Great multitasking brush! Both sides are durable/washable. The brush side is very dense yet thin, making application awesome. Whether blending a pencil, powder, or gel this is great brush for under $10!</li>
    <li> The spooly end is great and just what I was looking for but the brush end is a little long and not as dense and sturdy as I hoped. It is not a good brush for applying eyebrow powder/wax in my opinion. Maybe works better with a pomade</li>
    <li> this brush is awesome!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice brush.</li>
    <li> The brush was a little soft but very precise, im not putting a lot of concealer  on my brow so I don&#x27;t need it to be hard, just sharp enough not to rub off my eyebrows. It&#x27;s pretty good</li>
    <li> This is a good spoolie, seems like good quality and it does what its supposed to do. Nice having the brush on the other end too.</li>
    <li> It does what it needs to do and the brush is so soft!!! I love this.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it was good seeing that many people who bought Dipbrow from Anastasia bought this but... the brush is too soft and the spooly is too rough. I should&#x27;ve just bought the Anastasia brand one instead.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush specifically because it&#x27;s double-ended and the cheap price. I was debating whether to buy this or several other pricier alternatives but decided to just test it out. I disregarded all the bad reviews on this which i&#x27;m regretting wholeheartedly now.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed to say the least. The spoolie is fine(so i reluctantly gave it 2 stars) it does it&#x27;s job but the brush is just horrible. I use it with my nyx cake/powder and it just doesnt work. It&#x27;s flimsy and thin which doesnt help at all to pick up the wax and trying to fill in my brows? Just no.&lt;br /&gt;Seeing as i got the brush for it&#x27;s dual-ended design, but i only like one side of it i&#x27;d say do not buy it!!</li>
    <li> Not sure why this is so highly rated. I got it as an alternative to the Anastasia, but I may have to rethink that strategy. The angled brush is WAY too thin to apply color, in my opinion. Spoolies are easy to come by, any old mascara brush will do if you just wash it out.</li>
    <li> Great for blending and shaping the brows, as well as great price. Nice packaging and easy to use. No shedding.</li>
    <li> Great brush for the price listed. Have paid 4 times more for other brushes that do not have the double ends. I ordered two...one for myself and for my daughter...</li>
    <li> I bought this brush after a couple days of using the unsurprisingly flimsy brow brush that came with my eyebrow powder. It was inexpensive, and I&#x27;m happy with how well it works. The angled side is very soft, but it is firm enough that my makeup doesn&#x27;t get lost in the bristles. I like that it is a duo brush so I don&#x27;t have to pull out another brush when I need a spoolie. I&#x27;ve used it every day for about two months, and it hasn&#x27;t frayed or lost its shape. It isn&#x27;t too rough, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin when I use it. I absolutely recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> my first eyebrow brush ever, in long time.lol...works very well at smoothing and defining brows.</li>
    <li> Brush can be used for either eyebrows or very precise eyeliner, works great both ways. Spoolie on this allows for great control of where you want your brow hairs to go lol. (;</li>
    <li> Perfect. The item came as described.</li>
    <li> Very cheap quality, would not recommend buying this.  The brush frayed on both ends instantly, I have had better luck with Elf products.</li>
    <li> The brush is nicely angled and has a thin edge. Very easy to use and perfect for filling in eyebrows. The brush isn&#x27;t too soft or too hard, so it works great to make it look natural. I like the duo part, so I don&#x27;t have to look for 2 separate brushes when filling my eyebrows. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, perfect shape. Love how my eyebrows look nice and clean. I wish i bought two lol. Maybe i&#x27;ll just have to buy one more.</li>
    <li> My favorite tool. Best thing I never ordered. I can comb my eyebrows and then use my shadow to fill it in with in the other side of the brush</li>
    <li> The reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is that the brush itself is not really that great of quality. It&#x27;s good, it&#x27;s useful, and it&#x27;s better than the teeny-tiny brush that comes with the eyebrow kit, but it&#x27;s not like my other brushes. I have barely used it, so I&#x27;m kinda waiting to see if it stays together for very long. I do like the side of the applicator - and even the &amp;#34;mascara-like&amp;#34; side for combing my eyebrows. However, I wish it had a sponge side instead of a mascara side. I should&#x27;ve paid attention to what I was ordering. The price was right and since this got grouped with other items, it didn&#x27;t increase the price of shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this brush I just wish the glue was a little stronger. I had to buy super glue to keep the pieces together..  Other than that it&#x27;s a Wonderful  Brush!!</li>
    <li> I am  honestly baffled by the good reviews of this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it with Anastasia&#x27;s dip brow pomade and the results were not cute. The bristles are far too soft and are not straight! It is nearly impossible to make thin-hair like strokes with this brush. I also tried it with MUFE Aqua Brow, and the results were only marginally better.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money. The only decent part of this brush is the spoolie at the end, which, again, I would not pay $6 for.</li>
    <li> the brush end was very soft. that is not good for brow brushes. i wouldve liked it more firm so i ended up sending this back.</li>
    <li> I love it. I use it daily..</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted! I&#x27;m thrilled with the performance of this brush, it makes it so easy to do my brows!</li>
    <li> Sturdy. Delivered quick too!</li>
    <li> Good for brows! Had it for months and it works great. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my brows. It is a bit flimsy but works great for what I need.</li>
    <li> Greatest tool in my makeup bag!!!  :-)</li>
    <li> I wish the bristles were a little more firm but overall a nice brush</li>
    <li> I only had this for about 2 months when the brush broke off. I only use it to essentially comb and shape my eyebrows. I do not understand how or why it broke off after such little use and little time.</li>
    <li> Great brow brush and angle brush. Great for brow fill in and outline of the arch&lt;br /&gt; Will recommend and has prompt shipping.</li>
    <li> Worst brush ever purchased! Came bent and when I tried to use it, it completely broke! So disappointed, cheap quality.</li>
    <li> I just started experimenting with different bushes, and I love this brush.</li>
    <li> The brush is so soft n smooths out the style eyebrow liner I want.</li>
    <li> Too soft to shape brows. I guess I&#x27;ll splurge and get something that works a bit better. The spoolie side is great though.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  I don&#x27;t know, why I waited so long to get an eyebrow brush. This brush will stand up to any expensive brush out there.  The bristles are angled for a nice application and I love the brow brush on the end. It helps to blend my brow powder nicely. The length of the brush is really nice, as I have always had those tiny ones.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes - soft</li>
    <li> Good inexpensive replacement for the $20 recommended brush from Anastasia.</li>
    <li> This brush is decent for just beginning brows and wanting to get started I believe. I liked it a lot at first but I think there are better brands that will work a lot better. I sometimes find it hard to get a nice perfect shape but it does the job and the spooly on the end is really nice.</li>
    <li> Love this duo brush. Works great.</li>
    <li> Liked it a lot more than I thought.</li>
    <li> Very soft and came really fast. Plus great price</li>
    <li> So I bought this on a whim and I don&#x27;t get the bad reviews the both brushes work great. But I also have kinda thin eyebrows.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for my eye liner and the spooly end is a good texture and stiffness</li>
    <li> Works as it looks and as advertised.  I use the slanted end everyday to apply and blend Anastasia Brow Powder and it goes on smoothly, brush fibers remain intact.  I use the mascara-like end to comb my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Nice brush for what I need it for (dipbrow pomade). Doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;ll last forever but worth it for the price. I&#x27;ve been using for about a week or so now.</li>
    <li> The brush will work fine if you need it to lightly brush your eyebrows or fill in small gaps. I use angled brushes with the Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow pomade to give my eyebrows a more defined look, and this brush was a little flimsier than I expected. I ordered a set of Ecotools brushes around the same time which came with an angled brush that worked much better than this one for what I need. The spooly was also very quick to collect dust and usually running these through a damp towel is enough to clean it, but this one just sort of held on to it. Overall, I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re just looking for a brush to fill in those small gaps in your eyebrows, this one will do the job.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great for the price and it works really good and it&#x27;s easy to use and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This brush is okay but it&#x27;s not what I thought it was going to be. I thought the angle brush part would be more firm to allow for better shaping but it is very flexible and soft instead. When I opened the package I thought I broke the comb side but it just bent sideways as the core is made with some sort of flexible metal. All in all, it&#x27;s not my favorite but I don&#x27;t hate it either. Update: It actually works very well and the double sided brush is a huge convenience!</li>
    <li> perfect little brow brush. my eyebrows look awesome when I use this</li>
    <li> Nice and stiff. I use this drow duo with my Anastasia of Beverly Hills Dip Brow Pomade and it deposits the color well, it is also good enough to lightly shade color onto the brows. I will definitely buy this again if I had to.</li>
    <li> Thank you for this AMAAAAZING product! I used mine today &amp; my eyebrows look soo good i love how defined my brows look</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an angle brush to draw on your eyebrows and you don&#x27;t want to spend $20 on a brush, this brush is for you. I am one of those people that did not want to spend so much money on a brush so I decided to use this one. After using it for one week, it seems amazing for the price. I wish the brush was much sturdier and left flimsy to make better lines but it still gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic to use with Anastasia Dip Brow. It could maybe be a little firmer, but I think it works great for the purposes I needed it for. Plus, it was reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> Its exactly what it says it is. Nice quality!</li>
    <li> Thank you and it is cute.</li>
    <li> Nice basic brow brush.  Great price for the quality.</li>
    <li> Nice and cheap brush. Worked for putting on my Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow Pomade, before I decided to buy their brush. If you have the money to spend, go with the ABH one. If not, this one&#x27;s a nice substitute.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this will the brow makeup that she ordered. She loves it!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for what I needed (for use with the Dipbrow Pomade). Great for adding the perfect outlines and filling in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently discovered Anastasia&#x27;s dipbrow which to my surprise doesn&#x27;t come w/ a brush. This is great for eyebrows!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works great for my brows!</li>
    <li> Best eyebrow brush ever.</li>
    <li> The brush is too soft to do anything with really,via my opinion.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time anymore. It is a good quality brush. my eyeliner goes on so smooth and perfect. I like it and I have a  few different ones. I use this one almost all the time now.</li>
    <li> This brush is good but I perfer the Elf small angled brush</li>
    <li> This is the handles eyebrow brush I own, I have paid over $20 for Mac brushes I like this on the best</li>
    <li> it is a spare for when I travel :) Wonderful!</li>
    <li> not stiff enough for precise brow pencil or pomade application</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Stiffer brush makes it easy to get straight lines. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Love it, very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> This is a nice brush. Neither too soft nor too hard. Very economical brush for everyday use</li>
    <li> NICE DOES WHAT YOU NEED IT TO DO OF COURSE.</li>
    <li> Loooove this. A must have for your eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I use this brush with Anastasia DipBrow, and I get a perfect application every time!</li>
    <li> Perfect! I am so glad I found this option to it&#x27;s $18 counterpart. This brush is just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This brush is excellent yo use with Anastasia dipbrow pomade....goes on flawless...love it</li>
    <li> Starts out firm but gets ratty over time. Use this on my eyebrows everyday but now I think Id rather spend the money on a quality brush.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and better than my Mac brow brush!  I use this with Anastasia Brow Dip on my skinny, blonde brows and would be lost without it.  It&#x27;s nice and fine so you can get that crisp line to either simulate hairs or that nice defined border.  A great buy!</li>
    <li> There were apparently some complications with my delivery, so my package was misplaced but I was immediately taken care of. They shipped me out a new one and I recieved it three days later, which alone should be enticing enough to purchase from this buyer. For those of you who take a little more convincing, the product comes in a sealed package and exactly as described. The spooly is amazing for distributing product and getting that &#x27;gradient&#x27; effect on your brows. The bristles are soft and not abrasive, this applies for both the angled brus and the spooly. Perfect for your eyebrow needs. Would recommend and purchase again!</li>
    <li> I only use the spooley side. not nearly as stiff as the anastasia brush and doesn&#x27;t do a good job on brows. Thumbs down.</li>
    <li> nice, much less expensive then store item.</li>
    <li> Great brush, great value. I use it every day and I love it.</li>
    <li> The brush is average, but the spooly thing at the other end is great! I love that its double sided, wont find this in stores for a better price,</li>
    <li> The spoolie bristle broke off/came off about 6 months after I bought it, but when it came off the screwable end was still in tact so I just added some super glue on the tip and stuck it back in the holder and it works perfectly! I love that it doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of room in my makeup bag but it works perfectly for my brows!</li>
    <li> Okay it&#x27;s not stuff at all, and it&#x27;s very hard to make a nice precise outlines for the eyebrows, it&#x27;s okay to finish filling in the brows but overall it&#x27;s just okay</li>
    <li> came early and as described on amazon very good for the price and shipping full filled its purpose thanks.</li>
    <li> Love this brow brush omg perfect price to use with the  Anastasia Dipbrow</li>
    <li> LOve this brush! Makes applying my eyebrow cream color so much easier... I&#x27;ve used other ones but to me this one is the best..... Took a little while to get to me but worth the wait.... I&#x27;m going to purchase another one just in case something happens to this one because i definitely don&#x27;t want to  be without.... It is sturdy too.. Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap... I&#x27;m happy with it.....</li>
    <li> Nice brush, but it is soft.</li>
    <li> I use the Nyx Eyebrow Gel and this brush to fill in my eyebrows so I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;ll perform if you are using ABH Dipbrow or something similar. I will say that the angled brush on this duo is very soft and well, kind of flimsy. If you need something somewhat stiff then this brush isn&#x27;t for you, but it works fine for my purposes.</li>
