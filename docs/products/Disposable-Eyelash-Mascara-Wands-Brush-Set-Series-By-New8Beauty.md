      <li>Arrived  quickly and in good order.</li>
      <li>These brushes are great, very high quality, and I use them to improve my lash experience.  </li>
      <li>I prefer to use serums for healthy lashes rather than mascara.  </li>
      <li>Nice for clump free application.</li>
      <li>These are phenomenal - everybody should buy them.</li>
      <li>I love these wands.</li>
      <li>They are also easy to keep clean and dust free,,, which is even better for my eyes!</li>

      <li>The pink wands cannot be bent and it&#x27;s always best to bend your mascara wand for easier application.</li>
      <li>They look strong and durable.</li>
      <li>Overall happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>[[VIDEOID:mo39SF27A37N307]]These mascara wands are great for getting different effects with your mascara, and they are a necessity if you intend on sharing your makeup!</li>
      <li>(this pack has a few of them) as those work the best.  </li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly and is described accurately.</li>
      <li>I love the new Silicone and Nylon Eyelash Wands.  </li>
      <li>These disposables are a must for getting mascara application just right in a hygienic fashion.</li>
      <li>I have only used two so far, but seem a good buy.</li>
      <li>the purple brushes can separate and very gently manicure my eyelashes.</li>
      <li>Product arrives exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>I save a lot of time getting ready in the morning!</li>
      <li>just right, you come to the realization that mascara is pretty much all about the wands.</li>
      <li>So now I buy drugstore mascara and play with the wands and can pretty much do what I want.</li>
      <li>The one with the star on he end works really</li>
      <li>I really like to take care of them.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of different mascaras, but sometimes the difference between loving or hating a mascara is as simple as a brush.  </li>
      <li>Being made of silicone, these bend far too much to work really well.  </li>
      <li>I tested out all of these disposable brushes with my natural mascara, and they all work wonderfull!!</li>
      <li>well t get those teensy eyelashes that an normal mascara brush does not reach.</li>
      <li>These are like professional brushes or something.</li>
      <li>I purchase them frequently to use on clients.</li>
      <li>I particularly like the rounded end type, both for upper and lower lashes.</li>
      <li>The only way to truly have clump-free lashes is to use a new applicator with each use.</li>
      <li>I recently switched over to mascara with natural ingredients, and the only issue I had was that I didn&#x27;t like the brush it came with.  </li>
      <li>These wands were disappointing as some of them were far too large to actually be useful!  </li>
      <li>I am a professional makeup artist and have been looking for this style of disposable wand for a long time!</li>
      <li>The black stuff inside is really much of a muchness.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These are phenomenal - everybody should buy them. Once you start experimenting with different shapes to get your eyes just right, you come to the realization that mascara is pretty much all about the wands. The black stuff inside is really much of a muchness. So now I buy drugstore mascara and play with the wands and can pretty much do what I want.</li>
    <li> I love these wands. I purchase them frequently to use on clients.</li>
    <li> Very good quality brushes. You get a lot for your money. Also they give you a good variety.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Work well. Nice for clump free application. Also works great for eyebrows. Work best for one time use although are washable</li>
    <li> I have a lot of different mascaras, but sometimes the difference between loving or hating a mascara is as simple as a brush.  These brushes are great, very high quality, and I use them to improve my lash experience.  I use these with Eyeko, Kevin Aucoin, and Blinc &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; mascaras, and Mally regular mascara.  I can&#x27;t believe how much better I&#x27;m liking my mascara!  Great price, great seller.  Don&#x27;t buy more mascara, buy these brushes, and enjoy what you already own!</li>
    <li> These disposables are a must for getting mascara application just right in a hygienic fashion.</li>
    <li> Arrived  quickly and in good order. They look strong and durable. I only give them 4 star as I have not - time tested them. I have only used two so far, but seem a good buy.</li>
    <li> I prefer to use serums for healthy lashes rather than mascara.  These are great for the serums and much more hygienic because you can wash them.  Definitely a step up from the toothbrush I was using!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get it but all three of my daughters thought these seemed great.  And, they are all very happy with them.  So I guess there is a use for them but only use the plain one for my eyebrows.</li>

    <li> I love the new Silicone and Nylon Eyelash Wands.  I can use the Nylon Wand for the Fiber extensions and the Silicone for the Transplanting Gel.  It allows me to serve my customers without worrying about Cross Contamination.</li>
    <li> good product, price, service</li>
    <li> These wands are amazing! I am a professional makeup artist and have been looking for this style of disposable wand for a long time! They work great and they send a variety to choose from! They also were at my doorstep within 2 days! I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I dont see the curved one anywhere. The 2 pink ones on the side seem the same.</li>
    <li> Love these! They make my eye lashes look so long!</li>
    <li> These wands were disappointing as some of them were far too large to actually be useful!

    <li> Terribly flimsy, sent back</li>
    <li> These are like professional brushes or something. One coat of primer and one coat of mascara and you are good to go. I save a lot of time getting ready in the morning! Would definitely buy these again!</li>
    <li> FABULOUS personalized service, lovely packaging A++++</li>
    <li> I have eyelash extensions. I really like to take care of them. These brushes are great for that.... the purple brushes can separate and very gently manicure my eyelashes. I also appreciate that I can see if I have lost a lash extension, because of the color difference. When using the black brush I can&#x27;t see this as well... All the brushes work great. the Silicone ones are especially nice  and friendly to my eyelash extensions! They are also easy to keep clean and dust free,,, which is even better for my eyes!</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and is described accurately. Would order from this vendor again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Perfect!  I recently switched over to mascara with natural ingredients, and the only issue I had was that I didn&#x27;t like the brush it came with.  I tested out all of these disposable brushes with my natural mascara, and they all work wonderfull!! Just what I was looking for.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Product as described. The only way to truly have clump-free lashes is to use a new applicator with each use. I still sometimes dab off excess with a paper towel. I have a love/hate relationship with mascara. I particularly like the rounded end type, both for upper and lower lashes.</li>
