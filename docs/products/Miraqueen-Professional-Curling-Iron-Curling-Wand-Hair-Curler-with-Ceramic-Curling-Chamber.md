<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For such a big discount on a must-have item, the price is unbeatable.  It curls VERY well and easily, as long as your hair is in small chunks and it&#x27;s entirely smooth.  I&#x27;ve had a few issues with hair being ripped out of my head because I didn&#x27;t do it right (I&#x27;m better right handed than left), so it can take a little longer than it should to make perfect curls.  But they do come out perfect!</li>
    <li> great curler.... Holds curl great... easy to use.... Great price compaired to other brands.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely amazed at how well this works, and how easy it is to use. I was skeptical when ordering, not sure I could get the hang of it...but I was wrong. I am a believer now..its AWESOME. Just so you know I&#x27;m not blowing smoke..I NEVER leave reviews...I am soo glad I took a chance with this curler!!</li>
    <li> This is a great curling iron. Really makes your hair curl instantly! Not much effort needed to make it curl. This is a very easy to handle and use wand. Absolutely lovely</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I cannot curl using a wand for the life of me and I am \\&quot;just okay\\&quot; at using a straightener to curl my hair.  This made it so easy!!  The timer function is amazing and ensures you get consistent curls.  There really isn&#x27;t much to say, you can use it right out of the box with little difficulty.  This was one of my most satisfying purchases to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as all the positive reviews on here, I am a bit suspicious just because they are all in a matter of a few days in October and hardly any are \\&quot;verified purchases.\\&quot; I still like the product for the few times I used it but I just find the reviews for it interesting.  I will try to update my review regarding durability as time passes.</li>
    <li> Works fantastically! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is MAGIC!!!! Very easy to use and do not need to aware of burning your ears. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Hands down the best curling iron ever. Not only does it curl really well. The curl stayed. My hair doesn&#x27;t curl well and it certainly doesn&#x27;t stay curled. This curled my hair without any styling products and it stayed curled for a few days.</li>
    <li> works perfect. Love how the temp&amp;timer is adjustable. It lets you know if you try to curl too much@ 1 time.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this curler to work. After watching a video and reading the directions enclosed I thought it would be a snap however that was not the case. Since my hair is normal I set it to 410 per the directions. I carefully brushed and took a small section of hair and waited for the four beeps. It released a very loose curl. Then I tried another section the same way, it got stuck and released my hair. So I tried again, it got stuck again.  I should have quit there. I tried once more but this time it didn&#x27;t release my hair. To keep it from burning my hair I unplugged it. For several minutes I tried to unwrap the my tangled hair. Almost ended up cutting it until I realized I could pull smaller sections of strands out until it was all out. Even if this was user error there is no way I&#x27;m going to chance getting my hair stuck again.</li>
    <li> I was amazed with this curling iron. My puts my hair in its prime time! I flipping love it! The curling iron heats up to just the right temperature. Ladies, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this curling iron. Time to throw out my other curling irons, this one definitely gets the job done as I need it!</li>
    <li> I was sent broken equipment. Not a fan</li>
    <li> So far no luck with this.  I just can&#x27;t seem to get a curl.  Not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong but I will try again later.  No real directions with it.</li>
    <li> Works awesome. My wife has used this for about three weeks now and hasn&#x27;t stopped telling all of her friends. She can curl her hair in a matter of minutes versus the old sixty to ninety it used to take her. She had thick black hair and said that the machine won&#x27;t snag your hair because it reverses when it senses there is too much inserted. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> After receiving the item I tried to plug in and it did not turn on. I definitely received a faulty unit. I went back to the reviews and paid a close attention to the dates the reviews posted. I wonder if all the reviews are genuine. The are several reviews posted on the same day and most of the buyers are not verified. I would ask the buyers to make their judgement call before buying this item. I would NOT recommend anyone to buy this!</li>
    <li> Awesome Curling Iron! Heats quickly and is so easy to use.The digital controls are nice. And the curls last for days. Very reasonable price makes this an amazing value. This is one you don&#x27;t want to miss. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This heats up very quickly and seems to work exactly as described.  When I pulled my hair out, a perfect curl sprung out the results were absolutely stunning!  It never burns my hair like regular wand curlers and curling hair, took only minutes. I received A TON of compliments. Thank you for the amazing product that lives up to its claim.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife.  We live in an area with high humidity and this curling iron helped her maintain her curls for much longer than any other traditional iron that she has used in the past.  This curling iron is incredibly easy to use, the handle is comfortable/ergonomical, and is priced right.  My wife loves how quickly this iron heats up and the beautiful curls that it creates.</li>
    <li> worked great first and every time. My hard to curl hair looked just like all the pictures and the curl stayed in despite my humid climate. I immediately sent pics to friends and family recommending that they buy one.</li>
    <li> Love it! Beautiful, long lasting curls. The key is not to put too much hair in at a time or it will tangle or burn. Small sections give you amazing curl.</li>
    <li> This item was returned.</li>
    <li> Not for long hair, I returned mine.  I have waist length hair, and the Miraqueen, would work, but only with tiny sections, it would take hours to do my whole head that way.  Also my hair, because it&#x27;s so long did get caught  a few times,  I got it out, but not without some yanking.  This iron would work great on medium length hair, but hair no longer than the middle of you back.  If I ever cut my hair shorter,  I would definitely re-buy</li>
    <li> This curling iron is a MIRACLE WORKER! My hair air dries stick straight, therefore I have always had trouble curling my hair. I have tried every trick in the book including curling wands and various types of curling irons, and I have even used and entire bottle of hair spray before... and the curls never held. My sister suggested I give this curling iron a try and I couldn&#x27;t believe how well my curls held! It was so simple to use and I am able to easily transport it when visiting friends and relatives.  For the first time I was able to curl my hair for a night out without having to run to the bathroom every half hour to make sure it looked presentable.  I plan to buy this curling iron for gifts for my friends this holiday season... I hightly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas gift and tried it out twice this week. Short review: I love it. Longer review: There is a definite learning curve to using this thing. Maybe more so for me, as I am pretty clueless when it comes to hair styling. I did have a few times when I tried to put in too much hair and got the warning beeps, and a couple of times when it was difficult to get my hair back out. Despite my panicked feeling, I did manage to pry my hair out of the thing without it being singed off, so all&#x27;s well that ends well...? My point is, they are NOT kidding when they say to only do a small section at a time. I have straight, fine hair, but I have a lot of it. This was not a fast process. It also took me a while to get the hang of positioning the device the correct way and getting my hair into it while looking in the mirror. One last negative: The beeping gets really annoying. I wish there was a volume control so it wasn&#x27;t so loud right next to my ears. All that said, I do LOVE this thing. My hair has never held a curl for more than an hour or two, and these curls last all night. Even the next day, my hair is full of pretty waves. Although I don&#x27;t have time/patience to do this every day, I can definitely see myself doing this before special events or date nights, then using dry shampoo to make it last another day or (possibly) 2. I also plan to experiment with using this device, combined with the &amp;#34;ponytail method&amp;#34; of curling my hair, to see if I can get good results more quickly. (Ponytail method is when you gather all of your hair in a ponytail on top of your head and curl the ends, then let it down.)</li>
    <li> LOVE this curling tool! I would give 10 stars if I could! My hair has never been able to hold a curl until this beauty came around...now I can get two good days out of my curls! I have put too much hair in or hair that was tangled. It just gives me a little beep and I take my hair out and try again. I really don&#x27;t know how you could mess it up or get your hair stuck! Super simple, easy and IT WORKS!!!</li>
    <li> Great iron. I love the way it heats up very fast. I also love the simple directions, it gave me a great head start. I&#x27;m amazed how it worked on my hair.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a Christmas present for my daughter.  We returned it as she felt it did not do a decent job. She said the curling wand does a better job of curling.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the other version of the http://www.amazon.com/Curling-Miraqueen-Professional-Ceramic-Chamber/dp/B00QL93YTI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1420074660&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;miraqueen  I would recommend the other miraqueen professional steam curling instead of this curling iron. This miraqueen is quite heavy in comparison to the other miraqueen and I found that this curler works bests on thick coarse hair or bi-racial hair like my daughter.  I have fine, thin, pin -straight asian hair and the temperature  always has to be  set on 410 on 12 secs, 450 on 12 secs, or 0 secs. In addition to temperature settings if you have thinner hair while using this model you have to section your hair in the opposite direction of your hair growth in order to get curly hair, otherwise it won&#x27;t work. Also on multiple occasions my hair has been tangled and stuck in the chamber that I had to call for help, lawd... If the sections were 1.5 or 1 inch sections my hair would still get tangled, bigger 2&#x27; sections were needed to achieve curly hair in order for the curling chamber to grasp on to my hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing curling iron. Let me tell you this curling iron is the best i got so far. Very fast to heat up and shape your curls. I like the fact that it does no damage to my hair when i curl it the way i want it. I also like that the cord moves around with motion while i curl my hair. No longer i have to tangle myself with the power cord of the curler because this baby works for me instead of me working for it. This curling iron has some nice simple buttons to graduate the temperature and style that you want i pretty much learn it in a few minutes while i was doing my first test of the Miraqueen professional curling iron and the LCD is great way to see whats going on. Another future i like is the beeping system tells me when the iron is ready and when to release the handle to make those curls perfect. When you need some curls to look extra cute for the weekend with he girls this is the curling iron to have with you.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. Great product. Works on multiple types of hair and has long lasting curls. I was a little confused by the design on the picture at first, but the actual product is super easy to use. Which I love because I hate complicated products! Great curling iron, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Wow! This curling iron does miracles!  In just a few minutes, I had curls that were AMAZING! Profesional work, just like If I had gone to the salon for an expensive fashion look.  Its what I have been waiting for.  It is not everyday that I will go out and have my curls done, but when I do need my curls, this machine is a must.  A thumbs way up in my book.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, so I must return it</li>
    <li> great product , easy to use and very quick to get the hang of it. I got a lot of compliments on my hair</li>
    <li> I received the Miraqueen curling iron as a christmas gift and absolutely love it! I used it when we went out to the club and got so many compliments! It is so easy to use and saves me so much time on doing my hair. Most curling irons damage my hair when I use them but this curling iron worked perfectly and gave me beautiful curls !! It is so nifty and cool because the LED display screen displays all kinds of neat information, like the timer and tempature degrees. I was so impressed with this curling iron that I bought one for my sister for her birthday. This is top of the line people, You will not be dissapointed!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This curling device is just perfect for me and my sister, as it curls even the thickest hair. But first make sure you read the directions first and get used to the way it works. The iron works best if the hair dry and tangle free, the tangles come right out after a few minutes of use but if your hair is even damp, but mouse works great! Also you can expect no more of those painful burns you get from the common curling iron, you could even put the iron right next to your head and there would be no sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs or even wants a professional curling iron for the best in hair design!</li>
    <li> I love having my hair curled, but i guess i like a very particular style. I was looking for big loose curls but this only has one setting and thus, only one size curl. this machine does work well (once you overcome the learning curve) at making beautiful ringlets, but you wont necessarily be able to achieve kim kardashian waves/curls. Worked great on myself and my friends, but also if your hair is too long then the machine cant suck it all in to curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all, definitely a cool product, but im sending it back because my hair is just too long. if your hair is at max- medium or a long medium length youre probably fine.</li>
    <li> I have thin and straight hair. It worked well for me. Basically, it does what was on the description. Heats up very quickly and easy to use. It gave me smooth+natural curves and stayed for over 5+hours.(I&#x27;ve never curve/straighten my hair before) all the other product I use they don&#x27;t stay very long. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Miraqueen Professional curling iron is one of the best curling irons that I have bought for my wife. When my wife first used the curling iron she said it did a amazing job to her hair. The things she loved about the curling iron are the great features such as the 3 heat levels and timer settings that you can adjust with ease. Also, the highest temp the curling iron will go is up to 450 degrees. The high heat from the curling iron left my wife with perfect curls for days! I&#x27;ll give this product 5 stars for any female looking to have great curls without damaging there hair.</li>
    <li> Large and not very solid and a little scary. Not something comfortable to use everyday.</li>
    <li> It was my brother wedding and i had to be looked gorgeous.But there was a problem.That was my hair.I have thick coarse hair and it is super hard to get my hair to curl. My friend had the Miraqueen curling device so I gave it a try. Not only was it painless, fast, and easy, my beautiful curls stayed put all day, without product! It only took 20min (with a bit of goofing around) to complete it!!I am very happy with the product.Mariqueen does not damage my hair like my previous irons, which means I can style my hair as often as I want. I would recommend Mariqueen to anyone and i am sure it will never disappoint you.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I could never master using a regular curling iron, but the Miraqueen is super easy. It took me all of five minutes to learn (just watch a YouTube video as the instructions that are included are not helpful at all). I had long hair halfway down my back then cut six inches off, and the Miraqueen worked with either length. Now I understand the super high rating for this product because it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing curling iron! I got this Miraqueen for Christmas, and was automatically skeptical because I&#x27;ve heard horror stories on products such as this. But, this turned out to be safe and so easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can choose tight, medium, or loose curls, and it won&#x27;t burn your hair. The switches on the side are convenient to choose what you want, and I do like how there are options, and your hair will definitely not get stuck in it! The hair goes in easily and leaves easily, giving a flawless finish. I went to work with my hair curled, and everyone was complimenting me, and asking how I curl my hair. Needless to say, I&#x27;ve been using this now probably more than I should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great gift for any girl who doesn&#x27;t want to have to deal with a curling wand or anything of that area, and I know I&#x27;m not very good with a barrel or a wand. Miraqueen has also cut the time in half! It does turn off by itself after a while, so no need to worry about your house burning down! And unlike a regular curling iron, I have not burned myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miraqueen is amazing quality, and I&#x27;ve owned it for 2 months, and it&#x27;s holding up so well and is like new. It&#x27;s kind of pricey but it&#x27;s worth every penny. My friends keep begging me to borrow it. I can&#x27;t get enough of my curls and the results from this product!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas.  She can curl her hair in 5 minutes and it lasts longer than previous methods.  Word of warning: DO NOT PUT HAIR IN THE ERONG WAY.  My daughter got her hair in the wrong way and we almost had to cut it off.  Fortunately, reversing directions got it out after some work.  When used correctly, this is at least worthy of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Totally awesome product for producing HOT curls!  I bought this for my girlfriend as a gift because she looks totally hot when she curls her long brunette hair!  She has natural red highlights and when you see the curls that this thing makes, you can clearly see the light red highlights which adds to the rich look to her beautiful hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I can tell, she loves the fact it gets up to 450 degrees.  The more heat, the faster the curls and the less time she needs to get ready, which is a bonus for me :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The control panel can be managed with your thumb and is located in just the right spot.  I personally hate cords that get all tangled up, but that is not  happening with this due to the awesome swivel cord that is attached to the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beside choosing the temperature, you can select the temp time and the direction of the motor drive as you are styling your hair.  The trigger button is easy to use while holding the unit and the base is made from a magical material that stays cool while you are using the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am having a hard time finding anything wrong with this unit according to my girlfriend.  She loves it and used it a couple of times per week before we go out on the town.  At first she did say that it was heavy to hold, but now she is used to it and it might have been due to being used to the other curling iron she used before I bought her this bad boy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thin hair or thick hair, there is no reason that this would not work for you.  Such a simple design that really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat stay inside, to keep from burning the person using it and the automatic curling is something that will keep you coming back for more!  Depending on how long you curl the hair will determine what the curl looks like.  Basically, while styling your hair, you can decide whether you want 1 of 3 designs, or all three at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will tell you that the 12 second curl is the hottest.  Of course Iam bias because it is my girlfriend that is hot as hell with curled hair, but I am just being honest!  I would recommend this to anyone I run into based on what she has said.</li>
    <li> Works great on my daughter&#x27;s bone straight hair. Just wish there was an option to turn off the beep when she uses it at 5 am to look awesome for school!</li>
    <li> I have extremely straight hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl. I have a lot of it and it&#x27;s 4 inches past my shoulder so it&#x27;s fairly long. Curling irons always left &amp;#34;dents&amp;#34; and frizz, probably because I&#x27;m an idiot and don&#x27;t know how to use them correctly, BUT WHO CARES NOW I HAVE THIS MAGICAL FUTURE DEVICE! Now hear me out, if you think like I thought, that this machine is going to be painful, heavy and scary, it&#x27;s none of those things. I only made one error on my entire thick head of hair and knew right away because it doesn&#x27;t sound normal. I think I had too big of a section of hair, so I just gently pulled my hair out, brushed it out, and formed a smaller section of hair. It gives alternating (with option to do all left or all right) curls that all come out pretty every time. I used the 12 second setting on 450, which is the highest setting. I let them cool before brushing them apart and had gorgeous soft curls/beach waves. If your hair holds a curl well, you could probably get away with using lower settings, just play around with it until you find whats right for you.  It is well worth the price (I paid $79), though on the MiraQueen site it was advertised as $59 with a direct link to this Amazon page for purchase. I emailed them about that and got no response. However, seeing the the competing curlers are typically upwards of $100, this is a bargain. Also, I want to add that my hair was not clean, but I did use it with the MiraCurl spray detangler that was designed for use with these machines and it was fab.</li>
    <li> I can actually work this product and can curl my hair in less than 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I recently got rid of my Sultra Bombshell Curling Rod as it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.  I have fine hair but a LOT of it such that it gets super frizzy after a rain storm and without a flat iron my hair looks like a rat&#x27;s nest after washing.  When I first tried the Miraqueen my hair was a bit curly after a workout at the gym and so my hair did get stuck in the machine.  I tried not to panic and kept opening and closing the Miraqueen until it let go of my hair.  I had to use a very small section of hair combed tautly in order for the Miraqueen to accept my hair.  After a few attempts I did get the best curls ever.  They lasted until the next wash.  It does take a long time to do my hair but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.  I get better results after I flat iron because Miraqueen doesn&#x27;t like my hair when it&#x27;s frizzy.  Overall, I do love it as it gives the best results of all the curling devices I have ever owned and it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron as a birthday gift for my teenage daughter and I&#x27;ve almost never seen her happier to use a gift. She immediately ran to the bathroom to try it and came out only a short time after with a full head of curls. I was shocked as she had only used a curling iron once or twice before, but she talked about just how easy it is. She has since used it at least once a week and continues to produce full heads of luscious curls. Thanks, Miraqueen.</li>
    <li> my wife loves this. much better than the old way. she can even set the direction of the curl now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just dont put your hair in wrong haha ouch</li>
    <li> I have long flat hair with little or no body. I am always using rollers to add curls giving a more full body look. This means I am using the larger rollers. I usually start at the crown of my head and work backwards and secure the roller with a pin. So by the time the rollers heat up, I put them in, and they cool off and finally I can take them out, I have spent a considerable amount of time on my hair. But now with the Miraqueen, I just plug it in and when the ready light stops blinking, I start to curl my hair. I am done in a few minutes one it’s preheated. The other great feature is the automatic cut off. Sometimes I get into a big hurry and forget to turn it off. No problem it automatically turns off after the timer goes off. Curling is now faster and easier than before. I use my hand to comb through the loose hair curls and then set with a light touch of hair spray. I now have sexy volume and great curls in half the time. Very easy to use!</li>
    <li> Works well. You will need to practice with it for a minuite.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews.  However I had to for this product.  I have my husband&#x27;s navy command Christmas part coming up.  I really wanted to walk into the ball with lovely long curls.  I pretty much gave up on curling my hair years ago.  I have long thick hair that is wavy and a bit puffy.  I resigned myself to a flat iron.  I looked on with envy at those who could achieve perfect curls that hold.  No more.  My birthday is today so I justified buying this last week as a gift to myself.  I figured if it did not work I would send it back and exchange my dream of curls for a vacuum cleaner.  Well it looks like my old vacuum will have to suck it up for a few more months...pun intended.  This curler works.  Today is Sunday, on Friday morning I washed my hair and after it was dry I cracked open my amazon box and skeptically plugged in my new curler.  It sucked up my hair and beeped away.  When I pulled my hair out, a perfect curl sprung out.  I was not surprised.  The test for me was if the curls would live or fall out.  I did not use any hair spray or any other products.  Saturday morning I walked into by bathroom expecting to see that after wearing my hair up all night that my curls would be gone.  They were alive and well.  I did have a few that needed a touch up.  Sunday morning they are still kicking.  I can&#x27;t tell you how shocked I am.  I have spent hours with curling irons or hot rollers just to see my curls fail within a few hours.  I&#x27;m sad to have to wash them out today, but using this curler takes roughly the same time as using my flat iron so the inconvenience is gone.  In short, the dream lives.</li>
    <li> So easy to use! Very fast way to get curls or wave into your hair.</li>
    <li> Purchased this magic maker a few hours ago and did prime same day delivery. I curled my thin but really long straight hair in less than 6 minutes. I have never had the confidence to curl my hair with a curling iron or wand, but this chamber is as safe as I&#x27;ve ever felt curling my hair. During my first time I had to get used to making sure the hair was in the &#x27;V&#x27;, but when I could sense it getting caught, I just released the trigger and it easily released my hair...no fuss, no scary stuff. I would recommend this to anyone, especially my teenage self years ago when I wanted to curl my hair but didn&#x27;t want to burn myself.</li>
    <li> The Best Invention EVER.  I love this.  If you like to have curls that last all day, you can sleep on them, and wear them tomorrow - this is for you.  I have decently long hair and it takes me about 15 min to do my whole head.  I could not be happier with this machine.  I love that it automatically switches the curl direction. I can even use it on my 4 yr old as there is no way to burn her.  I don&#x27;t even have to hold it for the full amount of time.  You will not be sorry you bought this.  It is AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> My wanted a BabyBliss MiraCurl but it seems to many fake models were being sold, so I opted for the MiraQueen. The reviews seemed positive so I bought it for her for Christmas. We plugged it in and... nothing. We looked at the VERY skimpy manual for guidance. In the end, the unit was dead on arrival. As I was packing it up to send back to Amazon. I noticed many scratches on the handle. My guess it was used, found not to work and returned to the distributor who probably put it back into inventory. VERY disappointed.</li>
    <li> If I could give this 0 stars, I would.  Purchased as a gift for my sister..it was something she read about and after seeing all the positive and glowing reviews, told me that she would love to have this particular curler.  Within 10 minutes of use, it set a portion of her hair on fire; her husband ran to help save her (and the house) from burning down.  It just grabbed hold of her hair, ripped it into the mechanism, and then smoldered and eventually went into a spark of flame.. She now has a slight bald patch due to this unit. Buyer beware:  She has very healthy, long, never once been chemically treated nor processed, straight hair.  Perfect condition. She  had no chemicals or sprays on her hair while using the unit either.  Just be careful if you choose to purchase this item...</li>
    <li> My birthday was yesterday and I had an awesome time at my friend&#x27;s house (she was hosting the party for me). One of my dearest girlfriends since elementary (I&#x27;m like in college now) bought me this automatic curler and I was like, what&#x27;s this? I never heard of such thing before. I&#x27;m glad she got it for me though. The rest of my female friends and I had a ball curling each others&#x27; hair like no tomorrow. Some of my other girlfriends were almost fighting to get a turn. But of course, nothing too feisty broke out since it was my party. It worked really well on different kinds of hair! Even my one friend with the thickest hair a person can ever have had her hair curled using this thing. That&#x27;s pretty amazing. Now, everyone else is jealous of me and want their own. I got a black one, but my friend who bought this for me told the other girls that there&#x27;s a pink one as well. I like black so I&#x27;m going to stick with it.</li>
    <li> My wife had me order this for her and she loves it. She threw away her other curling iron once she saw what a wonderful job this one did. She said it&#x27;s easy to use and holds the curl longer than her other one did. I was also impressed. She looks beautiful no matter what, but there&#x27;s something about bouncy curls that just bring out her beauty that much more.</li>
    <li> This is literally the best curling &amp;#34;iron&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s cut my hair styling time in half and gives me PERFECT curls that last for days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always trying to figure out easier ways to give myself nice soft curls, because I&#x27;m not very good at doing my own hair.  I&#x27;ve tried a curling iron and a clipless curling iron.  I&#x27;ve always made dents in my hair with the curling iron, and I would always burn myself with the clipless curling iron.  I needed a new strategy.  I read reviews on the Miraqueen.  It wasn&#x27;t the cheapest, but it wasn&#x27;t the most expensive either.  I decided to give it a try.  I love it!  The first day I got it, I gave it a try just for fun.  My hair turned out so good and stayed curled that I actually kept it like that for work the next day.  Everyone loved my hair and asked how I did it.  They all kept asking me the name of the curling iron to buy for themselves.  My friend even asked me if I could bring it into work to do her hair during lunch for a Friday night party.  Her hair is thin, so curls don&#x27;t always stay.  However, her hair kept the curls long enough to last the night.  She was impressed.  I find it really easy to use, even getting the back of my hair with ease.  The tool is not too heavy, which is good for your arms while you wait for the curl.  There are different settings for different types of hair.  It beeps letting you know it&#x27;s working and when to let go, so there is no thinking and counting seconds.  Plus, it has another setting where you can choose to curl to the right, curl to the left, or alternate between the two.  I have a good amount of hair, and it gets it done fairly quickly.  The instructions do warn you not to clip too much hair at once, which is very important.  Sometimes I wanted to try to move faster and clipped a larger chunk of hair... It won&#x27;t work!  Your hair will get caught, but it knows to stop on its own.  It will turn in reverse and unravel your hair.  Then you&#x27;ll have to gently pull your hair out of the tool, but if you follow the instructions, that won&#x27;t happen.  I&#x27;ve never had huge chunks of hair stuck in the tool if you&#x27;re gentle.  If you&#x27;re like me, and no matter how many YouTube videos you watch on how to get that perfect curl, and you just can&#x27;t figure out how to do it, get the Miraqueen.  I&#x27;ve used it before work and even for weddings and special occasions.</li>
    <li> I have medium thin hair. It&#x27;s not baby fine, but it is on the thinner side. I tried so many of these types of curlers and this is by far the best one yet! I love that you can set it to auto direction so your curls go different directions! It never burns my hair (which can burn easily if I&#x27;m not paying attention). Actually I love that it has lots of options and settings for something in this curler class! I have included a picture (sorry for the quality) of what I was able to do in about 10 or 15 minutes. I love it so far! I must add that with regular wand curlers of any kind I am completely at a loss. One side of my head comes out great but the other always looks insane and falls flat. This one delivers an even curl all the way around for me!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Purchased a product for a gift and the person absolutely loved it.  She had heard about the great results that this product had and was thrilled to finally get to try it.  Her experience with it was remarkable.  She was astounded by the ease of the product and the results that were delivered.  Will be purchasing more as gifts very soon!</li>
    <li> This product is really good, at the begining i got confused how start it! But after a while i pressed the start button and keep pressing until started. It make perfect curls I am happy that I bought it! The service is good too, I called a few times and they were very nice.</li>
    <li> Returned. Would not curl my hair. Wouldn&#x27;t even put a wave in it. Tried all 3 time settings and all 3 heat settings, but nothing happened. Did not have an issue with hair getting stuck in it.</li>
    <li> I have very long, very thick hair. I had to use thinner strands to curl. I had a strand get stuck in the curler and I couldn&#x27;t get it out. It completely fried my hair strand and I had to cut my hair because I couldn&#x27;t pull it out. I was so excited for this curler and now I can never trust using it again, not that I could get the remaining of my hair out. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Received Miraqueen Curling Wand today and was disappointed to find the item I purchased appeared to be used.  It has multiple scratches and was missing the typical packaging content. The item definitely looks to be a customer return.  I would not recommend purchasing this curling iron.</li>
    <li> Incredible Gift! Girlfriend loved it and I looked like a hero! Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have only had this curling iron for a few days but I love it. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this curling iron for Christmas! It was the perfect gift. Now everywhere we go she has to curl her hair cause it does it so nicely! not like other curlers that claim to curl. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product off Amazon, I got it off eBay instead, mainly because I didn&#x27;t look on Amazon.  But I wanted to write a review for it nonetheless. I got this as a gift for a friend for Christmas and she absolutely loved it. She told me it works great and it&#x27;s does everything that she needs it for - now being a guy, I&#x27;m not 100% sure what that actually means :p But she loves it and she&#x27;s already recommended it to some of her friends.</li>
    <li> This curling tool is amazing! My hair is really soft, fine, long and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl at all. No matter what tool I use or what products I slather on, I don’t have a curl for more than a couple hours. So I just gave up and don’t curl my hair anymore. Recently, I was feeling like I should try this one, I did some research and watched some videos. I saw other girls with my hair type successfully curling their hair and that it was staying so I had to give it a shot. So onto the umpteenth try! I love it! I definitely recommend it! Just watch the videos posted here and trust that it will be awesome for you too! Good luck ladies!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a christmas present and she is very happy with it. She mentioned that the rotating chord base made ity very easy to move around and that the beeping helped her make sure she didn&#x27;t burn her hair. I am obsessed with gadgets and understand that curling hair isn&#x27;t the easiest task, but this Miraqueen sure makes it easier.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s incredibly easy to use, and creates perfect curls in my thick, straight hair! My hair NEVER curls, but with this it took only seconds before my bone-straight hair was bouncy, and shiny!</li>
    <li> My hair is very long, thick. So I have been having difficulties with finding the best product to curl my hair, I have tried many and was disappointed, until I was being motivated to try this, my friend also had a thick but a longer hair than mine, it works like MAGIC, this product is so user friendly with its specs, easy to use, VERY FAST, heats up swiftly, I don’t know why I never discover this product, until now, if you need the best product to curl your hair very fast and error free, I would recommend Miraqueen’s for you, works exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Gifted this to my girlfriend and She just loves it. Thanks a lot Miraqueen.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product. Works as mentioned here. Definitely a buy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! No bad things to say at all!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am amazed with this Miraqueen professional curling iron. It is the easiest curling iron I have used that gives me perfect curls every time. It is a little scary the first time you use it since it like sucks your hair in but after that its all awesome. I love all the settings, LED screen, the timer, ect. I just love everything about it. I can get the curls I want fast and even without struggling. The auto shut off is great since I&#x27;m always forgetting to turn it off.  If your looking for a great curling iron, I highly recommended this Miraqueen you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I will admit, I&#x27;ve never done anything special to my hair- I usually just wear it down, or put it in a ponytail. I&#x27;ve always wanted to be able to curl my hair, but unfortunately I don&#x27;t have the patience to take a ton of time on my hair. After seeing the miraqueen online, I was intrigued and researched further. I ordered and I am so glad I did! I just take a piece of hair (make sure it&#x27;s combed thoroughly and pretty strait) and put it in the device. I usually do minimum curls because that&#x27;s good enough for me, and it takes less than 8 seconds per piece of hair. Altogether, it takes me 10 minutes to do my whole head. I feel like I have so much more confidence now that I can wear my hair in a new style. I also like the fact that it shuts off automatically if you forget to switch it off... sometimes I can be a bit forgetful. All I can say is I wish I had found the miraqueen sooner!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for the holidays, and I just wanted to come on here and write a review because this thing actually WORKS!!! It works GREAT~ I should say, and the best thing about the Miraqueen Curling Iron is that its no hassle, no pulling getting out a brush, and balancing an iron and wrapping it all around the iron. Nothing like that here- you simply grab a reasonable(1 inch) amount of hair, and clasp the iron onto the hair, and its inner barrels spring the hair into the curler, and like magic, you wait for each beep, and when you get the last beep-beep-beep(isnt it so simple?!!!) VOILA!! You are done, and you are left with a gorgeous curl. I did this all over my hair, and it took about half the time it does with the conventional curling iron. I highly recommend this product. It is made with tourmaline ceramic so it is good for you hair, gentle and safe, and it really does its job well! Dont be scared when it rolls your hair in, just follow the directions and you will be very happy with this product!!!</li>
    <li> A fantastic essential piece for professional hairstylists and/or home use. You will not be disappointed in the sturdiness, ease, and feel of this curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;*Comes with a year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;*Can heat this device to 450 degrees fahrenheit and hence get a curled look, which is going to last for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;*The LED Screen, which is found on this device, will let you know about the temperature and the curl direction.&lt;br /&gt;*This device has an auto power off,&lt;br /&gt;*Three heat levels&lt;br /&gt;*Four timer savings.&lt;br /&gt;All of these features come in handy when you are trying to get those glamorous and powerful curls to look just as glamorous throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name, Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron, Curling wand, Hair Curler with Ceramic Curling chamber says it all. It includes all the features which you would buy separately and combines them in one item. So now you get to save tons of money, simply by buying this single item. Furthermore, the maker of this device promises that your hair will not succumb to harm while you are trying to heat it because it has protective coating of foam to help your hair get rid of the unwanted damage. Even more, there is a trigger button, which you can use with a press of your thumb or finger, with which you can control the holding and styling blocks, and the insulator base keeps the styling iron’s body cool for the user to have enough ease to work with it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> What more is there to say? Better products elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I just took a trip to Disneyland. This curling iron helped me out so much. It is so lightweight and easy to use; I do not think I could have taken any other curler on my trip. There were times during the trip where my family and I would be rushed. It was almost a trend being late for dinner. This hair curler made back a lot of that time for me. It is also quite durable. I only wish that it did not have a super long wire so that I could pack it easier. Overall, a great curler!</li>
    <li> Item was broken when it arrived.</li>
    <li> A lifesaver for my hair! I have slightly curly/wavy hair that has a tendency to just frizz out, half straight and half wave. I&#x27;d call it moderate/thin hair. I  have tried so many curling irons but so many just won&#x27;t curl my hair! The Miraqueen is the solution to all of this. It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take a long time to heat up, which is a plus in busy mornings. More importantly, after one run through with the Miraqueen I already got those movie-star waves I&#x27;d always wanted, but had kind of given up on. It&#x27;s sleek, easy to use, and the best curling iron I have tried! For the price, I&#x27;d totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> We just received the Miraqueen curling iron as a gift a few days ago.  My wife was previously using some cheap curling iron that she rarely used because it was poor quality and did not do the job.  Now that she has the Miraqueen she has been using it every day and absolutely loves it.  Her hair looks better than ever, it seriously looks like a professional hairdresser secretly lives in our bathroom now.  She is especially pleased with the variety of settings and user friendly design.  It is obvious that a lot of thought was put into this curling iron and the manufactures strive to produce a quality product.  This gift is by far her favorite one and it seems like it will certainly get its use.  Thank you for the amazing product that lives up to its claim.  I’d certainly recommend this to any lady who is looking for a quality curling iron that will not let her down.</li>
    <li> I bought the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron for a visit by my sister.  She has some expensive model that costs 3 times what the Miraqueen Curling Iron costs, and told me she left it home.  She was so happy with the Miraqueen that she said she will sell her iron that she left home and use the one I bought for her from now on.  I&#x27;d say that this is as good as it gets.  To outshine a model that costs 3 times what the Miraqueen costs is a definite reason to buy it.  To see my sister&#x27;s face light up as she thanked me for how well it works was more than enough for me to write a review of the product.  I know what I&#x27;m getting as a gift for several other women that use curlers.  Thank you Miraqueen!</li>
    <li> The MiraQueen Professional Curling Iron is a great investment to get a variety of beautiful curls from loose waves to tighter ringlets.  When you first try it, the moment it takes in your lock of hair, you will feel apprehensive, but the results will make up for it.  I always seem to do poorly curling the back of my head with a traditional metal iron, but this makes it easy as long as you just do a little section at a time.  It&#x27;s totally worth it, especially not burning yourself no matter where you hold it on the outside.  It is the only hair curling tool you&#x27;ll need!</li>
    <li> This curler makes it so. Easy for me to fix my hair! I have thick hair and it only takes me 15 min to do my hair with this! Where have you been all my life! Great price too!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife.  She loves it.  Every time someone comes over that hasn&#x27;t seen it, she takes it out for a demo</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, the box was a little crushed but the unit was fine.  Awesome curler! Awesome price!  I took 1/2 inch sections as it would jam if I took a full inch (my hair is really thick), very time consuming but worth it.  The curls last for days and look amazing.  I was a little reluctant to buy one after reading the negative reviews about it jamming in the hair and not releasing.  The very second you hear or feel it pull the hair, just release the button and the hair comes right out.  Then take smaller sections of hair, if it jams its because you took too much hair or didn&#x27;t get the hair in the curler correctly (watch videos online on how to use).  It has multiple heat settings (I went right in the middle, not high not low). You can select the curling direction (I went with the alternating).  This is just WOW, Love it.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is amazing.  It curls my hair beautifully and it is easy to use. I have shoulder length slightly waved hair.  This gives me perfect curls that really last all day.  My hair actually looks healthier after I curl it- smooth and shiny.  I even used it to curl my six year old daughter&#x27;s hair and it didn&#x27;t have to worry about her getting burned.  Use small sections and you should be fine.  If hair gets caught, it immediately beeps and releases your hair.  It curls in two directions and you can adjust the heat.  I can curl all my hair in about ten to fifteen minutes.  So glad I bought this- worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I LOVED this curler.  It has a big learning curve, but once I got the hang of it, I am hooked.  It never pulls my hair anymore, but at first, I had a hard time.  You just have to make sure your section of hair is not too large and that you place it in the correct place in the curler.  It takes me about an hour to do my whole head, but I have very thick hair, average length.  I always use it at 410 and 10 seconds.  If I want super duper curly hair, I use 450 and 12 seconds.  Product is not necessary.  The curls will hold for a full day easy, and the next day, I have enough waves to wear it again like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem is that the part that sucks my hair in does not roll consistently.  Then little motor makes it turn and it pulls my hair in.  This part has malfunctioned MANY times for me.  I have actually gotten halfway done with my hair, and it just stops working.  Once I took it to a cheerleading tournament to do girls&#x27; hair, and it wouldn&#x27;t heat up until I unplugged and plugged back in.  Normally it is heated within about 1 minute.  It has a one year warranty, and I have emailed them b/c the return form is currently not working.  Fingers crossed that I get an exchange!</li>
    <li> I needed a curling iron for my daughter. She has naturally curly hair but I needed to help her with keeping her curls on the front from getting frizzy. With the curling iron, she was able to establish curls that, with a little hairspray, lasted all day. I strongly recommend this product. From a male perspective, it is an all around winner---safe, easy to use, works quickly and effectively without burning or drying out the hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing curling iron! It really makes great spiral curls even with very long hair (down to mid-back length). It takes a little practice during your first use to know how much hair the iron will take in (it will beep at you to release the trigger if you&#x27;re doing it wrong), but once you get the hang of it, your whole head will have bouncy spiral curls that last all day even without hair product. The timed beeps takes the guesswork out of how long you need to hold the hair in. If you end up doing it wrong and your locks of hair gets sucked in incorrectly or if you tried curling too much hair at once, the tumbler stops immediately so that your hair doesn&#x27;t get trapped or tangled in the chamber.</li>
    <li> I honestly expected tangeled hair and even kept my sissors handy!&lt;br /&gt;I watched the video and carefully read the directions before I even plugged it in.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use!  I have fine, straight color damaged hair so I was especially concerned.&lt;br /&gt;Please follow the directions and you will be very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Use small sections of hair and listen for the 3 beeps.&lt;br /&gt;My settings are 410 degrees at 10 seconds.  My question is why did the price go up 20 dollars between Thursday, when I ordered mine, until today (Sunday)?  I guess i will not order any for my family until the price goes back to 79 dollars with Prime shipping.</li>
    <li> KOOL!  I love it.  I have super thick long permed hair.  Not fond of the frizzy look and it takes FOREVER with a curling iron and I&#x27;m not fond of burned fingers.  After getting the hang of how much hair to use, where to place it with the controls facing the head and letting the other end of hair go before squeezing it shut, it went really fast and easy!!  If you feel any tugs, just let go of the trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have really long hair, use a super thin strand of hair and make sure you don&#x27;t have any flyaways in the way of the loose end after inserting into the contraption against your head.  A little practice and voila&#x27; ~ super fun curly locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money and the wait for it to come back into stock.  Don&#x27;t get discouraged if it&#x27;s not available, it will be, then grab it!</li>
    <li> It is rare that I write reviews for things I buy online; I usually don&#x27;t have the time.  But for around 30 years I thought that I&#x27;d never be able to do much to my super thick, curly hair- except air dry or flat iron it.  My girlfriend told me she bought one of these on Amazon so I went for it.  It is absolutely amazing!  Not only does it curl my hair into smooth locks but it holds for a long time.  I woke up the next morning with most of my curls still in tacked.  Amazing curling iron and delivers what it promises!</li>
    <li> It took me two times to get the hang of it and now it is the only curing device I use. It is so easy and the curls stay for days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the directions!  Don&#x27;t try it for the first time before a big event.  Play around with it - you can curl to right or left.  Try out the different setting for loose and tighter curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works best if hair is dry and tangle free.  It it does get tangled, no biggie - it releases right out. If your hair is too damp, it will not curl.  I use mouse on my hair, then dry it and comb it before curling. No need for hairspray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safe for anyone - will not burn your hands or skin.  You can put it right next to your noggin without the pain and awful smell of burning flesh that is common with curling irons!  Doesn&#x27;t turn your bathroom into a dry sauna - no sweat rolling down your face from all the heat on your head and in the room!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Section your hair and clip back so you can go area by area in smaller sections - once you get this routine down, it will go do dam fast you won&#x27;t believe it.  You&#x27;ll fall into a rhythm and before you know it, you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Posting a photo of me several hours after using it and no hairspray either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got fine hair and through the years have used hot rollers, steam rollers and all kind of curing irons only to have the curl fall out five minutes later or worse, attacking it with hairspray to keep what little curl took and ending up with a huge mess of icky hair that I&#x27;d end up putting into a ponytail after all the frustration with the end result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got this... BEST CURLING IRON EVER!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I had low expectations for this curler. In fact, I purposefully bought it on Amazon since I had more than normal doubt I might need to return it, and I&#x27;d need to count on Amazon&#x27;s excellent return service. But, I was very, very wrong to doubt. This machine can curl some beautiful hair and in an astonishingly short time. I have an illness that sometimes makes me uncoordinated and weak and I felt this curler would get me through on those days. Even though the machine is somewhat heavy, it curls so fast ans so completely that I can do my entire head in 8 minutes. The curl holds and can last through brushing. The magic is in the settings; simply tap the number of minutes, the time, and you are ready to go. The best feature is the automatic curly direction setting. As you curls tha machine remembers to switch directions of the curl every round. You can select only right or left, but the automatic gives me natural random direction. I know you all are wondering about tangles, but no, I have not had one problem with the machine. I simply keep a fine tooth comb, brush out a section, and the machine takes up even long hair nicely and smoothly. I suppose if you don&#x27;t brush your hair with each section you&#x27;d get more of the beeps which signals you to abort the curl before anything happens (great feature). The machine also is waay to bulky for travel, which you may want to consider. All in all, take the chance. It actually does beat the pants off of a regular curling iron. Another plus...I may never have another curling iron burn on my fingers again.</li>
    <li> I just packed up all of my electric rollers, curling irons and such. This is amazing. I had it now for about 3 hours and figured out how to use it in the way I like my hair.  I have difficulty using it with the hair on the back of my head though.  But that&#x27;s not really a big deal because if u don&#x27;t put your into in properly it stops, beeps and ur able to easily readjust your hair into the machine.  Also, my hair is very dry and this thing makes my hair look quite healthy. I use to (until today) flat ironed my hair then curled it with an ordinary curling iron in order to make it not look dried out.  Now I can simply use this wonderful machine and magically my hair looks great!</li>
    <li> I am in love with my Miraqueen curling iron. I bought my Miraqueen last week and it came on time as promised.  My hair stayed beautiful and the curls lasted 4 days! Normally my curls fall with regular irons and the temperature was perfect as I have coarse hair. My daughter even said how pretty my hair looked.  This curling wand is perfect for moms. I am one satisfied customer and these make great gifts too!</li>
    <li> Great product. So neat and fun to use.</li>
    <li> The Miraqueen is LEGIT. I ordered this hoping for the best but expecting to return it. However, this thing seriously works!! Almost too well..the first time I used it, I ended up looking like Shirley Temple / a poodle with super tight springy curls. They lasted like that for 3 days, which is a testament to how well this curler works because I have thick, heavy hair that NEVER holds a curl for more than a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, once you experiment with the temperature and hold time options, you can find the combination that works best for you. I got Shirley Temple hair with the curler at 450 degrees and holding for 12 seconds, which is the maximum temp and hold time possible. The second time I tried, I got curly, flowy hair with volume by using a straightener on the top of my hair first (but leaving the bottom half/third untouched), and then using the Miraqueen on the bottom portion at 450 degrees and the 10 second hold. Immediately after I released each curl, I tousled it and ran my fingers through so it would be less of a tight curl and more flowy. It came out perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the left/right curl options really work too. This is what set this curler apart from others for me, which did not allow you to choose the direction of the curl. This is important because if all of your curls are going in the same direction it looks weird and unnatural. You want the curls surrounding your face to be going away from your face towards the back of your head - so use the &amp;#34;Left&amp;#34; curl direction on the left side of your face (and the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; curl direction on the right side of your face). I would also recommend keeping mostly left-sided curls on the left (and right-sided curls on your right), but occasionally switching it up and doing the opposite direction to keep things looking natural and not too uniform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a GREAT curler and I almost want to buy a few more to have in case they stop making this in the future. It is that good. My friends kept commenting on how great my hair looked and asked me where I got my blow out - thank you Miraqueen!!</li>
    <li> fun to use ..... curls stayed in for two days ! my daughter loved it as she has trouble curling own hair with wand. only issue is it gets a bit heavy after awhile.....</li>
    <li> From straight to curly in minutes! I love it especially since I do not spend much time on my hair. The Miraqueen is so easy to use.  I like that it stops so that you know you curled too much hair at one time or your hair is not combed through well. I also like the different settings.</li>
    <li> Daughter used it one time and had hair tangled in it and had to cut to get loose.</li>
    <li> Great curling device. I have been using other hair curlers in the past and all of them didn&#x27;t last long. My hair would stay curled for a very short amount of time before looking ugly again. This one is great. It keeps my hair beautiful and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it uncurling too soon.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my wife but she is very happy with it. A lot better and quicker results than a wand curler...just you do need to be careful not to grab so much hair since it can get tangled...</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift from my hairstylist and best friend. I have to say, I am so in love with this curling iron! I had flawless curls on New Years thanks to it. It has the perfect temperature that you are more than welcomed to adjust. I never feel like I&#x27;m frying my hair when using miraqueen. This flat iron is great for relaxed or natural hair.</li>
    <li> I love the concept, but it just did not work for me. I have rather long hair that is on the thinner side. It barely curled my hair no matter how much what amount I used, even on the highest heat and time setting. wondering if all of these positive reviews are fake. any curls i got looked deformed and did not last. Also, my hair got caught multiple times and this was after straightening it and using the smallest amount. I hated the beeping, it was so loud it woke my boyfriend up. It was a christmas gift so I feel bad returning it, but i would not waste my money on this.</li>
    <li> I hardly ever do anything with my hair because it takes me too long and I don&#x27;t always have the time, but most importantly because both my hands are injured and it can sometimes be very painful to use hair dryers, straighteners, or curlers.  After watching some videos and reading reviews I decided to give Miraqueen a try and I&#x27;m so very glad I did.  It is very easy to use, although it did get a little heavy after a while, but I have short hair so it didn&#x27;t take long for me to curl it all.  I was also very pleased that my curls held extremely well; usually my hair goes flat after a 3-4 hours, but they held for over a day.  I love my Miraqueen Curling Wand and I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> Great, easy to work with curling Iron. The different heat settings is a great feature that really gives body and luster.&lt;br /&gt;Very very happy!</li>
    <li> Item works exactly like it should if you follow the simple directions they provide. It gets easier to use and you get better results the more you practice with it. I love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Easy to use and very well made. My girlfriend loves this thing, and says it&#x27;s the best curling iron she has ever owned. Her hair has never looked better. This was a great purchase!</li>
    <li> I had heard so many good things about the Miraqueen curling iron and how you can curl your entire head in 5 minutes. Curling always takes so long for the waves I desire. The Miraqueen is awesome at getting your head done in 5 minutes. The only problems I had were getting the back of my head. I love the auto turn off when your on the run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips for using.&lt;br /&gt;#1 Use small thin sections of hair. Especially if you have long, or thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;#2 Make sure your hair has no knots or tangles before sucking it in (Common sense people...)&lt;br /&gt;#3 To get your waves/curls to last longer add a spritz of a hair spray before sucking it in or just after as it&#x27;s cooling&lt;br /&gt;#4 Keep the side of the devise that says &amp;#34;keep this side towards your head at all times&amp;#34; towards your head. The hair is sucked up through the other side, if you try to do it the other way, I guarantee it wont work correctly and it will be your own fault. Follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;#5 If you try to leave your hair in for to long it will auto shut off the heat after 25 seconds. I love this so if your half asleep and not listening to the beeps or listening to loud music and can&#x27;t hear the beeps it will auto turn off before you have a chance to fry your hair.</li>
    <li> This product is very professional. After buying this product my life has gotten way easier because this product makes the less sound, works smooth and  cuts threw iron efficiently.</li>
    <li> Bough this for my mom as a christmas present.  My mom has shoulder length hair.  The product worked wonderfully as advertised.  The only reason for the 4 star is that my mom&#x27;s hair was too short for this.  It work great, but not well enough if you have short hair - due to the barrel size.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome curler...really nice curls in a short time! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I am not one to write reviews, however this product deserves a shot out from the mountain tops of Fiji. No joke. I have thick mixed race hair, so naturally my hair is curly however it is tex-laxed and flat ironed most of the time to managed my natural curls.. Plus the benefit of having thicker hair means it retains heat and curls longer. Growing up I used to swear by hot rollers, and the lovely curling iron which I cannot begin to tell any of you how many times I&#x27;ve burned myself with. Especially when trying to get he baby hairs, my neck as been burnt one too many times. It wasn&#x27;t until mid way through college that gave up the use of heating tools except for the occasional blow out and once a week ironed sesh because well 1) heat is bad for your hair and 2) I got tired of burning myself and praying my sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t scar at the mercy of a curling iron. I tried this product on a whim because I&#x27;ve seen so many of the fabulous reviews on here, it looks clunky in the picture so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much once the product arrived in a jiffy to my door step. I picked a day where I didn&#x27;t have any commitments in case I needed to wash and deep condition my hair immediately. A wash + dry, and few beeps later my first spiral curl was born out of the Miraqueen! I did my whole head and was just in love. For starters my hair didn&#x27;t get very hot, and was still soft to touch after spending a couple seconds in the Miraqueen. I didn&#x27;t use any hair products with this either which was a plus. My curls did not fall throughout the day, and only needed a minor touch up the next morning after I woke up. My hair also did not have any breakage either. I am definitely keeping this *Queen on deck.</li>
    <li> i was skeptical because I didn&#x27;t want my hair eaten LOL, but I brush it frequently and it does wonderfully!</li>
    <li> With other curling irons, it hurts to curl because it burn my skin and sometimes my hair. Hard to hold too.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am happy I got a new curling iron which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product. My hair is wavy. Hair dryer makes my hair pretty straight which look lifeless. So I ordered Miraqueen Curling iron. I use it after drying my hair using a good hair dryer so my hair can be curled as I like. I used the default temperature there which is around 375 or so. Then at 8 sec settings, my hair can be curled within 15 minutes. And the best part is the curl stays and no burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this</li>
    <li> For this years holiday season I have looked for a way to exceeds my wife&#x27;s expectations with this years gifts. No more lotion bottles and the normal items that wind up being put under the sink and never to be seen again. I came across this product as a recommendation from my wife&#x27;s sister who&#x27;s a cosmetologist and I absolutely love it. I can&#x27;t wait until she unwraps it. The results that I have seen from her sister have been great. Every weekend when we get together she has a new hair do. It comes down to a great product like this curler. I highly suggest you try it!</li>
    <li> It worked well once! Then everytime I went to clamp down it would shut off. I guess mine was defective :/</li>
    <li> I love it! its so easy and I take it to the salon I work at.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is simply amazing!  Its easy and fast.  I have long hair and I get longlasting curls! Love this!! I highly recommend! !</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for Curls, this is it, stop searching and buy this now. I recently bought this for my girlfriend, and she swears by it that it&#x27;s the best one she has ever owned. Plus the automatic function makes it super fast and convenient when you&#x27;re in a rush. Thanks to this I&#x27;m only waiting about 20 minutes instead of an hour for her to get ready.  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for my sister.&lt;br /&gt;Was almost going to buy her a cheaper hair curler, but I found this one. All the safeguards and features it has really made it worth the extra money. I mean the automatic turn off is great, my sister can be ditzy and forget to turn off appliances for her, so this is great for her.&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the actual curls, they keep their shape really well and for a few hours on the higher settings. It automatically beeps when it&#x27;s finished, and I&#x27;ve found it difficult to burn myself, or my hair with it (I only used my hair to test it with).&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the plastic feels a bit flimsy, but it has yet to break or damage so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re wondering to go with this one, or a cheaper one, go with this one. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I actually received this curler as a gift. I’m in love with changing my hair style daily and have recently caught onto the curl obsession. My hair has a natural loose beach wave to it, and it holds curls really well. My main issue is finding a curler that doesn’t damage my hair. In Alaska our air is really dry, and some curlers end up drying my hair out too much and providing more frizz than curl. This curler actually does the opposite. It curls my hair without drying it out- and leaves virtually no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with most hair tools, this curler takes a few tries to get used to, but once you get in the hang of it, and find the right angels for different parts of your head- your hair will soon become curly and gorgeous with each use of this curler. The curler has three settings for three different kinds of curls. My favorite setting is the lowest one, which gives a very loose curl. A sort of a beach wave that works really well for casual or formal events. It looks natural and pretty. Unlike other curlers, that tend to have the curls wear out later in the day, this curler uses enough heat to create permanent curls that can hold for many more hours than other curlers. Compared to my last curler, this curler does seem to do a better job of creating longer-lasting curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second curl setting is a medium setting, which works great for formal events. I’ve curled my hair for weddings a few times, and was actually recently a bridesmaid. I did all of the fellow bridesmaids hair, as well as my own, and used the medium setting. It held the curls flawlessly- even on girls with really straight hair. A few of my friends are Korean, and they have beautiful black hair. But their hair is also stick-straight and has SO much trouble holding a curl. This curler, curled their hair really easily AND the curls stuck- which is pretty rare. Most of the time their curls fall loose after a few hours, but the styles I did for all of the bridesmaids worked for every single one of the girls, and stayed tight throughout the entire wedding event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last curl setting is a tight curl, which seems to have more of a ‘perm’ effect in my mind. It’s kind of a Taylor Swift curl. Very curly and pretty and it really makes your hair appear naturally curly, because the curls are so tight. I haven’t used this setting much, but when I do the curls are always super curly and cute. I love that it kind of has a childish charm to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curler is relatively easy to use. It has a beep setting which allows you to know when the curler is preheated, and how long to hold the curler to get the curl you want. You can also adjust the heat, for different types of hair and to adjust to your personal curl needs. I’ve been using this curler for a good three months now and have had no issues with it. It’s literally just as good as it was when I just got it- and I’m really impressed with the quality of it. Great product, and I would highly recommend it to anyone out there who curls their hair regularly. A bit different than your average curler, but a bit better than your average curler as well!ingle one of the girls, and stayed tight throughout the entire wedding event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last curl setting is a tight curl, which seems to have more of a ‘perm’ effect in my mind.

    <li> I bought this curling iron for my girlfriend who has very straight hair. She didn&#x27;t want it at first but I told her to try it. After trying it, she told me it one of the best curling irons she has tried. The curls look amazing, the iron is easy to use and it lasts for a long time. If you want to buy something for your girlfriend/wife, this would a wonderful gift to her.</li>
    <li> Afeter 1 month stopped to work. I had sent it back Miraqueen expecting to have it replace it. Never got a word.</li>
    <li> Recently, I received the Miraqueen Professional Curling Iron as a birthday present.  Usually it would take at least an hour to curl my naturally thick hair, but since I have been using the Miraqueen, my hair styling time has been cut in half.  There are a number of things that set this curling iron apart from it&#x27;s competition: (1)  This iron has a LED screen that displays everything you need to know to curl your hair at the proper temperature and direction.  Kissing awkward curls and damaged hair goodbye.  (2)  There&#x27;s a 1 year warranty for those that are kinda rough on our styling tools, however, this iron is well made and sturdy in its construction.  (3)  There are 3 awesome heat levels that optimize your hair&#x27;s health.  (4)  Four timer settings and an auto power-off just in case you forget to turn the iron off yourself.  (5)  It heats to 450 degrees for curls that can last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this iron and it tames the untameable with outstanding ease...believe me, I know from experience.  I highly recommend the Miraqueen to anyone wanting to achieve wonderful, shiny curls and waves without sacrificing your hard earned dollars, time, and the health of your hair.</li>
    <li> Great product! Very easy to use. I love it that my kids can use it without fear that they will burn themselves.</li>
    <li> Love. Love love love.</li>
    <li> I know some people love these, but this was not for me. My hair got caught in barrel when it turned and I found that I didn&#x27;t quite figure out how close it could get to my hair before I was in panic mode feeling like my hair was being sucked up and pulled.  When this didn&#x27;t happen, I was not left with nice soft curls or waves like I get with my $20 barrel curler. My hopes were that I would get a similar affect that would last longer and be quicker. However - everyone has different hair.</li>
    <li> I was afraid to buy this because I thought my hair would get stuck.  It&#x27;s a little alarming when it sucks your hair in,  but I&#x27;ve had it for months and never had a problem.  I get tons of compliments when I use it, too.  It has temperature and time setting and beeps when it&#x27;s done,  very handy.</li>
    <li> My hair is straight and fine. I tried to perm before but it didn’t last long. I gave up to perm it for many years. But sometimes, I do really want a different look and thanks my sister got me this wonderful birthday gift. This is a magic curling wand she said and it works great. I think this curling wand is very high tech and latest invention. I am amazed this is actually in the market now. It has 3 heat levels and 4 timer setting. It can notice me when it is ready to use and remind me when the time is up. So I won’t burn my hair. Love the swivel cord, it really helps when I want to get hair curl in different direction. It would never get in the way. The curls did stay most of the day for me and I am happy with the result, it does look like ceramic perm. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I just threw my Conair curler away that I paid twice as much for. The Miraqueen is far better. You can alternate the curl direction and it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; your hair like the Conair one does. I now have 2 of these - one for home and one for the gym.</li>
    <li> I got this curling iron as a present for my daughter. I really like that it is designed so that the outer surface stays cool while the hair is heated and curled in a chamber within the unit. This means no burns to the skin from using the iron. I also like that it turns itself off in case it is left on after use. My daughter loves it because it makes perfect curls that stay put all day. She also likes how she can adjust the heat setting and create the tightness of the curls so she can style her hair exactly as she wants it to look. This is a state of the art curling iron that is both safe and works really well!</li>
    <li> Best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on a hair tool. Usually since my hair is really frizzy and naturally wavy/curly I have to straighten before attempting any kind of curl. But not with this tool. I was able to just blow dry and get right to curling. I went to a Christmas party with my hair curled and after lightly sweating and hours later my hair was still in perfect condition. Couldn&#x27;t believe it. I highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> So I was skeptical. I figured if the curling wand didn&#x27;t work, I would just return it. I have to say... I really like it. It is super easy to use and my curls are great. I needed to turn the time down a little because the curls were tighter than when I had wanted. I have naturally curly hair and this curls my hair well and it is not the slightest bit frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and by far it is the best curling iron on the market. She has super straight hair and has a hard time getting curls to hold. She and I are totally amazed by how easy this wand is to use and how well the curl holds. Her hair was still curly the next day!  You cannot go wrong purchasing this. You will be in love!</li>
    <li> This made a great present for the holidays.  She said that it works very well and is very happy with the gift.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love it. Gotta have it. Quick &amp; easy. Best curler EVER! Portable. Not pricey. Need I say more? I like how I don&#x27;t have to wrap it around my hair 100 times to get the curls I need--it gently and quickly curls my hair into the device for a bouncy, burn-free curl, each-and-every-time! It also has an easy-to-read, light-up LCD, three simple settings, works like a charm every time, &amp; I can fit it into any medium-sized purse or travel bag. Mira, you&#x27;re the new Queen of Curling. It&#x27;s time for a coronation!</li>
    <li> My daughter really enjoys the curling iron.</li>
    <li> Awesome as described and mentioned in videos. Works great</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 11 year old daughter because I didn&#x27;t want her burning herself with my curling iron. She loves it, so I love it! It&#x27;s easy to use, and did take some getting used to. I read all the directions and reviews before I purchased, and told her to read them as well, and filled her in. I warned her about putting too big of a chunk of hair in at one time. She told me she did get too much once, but it sensed it, and reversed gears and spit her hair right back out. I told her to be careful, and that if for whatever reason that happened and it didn&#x27;t spit it out right away, unplug it and holler for me so I could help her without it frying her hair. Great buy, and it really eases my worries of being burned!!</li>
    <li> Got this as one of the gifts for my girlfriend on her birthday. She is absolutely IN LOVE with this curling iron. I admit I don’t know much in regards to these type of things but she’s been so excited and happy lately that I wanted to leave a review! She keeps mentioning how easy it is to use and how the quality is 10x better than any other ones that she has used. Lets just say her happiness has spilled over and made me a happier man, haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked her a few more questions about what she liked about this and she said that she doesn’t get burned anymore. She also said that she can do her hair a lot faster since she doesn’t have to pull her hair around with this item. Basically, she loves how the curler is such a non-hassle. I’m happy that she’s happy and would definitely recommend this one.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  As the other reviews have mentioned, this curling iron heats up quickly and to the preset temperature which is a huge deal.  With hair that is rather sensitive, this is a great product than the other &amp;#34;1 heat setting fits all.&amp;#34;  While it takes some getting used to at the beginning, once you get the hang of it then it&#x27;s all easy curling afterwards.  A great compliment to a flat iron that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> BY FAR THE BEST curling iron i have ever owned. One of the best, if not The Best, hair tools around. Feels great and easy to use. Not only does my hair stay in perfect condition hours after using it but it makes it looks gorgeous. Highly recommend to purchase. 5 Stars all around. Thank You miraqueen.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed did not work:( was broken</li>
    <li> This tool is so much fun! I researched several brands before deciding on this one. I like that you can choose to curl left, right, or alternating. I love that there are no external parts that get hot so there is no fear of burning your skin. The beeps let you know precisely when to release the curl, so all your curls are uniform. I have medium length hair that is curly underneath but straighter on top. I can use a lower temp for looser waves or a higher temp for curls. I thought the learning curve was pretty quick. I definitely prefer this over a curling iron or wand.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good specially if you don&#x27;t have much hair. It does take me at least 30 minutes to get my hair done. And if try putting more it just doesn&#x27;t work or even worse if it tangles, but it does work.. I like it because it&#x27;s easy</li>
    <li> Received timely... Works great!</li>
