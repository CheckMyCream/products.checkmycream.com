    <li> Great price, good quality. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Not satisfied.  Did not receive my 3 pc sable short brushes. The only reason it got a star is because I had to pick one.</li>
    <li> Shipped and received in a timely manner. Well made. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> broke the first day i got them</li>
    <li> I use will be using these brushes for my figure modeling hobby.  They appear to be decent detail brushes.  They were set at a price that couldn&#x27;t be beaten, but if you need them fast this isn&#x27;t the place to get them.  They were truly sent on the slow boat from China.  It took over a month to get here.</li>
    <li> One brush needed maintenance before use. But they are working well otherwise. I have used them frequently and am glad I purchased them</li>
    <li> The tips fall off the first use, I had to super glue the metal back onto the handles.</li>
    <li> Used these to paint the stamped metal on my G -22. Brushes worked without losing bristles and cleaned up well.</li>
    <li> This product arrived in the time frame it said it would. I love to use this with nail art. I would suggest this if you want to enhance you nails even more. I had been looking out for a new brush set and I am so glad I came across this one. I love it and do not regret it. After having this sometime and using it is ok.

    <li> Falls apart super quick. Never even got to use them before they broke.</li>
    <li> The brushes work fine, i just wish they were a little more stable.</li>
