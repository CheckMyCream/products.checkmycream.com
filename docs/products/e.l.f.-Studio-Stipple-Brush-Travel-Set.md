      <li>I super love them!</li>
      <li>The large stipple is good but a bit flimsy</li>
      <li>They are easy to wash and did not shed.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!!</li>
      <li>I was really excited to use this under the eye for highlight</li>
      <li>Came in a timely manner, overall a good buy.</li>
      <li>Not bad brushes at all for the price.</li>
      <li>Only ones I liked were the eyeshawow brushes .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s totes worth the price</li>
      <li>I think it depends on your own personal technique and your comfort.</li>
      <li>To be honest I was expecting the to be a bit taller, other then that they work fine.</li>
      <li>I have a a few elf brushes and the quality is amazing!</li>
      <li>Supposed to be brand new!!!</li>
      <li>and like always, they had exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>but they didn&#x27;t have the large stipple brush</li>
      <li>The case doesn&#x27;t really protect the brushes &amp; they stain easily even when using brush cleaner on them the same day.</li>
      <li>have worked really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The others not so much.</li>
      <li>The price is kind of higher than usual (for ELF products) for the amount of brushes</li>
      <li>the only one i liked was the flat shadow stipple brush</li>
      <li>A trick I&#x27;ve learned is to clean it in between stippling because it really keeps the color on the bristles so if u accidentally put too much contour its a hot mess and much too large an area.  </li>
      <li>The small stipple brush is amazing.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>The brushes are too soft to create any stippling effect.</li>
      <li>but I would not waste your money.</li>
      <li>I mostly decided purchase this for the small stippling brush and wanted a smaller version of it for my purse.</li>
      <li>but I mainly use it to stipple after I&#x27;ve applied my foundation with a flat foundation brush.</li>
      <li>really recommend this .the item came the day it was expected to come .</li>

<li> Over all I&#x27;d buy the small stipple only.</li>
<li> however the other three brushes</li>
<li> Not worth $15.</li>
<li> I like the little travel pouch it comes with.</li>
<li> like how they are small so the foundation doesn&#x27;t get stuck inside like it has with other brushes that I have used before.</li>
<li> and I like the brush a little bit fuller</li>
<li> They work just like those expensive Sephora brushes so far.  </li>
<li> The only reason I gave 4 stars instead out of 5 is because after a while, when you wash them especially the biggest one it does get a little ugly and doesn&#x27;t distribute the make up as well anymore.</li>
<li> Brushed fell off the handle within no time and shed like crazy.</li>
<li> Not a good brush.</li>
<li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong</li>
<li> This is awful.</li>

    <li> What great brushes! This is a MUST HAVE! The case is also great because it holds all of the brushes neatly. I recommend this to everyone, this is a great buy and definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Definitely great quality for the price! The only reason I gave 4 stars instead out of 5 is because after a while, when you wash them especially the biggest one it does get a little ugly and doesn&#x27;t distribute the make up as well anymore. Replace your make up brushes every so often.</li>
    <li> Brushed fell off the handle within no time and shed like crazy. Only ones I liked were the eyeshawow brushes .</li>
    <li> I recently purchase the MAC Mineralized Foundation and I was told I need to use a stipple brush to apply.  I looked around in various stores but they were a bit pricey.  Target sells E.L.F. products but they didn&#x27;t have the large stipple brush so I came to Amazon and like always, they had exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome. I super love them! Very satisfied customer. Came on time and in good packaging. Loving this purchase. Came in a timely manner, overall a good buy. Satisfied with my purchase. I use on a regular basis and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Product was used when I received it. Supposed to be brand new!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful brushes.  They work just like those expensive Sephora brushes so far.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any loose or lost hairs so that&#x27;s a plus. I like the little travel pouch it comes with.</li>

    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> It was the perfect size to have in my makeup bag. I gave it 4 stars because the larger brush started to shed and I like the brush a little bit fuller however the other three brushes what great and I don&#x27;t specifically use the brushes for the uses that were recommended.I think it depends on your own personal technique and your comfort.</li>

    <li> Not bad brushes at all for the price. The case doesn&#x27;t really protect the brushes &amp; they stain easily even when using brush cleaner on them the same day. Aside  from that I have had no issues such as shedding.</li>
    <li> Would love to purchase these brushes! They need to restock soon! I have a a few elf brushes and the quality is amazing! These brushes need to be in my collection!</li>
    <li> These brush are great nice quality</li>
    <li> The small stipple brush is amazing. It&#x27;s great for buffing out cream contour. It has great coverage and really builds. A trick I&#x27;ve learned is to clean it in between stippling because it really keeps the color on the bristles so if u accidentally put too much contour its a hot mess and much too large an area.  The large stipple is good but a bit flimsy and I guess it&#x27;s good coverage but I mainly use it to stipple after I&#x27;ve applied my foundation with a flat foundation brush. It gives a nice airbrush finish. It&#x27;s good for setting powders too. The concealer stipple is eh. I was really excited to use this under the eye for highlight but it&#x27;s dual fibers the black ones are very prickly and really hurt that delicate skin. So I dont use it often. I&#x27;ll cut my eyeshadow or eyeliner with it but not a go to.  Aaaaand the eyeshadow stipple. Not a good brush. Used it twice and it doesn&#x27;t do anything for me. Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong but Ive stayed away from this brush after two tries. Hope this helps.  Over all I&#x27;d buy the small stipple only. It&#x27;s totes worth the price and I&#x27;d buy it again. The others not so much.</li>
    <li> Not the best brushes I used. The brushes are too soft to create any stippling effect.</li>
    <li> I mostly decided purchase this for the small stippling brush and wanted a smaller version of it for my purse. This turned out to be a very good set. I have used a couple of brushes and the E.L.F ones have worked really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how they are small so the foundation doesn&#x27;t get stuck inside like it has with other brushes that I have used before. They are easy to wash and did not shed. I also like the pouch it comes it has a zipper on the side. I was able to store a couple of more eye shadow brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great buy good to have in your purse or for travel. The price is kind of higher than usual (for ELF products) for the amount of brushes but I have not seen this set sold in stores.</li>
    <li> quality not that great. the only one i liked was the flat shadow stipple brush the others were to loose</li>
    <li> This is awful. Do not waste your money. The big stippling brush did not stop shedding and it is not completely unusable. The others are kind of ok I guess, but I would not waste your money. Not worth $15. Maybe $5 but not $15</li>
    <li> I love stippliing brushes for so many techniques for my makeup.  These are excellent quality and reasonably priced.  No need to buy MAC where one cost more than this set.</li>
