      <li>or if you apply correctly you can get a very clean line with it.</li>
      <li>I love the color and how smooth it glides on.</li>
      <li>But smears easy.</li>
      <li>It is really easy to apply and remove.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and don&#x27;t have to sharpen the pencil ever.</li>

      <li>This pencil leaves great highlights that last all day.  </li>
      <li>Lasts all day and goes on super smooth.</li>

      <li>Such a good product.</li>

      <li>i loved the colour, it looks very good on me unlike black that sometimes look harsh.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
      <li>This is good but still not really waterproof.</li>
      <li>Very pigmented, I like this rich brown eye pencil</li>
      <li>Also good pricing and lots of other colors.</li>
      <li>Nice when it first applies but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>It last all day and goes on very easily.</li>
      <li>Super fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely be getting more when I run out.</li>
      <li>So better for the upper eye lid than the lower.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It goes on better than any eyeliner i have bought in the last 4 or 5 years</li>
      <li>and I feel it is easy to apply without causing extra wear and tear on my lashes.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and a part of my daily routine.</li>
      <li>but every time i use it my eyes get very itchy, at first i thought it was something else causing it, but i noticed that the itching happened whenever i used this particular pencil.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and creamy, nice color ( a tad darker than what I wanted, but it&#x27;s still good), stays on all day, and it even covers up my annoying eyebrow scar!</li>
      <li>so it applies darker, and I really don&#x27;t have to with NYX&#x27;s eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly, but my search continues for a liner that won&#x27;t spread to the outside corners of my eyes by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>Love it, and I wont be using any other brand of eye pencil from here on out.</li>
      <li>a decent eye liner, but it really smudges.</li>
      <li>Great color of brown, no red tint which is hard to find.</li>
      <li>their mechanical pencils seem to break and smudge a bit if rolled up too high.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>I usually buy Jordana at Walgreens, they have cheap mechanical eyeliners.</li>
      <li>SO easy to apply, and almost mistake-proof for wings; at least, for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried it because this is significantly less expensive, has more product inside, and actually lasts longer on my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I bought these because I was pinching pennies and didn&#x27;t want to shell out $17 for my usual Brown Clinique quick liner.  </li>
      <li>I usually buy this product through ULTA, but Amazon saved me a trip (and probably a few extra dollars on a spontaneous purchase).  </li>

<li> but I hardly used it a few times before it broke.  </li>
<li> Not sure if I like spending $4.50 on just one eyeliner however.</li>
<li> I usually buy cheap eye pencils from Jordana, which are impossible to apply when the product is cold.</li>
<li> Not really good for eyebrows though.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I usually buy this product through ULTA, but Amazon saved me a trip (and probably a few extra dollars on a spontaneous purchase).  Well worth the money.  This product stays on all day for me.  I use it with eyelash extensions and I feel it is easy to apply without causing extra wear and tear on my lashes.</li>
    <li> Finally the shade I was looking for...</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and perfect color. Just what I was looking for. Also good pricing and lots of other colors.</li>
    <li> I lost my eyebrows during my chemo treatments. This product has given me confidence to be out in public. It last all day and goes on very easily. Perfect for an old lady like me. I keep one in my purse just in case I get stuck in a rain storm or sweat a lot which would force me to wipe my browse. It&#x27;s more of a comfort to have it with me just in case.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product, and when I got my other parts of my shipment, this was on the packing list but not in the box.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly, but my search continues for a liner that won&#x27;t spread to the outside corners of my eyes by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> makes a great eye liner. SO easy to apply, and almost mistake-proof for wings; at least, for me.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting this product to be as good as it is for the price. I usually buy cheap eye pencils from Jordana, which are impossible to apply when the product is cold. This glides right on and blends easily. Love it, and I wont be using any other brand of eye pencil from here on out. This is the best quality I&#x27;ve found for the price.</li>
    <li> The color was good but I hardly used it a few times before it broke.  I guess it didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
    <li> The color is great and it literally stays all day, but the product itself breaks off really easily and I got a bit in my eye and it burned like a mother f-er</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner. Lasts all day and goes on super smooth. Love it and would highly recommend it. I love NYX cosmetics.</li>
    <li> Great color of brown, no red tint which is hard to find. I would buy this again.  Suggested it to friends.</li>
    <li> NYX Mechanical Eye Pencil, Brown, Very pigmented, I like this rich brown eye pencil, I can recommend this product and will repurchase it.</li>
    <li> I love this eye liner!</li>
    <li> Already had used product but buying on line was easier.Easy to use and don&#x27;t have to sharpen the pencil ever.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery.  This pencil leaves great highlights that last all day.  It is easy to use and a part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a brown eyeliner for forever. I needed something of good quality but for a good price. This eyeliner is nice and smooth and is a good buy. It is also waterproof which I do not remember the description saying that it is. Which makes the eyeliner ever better.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend. Not really good for eyebrows though.</li>
    <li> Such a good product. It goes on better than any eyeliner i have bought in the last 4 or 5 years and it does not smudge or fade threw out the day.</li>
    <li> These cost only a fraction of what eyeliner pencils cost in stores, but the product makes my eyes itch, so I&#x27;ll have to break down and get some more expensive eyeliner pencils.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I was pinching pennies and didn&#x27;t want to shell out $17 for my usual Brown Clinique quick liner.  I&#x27;m so glad I tried it because this is significantly less expensive, has more product inside, and actually lasts longer on my eyes.  It is an excellent product and sometimes hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Super great and stays on FOREVER without smudging.</li>
    <li> I love the color and how smooth it glides on. I don&#x27;t like putting eye liner on my lower water line. It just smears eventually so I avoid putting there at all. I usually tight line with this and it comes off within like 30 minutes. It smudges down to my water line just a bit. But if you don&#x27;t have watery eyes like me, this is perfect for you.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this eyeliner. Holds tight to waterline, vivid color, no worry about wood splinters in your eye (am I the only one paranoid about this?) at quite a value. NYX is the best.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Glides on with ease without tugging your eye lids. Can be smudged to get the smoky look or if you apply correctly you can get a very clean line with it. Happy to have learned of Nyx products.</li>
    <li> i loved the colour, it looks very good on me unlike black that sometimes look harsh. but every time i use it my eyes get very itchy, at first i thought it was something else causing it, but i noticed that the itching happened whenever i used this particular pencil.</li>
    <li> I like this. But smears easy. Nice when it first applies but doesn&#x27;t last. Won&#x27;t repurchase. Will try another brand next time.</li>
    <li> their mechanical pencils seem to break and smudge a bit if rolled up too high.</li>
    <li> great and pretty waterproof. nice color</li>
    <li> excellent seller, item as described</li>
    <li> This is good but still not really waterproof. The price is great! It is really easy to apply and remove.</li>
    <li> Wow! Lasts all day makes your eyes pop. I went back and ordered the black. Would purchase again. Great deal even if you have to pay shipping.</li>
    <li> After trying many high end eyeliners that just smeared, caked up and wore off very quickly I figured I&#x27;d never find a good one. But I&#x27;m so glad I came across this one! It&#x27;s very smooth and creamy, nice color ( a tad darker than what I wanted, but it&#x27;s still good), stays on all day, and it even covers up my annoying eyebrow scar! I will definitely be getting more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I usually buy Jordana at Walgreens, they have cheap mechanical eyeliners. Get two eyeliners for the same price as this. Decided to try something different. I was expecting the brown to be a tad bit darker, but it&#x27;s still a good shade. Not sure if I like spending $4.50 on just one eyeliner however. Compared to Jordana, it&#x27;s about the same. The only bonus is I usually take a lighter to it so it applies darker, and I really don&#x27;t have to with NYX&#x27;s eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Great product! This eyeliner goes on smooth, is a beautiful color and doesn&#x27;t smudge.  I would reccomend the purchase of this eyeliner.</li>
    <li> The eyeliner is clumpy when trying to apply.</li>
    <li> I liked the color. It&#x27;s the shade that I expected it to be. I&#x27;m actually wearing it now. It works better than any pencil eyeliner. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> a decent eye liner, but it really smudges. So better for the upper eye lid than the lower.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the mechanical aspect, twisting as I go, so I control how much is available to use at any given time.&lt;br /&gt;Color is good and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Love the look of the NYX eye pencil on my eyes.</li>
