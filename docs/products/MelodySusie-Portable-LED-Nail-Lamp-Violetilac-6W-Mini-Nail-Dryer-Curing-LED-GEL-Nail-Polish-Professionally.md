      <li>I tried many times putting my hands under the light and my nails were still sticky.</li>

      <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s a mini because it easy to put away.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to clean off the surface of the nail after though or they will be sticky.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect little LED lamp to cure your Gelish polish...</li>
      <li>I just used this LED light and it works well.  </li>
      <li>lamp works fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I remain amazed at the shine &amp; chip free look</li>
      <li>True, you can only do one hand at a time, and thumbs have to be done seperately, but it&#x27;s perfectly fine and does a great job.</li>
      <li>I have large hands for a woman, and I was able to angle my 4 fingers to fit just fine.  </li>
      <li>I wanted the original gelish brand LED but found this one instead.  </li>
      <li>On a recent vacation it was nice to be able to quickly fix a nail that lifted.  </li>
      <li>It works fine, but this LED light is so much faster!  </li>
      <li>so I got the full size purple LED lamp also by MelodySusie.  </li>
      <li>you really don&#x27;t need more than this for you nail curing needs.</li>
      <li>have since found on Amazon a much better lamp that will cure my whole hand and has a longer, sturdier timer button for almost 1/2 the price of this lamp.</li>
      <li>Luckily, this fits all my toes at once.</li>
      <li>Light will get extremely hot, but I assume all of them do.  </li>
      <li>This light does exactly what it is supposed to do...</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to invest a ton of money up front in case I didn&#x27;t like doing it at home, so I first bought a cheap UV lamp.  </li>
      <li>As a beginner sometimes it still takes me half an hour to do my hands, but I can say I am totally happy when they&#x27;re finished.</li>
      <li>My first try!  </li>
      <li>I have had this for several months now and it cures all brands of LED gel polish quickly and effectively.</li>
      <li>con is that I can&#x27;t fit my whole hand in at one time; I do my thumb</li>
      <li>Still worth it.</li>
      <li>Customers comment on my nails all the time, and it&#x27;s always fun to tell them I do them myself.</li>
      <li>For the price, I figure it&#x27;s still worth it and still 5 stars.  </li>
      <li>what I paid for the UV, but is absolutely worth it</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m pretty happy with the purchase since it cost half the amount of the gelish one.  </li>
      <li>It is super fast at drying Gelish nail polish.</li>
      <li>so I added a few extra seconds  to the &#x27;6G&#x27; timing listed by Gelish and they came out GREAT!  </li>
      <li>I only do gel nails, so it is very important to me.</li>
      <li>This light is just as comparable to the light that comes with the Gelish Nail Kit, however, this light by itself costs significantly less.  </li>
      <li>I attempted my first gel manicure, I followed the instructions to a T.  </li>
      <li>This is the first lamp I&#x27;ve ever bought for DIY gel nails</li>
      <li>You just plug it in, and there&#x27;s only one button too press on top.</li>
      <li>I wish I&#x27;d have purchased this first.  </li>
      <li>I use it with my Gelish polishes and its exactly as pictured/described.</li>
      <li>and I also love the 45 second timer on it ..</li>
      <li>This was my first dryer, but it works well and gets the job done.</li>
      <li>you can only fit four fingers in at a time and then cure the thumb seperately, but it is super fast!</li>
      <li>The light turns on for 45 secs then turns back off, however I leave it on my nails for 2 cycles just to make sure my gelish is properly dry.</li>
      <li>That being said, this is really convenient because of the size.</li>
      <li>There definitely is a lag from when you press the button till the light turns on, but you get used of it.</li>
      <li>I do have to cure my thumbs separate from my fingers, but it still save so much time vs. the UV that I don&#x27;t care.  </li>
      <li>The seller was prompt and product came fast.</li>
      <li>my nails have maintained thanks to this product.</li>
      <li>(it really is)</li>
      <li>I love it and have absolutely no complaints.</li>
      <li>&amp; I let them dry completely (like 45 mins) and then went on and applied the gelish top coat &amp; cured them with this product.</li>
      <li>It says it takes 1 minute for Gelish (which is what I have) to dry under the light</li>
      <li>would highly recommend this lamp for use with compatible polishes.</li>
      <li>I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use my regular polish with it since it says that it&#x27;s pretty much necessary to use gel polish only.</li>
      <li>It was really easy to learn gel polish and this lamp cut the time down to what I would consider manageable.</li>
      <li>The opening is somewhat small, so I cure my thumb separately to avoid bumping it, but at 45 seconds a pop, it is still super quick.  </li>
      <li>I am new at this and it happened to me too.</li>
      <li>i havent had any problems with mine so far!</li>
      <li>I have small hands compared to most women.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great. Using with Gelish Soak Off nail products. Recommend to anyone wanting to save money. you really don&#x27;t need more than this for you nail curing needs. And its small so storage is easy.</li>
    <li> Works great. I use LED because its definitely healthier for your skin than UV. I use it to do my Gelish manicure. The light turns on for 45 secs then turns back off, however I leave it on my nails for 2 cycles just to make sure my gelish is properly dry.</li>
    <li> Works well! I have no complaints! I&#x27;ve been using the Gelish base/top coat and an OPI color polish. I&#x27;m still new to doing my own gel nails and need more practice, but this light is great!</li>
    <li> Make sure to check the dimensions as this dryer IS small. I usually do my thumb separately. That being said, this is really convenient because of the size. I&#x27;m also able to do my toes which is a plus. Luckily, this fits all my toes at once. This was my first dryer, but it works well and gets the job done. I sometimes hit the edges of the interior when I&#x27;m doing my fingers, so it&#x27;s good to see how deep your hand should go instead of blindly just shoving it in there. It gets noticeably warm, but not enough to be uncomfortable. There definitely is a lag from when you press the button till the light turns on, but you get used of it. It&#x27;s really simple to use. You just plug it in, and there&#x27;s only one button too press on top. I&#x27;ve used it several times already and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to try out gel nail polishes. The other lamps can get really expensive and this one works just fine.</li>
    <li> Works great for doing gel nails at home.  It&#x27;s a little too small for the whole hand (unless you have tiny hands).  But if you&#x27;re not in a rush you can just do the fingers and thumb separately.  You might be able to fit one hand in at once, but you&#x27;d risk messing up the gel.</li>
    <li> This light is just as comparable to the light that comes with the Gelish Nail Kit, however, this light by itself costs significantly less.  It has a 45 second automatic timer on it, and it works great for my gel nails!  Very pleased with this.</li>
    <li> This is the first lamp I&#x27;ve ever bought for DIY gel nails and I am not at all unhappy. It was really easy to learn gel polish and this lamp cut the time down to what I would consider manageable. As a beginner sometimes it still takes me half an hour to do my hands, but I can say I am totally happy when they&#x27;re finished. I had a lot of trouble getting regular polish to be streak free, but I feel like a pro when I use gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this lamp for use with compatible polishes.</li>
    <li> This review is to help people out there that have attempted to read the directions (like me) but are still getting sticky nails. I am new at this and it happened to me too. I tried many times putting my hands under the light and my nails were still sticky. I took some of the &amp;#34;artificial nail remover&amp;#34; on a cotton ball and wiped all of my nails. The sticky residue came off and I have a nice shiny gel nail still there. Not sure if that is what you are supposed to do, but that worked for me.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about this item being for smaller hands. I have small hands compared to most women. So I decided this is a good price, and purchased it. However, I am very disappointed with this item. If you shove your entire hand under dryer your nails will not cure properly. So instead of returning the product, I have resorted to curing my thumbs seperatly. Yes, a bit inconvenient.</li>
    <li> This light is great and perfect for my dorm room. I love it and have absolutely no complaints.</li>
    <li> Great product and seller!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this light! I had the black one, but the cord broke....and I may have accidentally fried the light by using the wrong cord! Oops! I only do gel nails, so it is very important to me.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with gel manicures after doing one myself with a friend&#x27;s gel manicure set. Two weeks later I ordered this along w the Gelish Basic kit. It is WONDERFUL. True, you can only do one hand at a time, and thumbs have to be done seperately, but it&#x27;s perfectly fine and does a great job. I am a nail freak. I love doing my own designs on my nails &amp; so I&#x27;m stocked up on colors. I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use my regular polish with it since it says that it&#x27;s pretty much necessary to use gel polish only. As soon as I got this in the mail I had to experiment. I used regular polishes to do a glitter ombré manicure on all my nails &amp; I let them dry completely (like 45 mins) and then went on and applied the gelish top coat &amp; cured them with this product. Wiped &#x27;em down with that alcohol stuff &amp; BAM. Brilliant, shiny, goregous manicure. They came out stunning! It&#x27;s something to be proud of. Customers comment on my nails all the time, and it&#x27;s always fun to tell them I do them myself. Love love love this kit! I&#x27;m a week in, and no chipping at all yet. I&#x27;m a barista, so I&#x27;m constantly knocking my hands around. I remain amazed at the shine &amp; chip free look my nails have maintained thanks to this product. Also, removal is easy. The acetone thing works, but takes a little extra time. Still worth it. I peel it off sometimes too. (Shh! Don&#x27;t say a word) At any rate, I would totally reccomend this to anyone who loves doing their nails. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> No issues..works like others I&#x27;ve tried.  Light will get extremely hot, but I assume all of them do.  Works great!</li>
    <li> This light does exactly what it is supposed to do... But it also died within 10 manicures. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> 11/6/13 UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve had this nail lamp for a year, and now it won&#x27;t turn on.  For the price, I figure it&#x27;s still worth it and still 5 stars.  I bought another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I attempted my first gel manicure, I followed the instructions to a T.  I put thin layers of base, cured under lamp, color, cured, top then cure again.  My nails were still feeling tacky after I cured them for over 2 min each (the instructions say 10 seconds with an LED lamp).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, your nails will feel a little tacky, but they&#x27;re DRY.  Scrub them with a nail brush and soap and water and reveal gel manicured nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con is that I can&#x27;t fit my whole hand in at one time; I do my thumb separate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lamp works fantastic.  Price is unbeatable (I&#x27;ve checked).</li>
    <li> I recently started using Gelish at home, after having it done professionally once.  I didn&#x27;t want to invest a ton of money up front in case I didn&#x27;t like doing it at home, so I first bought a cheap UV lamp.  It works fine, but this LED light is so much faster!  I do have to cure my thumbs separate from my fingers, but it still save so much time vs. the UV that I don&#x27;t care.  It seemed that I was having to do two 2 minute UV cycles for the final 2 coats, whereas I&#x27;ve never had to cure any coat for longer than 45 seconds with the LED.  This lamp costs about 2x what I paid for the UV, but is absolutely worth it (and this one is a lot cheaper than most of the LED lamps I found).  I wish I&#x27;d have purchased this first.  I really like the 45 second auto shutoff.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I decided I wanted to be able to cure my whole hand at once, and that the rather painful price was worth it (it really is) so I got the full size purple LED lamp also by MelodySusie.  However, I&#x27;m keeping this one for traveling.  On a recent vacation it was nice to be able to quickly fix a nail that lifted.  The base coat, top coat, and color polish fit in my airplane plastic bag and rubbing alcohol can be found anywhere.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical after noticing that a lot of the dryers had seller&#x27;s positive feedback altering their scores. I took a chance with this one due to the price and am happy I did! Works perfect. Cured Gelish polish in 45 seconds per coat. Be sure to clean off the surface of the nail after though or they will be sticky. I thought they had not cured well and got online and read to do this and it worked.</li>
    <li> The size wasn&#x27;t too bad of an issue (you have to cure thumbs separately), but I found that while using Gelish I had to cure two or three times due to the wattage of this lamp.  After a few weeks, the button got stuck and it was rendered useless.  For the price, it&#x27;s not a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since found on Amazon a much better lamp that will cure my whole hand and has a longer, sturdier timer button for almost 1/2 the price of this lamp.</li>
    <li> I cured my nails at least 10 times and they didn&#x27;t dry! AT ALL!!! It says it takes 1 minute for Gelish (which is what I have) to dry under the light but this thing doesn&#x27;t dry my nails AT ALL.</li>
    <li> got this to use with my opi gels and i love it. you can only fit four fingers in at a time and then cure the thumb seperately, but it is super fast! i havent had any problems with mine so far!</li>
    <li> Our Daughter bought this as a gift for her Mom, so this Mom returned the favor and ordered her one too! Get the protective gloves also. The seller was prompt and product came fast.</li>
    <li> I just used this LED light and it works well.  I did my nails with a dark Gelish color (Midnight Caller) so I added a few extra seconds  to the &#x27;6G&#x27; timing listed by Gelish and they came out GREAT!  My first try!  I have large hands for a woman, and I was able to angle my 4 fingers to fit just fine.  I&#x27;m very happy with this inexpensive LED light.  The ON button on top shuts off the light at 30 seconds automatically, or you can just use it as an ON/OFF button.  No need to spend $100-$200 for a light for casual, at home use.  I got the white one.</li>
    <li> This works great! I have had this for several months now and it cures all brands of LED gel polish quickly and effectively. The price is cheaper than what you might find at beauty supply stores.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t so sure when I purchased this if it was going to work out but I am SO happy I took the chance. I use it with my Gelish polishes and its exactly as pictured/described. One tap and  Its even the perfect size for me to do my toes! Plus its small enough to toss in a suitcase or weekend bag for any holiday manicure emergencies. To top it off I love knowing that I&#x27;m saving tons of money doing my own nails, and that is priceless.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for a stylish &amp; convenient way to cure gel nails, etc.</li>
    <li> I love it is really nice and easy to take with me everywhere and it works great and I also love the 45 second timer on it .. my nails are not sticky at all at the end it dry perfect</li>
    <li> I wanted the original gelish brand LED but found this one instead.  I was skeptical since I never heard of this brand but I just used it a week ago and my polish is still looking good.  So I&#x27;m pretty happy with the purchase since it cost half the amount of the gelish one.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s a mini because it easy to put away.  I guess I&#x27;ll have to see how long this lamp lasts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy it works as described! It is super fast at drying Gelish nail polish. I used the Gelish basix starter kit with it.  So worth owning your own LED light!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect little LED lamp to cure your Gelish polish... I&#x27;ve been using it to cure my gelish on my toes but I&#x27;ve ordered a 18w LED lamp that will cure my entire hand at once to do my hands...  but this one will be perfect to travel and take with me...  does a perfect job in 45s ..</li>
    <li> When I opened the light, I was not convinced that it would work, but this compact and lightweight LED light does the trick!  The opening is somewhat small, so I cure my thumb separately to avoid bumping it, but at 45 seconds a pop, it is still super quick.  I am using Opi Gelcolor.</li>
