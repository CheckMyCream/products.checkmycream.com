      <li>I think I love them more than he does!</li>
      <li>With most after shave products you have an overwhelming scent and the fact that they burn!</li>
      <li>Very comfortable, alcohol based shaving products sting but not this</li>
      <li>so I can apply it with my fingers, smells good and mild, and serves its purpose as post-shave antiseptic.</li>
      <li>However, that after shave like many others has alcohol in it and has that burn, whether you shave with a razor or a machine.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>Gentle and soothing, not sticky, a great product.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>This aftershave balm is just ok.</li>
      <li>works good no razor burn, i shave dry so this is great.</li>
      <li>He also says that shaving has become more comfortable as well.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product for those that have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>okay, I&#x27;ve used this product primarily as a lotion to sooth my face after shaving, and I will say that the Dove product comining care sensitive hydration and post shave balm is very effective for my skin.  </li>
      <li>This balm helps to moisturize the skin and leaves the skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
      <li>Light, but manly.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a great chance I will continue using it for the foreseeable future.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a great chance I will continue using it for the foreseeable future.</li>
      <li>Smooth and comforting for aftershave.</li>
      <li>First of all I am surprised how it got so many good reviews.</li>
      <li>If you like the cool after shave which is non greasy</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this to anyone, and also I am more into thicker form of balms not thin liquid.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s true).</li>
      <li>This sensitive post shave balm is nice, though.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does absorb well and fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>balm\\&quot; really helps fill a rather unaddressed niche in men&#x27;s skin care - the need for a soothing lightly scented moisturizing cr&amp;egrave;me.  </li>
      <li>My notes: It does have a nice, subtle scent instead of over-powering like so many men&#x27;s products!</li>
      <li>The king of the castle says his face feels very smooth, substantially moisturized and well protected after using this Dove aftershave (post shave balm),  He commented that the fragrance is manly but not overpowering, and the product flows very easily from bottle but didn&#x27;t become messy.  </li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;m older, and presumably wiser, I have begun to recognize the benefits of soothing and calming the skin after shaving, and have found that a good balm or lotion will do wonders for skin quality and overall appearance.</li>
      <li>, feels great, cools your face down, has no Odor or very minimal.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Of the four products, he particularly liked the \\&quot;Sensitive Face Lotion\\&quot; and the \\&quot;Sensitive Post Shave Balm\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Awesome stuff smells great and lasts a long long long long time.  </li>
      <li>I would like a more accurate and/or consistent delivery system, plus the bottle is dark</li>
      <li>I have pretty fair/sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s serves its purpose, but is not my first choice.</li>
      <li>This works pretty well.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t exactly greasy, although you do feel the product on your skin.</li>
      <li>At first application I felt like this product was greasy.  </li>
      <li>The only post shave balm that has ever made my skin feel so smooth and calm after a shave.</li>
      <li>/&gt;A couple of closing notes, one positive, one negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is good for sensitive skin and does not cause any further irritation, but I do not feel like it does a lot as far as really soothing or preventing irritations from shaving.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a pleasant, light scent and isn&#x27;t irritating at all -- in fact, it does live up to the hype in that</li>
      <li>it quickly evaporated away leaving a soft skin feeling, but no grease.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have never really cared for any post-shave product before, it&#x27;s mostly my husband that likes that stuff, but I must say this works very well.</li>
      <li>and it was reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>really like this Dove post shave product.</li>
      <li>so I really won&#x27;t know when I am out until nothing squeezes out (unlike a toothpaste container than flattens out as the product is used) and the bottle keeps its shape.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It moistures very well.  </li>
      <li>one works fast</li>
      <li>really like this Dove post shave product.</li>
      <li>works better than expected.</li>
      <li>Very watery.</li>
      <li>(I sound like a commercial</li>
      <li>This has worked really well</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all right, but maybe Dove is so used to targeting women that they misjudged what a masculine scent is.</li>
      <li>The scent is mild and barely noticeable.</li>
      <li>; kind is a little harder to find in stories, but is obviously available easily on Amazon (can only find the &amp;#34;Hydrate&amp;#34; in Target or Walreens).</li>
      <li>This seems to work much better than traditional shaving lotions that I&#x27;ve used in the past, and I highly recommend it for soothing the skin rather than refreshing it with a stinging lotion.</li>
      <li>white soothing cr&amp;egrave;me is mildly scented and acceptably masculine (barely), and although mild, the scent hangs in there for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is just oily enough to allow it to be spread out across the face, but once the application is complete, it air dries quickly, leaving skin (sounds like a commercial) soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I had previously been using a sensitive skin lotion by Polo, but it was pretty strongly scented</li>
      <li>I think this and the other products make him smell incredibly sexy, actually.  </li>
      <li>You also can not control how much of balm you want, as you squeeze the bottle it shoots out in a very fast manner so be careful.</li>
      <li>I found that this Dove product works fine no matter what shave method I&#x27;ve used, but it was particularly soothing on dry skin after a dry electric shave.</li>
      <li>I felt a remote cooling/tingly sensation, but this stuff is not at all like the strong burning/cooling astringent qualities of the alcohol-based lotions(that I often like, especially in summer).  </li>
      <li>This product offers a soothing, healing balm on those days when I am a bit too aggressive with the razor.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, which always makes shaving a chore.</li>
      <li>No problems with my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I use this after shaving in the shower with my Norelco Sensotouch 3D and Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Shave Cream.</li>
      <li>B001G7PTVQ Gillette Mach3 Disposable, Sensitive, 3-Count</li>
      <li>Once upon a time, when razors were two disposable blades on the end of a plastic stick and shaving foam was the consistency of the head on a day old glass of beer, after shave balms and lotions were one of my grooming necessities.</li>
      <li>He also has sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>He&#x27;s been using the Dove Men+Care line of hair/body wash for several months now, and really likes it.  </li>
      <li>It does make your skin soft though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re prone to that dry, tight feeling after shaving, you will most likely want something a little more moisturizing, which is longer lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have sensitive skin, which always makes shaving a chore. Even a light shave will often leave my skin feeling scraped and looking raw. And then I discovered this stuff. I have no idea what&#x27;s in it, but it definitely works. I shave, and then wash my face and neck in the shower. After toweling off, I apply this balm and bam! It makes my skin feel moist, but not greasy, and it eases the feeling of razor burn. I can&#x27;t speak highly enough about this product. Love it!</li>
    <li> No problems with my sensitive skin. Great, understated smell.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable, alcohol based shaving products sting but not this</li>
    <li> Works great! The fragrance is not overwhelming either, very subtle.</li>
    <li> Very good. Not greasy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for those that have sensitive skin.  Every time I shave my skin is sensitive to the touch and feels very dry.  This balm helps to moisturize the skin and leaves the skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
    <li> works better than expected. Dove has become such a trustworthy name for us men</li>
    <li> First of all I am surprised how it got so many good reviews. I tried it for one day and just threw it away. The smell is very feminine and it leaves this very bad odor on your face which you are constantly smelling as you move. I would not recommend this to anyone, and also I am more into thicker form of balms not thin liquid. You also can not control how much of balm you want, as you squeeze the bottle it shoots out in a very fast manner so be careful.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Great aftershave, and has no scent which is what I want, since I wear a lot of cologne.  Smooth and comforting for aftershave.</li>
    <li> It moistures very well.  It also soothes.</li>
    <li> Great feeling - smell could be improved.  Pretty bland smell, not good, not bad...just like nothing.</li>
    <li> I have never really cared for any post-shave product before, it&#x27;s mostly my husband that likes that stuff, but I must say this works very well. I changed my shaving routine to fit this in, and I am very happy I did so. My neck area, which is normally very bad, very bumpy and sensitive, took to this especially well.</li>
    <li> A very good product; no burns.</li>
    <li> Husband uses product and the price was good</li>
    <li> The only post shave balm that has ever made my skin feel so smooth and calm after a shave. Sooooo stoked about this product. Only downside is I can seem to find it in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> If you like the cool after shave which is non greasy this is it (I sound like a commercial but it&#x27;s true). I prefer very subtle fragrance and this is perfect as it does not have overpowering scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for the past couple years. I used to deal with a lot of breakouts and ingrown hairs after shaving. I have pretty fair/sensitive skin. I use this after shaving in the shower with my Norelco Sensotouch 3D and Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Shave Cream. I always pat dry my face (they say you should never rub or scrub your face with a towel after showering/shaving) and then put this on my face. It seems to work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Bottle seems to last a long time&lt;br /&gt;-Reduces ingrown hairs/breakouts&lt;br /&gt;-Very little smell to it&lt;br /&gt;-Does not feel greasy or oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; kind is a little harder to find in stories, but is obviously available easily on Amazon (can only find the &amp;#34;Hydrate&amp;#34; in Target or Walreens).</li>
    <li> This works pretty well.  It&#x27;s comparable to Every Man Jack from Target.</li>
    <li> Having a very strong sense of smell, I dislike colognes and aftershaves. This is great for me - it is a balm so I can apply it with my fingers, smells good and mild, and serves its purpose as post-shave antiseptic. It also moisturizes, unlike aftershaves.</li>
    <li> good product. will buy it again</li>
    <li> My husband is 30, and he has thick, quick-growing hair.  His facial hair is no exception.  He also has sensitive skin.  He&#x27;s been using the Dove Men+Care line of hair/body wash for several months now, and really likes it.  I&#x27;ve also noticed changes too, like his hair is smoother and he no longer gets dry patches of skin on his hands and elbows or any other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw Vine offered this same line in facial care products for men, I jumped on all four products for sensitive skin for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of them have been no exception to the excellence of the Dove for Men product line.  He&#x27;s been getting less razor burn, he has had less breakouts, and he hasn&#x27;t had any sort of negative reaction to any of the facial care products from Dove.  He also says that shaving has become more comfortable as well.  I&#x27;m not sure how well he notices his skin, but I notice.  I&#x27;ve noticed his skin looking clearer and brighter, and I think they&#x27;ve done great things for his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This post shave balm has been excellent for my husband.  He has almost no razor burn since using this and the line of Dove Men products for shaving, and he used to get a fair amount of it.  It has a nice feel to it, it&#x27;s not greasy or oily anything, and the fragrance is wonderful.  I think this and the other products make him smell incredibly sexy, actually.  I will continue to buy these products for my husband in the future.  I think I love them more than he does!</li>
    <li> works good no razor burn, i shave dry so this is great.</li>
    <li> Dove Men Plus Care is a thick and luxurious application for those of us with sensitive skin.  I have a very tough beard, and try to keep clean shaven on both head and chin. This product offers a soothing, healing balm on those days when I am a bit too aggressive with the razor.</li>
    <li> This nicely performing \\&quot;post-shave balm\\&quot; really helps fill a rather unaddressed niche in men&#x27;s skin care - the need for a soothing lightly scented moisturizing cr&amp;egrave;me.  Manufacturers are getting on board with this now, as I recently used and reviewed a very similar new product from Axe. I had previously been using a sensitive skin lotion by Polo, but it was pretty strongly scented and I didn&#x27;t necessarily want that every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm/Sensitive comes in a 3.4 ounce rectangular container similar in dimensions to a stick deodorant. I&#x27;ll also add that 3.4 ounces is just small enough to allow inclusion in airline carry-on baggage (by current security rules).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white soothing cr&amp;egrave;me is mildly scented and acceptably masculine (barely), and although mild, the scent hangs in there for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On application, this product does indeed instantly sooth and soften.  I felt a remote cooling/tingly sensation, but this stuff is not at all like the strong burning/cooling astringent qualities of the alcohol-based lotions(that I often like, especially in summer).  This Dove is alcohol-free.  You&#x27;ll want to go ahead and rub the excess product into your hands, where it will also soften and leave behind a mild scent.  At first application I felt like this product was greasy.  But, not to worry . . . it quickly evaporated away leaving a soft skin feeling, but no grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of closing notes, one positive, one negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive: Price.  Notwithstanding the relatively small container, this seems like a decent value (typical of Dove).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative:  Scent.  It&#x27;s all right, but maybe Dove is so used to targeting women that they misjudged what a masculine scent is. I guess it&#x27;s acceptable, but is a little too \\&quot;flowery\\&quot; for my personal taste.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff smells great and lasts a long long long long time.  I use mine everyday since christmas and i think i might be only half way through buy it you won&#x27;t regret it. no burning or irritation its amazing</li>
    <li> The Dove Men+Care line of products has always been solid in my experience, aside from their body wash which I&#x27;m not a fan of. This sensitive post shave balm is nice, though. It&#x27;s got a pleasant, light scent and isn&#x27;t irritating at all -- in fact, it does live up to the hype in that it&#x27;s rather soothing when applied. If you&#x27;re looking for this type of product, I see no reason not to recommend it.</li>
    <li> This after shave lotion works great. I am a big fan of a competing brand in a white bottle (Nivea). However, that after shave like many others has alcohol in it and has that burn, whether you shave with a razor or a machine.&lt;br /&gt;This one works fast, feels great, cools your face down, has no Odor or very minimal.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is the packaging. I appreciate the inverted form however it is a \\&quot;squeeze\\&quot; bottle, and everyday I squeeze it I get a different amount. I would like a more accurate and/or consistent delivery system, plus the bottle is dark so I really won&#x27;t know when I am out until nothing squeezes out (unlike a toothpaste container than flattens out as the product is used) and the bottle keeps its shape.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of this, the product inside is great.</li>
    <li> Very watery. Though it does provide moisture, it&#x27;s not as luxurious as other sensitive skin balms. It&#x27;s serves its purpose, but is not my first choice.</li>
    <li> Husband needed a soothing post-shave lotion/cream/balm since he was switching to a safety razor.  This has worked really well and it was reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I recently gave my husband the Dove Men Care post-shave balm, along with 3 other Dove Men Care products. Of the four products, he particularly liked the \\&quot;Sensitive Face Lotion\\&quot; and the \\&quot;Sensitive Post Shave Balm\\&quot;. He says they work great, and leave his skin feeling better and healthier. The Post-Shave Balm has a nice cooling effect. He likes the scent, and I do too. It&#x27;s masculine, but not strong.</li>
    <li> Once upon a time, when razors were two disposable blades on the end of a plastic stick and shaving foam was the consistency of the head on a day old glass of beer, after shave balms and lotions were one of my grooming necessities. Over the years, as actual shave product technology improved, I found I had less need to use after shave products. Now that I&#x27;m older, and presumably wiser, I have begun to recognize the benefits of soothing and calming the skin after shaving, and have found that a good balm or lotion will do wonders for skin quality and overall appearance. So I welcomed the opportunity to try this Dove post shave balm for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a regular shaving routine. Some days I go with [[ASIN:B0032ANCUK Edge Shave Gel, Extra Protection, 7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)]] and my [[ASIN:B001G7PTVQ Gillette Mach3 Disposable, Sensitive, 3-Count (Pack of 2)]], some days [[ASIN:B00A0J086C Axe Shave Gel, Shield, 7 Ounce]] takes the place of the Edge, and some I use my [[ASIN:B005DKKBRY Panasonic ES-LT41-K Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Black/Silver]], maybe wet with gel, but usually dry. It&#x27;s just how I feel at the moment. I found that this Dove product works fine no matter what shave method I&#x27;ve used, but it was particularly soothing on dry skin after a dry electric shave. A little goes a long way and when massaging it in, you can almost feel like it is soaking into the skin. It is just oily enough to allow it to be spread out across the face, but once the application is complete, it air dries quickly, leaving skin (sounds like a commercial) soft and smooth. The scent is slightly effeminate, I felt, but it isn&#x27;t particularly strong and doesn&#x27;t linger very long after application. I used this balm in tandem with [[ASIN:B00A0J09GG Axe Face Hydrator and Post Shave Gel, Chilled, Cooling, 3.3 Ounce]]and I think it leaves my skin just a little less greasy (but the Axe product is fine too). A similar product is the [[ASIN:B009YSSLGE Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Face Lotion]], which I use when I&#x27;m going to be out in the sun or on days when I don&#x27;t shave (which are usually the same day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this Dove post shave product. There&#x27;s a great chance I will continue using it for the foreseeable future.ASIN:B009YSSLGE Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Face Lotion]], which I use when I&#x27;m going to be out in the sun or on days when I don&#x27;t shave (which are usually the same day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this Dove post shave product. There&#x27;s a great chance I will continue using it for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> I used it for couple of months, the liquid gets stuck a lot and the bottle is not design well. I am going back to Nevea after shave balm.</li>
    <li> This aftershave balm is just ok. It is good for sensitive skin and does not cause any further irritation, but I do not feel like it does a lot as far as really soothing or preventing irritations from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does absorb well and fairly quickly. It isn&#x27;t exactly greasy, although you do feel the product on your skin. It can relieve some of the tightness after shaving, but not for very long. If you&#x27;re prone to that dry, tight feeling after shaving, you will most likely want something a little more moisturizing, which is longer lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t seem to stop or help razor burn, or the little red dots that you get sometimes after shaving. It does make your skin soft though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice. Light, but manly.</li>
    <li> The king of the castle says his face feels very smooth, substantially moisturized and well protected after using this Dove aftershave (post shave balm),  He commented that the fragrance is manly but not overpowering, and the product flows very easily from bottle but didn&#x27;t become messy.  He didn&#x27;t get any breakouts or irritation after using it.  He also says he&#x27;s now interested in checking out other products from this Dove men&#x27;s line.</li>
    <li> Review by my husband, John: \\&quot;This has the quality one comes to expect from Dove products. Its smooth, very subtly scented, and very soothing. It feels so good to apply it to razor burn you almost hope you get some! Gentle and soothing, not sticky, a great product.\\&quot; My notes: It does have a nice, subtle scent instead of over-powering like so many men&#x27;s products!</li>
    <li> ... but this Post Shave Balm I do like. With most after shave products you have an overwhelming scent and the fact that they burn! When you have sensitive skin to start with, the simple act of shaving hurts enough, you don&#x27;t need to add alcohol to the fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this, it soothes the shaving burn some of us feel everytime and moisturizes as well. The scent is mild and barely noticeable. As with all the Dove for Men products I have tried, this is an excellent addition to my morning routine.</li>
    <li> I grew a fall and winter beard and have just lately shaved it off for the warmer weather coming.  At the same time, I&#x27;ve started comparing the various shaving products along with moisturizing and sun black produchts..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So okay, I&#x27;ve used this product primarily as a lotion to sooth my face after shaving, and I will say that the Dove product comining care sensitive hydration and post shave balm is very effective for my skin.  This seems to work much better than traditional shaving lotions that I&#x27;ve used in the past, and I highly recommend it for soothing the skin rather than refreshing it with a stinging lotion.</li>
