<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> havent used them all yet, but great chapstick</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and I always get the pomegranate flavor, but this variety pack is amazing and you can try all their different fruit flavors.</li>
    <li> Well softens,not sticky.</li>
    <li> Like this.  Excellent for lip moisturing.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used them but like the package and the way they look! And I think the price is reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand of lip balm for years--I love it, and carry one with me at all times. I feel good that it is made healthfully too. My lips are never chapped--feel very soft and smooth. The price for this four-pack is good too at less than $2.50 a tube. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm, but I normally just get the &#x27;regular&#x27; kind at the store. I&#x27;m so glad I got this sampler pack! Not only is it nice to try different flavors, this was way cheaper than what I found in stores.</li>
    <li> Love burts bees! It&#x27;s the only brand I can find that doesn&#x27;t eventually dry out my lips more.</li>
    <li> Great product. Good quality. Fast shipping. I am very glad.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d like the pear and coconut the best, but I like the pomegranate the best so far!  I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and I think this was a good deal!</li>
    <li> The lip balm realy nature and keep may lip Moist</li>
    <li> Great chapstick!  Great price!</li>
    <li> Great service, quality is very good</li>
    <li> nice package of lip stuff.  enough I got to keep one.</li>
    <li> Love these. Was previously using the Neos and while I likes their flavors, the size isn&#x27;t convenient and mold started growing in the cracks.&lt;br /&gt;All of these flavors taste great and my lips have not been chapped or sore since using them.</li>
    <li> Love this product and was a good price!</li>
    <li> the flavors are nice.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and very moisturizing! I use it every night before I sleep. I&#x27;ve been through like 5 of these!</li>
    <li> my friend very like it</li>
    <li> Only lip balm that actually hydrates my lips. Love it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have to worry about all the chemicals that are typically used in popular lip balm brands.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm, bar none.</li>
    <li> Original Burt&#x27;s is still the best.</li>
    <li> love this chapstick....$7.77 for 4 is a good deal.  However my favorite is coconut pear by far. I probably wont buy this particular pack again, and just stick with the coconut pear. The other ones weren&#x27;t that great.  The pomegranate was quite a dissapointment.</li>
    <li> This thing healed my chaped lips. Wow! Is all I can say.</li>
    <li> Good quality product. It works great. It is natural. Am my family uses it.</li>
    <li> Received quickly and my girlfriends lips are so moist and soft now</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm and I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees. Sympathy to family on the loss. I would have kept my business. Just to be sure that all ingredients remained natural.</li>
    <li> I love these lip balms!  The mango especially smells great.</li>
    <li> Really great deal, i&#x27;m super happy that I bought them! They were all sealed and brand new which was great and I feel confident about buying them again!</li>
    <li> 4 stars for the moisturizing, 2 stars for the flavor.  Or lack thereof.</li>
    <li> Very good.But the APEX is laji!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m  extremely happy with this product! I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love, love, LOVE them!</li>
    <li> These are the best lip balms I&#x27;ve ever owned! I also love the senses of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I purchased this over a year ago and I just finished one tube after using it almost every day (really!).  I believe they&#x27;re amazing because:&lt;br /&gt;1) They immediately made my lips feel better when my lips were chapped (and sometimes caused pain).&lt;br /&gt;2) I saw the difference the next day (from chapped to better looking lips).&lt;br /&gt;3) They&#x27;re durable! Like I said, I used the same one (out of four) for over a year!</li>
    <li> The mango one after a small amount of time starts to have a unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;ve only used the pomegranate one, and really like it.  No harmful ingredients--I cannot take peppermint oil on my lips, so not all the Burt&#x27;s Bees balms work for me.</li>
    <li> I love burts bees lip balm.</li>
    <li> I love the new flavors. burt&#x27;s bees are the best.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm and this is the best deal around! As stated, all of the different flavors have different purposes which should determine what you use it for. The one I find myself using the most is the grapefruit, but I love them all!</li>
    <li> I prchased this item at a resonable price. I think the pink grapefruit has best scent. And it tastes not that good.</li>
    <li> So good to have.  Especially in the winter months!</li>
    <li> I love Burts Bees &amp; this is a great variety pack!! Shipping was quick, the reason why I have it 3 stars is because I&#x27;m pretty sure I, myself, only opened one of the balms. The other 3 were previously opened our already open. I don&#x27;t get weird about things like that &amp; I&#x27;m still using them, but I don&#x27;t know if I SHOULD feel weird about it... o.O</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, very good product.</li>
    <li> Great deal! I usually only use the peppermint ones but I&#x27;m loving these fruit flavors.</li>
    <li> I like them all, but the mango is my absolute favorite for continuing moisture!</li>
    <li> I love the taste，really good！They are moisturized and nourished！！My all family love them.Thanks Amazon！！The shippment is faster than before.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good for lip use. And much cheaper than sold in TB .</li>
    <li> smooth,thin and smells fresh</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balm ever!</li>
    <li> Not a bad variety.....flavors are a personal preference, so liked some more than others.</li>
    <li> What can I say. A good product that does what it claims.  The only downside for me, my dislike for anything that tastes like coconut.  Gave that one to the wife.</li>
    <li> Love this set of four lipbalms. I always lose my lip balms, in fact, I think I already lost one. But these keep your lips moisturized all day without being reapplied unless you eat food and wipe it off. No colors, smells good.</li>
    <li> good stuff. Really natural and some people like that.</li>
    <li> Love burts bees lip balm, these new scents are amazing! The pear coconut is the best! Very moisturizing and goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> Fantastic deal.  Works wonders on dry lips.  Doesn&#x27;t leave excess gunk on your lips.  All the flavors were subtle and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> These are good.  They smell great and are a good lip conditioner.  My only disappointment is that they do not have any flavor.</li>
    <li> Package has been received, very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Great product all natural</li>
    <li> this is the best lip balm that I have tried in a long time.  I love the fun scents. the Mango and grapefruit are my favorites, and each infusion brings a different benefit to the lips. these are not greasy, but leave a nice sheen to the lips and lasts for a good time as well.  this is my second order of these and I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love these and even bought them as christmas presents for co-workers.</li>
    <li> Great price for an awesome product!</li>
    <li> i am from china and got the item with 12 days. it&#x27;s so fast. haha .&lt;br /&gt;and i also love the lip very much, the smell is good.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lip balm I have ever used.. I recommend Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s too everyone!!</li>
    <li> BB is my favorite brand of lip balm. I apply lip balm probably 1-2x an hour. It doesn&#x27;t melt in the hot car!! The flavors are great. My favorite is the coconut.</li>
    <li> I come from China, everyone says this lipstick is very good. My daughter is very like lipstick bought later.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees chapstick is my favorite and having a bunch of different flavors is nice!</li>
    <li> Great product, in keeping with all Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  The multi-pack makes these very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Good lipstick, my baby is in use, drying quickly good</li>
    <li> It keeps my lips from chapping and cracking, whatever the weather. I use it every day! This is a great pack of 4.</li>
    <li> Always loved Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.  Love the variety pack, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I love the product. Natural is the way to go especially when it&#x27;s going on your lips. A multi pack is hard to find in stores near me. So I was so happy to find it here!</li>
    <li> Flavors are awesome! Makes my lips feel awesome!</li>
    <li> I just received it yesterday, but the item was labeled by 2013-11 on the package, I am afraid that it is out of date now.</li>
    <li> best price and quality. use this everyday.</li>
    <li> My order of this 4 pack came in a perfect box, but it included 2 of the same lip balm. It did not include a pink grapefruit flavor &amp; contained 2 coconut &amp; pear. Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Not all flavors are great, but I got it to try them</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t love the grapefruit, the mango and coconut are my favorite. Burt&#x27;s bees is always an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Love these! Especially the pear and coconut. Smooth and creamy. Leaves lips soft with a hint of shine, no color.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used the coconut and pear lip balm, which has worked really well. I gave my mom the mango one and she loves it.</li>
    <li> These taste and work great!</li>
    <li> good products.www.herebbs.com/thread-4028-1-1.html</li>
    <li> Great product and taste much, much, much better than the original Burt&#x27;s.  Great product and seems to heal lips as well.  I&#x27;ve been using Carmex products for years and this by far is much better.</li>
    <li> I like everyting of grapefruit flavor .&lt;br /&gt;This set contain the other 3 kind of lip balm,so good!</li>
    <li> Very good, is what I want</li>
    <li> Smell is good, moist my lips</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s natual and smell so good.</li>
    <li> Awesome lip balm! I carry one with me all the time.</li>
    <li> AWESOME product!! I LOVE this lip balm.</li>
