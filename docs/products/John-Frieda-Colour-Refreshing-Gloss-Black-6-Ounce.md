### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>must say that I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, a great product!</li>
      <li>Still a great product though!</li>
      <li>After seeing how great my hair looked, she told me I should use it after every shampoo, which is not what the directions say, but I took her advice.</li>
      <li>It DOES make your hair look very healthy &amp; shiny, but that&#x27;s not all it should do.  </li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I have very fine, curly hair and this product defines my curls and makes my hair shine.</li>
      <li>Looking for more of a semi permanent hair gloss</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>The color I chose worked well with mine and gave it a significantly refreshing</li>
      <li>Fabulous stuff!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for 3 weeks now, and it&#x27;s good, easy to use, with a clean application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Works just like the old color glaze, and I&#x27;m SO happy I tried it.</li>
      <li>This stuff has saved my hair twice, taking it from orangey highlights to lovely cool ashy highlights.</li>
      <li>you are not sure which color to get, the John Frieda website has a compatibility list of most hair color makes and shades so that you can find the one that best matches yours.</li>
      <li>My hair is baby fine</li>
      <li>It does gloss it, and for me, helps keep a bit of the wave out, and gives it a smooth almost velvet texture.</li>
      <li>I decided to just let my hair grow out since I didn&#x27;t have a noticeable line of demarcation and the faded dye blends fairly well to my natural hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I did not see any results the first two times, if anything it made my hair more brassy.</li>
      <li>It rinses out clean and</li>
      <li>Welcome back old friend :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually pretty happy with my first experience that I purchased 2 more since amazon is selling the gloss for less(at that time) than any other stores.</li>
      <li>Really does a great job of removing brass from my blonde hair.</li>
      <li>I reall blob it on, so this bottle only lasts me two applications, I have waist length fine hair but LOTS of it, so would probably have a lot more applications for someone else.</li>
      <li>Given the subtlety, I can&#x27;t say with honesty that it&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
      <li>This product is very good and last a long time and does just what the bottle says it will and works 5+ Stars.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice and I am very sensitive to smells, and it dies sting a bit, but I&#x27;m completely hooked and planning to stock up!</li>
      <li>and I usually use a purple shampoo which works great.</li>
      <li>I have light blonde hair...not bleached but pretty light</li>
      <li>First of all though it isnt what Amazon says in the listing, that&#x27;s a mistake.</li>
      <li>though &#x27;shiny hair&#x27; wasn&#x27;t checked off my list during the first use, I would imagine that the gloss would work much better after several uses.</li>
      <li>coloring is a notoriously tricky business since there are so many different types and colors of hair.</li>
      <li>I tend to have more problems with hair growth and obvious roots, but my color certainly fades some too, so I was hoping this could help restore some life.  </li>
      <li>Not super high end for hair care, but for drugstore products, it&#x27;s pretty good</li>
      <li>(it always starts looking a little more lackluster just before my next coloring) and I liked that it did that.  </li>
      <li>To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure if this product is worth it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this works on all types of hair equally well, especially hair that is more resistant to processing, but I think it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this project to others!</li>
      <li>About 3 weeks after having my hair done I used it and it really did refresh my color.</li>
      <li>This product really helps hold colour in and refresh it with each use.</li>
      <li>does absolutely nothing</li>
      <li>I tend to go very brassy now</li>
      <li>I really wanted it to work as intended.</li>
      <li>Hair colorists always recommend the use of haircolor-preserving shampoos and conditioners as well as coming back between full colorings to have the color freshened up.</li>
      <li>(I have someone in London who does better for half the price</li>
      <li>I find that using it twice a week is more then enough, and at that rate, I expect this bottle to last for a while.</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>I use Olia hair color, which is unfortunately not on the list, but if you find that your color is missing from the list as well, there are enough other colors listed to give you a good idea of the right shade to choose.</li>
      <li>WOW, is all I can say it really cut the red out of my hair and fast.</li>
      <li>I had tried a Loreal prodcut that you have to mix and use gloves and leave on for half an hour which didnt work at all, and unred which misteriously made my hair more red.</li>
      <li>I was somewhat confused as to whether I was properly a cool blonde or a warm blonde</li>
      <li>But it didn&#x27;t really do much for the color, but I would definitely buy it again for the shine factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I deducted a star because even though the gloss made my hair soft, my hair wasn&#x27;t any shinier than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I apply in shower after shampoo but not comidtioner (after conditioner doesnt make sense as you want the hair shaft porous to take on as much of the product as possible</li>
      <li>This stuff wins hands down.</li>
      <li>This product does the latter very well, and in doing so, saves one quite a lot of money when compared to the cost of getting the similar treatments at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although it is slightly drying but worth it.</li>
      <li>I used in the shower as directed, and I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;m really getting much for results.  </li>
      <li>The John Frieda Precision Foam Hair Color is so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t come with all the mess you usually get.</li>

<li> When I saw the color of this I expected great results but was disappointed.</li>
<li> I usually like John Frieda reasonably well.  </li>
<li> Not bad, but not great either.</li>
<li> My hair became soft, manageable, and less frizzy.</li>
<li> that I&#x27;m coloring and highlighting to cover the grey.</li>
<li> (I tried both) and I can say that the results are subtle enough that it doesn&#x27;t much matter if you choose one or the other.</li>
<li> This last time it was really bad even though I spent $400 including tips at a top NY salon.</li>
<li> always seems that says before mt next appointment dark roots show up and this will help disguise them</li>
<li> and this product left my hair feeling slightly sticky even after thorough rinsing.</li>
<li> product definitely did add a little shine considering</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money trying to get my curly hair to shine.</li>
<li> caveat is that this product may cause stains, so be careful to thoroughly and immediately rinse any surfaces that it comes into contact with.</li>
<li> The refresh only lasted a few days, but reapplication refreshed again.</li>
<li> The medium brown part of my hair has gotten slightly red/brown and the dark blonde part has a tinge of orange.</li>
<li> The dyed medium brown got slightly darker and the dark blonde is less orange.</li>
<li> In other words, there may be some slight results, but if so, they&#x27;re so subtle that it&#x27;s hard for me to say for certain.  </li>
<li> Easy way to add luster and shine and pull just a l little brassiness from a bad coloring job.</li>
<li> It does cut down on brassiness but it didn&#x27;t add any shine or gloss.</li>
<li> I left the product on my hair for almost 20 mins ( I have very thick hair) and still nothing.</li>
<li> I was a bit skeptical trying this gloss, but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
<li> Anyway, this stuff both lightened slightly and took the brass out and what a shine!</li>
<li> I had when I was little!)</li>
<li> I think maybe I see some brightening, but it&#x27;s hard to tell.  </li>
<li> People who claim this is a messy product and stains their hands are not great at reading directions.  </li>

    <li> Not bad, but not great either. My hair is baby fine and this product left my hair feeling slightly sticky even after thorough rinsing. It does cut down on brassiness but it didn&#x27;t add any shine or gloss.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, curly hair and this product defines my curls and makes my hair shine. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money trying to get my curly hair to shine. This is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever tried that does it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product one morning, I passed my stylist on sidewalk on the way in to the salon. I was going in for eyelash tinting. She&#x27;d just cut my hair the day before. She stopped short and asked me what I&#x27;d done to my hair. She thought I&#x27;d used a curling wand and styled it. I had just air-dried. After seeing how great my hair looked, she told me I should use it after every shampoo, which is not what the directions say, but I took her advice. I love this product. I&#x27;ve just set up a recurring order so I never run out.</li>
    <li> Looking for more of a semi permanent hair gloss</li>
    <li> This will help you get from one coloring of your hair to the next always seems that says before mt next appointment dark roots show up and this will help disguise them</li>
    <li> People who claim this is a messy product and stains their hands are not great at reading directions.  Rinse your hands after application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for 3 weeks now, and it&#x27;s good, easy to use, with a clean application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it in the shower after shampooing and conditioning, and just keep my head out of the spray for 5 minutes while scrubbing and or shaving the rest of my body.  It rinses out clean and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dye or color hair.  It does gloss it, and for me, helps keep a bit of the wave out, and gives it a smooth almost velvet texture. I find that using it twice a week is more then enough, and at that rate, I expect this bottle to last for a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for years (to get that same blonde I had when I was little!) and I&#x27;ve never tried a product quite like this.  I usually like John Frieda reasonably well.  Not super high end for hair care, but for drugstore products, it&#x27;s pretty good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product definitely did add a little shine considering I was getting toward the end of the weeks (it always starts looking a little more lackluster just before my next coloring) and I liked that it did that.  But it didn&#x27;t really do much for the color, but I would definitely buy it again for the shine factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical trying this gloss, but was pleasantly surprised. About 3 weeks after having my hair done I used it and it really did refresh my color. The refresh only lasted a few days, but reapplication refreshed again. This product definitely extends the life of your hair color.</li>
    <li> I tend to go very brassy now that I&#x27;m coloring and highlighting to cover the grey. Easy way to add luster and shine and pull just a l little brassiness from a bad coloring job. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Hair colorists always recommend the use of haircolor-preserving shampoos and conditioners as well as coming back between full colorings to have the color freshened up. This product does the latter very well, and in doing so, saves one quite a lot of money when compared to the cost of getting the similar treatments at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not sure which color to get, the John Frieda website has a compatibility list of most hair color makes and shades so that you can find the one that best matches yours. I use Olia hair color, which is unfortunately not on the list, but if you find that your color is missing from the list as well, there are enough other colors listed to give you a good idea of the right shade to choose. The color I chose worked well with mine and gave it a significantly refreshing boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair coloring is a notoriously tricky business since there are so many different types and colors of hair. I don&#x27;t know if this works on all types of hair equally well, especially hair that is more resistant to processing, but I think it&#x27;s definitely worth a try. If it works for you, it will save you a bundle versus all of those in-between color salon visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat is that this product may cause stains, so be careful to thoroughly and immediately rinse any surfaces that it comes into contact with.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see how it adds any color, or even keeps it from fading like it claims.  It DOES make your hair look very healthy &amp; shiny, but that&#x27;s not all it should do.  I really wanted it to work as intended.</li>
    <li> The John Frieda Precision Foam Hair Color is so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t come with all the mess you usually get. I would highly recommend this project to others!</li>
    <li> My hair before gloss application:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this gloss in &amp;#34;Cool Brown&amp;#34; to help tone my brassy ombred hair. The medium brown part of my hair has gotten slightly red/brown and the dark blonde part has a tinge of orange. I decided to forgo with redyeing/touching up my hair since summer is a notorious season to turn people&#x27;s locks brassy as hell. I decided to just let my hair grow out since I didn&#x27;t have a noticeable line of demarcation and the faded dye blends fairly well to my natural hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair condition after gloss application:&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I&#x27;m impressed. The gloss made a difference after just one use. My hair became soft, manageable, and less frizzy. I noticed that the gloss tinted some of the brassiness away. The dyed medium brown got slightly darker and the dark blonde is less orange. I deducted a star because even though the gloss made my hair soft, my hair wasn&#x27;t any shinier than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though &#x27;shiny hair&#x27; wasn&#x27;t checked off my list during the first use, I would imagine that the gloss would work much better after several uses. I&#x27;m actually pretty happy with my first experience that I purchased 2 more since amazon is selling the gloss for less(at that time) than any other stores.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a week ago and have used it three times just as directed. I did not see any results the first two times, if anything it made my hair more brassy. I have light blonde hair...not bleached but pretty light and I usually use a purple shampoo which works great. When I saw the color of this I expected great results but was disappointed. I left the product on my hair for almost 20 mins ( I have very thick hair) and still nothing. I will probably throw out the rest of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Fabulous stuff! First of all though it isnt what Amazon says in the listing, that&#x27;s a mistake. It isnt foam and it isnt color but thats not the product&#x27;s fault. Read the bottle in the photo, that&#x27;s what youre buying. I have highlights and depending on where I get them done, they can come out VERY brassy (read orange) and not light enough. This last time it was really bad even though I spent $400 including tips at a top NY salon. (I have someone in London who does better for half the price but I didnt want to wait til I was back there). Anyway, this stuff both lightened slightly and took the brass out and what a shine! Although it is slightly drying but worth it. I apply in shower after shampoo but not comidtioner (after conditioner doesnt make sense as you want the hair shaft porous to take on as much of the product as possible I reall blob it on, so this bottle only lasts me two applications, I have waist length fine hair but LOTS of it, so would probably have a lot more applications for someone else. I put on a conditioning cap and leave for about 5-10 minutes then rinse ans condition. This stuff has saved my hair twice, taking it from orangey highlights to lovely cool ashy highlights. I had tried a Loreal prodcut that you have to mix and use gloves and leave on for half an hour which didnt work at all, and unred which misteriously made my hair more red. This stuff wins hands down. The smell is nice and I am very sensitive to smells, and it dies sting a bit, but I&#x27;m completely hooked and planning to stock up!</li>
    <li> does absolutely nothing</li>
    <li> This product really helps hold colour in and refresh it with each use. It doesn&#x27;t add colour though,as suggested, which is why I have four instead of five stars. Still a great product though!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Really does a great job of removing brass from my blonde hair.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure if this product is worth it.  This shampoo-in stuff is supposed to help extend the life of color.  I tend to have more problems with hair growth and obvious roots, but my color certainly fades some too, so I was hoping this could help restore some life.  I used in the shower as directed, and I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;m really getting much for results.  I think maybe I see some brightening, but it&#x27;s hard to tell.  In other words, there may be some slight results, but if so, they&#x27;re so subtle that it&#x27;s hard for me to say for certain.  Given the subtlety, I can&#x27;t say with honesty that it&#x27;s worth the money.  I was somewhat confused as to whether I was properly a cool blonde or a warm blonde (I tried both) and I can say that the results are subtle enough that it doesn&#x27;t much matter if you choose one or the other.</li>
    <li> WOW, is all I can say it really cut the red out of my hair and fast. This product is very good and last a long time and does just what the bottle says it will and works 5+ Stars.</li>
    <li> Works just like the old color glaze, and I&#x27;m SO happy I tried it. Welcome back old friend :)</li>
