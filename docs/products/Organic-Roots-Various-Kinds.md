      <li>maybe a light lemon scent???</li>
      <li>The 2nd day, my hair wasn&#x27;t as shiny, but it still looked great and was soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and my curls are frizz free</li>

      <li>I love the way it works on my natural hair!!!!</li>
      <li>Well I was on the hunt for a curl defining cream due to the fact that I wasn&#x27;t sure if using gel all the time was good for the hair.</li>

      <li>so my sis goot lucky</li>
      <li>but I got over that quickly.</li>
      <li>This product smells great and does provide immediate definition in natural curl texture on natural hair.  </li>
      <li>But it dissipates quickly</li>
      <li>I think I might try a different oil since grapeseed is so light, but I enjoyed having light bouncy curls all day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I went natural and I love this product.  My curls are so defined.  I would definitely recommend this to other people that are wearing their hair natural.</li>
    <li> I like the results I get with this product, the only complaint I have is that it makes hair a little tangle prone and creates a lot of volume (which isn&#x27;t always great with curls). I thought it was worth it though, because it left your hair so soft and defined. Until I saw that they have the Curl Boosting Jelly, OOOOOOOOOMMMMMGGGG. I put a little bit of the cream and spread it all over, then styled with the jelly and my hair came out PERFECT. I think the cream is great, but works better paired with something else.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from the drug store this past weekend. I have used it twice and my curls are frizz free and I notice slightly less shrinkage. I have 3C type curls and my strands are fine with medium density. I used this creme as the \\&quot;C\\&quot; in the LOC method of styling. I divided my hair into quarters, used my Denman only after the leave-in, and raked the oil and the creme through each section with my fingers. I used a tiny bit of deep treatment as a leave-in (Shea Moisture Deep Treatment), grapeseed mixed with a little jojoba oil, and then the Curls Unleashed Creme (let it air dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is hard to explain...maybe a light lemon scent??? But it dissipates quickly and I only smell my leave-in which is a light fresh scent. I don&#x27;t think is the creme is extremely moisturizing. I think I might try a different oil since grapeseed is so light, but I enjoyed having light bouncy curls all day. The 2nd day, my hair wasn&#x27;t as shiny, but it still looked great and was soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did leave \\&quot;hair boogers\\&quot; when my hair was wet...especially around the edges where I put a little eco styler gel over top, but no flaking once it dried a little. Not a huge issue since I don&#x27;t leave the house with my hair sopping wet. It was fine after I reached the very damp stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is a keeper for me! This is the first decent wash-n-go [well, 2nd since I have done 2 wash-n-go&#x27;s with this now ;)] I have achieved without using a ton of gel (which leaves my hair flat, crunchy, and wet-looking). My hair stayed nice all day, was very soft, and I was able to achieve pretty 2nd day hair without adding any additional products. As long as this continues to work, it will be a staple for my wash-n-go&#x27;s. I have not tried this with twist-outs or roller/rod sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will experiment with the products I layer this with to see if I can get better moisture retention, but other than that, GREAT RESULTS!</li>
    <li> I actually bought it for my hair but realized it is for ladies so my sis goot lucky and i hope she likes it!</li>
    <li> Boost natural curls. Love this stuff.  It&#x27;s not sticky feeling on my curls.</li>
    <li> This product did not give me the desired results will  not use again. When I initially saw the product I thought it might be the answer to very dry hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is Curley, not too thick, not too thin and just past my shoulder. I rub/smooth then scrunch a nice size dollop of this cream in my just washed, towel dried damp hair.  After my hair completely dries it is nice, shiny and full of curliness!</li>
    <li> I was so hesitant to try this line of products.  I didn&#x27;t think they would be good at all for some reason.  Boy, was I wrong!  I think this creme is my favorite over the boosting jelly.  I love the way it smells.  It has a light fresh creamy scent and it defines and shines my hair so well!  It does not leave flakes at all and I put a lot on my hair.  I have 3C/4A hair and this creme is definitely going to be a staple.  I applied it just after washing my hair without a leave-in and it took about 30 minutes to an hour to totally disappear in my hair (because of the amount I used), but the results were fabulous.  I love this stuff.  I really loved Dark &amp; Lovely&#x27;s curl defining creme too, but the results didn&#x27;t last more than one day and the product is flammable.  :o  This was well worth the purchase and it costs half as much as my other favorite, Kinky Curly.</li>
    <li> Well I was on the hunt for a curl defining cream due to the fact that I wasn&#x27;t sure if using gel all the time was good for the hair. (I literally big chopped last week) So I discovered this product. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure at all if I liked it and I knew for sure I HATED the smell but I got over that quickly. I discovered that pairing this with a leave in or just regular conditioner works well. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to maintain less frizz but as far as this product, I&#x27;m not giving up on it because it seemed to moisturize and hold for me.</li>
    <li> But don&#x27;t believe the \\&quot;you save price\\&quot;. Go to Walmart to Walgreens. This is a rip off. I made that mistake</li>
    <li> This product works great on my hair. It is a hit costly in comparison to other products I&#x27;ve used but is definitely worth the money as it lasts a long time and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I use after shampooing and conditioning with either Dove Quench or the Suave Professionals and once I add this in my hair it just gives my curls a shine and moisturized feeling that lasts for a nice amount of my day.&lt;br /&gt;I also Love the smell. The texture is weird cause it feels like a custard but that does not alter it&#x27;s effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a 3B curl pattern give this a try.</li>
    <li> This review is for the curling gel worked great on my hair which is pretty coarse 4b. Gave me instant waves and curls. I didn&#x27;t care for the curl creme it was very greasy</li>
    <li> It does curl your hair. I used it right out of the shower for a wash and go and it stayed moisturized. I used this with curlformers on my daughters hair, and it worked out great. her hair remained soft even with a little gel. It could smell a little better.</li>
    <li> My grade of hair didn&#x27;t respond to this product styling wise.  My hair is soft and fine and this product just made it look dry.</li>
    <li> When I first saw this product at a beauty supply in my neighborhood about 1-1/2 yrs ago, I wanted to try it but didn&#x27;t want to spend $16 for it.  The store owner gave me samples to try.  I used the samples for about a month and was so impressed with the results that I bought a couple of jars from Target when it went on sale.  I have thick, curly kinky hair that doesn&#x27;t respond well to most hair products.  This product, however, is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used on my natural hair.  Curls unleashed gives my huge 70&#x27;s afro so much life.  My curls are enhanced and my hair has a lot of shine.  People always stop and ask me what I use on my hair.  I tell them my hair regimen then tell them about Curls unleashed.  Someone posted that you could add olive oil, castor oil and other natural oils to make this product more effective.  This is a good idea!  I, on the other hand, use the liquid, oil, cream (aka LOC method) and this product truly helps to retain moisture.  Good job ORS. Curls unleashed is definitely a staple for me.  If you have thick, curly kinky, big hair try it!  Oh!.....I forgot to mention that a few ladies on other websites said this product didn&#x27;t make their hair curl.  Well, I don&#x27;t think it is designed to make hair curl or change hair texture.  Its main function is to enhance existing curls.</li>
    <li> Great hold for my hair and my daughter&#x27;s and we have different textures.</li>
    <li> Before I found this product my hair doing days were a fight and almost unbearable with my daughter. It helps moisturize and relax the curls so its not a huge battle! Worth a try for crazy tight curls!</li>
    <li> It was just aight... i liked the way it made my hair look when i applied and it was very moisturizing but i HATED the smell it smells like very strong flowers and something synthetic. It not a all natural product at all and the next day when i took my twists out my hair was a bit dry. Not better than Shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie the smell was pretty bad. Try if you&#x27;d like but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Supposed to help shine... it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Not supposed to cause shrinkage...it does.&lt;br /&gt;Not supposed to flake...it does, big time.&lt;br /&gt;Bought it at Walmart. The 3$ stuff worked better.</li>
    <li> This product is not organic at all. And it smells like chemicals. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> First let me say I read nearly every hair curling product review available on amazon.com and the more I read frankly the more confused I became - and even more intrigued. Nearly all reviews were about the results obtained for specific hair types - \\&quot;2a, 3b, 4c\\&quot;, etc. and I didn&#x27;t know what the heck everyone was talking about because I didn&#x27;t know my \\&quot;hair type\\&quot; from a hole in the ground. I eventually stumbled across a section of \\&quot;Questions &amp; Answers\\&quot; that led to another website - naturallycurly.com (who knew such a thing was in existence). Naturallycurly has an abundance of everything hair info and also reviews and sells hair care products for every hair style imaginable. More importantly the site has a quiz on the first page with a series of questions to help determine hair type. It&#x27;s important to know your hair&#x27;s \\&quot;type\\&quot; because it makes it alot easier to identify the products that work best for your hair - especially the curling products because most are specific to the hair type. My hair type is \\&quot;4b\\&quot; which means the natural state of my African American hair is thick, has a tight curl pattern and tends to be coarse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the product:  There are a number of positive reviews for the Curls Unleashed product - most of them swearing the product worked well for their hair type and some reviewers also listed the potpourri of other products they used to get even better results. I also noticed references to \\&quot;co-washing\\&quot; only it wasn&#x27;t exactly explained so I haven&#x27;t the foggiest idea what it means to \\&quot;co-wash\\&quot; the hair (though I&#x27;m venturing a guess it refers to washing the hair twice to make sure any other product&#x27;s residue is completely removed?). Some reviewers stated they experienced flakiness, dryness, and \\&quot;crunchiness\\&quot; with the product (scary) and to be fair the reviews mostly appeared to be written by 1st time users.&lt;br /&gt;ri&lt;br /&gt;Sooo . . . to make a long story short: I washed and \\&quot;co-washed\\&quot; my hair and conditioned it (recommended) and lightly toweled dryto remove excess water (otherwise it drips down your back). Next I parted my hair in four sections (down the middle and across from ear-to-ear) and combed it through with a wide-tooth comb to remove kinks. I worked on one parted section of hair at a time and applied a scoop of approximately 2 tablespoons of the Curls Unleashed product and starting at the roots of my hair worked the product through to the ends of my hair then \\&quot;scrunched\\&quot; small sections at a time after I coated it with product. \\&quot;Scrunching\\&quot; the hair is basically taking a small section of hair and grabbing from the root and squeezing the hair with the fingers so the hair is pressed tightly into the palm of the hand for a few seconds then releasing the hair. Scrunching works best if you do the same section over and over several times before moving on to another small section. After I applied the product to my entire head I started scrunching randomly all over my head - by then my hair was completely (though moderately) covered with the product. For a split second I thought I&#x27;d made a big mistake - I looked a hot mess! - and thought I must&#x27;ve been crazy to believe coating my natural hair with globs of goop would turn it into a head full of curls - then I noticed the product was being absorbed by my hair. I kept scrunching and within 5-10 minutes (at this point I should add I also followed the advice of one reviewer and applied a moderate amount of jojoba &amp; sesame oils to my hair - more later. When I saw a section of hair that looked frizzy I applied a bit more product and scrunched - and viola! My hair started curling and I began to see glistening (dang) and loosely but defined spiraled curls emerging! I stood in front of the mirror and kept up the scrunching and working the hair all over my head. CURLS - I GOT CURLS - ACTUAL CURLS! One thing though - I did NOT need to use any extra oil - and I would not recommend using anything else except Curls Unleashed however things might turn out better if you apply the leave-in conditioner during the styling phase because after my hair dried completely it was a bit on the dry side. My results were very little hair shrinkage and I got spirally tight curls and was able to come up with a pretty decent-looking style just using my fingers to arrange the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to be clear though the results will not resemble \\&quot;Shirley Temple\\&quot; curls but you will not be disappointed in the least because this product actually works quite well on 4b hair in the natural state - transforming just washed frizz into a mass of well-defined springy, spirally curls that look like you used curling rods to produce the look. I should also add I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;twist\\&quot; or braid or do anything else except apply the product to very damp hair and scrunch until my hair absorbed the product and using my fingers to scrunch my hair repeatedly in small sections until it began curling. After my hair dried completely the curls became tighter, springier and more defined and there was no flaking or \\&quot;crunchiness\\&quot; with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS STUFF! I didn&#x27;t exactly get perfect results the first time - I probably used more product than was required and I added extra oils to my hair I didn&#x27;t need - and regret but most people reported their results were less than perfect the first time as well so - the important thing is I am pleased with the results I received and very impressed with this product. And, judging by other reviewer comments, the first time is mostly a learning curve and I have to wholeheartedly agree with that! A big plus for me is not only did I notice that Curls Unleashed product works well - OTHER PEOPLE NOTICED AND I GOT COMPLIMENTS ON MY CURLY HAIR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho - I wanted a stylish break from perming and a more natural look that is also easy to manage and I can honestly point to Curls Unleashed as the product and the solution I was looking for. Even more important - For me (horns blaring) Curls Unleashed is my very own Holy Grail (borrowed but true)! I will definitely buy this product again and again and again and again.</li>
    <li> My hair loves this creme and my twist outs are exactly the way they should look. It leaves hair soft and well set with no flaky residue. It&#x27;s not greasy in texture. My hair is in the 4 range.</li>
    <li> I liked the ingredients and so I wanted to see how the cream would work on my permed hair. My hair falls beyond my shoulders and so I used a teaspoon of the cream to cover my scalp and hair.  It made my hair stiff.  It didn&#x27;t really give any shine to my hair.  I tried it after I washed my hair.  I also tried it another time on my hair when it was completely dry.  The coconut oil ( listed as the second ingredient on the jar) probably had something to do with the stiffness in my hair. Based on my experience, Coconut oil works best in warm weather and hardens or becomes stiff in cool and cold weather. I thought the additional ingredients in the cream would soften the effects of the coconut oil.  This cream may work best on natural hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF! I&#x27;ve just recently started to embrace my curls, and so I decided to give this a try because it&#x27;s organic. I have 3b curls. After cowashing my hair with lottssss of conditioner, and using a wide tooth comb to comb in leave in conditioner, I then finger comb this through my hair. It makes my curls look AMAZING! I don&#x27;t even have to use hairspray for it to keep it&#x27;s hold. I will never try to force my curls to be anything less than what they are again! As far as the smell, it does not bother me at all. It&#x27;s a light lemony scent, if anything. 3b curly girls... this product just might be your new friend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third jar of this stuff.  My curls are really loose, but they tend to frizz really bad and this stuff makes them look so soft and the frizz is totally gone.  I do have to use this with another product that is pricey and I&#x27;ve tried other products since I can&#x27;t seem to find this anymore, but nothing does as good of a job with the frizz as this stuff.  Thank goodness Amazon has it!</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to try something so new with a price above $10, but ORS has a very good reputation (at least with me).  I used it on my daughters 4a/3c hair and it worked really, really well.  It defined her curls, had a lovely shine, and no shrinkage.  Her hair looked very natural and just really pretty.  It helped detangle her hair as well.  After applying it I could just run my fingers through her hair, prior to application my fingers just got caught in the tangles.  I think this one is going to become a staple here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a YouTube jobs lately. I&#x27;ve cone out of a funk period and am now attempting to re-energerize my look. I first focused on make up, then wanted to so something with my hair as i have had a very bad choppy cut after moving from NJ to SC! I remembered a time when I had beautiful curls that seemed to.disappear with age. Nothing I.used ever seemed to give me back my.curls or maintain them. After viewing a dozen natural hair care vids I went to target looking for Shea Moisture Thickening Milk as I am a 3b whos been move on the straight side for years. As I couldnt find the product used in the video I settled for this product Curls Unleashed. That night I washed, deep conditioned my hair for 2hrs or more then applied this product as I flat twisted my hair tied it up and went to bed. I was very surprised that my straight hair not only smelled great but was shiny, and had the nicest spiral pattern due to the flat twist. I would love to have thicker hair as I once did as a child but that might never happen. I maintained my curls all week by reapplying this light pudding througout my do abd tying it up with a satin headwrap. Today after washing and deep conditioning my hair for an hour I appled Curls Unleashed to my wet hair and let it air dry. I scrunched my hair alil to shape my curls and they are just as beautiful as they were when I flat twisted my hair. This is the old me but better. I love the shine and boune I get. The fact that I can.wear my curls longer and not have a problem with frizz is amazing. This is definitely a go to product for me. My hair doesnt feel weighed down and I apply the product as much as needed to combat any dryness or fly aways. Love This</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t define my transitioning hair nor did define my sisters all natural 4a hair.  Now that I am all natural I will give it one more shot but I am hesitant because before in both mine and my sisters hair it removed moisture. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it two stars is because I have used the jar about 6 times when I had arm pit length transitioning hair and 1 time on my sisters bra strap length hair and I am still only half way down on the jar.  I am very heavy handed but this product goes a long way.  Also it is the absolute BEST SMELLING PRODUCT EVER.  I have never smelled anything this amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months now and it&#x27;s perfect! It provides a soft hold and stretches my coils/ curls. I&#x27;ve never been into gel because I like my natural hair to look and feel natural... not hard and crunchy. I use it while my hair is wet after a co-wash and I seal it with (Design Essentials) daily moisturizing lotion. It gives me just the look and feel I desire. Never had flaking though.</li>
    <li> I have 4 b hair type, after wash I apply this product on my natural hair and oh boy such softness, great product. This is part of my regimen.</li>
    <li> It does make your hair very Curley but dries it out too much.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works so good on my curly hair.</li>
    <li> This cream was purchased for my  biracial daughter who has mixed textured hair. I needed a light-weight moisturizing cream and I have been slightly disappointed with this. The cream is rather heavy and does not dissolve easily into my daughters hair. It needs to be rubbed into my palms and then brushed in and it still leaves a white residue at times. On the plus side it smells nice but I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> My hair is curly and wavy and frizzy.  My hair,when straight, comes to the middle of my back. When curly and using OTHER expensive name brand products, it SHRINKS to my chin. Using this product my hair doesnt frizz AND hangs past my shoulders. I love it! My hair doesnt look dry even after a day or two! Worth EVERY penny of the money i spent!</li>
    <li> My daughter has 4c hair &amp; this works wonders on her twist out. I love it. It smells good and feels so soft</li>
    <li> It smells good!!!  I love the way it works on my natural hair!!!! would buy it again :D&lt;br /&gt;You don´t need a lot of producto to get the results!!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend mixing this product with olive oil, castor oil and aloe vera juice. Using an empty container,  mix half of this container with; 2 tbsp of olive oil; 2 tbsp of castor oil; and 4 oz of aloe vera juice(not gel). Combine gradually while stirring with a spoon. Mixture will still be emulsified and creamy.  Castor oil is key, but olive oil can be interchanged with other oils....golden sesame, jojoba, sweet almond,,etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this and get the most beautiful, frizz free, well defined curls with a lovely sheen. Good for \\&quot;all\\&quot; natural hair types. Including what is called 4C. The Z is a sharply angled curl, but still a curl. This recipe will loosen the pattern and define the curls,  minus the frizz. I like and use the Curls Unleashed, but any creamy, buttery curling creme can be used as a base. The key is the aloe vera juice in combination with the buttery creme and oils.  Aloe vera lowers the PH balance.  Our natural hair responds very well to a lower PH. Most hair care products typically have higher a PH than is optimal for us. Lower that PH and add some good oil to this buttery product and watch your hair do what it naturally does best....Curl.  Great for wash and go&#x27;s, and other styles as well. I promise you will be pleased with results. If you think your hair won&#x27;t curl well....try this.  If your hair curls well aready...it will curl better and smoother with this recipe.  There is no need to purchase a lot of different products for curl definition.  This really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I like Curls Unleashed and trust the quality of ORS.  This is very rich, creamy, and buttery. The scent is pleasant. I tried using Curls Unleashed without the oil and aloe. \\&quot;Much better\\&quot; result are achieved using this as a base for the aloe and oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply to my wet hair after shampooing and conditoning. Let dry naturally. The hair will dry with beautiful long lasting curls and sheen.  In between shampoos, I spritz my hair with water and apply as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine is very similar to a recipe  I got from a youtube channel. I can&#x27;t remember the young womans&#x27; name, but she deserves all credit for creating this recipe. I tweaked it for me and you may do the same for yourself. She understands the science of our hair. She can better explain why lower PH levels are so important for our hair&#x27;s beauty  . As soon as I find her channel again, I will update my review with her info. so you can visit her on youtube.  She has lots of videos with good information on hair and hair care for people who wear their hair naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, check out the Cherry Lola treatment on youtube. That is a wash out conditioner  that you can make in your kitchen.  It balances the protein in our hair. The  results are similar to a short term Brazilian Blowout, without the heat, chemicals, and artificial ingredients. Just type Cherry Lola in the youtube search bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Kimmaytube is her youtube channel.  Last note, anyone looking for a style change up, with less defined curls, use Sta Sof Fro Comb Out Conditioning spray. It can be used for detangling, before applying curling cremes or gels, too.  Curls will still activate. It&#x27;t what we used for our 70&#x27;s precision cut Afos. Everything cycles. Natural hair is returning with an updated spin. Today the unstructured afro and curl defined natural hair is what&#x27;s popular. Not to worry, unless the barber is old school, most don&#x27;t even know how to cut a precison Afro. My son is a barber and he can&#x27;t do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our 70&#x27;s  routine was regular precison trims, shampoo, condition, Sta Sof Fro Comb Out, pick the hair, and finshed with Afro sheen oil spray.  Really simple. Hair will dry stretched if picked out.  I watched a youtube video, 10 minutes of explaining why she couldn&#x27;t possibly wear an afro because her hair would matte into one big ball of tangles.  I had to smile.  The Sta Sof Fro will stretch the most tightly curled hair, provide sustained ease in detangling, add moisture, conditioning, softness, and a nice sheen.  We used the Sta Sof Fro in conjunction with an oil sheen and our afros were easy to care for and beautiful.  Just rent  Shaft, Foxy Brown, Cleopatra Jones or watch an old episode of Soul Train. You&#x27;ll see how beautiful our &#x27;Fros were.  We didn&#x27;t waste time polarizing our hair into \\&quot;type categories\\&quot; either.  Was that really started by Oprah&#x27;s hairdresser?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sta sof Fro is still on the market. The formula and packaging are the same. It&#x27;s not widely known anymore, but it is still the best detangling conditioner on the market. I wish more natural wearers of today knew this.  Detangling hair can become easy.  Using will eliminate breakage due to dryness and tangles. We went \\&quot;Black and Proud\\&quot; as a Nation. Afros crossed all socioecononic groups and generations. Momma, daddy, grandmomma, children,  politicians, celebrities and the whino on the street wore Afros. At that time, Sta Sof Fro and Afro Sheen were produced by Black owned companies. We made &#x27;em rich and they produced quality products for us.re, conditioning, softness, and a nice sheen.

    <li> Unfortunately, my hair still feels pretty rough afterwards.  All it does for me is leave a waxy residue. I would even accept waxy residue if it made my hair soft and manageable. Also there&#x27;s something about the smell that I just don&#x27;t like.  I put it on and then had to wash it out because I personally can&#x27;t take it.  If anyone else loves this product, I&#x27;m sorry, but the smell just made me a wee bit nauseous. I wasted my money. bye!!</li>
    <li> I actually use this when I press my hair out! Yes, that&#x27;s the opposite of its intended use. But it smooths out my hair and absorbs the heat of my flat iron.  Since I started using this product (along with a leave-in therma conditioner), I have had a lot less damage to my thick, thick hair! I highly recommend it for curly or straight natural girls.</li>
    <li> I use this product as a \\&quot;custard\\&quot; for two strand twists.  I apply this to washed, conditioned wet hair after I put a moisturizer.  I twist sections, air or bonnet dry my hair and end up with well defined twists.  There is no flaking.  This rivals Ms. Jessie&#x27;s but the Ms. Jessie&#x27;s product produces more shine, plumper twists with elongation.  The availability and pricing make this product convenient and I will continue to use it for twists, braids and corn rows on wet hair.  The twists outs are unbelievable!</li>
    <li> This works just as well for a wash and go on my hair as it does for twists that I pin up an untwist when dry, for more sophisticated curls.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and does provide immediate definition in natural curl texture on natural hair.  However, I strongly agree with previous review that says use as a base.  I do not recommend for dry hair as I found the level of alcohol higher than the lighter oils in it.  I found my hair much more dry after 20 minutes of application.  This product was used on short, natural hair.</li>
    <li> I paid 16 dollars for this product from the store, which was advertised on the label as not leaving flakes. I knew I should have stayed with what was tried and true (Taliah Waajid Curly Curl Creme) and costs half the price at 8 dollars and does exactly what it says it does. The first time I used this Curls Unleashed product, I washed my hair and then, as I do with my moisturizers, applied this to my hair while damp, expecting moisture, shine, and defined beautiful bouncy coils (I am a type 4abc hair). I immediately saw millions of tiny white blobs stuck all throughout the areas in my hair that I had applied this stuff! So I thought perhaps it was because my hair was wet, and that I could wash the flakes out. They did not wash out, but only got WORSE. This stuff flakes up like crazy when it touches moisture and wetness. I don&#x27;t understand how people use it in their hair when it flakes up like this, and is very embarrassing when I wear black. This is NOT good for wash-n-go at all and there are no directions on the label warning not to use on hair that is not as dry as the Sahara desert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have washed - even used shampoo, and I usually only use shampoo twice a month but use conditioner instead about 3-4 times a week - my hair THREE times since making the mistake of using this, and the flakes are worse than ever before. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to have to do to get my hair clean and free of the flakes I got from using this terrible, terribly overpriced and falsely advertised product. They get in my eyes, on my face, clothes, bed sheets, everywhere, and I am thinking of suing them for false advertising and what using this is causing me. NEVER had a problem like this with any hair product I have ever used in my entire life, and will NEVER purchase this nor recommend it to anyone. But I will recommend Taliah Waajid&#x27;s Curly Curl Creme, instead.</li>
    <li> My hair type is a combination of 4c &amp; 4b and since I had perm damaged from about 2 years ago. I have been on a quest to find what I could do to get my hair to regrown back, especially in the crown area.  This product is very moisturing for my hair. I applied it while my hair is damped, it does stay white, until it dries later. But at the end of the day, my hair is still curl and quite soft. The next day I do it all over again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but dries flaky on the hair. I would nou purchase again. Also seems to dry out the hair.</li>
