<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t come with super clips as described, only wire clips but they work fine. I like the size of the rollers.</li>
    <li> The best rollers ever!... heats up in seconds. Love the body and staying power all day long!</li>
    <li> Clips leave very obvious marks in hair. Also, instruction manual says red light on front of set will turn clear when rollers are finished heating up.  Light stayed red and never turned transparent each of the 3 times I used these.</li>
    <li> I just have to say they heat up quickly, but DON&#x27;T get very hot.  And the clips that hold the rollers in leave lines in your hair.  I am disappointed and would not recommend them to anyone else....</li>
    <li> Love it! I have long thick hair and these hot roller really do the trick for big volume and soft curls.  The clips are the best. They do not leave creases or funky waves in your hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble curling my hair (long, straight, light-medium weight) so I was really curious to see how hot rollers would work in my hair. The set I got came quickly and in great shape but these just don&#x27;t work for me. I read through the directions and tried to follow tutorials online but still didn&#x27;t get much of a curl after leaving these in for 30 mins. I tried a few times but didn&#x27;t get any good curls so I&#x27;m returning them. They might work great for some but not for me.</li>
    <li> Works good - I only miss a button to make it off</li>
    <li> My only complaint would be the clips to hold these. I wish they weren&#x27;t such chinsy plastic, there are so many tiny little fingers that they flex and bend easy. They haven&#x27;t broken but they aren&#x27;t very gentle on your hair. I think a few thicker ones, that didn&#x27;t flex and bend, might be better, or even the single large metal pins that some rollers use. These ones will leave a mark on your hair, if you don&#x27;t place them just so and since they are so thin and flexible they can move even if you do place them properly. Still really like the curlers and the marks go away relatively quickly once you take the rollers out and leave your hair down.</li>
    <li> My thick blond hair resists to stay curled up by these for longer than an hour, regardless of the hair product I use to secure the locks.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Gets nice and hot quickly! Held curls all day with just a little extra spray. I have a shoulder length bob.</li>
    <li> works well. The new clips on these rollers work so much better than the old little wire ones. Gets nice and hot..</li>
    <li> This had clips instead of wire picks.  I don&#x27;t like the clips, as they don&#x27;t hold the curlers in place.  The other irritating thing is that there is no on/off button.  You have to plug it in to start it &amp; unplug it to stop it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m able to extend time between shampoos by reviving my &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; with these rollers---and to cahnge my look as well.</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight hair that does nothing but lay flat. I ordered these to see if I could give myself a quick way to add body to my boring hair.  I do not have the time or patience to do anything fancy. These heat fast and it took me o time to put in the rollers. By the time I was done getting ready (and I must mention I don&#x27;t do a lot to get ready), they were ready to come out and voila!  I had body!  Lasted fairly long considering I didn&#x27;t put any product in my hair before or after the rollers went in. Very happy!</li>
    <li> I had an older set of Conair heated rollers and wanted a new set.  This is a great set for the price.  I received package really fast too.</li>
    <li> I bought these curlers with high hopes that I could curl all of my hair quickly without having to sit there holding a curling iron.  I was so disappointed in this set.  Before these I had been using a really old set that my mom had from probably the 70s.  I was excited to get these new curlers thinking the technology had probably improved significantly.  Nope.  These curlers didn&#x27;t get close to getting hot enough to curl my hair.  I followed all of the directions and even let them get hot for significantly longer than the instructions stated to.  I left them in my hair for the recommended length of time and perhaps a while longer as I got ready.  I took them out and.... no curls.  Just a wimpy little flip at the end of my hair that added some volume which was not what I wanted.  My hair already has plenty of volume, I wanted curls.  When all was said and done my hair looked just like the girl on the curler box.  I remember thinking when I first opened the curlers, \\&quot;I hope that my hair turns out looking better than her&#x27;s when I&#x27;m done.\\&quot;  LOL That is exactly how it ended up looking.  Plenty of volume, no curls to be seen.  So I guess if you are looking for something to add volume to your hair only this product might work for you.  But it claims to be able to curl your hair and the curlers don&#x27;t get close to hot enough to be able to do that.  I returned them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say about these rollers because I never got to use the rollers to their full potential. The reason why is because the clips in these rollers suck. The clips are too small and are no where useful to this product. If you have straight, thick, and Asian hair like I do. Do not get this, the clips are too frustrating to figure out this defective product</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift for a friend who LOVES them!!</li>
    <li> These are super awesome and make curling your hair really easy! I straighten my wavy hair first and then put the curlers in. They heat up really fast - the instruction manual says to wait for the red light to turn white. There is a red light to indicate that it is plugged in that never turns white (i waited like an hour). There is actually a little red dot on one of the larger black curlers and you have to wait for that red dot to turn white which only takes like 2 minutes. The clamps did not crimp my hair at all, but I seen where some people were asking where you can buy the metal pins instead of using the plastic clamps and they couldn&#x27;t find it - it is on the first page of the instruction manual with what the model number is that you need and how much it costs.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly, but cools much too quick.&lt;br /&gt;Clasps leave an undesirable crease in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like this product but it broke after 20 months of occasional use. The heating element stopped working. Not a bad lifecycle for the price but I&#x27;d prefer something more robust!</li>
    <li> SUCKS.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this. It&#x27;s definitely not for people with hair longer than your shoulders and the clips don&#x27;t even hold the rollers in place. Very disappointed I&#x27;ll just stick to my hair curler from now on.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy wave/curly thick hair. These hot rollers really work for my hair type. makes beautiful curls. not too tight. gets very hot, and the curl stays in my hair a long time. the only downside to these hot rollers is that I have thick frizzy hair so my hair does NOT need volume and these hot rollers DO give alot of volume to your hair.</li>
    <li> Like these rollers very much, the body that they add to my medium length lasts all day.  My only complaint is that the clips don&#x27;t hold the rollers securely in place.</li>
    <li> I saw others comment in reviews that the clips cause crimps where you affix them over the rollers.  I have fine hair and this definitely is the case for me.  Unfortunately, I cannot use this product because of this.</li>
    <li> Great purchase. Heat fast, perfect number of rollers, soft, waves/curls. The clips do need to be improved though.  They work, but not well. I do take the rollers when I travel, but they do take up a lot of room in my suitcase.</li>
    <li> These rollers produce good results for my thick curly hair. They do not get as hot I would like though.</li>
    <li> It heats up quickly and gives me the curls I wanted.  Beats the curling iron hands-down.  No more frizzy ends.</li>
    <li> Right at the top where you put the clip and its not pretty. And the first time I plugged it, it emits smoke and weird burnt smell, I was skeptical to use it but the smoke and smell went away.it gives a very light body but didn&#x27;t last long, I have a medium length and wavy hair. I thought of returning it but decided to keep it as I don&#x27;t want to inconvenience myself., it may serve it&#x27;s purpose some other time or I could use it on my daughter when she goes to school parties and ceremonies.</li>
    <li> They rollers created volume and body, but I was disappointed that thet did not produce the &amp;#34;long loose curls&amp;#34; look that I was hoping for. I will update this review if I find a way to get better results from them.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used hot rollers in years.  I enjoyed the clips and the soft curls it gave me.  The price was fair too!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a 20 year old version that my wife had that finally died. She wanted a version that had only the large and larger rollers (no small ones) which this one fits the bill. The only reason this gets 4/5 stars is because the old one had a self retracting cord into its body and this one does not.</li>
    <li> The 12 rollers are enough for my fine hair.  This set comes with super clips that hold your hair in place but  leaves marks in your hair.  There isn&#x27;t anywhere to store the clips except on the original cardboard strip that the clips came on.  There is one roller that has a dot that changes color when the hair setter is ready.  The curls don&#x27;t last very long even with a lot of hair spray.</li>
    <li> Love these! Leaves my hair shiney and healthy looking!</li>
    <li> Heats up in an instant...no on off switch..just plugin&lt;br /&gt;2 Sizes in rollers great selection</li>
    <li> These work very well and especially if you use a setting lotion. They do a fabulous job and heat up quickly. All I want to say is that the curls you&#x27;ll be left with will likely be more like waves, with the final brushed-out effect looking more like a voluminous blowout than spiral curls. I wear my hair in a sort of retro &#x27;60s way, so the volume these rollers give me is ideal for teasing my hair. However, your hair is going to look really &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; and probably voluminous and fluffy, so if you want tighter curls get a smaller size roller or hot sticks.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers.  They give my long hair so much body instead of the more tight curls of smaller rollers.</li>
    <li> gives my hair great body and slight turn under without curls.  love these rollers for my hair style.  I did find rolling the top row up prevents hair creases from the clips.</li>
    <li> They were nice I just thought I ordered the ones that weren&#x27;t flocked.Amazon refunded  my money fast . Very happy with them</li>
    <li> They rollers work great and the clips are very good for fastening my long thick hair.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and curls quickly. Could use more rollers.</li>
    <li> Meh. I&#x27;m not super impressed. The curls can be pretty after you practice for a while....but man oh man, there are some terrible marks left by these grabber thingies. Not sure what they were thinking there but if you roll TOWARD your face you won&#x27;t get marks as bad on our hair.</li>
    <li> I finally got these in the mail today! I will say they work best with air dried hair. When you put them in you want to spray your hair with hair spray and brush it through and then put the rollers in. I have very thick hair and curling it normally barely even works for me and i got nice full curls with these (after running my fingers through the curls). I would recommend buying the clips for these because the ones that come with the set leave dents in your hair!</li>
    <li> The product itself is great.  The curlers heat up fast but I would prefer an on/off switch which it doesn&#x27;t have.  It did give my hair lots of curl and body.  I have long thick hair and the rollers glided on smoothly.  I don&#x27;t like the clips.  I will purchase better ones.  The clips leave indents where you put them and I can see them breaking easily.  I had to use a flat iron to get the indents out of my hair.  Overall, I will use them but will buy new clips.</li>
    <li> I like these rollers because I AM NOT very good at using a curling iron.  I wanted a full look without the curl.  These curlers provide that.  The only down side is that the curlers get really hot and burn my scalp.  I have very fine hair, I guess that&#x27;s why.  All and all, if you want a full straight looking &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;, these are for you.  I set my hair and by the time I put my make-up on, I take them out and I&#x27;m ready to go!</li>
    <li> The first time I tried these my hair was really clean. I use BioSilk shampoo &amp; conditioner, then I spray 12 Benefits Healthy Hair Treatment (SO AMAZING), brush my hair, and let it air dry. The next morning I used these curlers. I left them in for the longest time so that the curls would be tight curls and they would relax throughout the day. Well that was wishful thinking because after about 20 minutes (after I took the curlers out) my hair was just plain wavy. So I thought my hair was just too clean. So the next time I tried it I washed my hair exactly the same &amp; even used my hair treatment again but I also used mousse in my hair thinking it would make the curls stick. NOPE. Same thing happened. SO, the THIRD time I attempted to do my hair I used my same shampoo &amp; conditioner routine but DID NOT put my hair treatment in, instead I used some hair wax and let my hair dry. That still didn&#x27;t make the curls stay. I do have fine hair but my hair can last with curls all day if I use my straightener or curling wand. I really wanted to use curlers to make my morning routine more simple but it has just become more frustrating. I don&#x27;t think the velvety coating on these rollers is a good idea for my thin hair I think that&#x27;s why my hair won&#x27;t stay curled? Unfortunately, I will be returning these. I did like the clips that came with these rollers though. I know some people mentioned it leaves marks in your hair but I found out, by my trial and errors, that if you kind of brush your hair with the clip when you are putting it on the roller (after you have already rolled up your hair) that you don&#x27;t get the marks in your hair. Worked for me anyway.</li>
    <li> Trust the reviews! Waste of money. The clips that keep the rollers in your hair also leave marks/kinks that totally ruin your hair. Don&#x27;t buy this. I&#x27;m trying to come up with ideas on how I can keep the rollers in my hair without using the clips that come with it. So disappointing.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and so easy to use.  Wish the rollers were lighter.....but I cannot live without this.  Highly recommended! :-)</li>
    <li> It works quite well.  Clips are easy to put on rollers, holds well, comfortable, curls nicely but the clips are stored separately and take up some room.</li>
    <li> Love my heated rollers ! Great price and shipping was easy peasy !</li>
    <li> Frat product for Sammy a thiny hair</li>
    <li> Our daughter loved them. she was thrilled at the number of curlers and the large clips.</li>
    <li> I wish they had the metal &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shaped hair pins to secure the rollers on my hair.  The clips kinda leave crinkles in my hair, but eventually straighten out.  I have really long straight hair(almost down to my waist and hot curlers are easier that curling iron).  These work great, and get the job done... but I do wish they had something other that the plastic clips to keep them in place. Also, I don&#x27;t feel like they get as Hot as my other set of conair curlers (the ones with the ridges and metal &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shaped pins to keep them in place) Altogether, yes I would suggest these to a friend.  They work fine.</li>
    <li> These are great. Very easy to use and the curls come out very flowy</li>
    <li> like the color, case itself is a little slick but excellent value for a cell case, I will order again.</li>
    <li> How cheap can China get???  That is where this is made, and guess what?  They took away the on/off switch on the front like the older models all had!  This means you have to physically unplug the  unit after using, and when you plan to use, you have to find the cord and plug in in all over again.  What was that feature, maybe 15 cents - for the manufacturer to keep this as it was on the original unit?  Unit works o.k., but every time I use it I get p.o.&#x27;d that I am fumbling around just trying to turn it on.  Also, the new clips are all right, except they are made out of such a cheap, friable plastic, that the little individual teeth bed and break off.</li>
    <li> Good old fashioned hot roller hair is much less work than a curling iron!  Roll it up, put on makeup relax and pick out clothes, remove rollers, toss head around like a shampoo commercial - BAM gorgeous!</li>
    <li> Heated up very quickly.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers, but the clips, as others have said, will leave creases in your hair. I MUST find normal wire clips that are Jumbo (haven&#x27;t found yet) or clips without &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; so I can actually use these!!</li>
    <li> I have been using these curlers for years and love them until I ordered them from Amazon where they only came with the \\&quot;super clips\\&quot; which are plastic and worthless to hold thick hair.  I did speak to Conair corporate and they said the set is suppose to come with both the wire and plastic and agreed to send me the wire clips for free.  Once I get the wire clips all will be good.  They are great curlers with the right clips.    1-22-2015  Update on the wire clips.  I was originally told by Conair 7-10 business days but have yet to receive them.  Called today and was told they are on backorder and it could be a number of weeks before I receive them so if you use the wire clips like me you are out of luck for now.  I&#x27;m looking to buy a new set of curlers because I really need them now.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Just didnt heat up enough to really curl my hair (its fairly long and fine)</li>
    <li> These heat up extremely quickly but are not uncomfortable to handle. An older set I had made out of plastic were practically untouchable when hot. I have a little longer than shoulder length medium fine hair, and a lot of it. These curlers give me a lot of nice volume without making it too curly or obvious. They also add shine. The set is small enough to be left on my bathroom counter without taking up the entire space. I think curlers are really hair specific, so maybe the other reviewer needs something a little more heavy duty. I&#x27;ve also found that blasting the curlers with my hair dryer on the cool setting right before removing them helps to set them. I will say that if you are looking for defined curls, this set is probably not for you.</li>
    <li> These are great for my medium length mane o&#x27; hair. The first few times the curls looked a little childish, but with some practice I figured the system out. I have lots of really fine hair, and with a little hairspray these curls hold a long time. The only bad part are those dastardly clips! I don&#x27;t know what kind of sorcerers are capable of using the clips that come with this *without* getting big dents in their hair. The dents really make the top of each curl look weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have accepted that I will never have such magical hair-related powers. I contacted Conair customer support with my issues (claw clips, bah!), asked if they could help a sister out by sending some classic roller clips, and included my mailing address. Now they are mailing me some of the good ol&#x27; &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shaped wire clip majigs. The new clips are supposed to take 10-12 business days to arrive after you hear from them (and they took awhile to respond to my email) but the clips are free. Huzzah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers to good bouncy curly hair days!</li>
    <li> I bought these because of the &amp;#34;xtreme&amp;#34; heat advertisement.  Finally, one that really gets HOT.  The curlers are large and good for my very long hair. There is no on/off switch as advertised!!!  Thus 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> i am completely in love with these hot curls, they work great and deft leave the curls looking smooth and damaged free compared to the curly iron</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair after using twice in a row and leaving in my hair for over ten minutes.  Gave my hair a little body for maybe 30 minutes and then back to flat.  My hair is a little past shoulder length.</li>
    <li> works for my hair, but sometimes the clips leave dents in my hair</li>
    <li> Curlers are fine and they heat to a good temp. but the clips.... you can&#x27;t keep these things straight if your life depended on it.  They fall all over the place, including off.  I&#x27;m looking for a way to tie something on my head just to keep them in place.  I really wish I hadn&#x27;t sold my old ones in the yard sale.  I thought the felt would protect my hair better and maybe give me more manageabilility... I was wrong.</li>
    <li> I was replacing the exact same model. Mine has a on and off switch , this one does not. You must plug in and unplug to turn on and off. But if you don&#x27;t mind that, it works fine</li>
    <li> I wish I could find pins, instead of using these clips, they leave dents in the hair.</li>
    <li> I have so much hair and really long (Mediterranean type) and this didn&#x27;t work for me :(  Ive tried a lot of heat rollers and this claimed to be the best fit for long hair but I need way more rollers and these burn at the touch not leaving you enough time to roll it properly so it wont get any kinks, plus the clips are annoying, I wish I got the metal ones which work way better. Also the waves fall almost after an hour (in my humid climate, so not recommended for said climate type)  Hope this review helps for anyone with similar circumstances.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers and this is my 3rd set over several years of everday use. I like that the rollers are all large sizes so that your hair gets body without that overly curled look.They are simple to use, heat up fast and the clips are great so much better than those little silver pins ! I would and have recommended these curlers to lots of people. Cheap, easy and efficient buy some you&#x27;ll love them !</li>
    <li> I expected it to give more curl, but it only gave a small amount of boby to hair even when i would leave in for 30 min or longer. Not what i thought it would do.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love these rollers.  I get so much volume!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not great with these but I am pretty sure I did it right although after clipping in the curler with the clip, it wobbled a bit and caused the base of the curl to look weird after it dried. They give great volume, heat up at an ok speed, and everything is as described, but not sure how to get them to stay put while on...&lt;br /&gt;I have long fine straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;There were 2 rollers leftover when I did my whole head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because the the clips dont stay on my head! It all fell down.... I tried so many ways and I&#x27;m so mad. I even purchased those &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shaped clips but they were too tight and too harsh to slide into my hair..... I cant even use it......... any suggestions would help.</li>
    <li> The clips are so flimsy they don&#x27;t hold the rollers in my hair. The curlers aren&#x27;t hot enough either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of my money.</li>
    <li> These rollers are great.  My hair is medium-length and straight with fine strands but full hair.  These rollers work well to give my hair bombshell body with a slight curl under at the ends, which is what I&#x27;d expect from the barrel sizes included in this set.  They heat up quickly and are easy to use.  The clips do create a somewhat unnoticeable line/imprint in my hair, but compared to clips that I&#x27;ve used in other hot roller sets, it&#x27;s barely noticeable and when I style my hair after taking the rollers out, so most people wouldn&#x27;t even notice that.  It&#x27;d be nice if the set also came with the metal hook clips as well for those who prefer those.  Overall, definitely a great set and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I have long hair to the middle of my back.  This is the only set that I have found that has enough large and jumbo rollers for my hair.  They heat up quickly and are easy to store.  They are perfect for anyone that wants to set their hair and give it bounce and shine.  At first I did not like the clips but then I figured out how to use them.  There is a short side and a long side. Put the clip in with the short side on top and then make sure that the handle is pointing up.  If you still can&#x27;t figure it out you can always contact Conair customer service and buy pins, but I think the clips are pretty good now.  You can email them at Feedback@Conair.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that these are jumbo rollers and they will not give you tight curls.  They will, however, give you big curls and nice &amp;#34;Old Hollywood&amp;#34; like bounce.</li>
    <li> I have thick, shoulder length hair. This curls my hair quickly and effectively. The curl lasts all day. They also heat up quickly.</li>
    <li> love love love these. So easy and make my hair look perfect</li>
    <li> Was a christmas gift for my grand daughter. She likes it.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not good at it yet, but I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because the curls don&#x27;t stay all day long. It&#x27;s great for adding volume and it is gentle on my hair.</li>
    <li> I only use curlers sometimes so I have only use this product four times in the two months I have owned it. I waited too long to process return. I now cannot return it. The rollers and clips are nice and as described. But the product does not heat up as high as I would expect. My 15 year old small rollers with wired clips works much better and I will return to using them. I have long hair and I would have expected to get a curl out of the process. I get no curls after leaving in for at least 1/2 hour, or until cooled. The heat is just not there in the roller.</li>
    <li> Left the curlers in for 10 minutes like the instructions requested, and my curls fell flat within a half an hour. They&#x27;re tricky to roll, too, and I burned my fingers a few times.</li>
    <li> i hate doing things that take up too much time or effort. and as much as i know i should care about my hair, 9/10 times of the time i generally opt for a simple updo that involves little effort.&lt;br /&gt;a friend told me about how she started using hair rollers, and i was a bit skeptical at first but saw the great reviews of this product and went ahead and purchased it on amazon. i love it. it takes about 10 minutes total from getting them in my hair to getting them out to having nice voluminous curls. and it looks like i spent a lot more time/effort on it. great way to spruce up my hair when i don&#x27;t want to think too much about it. would purchase again it if breaks!</li>
    <li> I love this the curls come out great. The clips aren&#x27;t the best though. I need to get some that will hold the roller in place</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned these for about 2 years, and I hate them.  They are quite possibly the worst set of rollers I have ever used.  My hair is long, wavy, and fine, and usually holds a curl well.  However, my hair will not hold a curl with these rollers at all; the flocked design lends itself to smoothing and straightening the hair, rather than curling the hair.  The rollers do not give my hair the volume and body that rollers should provide.  The rollers are soft, and do not get caught in the hair, which is a plus.  But I cannot recommend them at all, and they are ultimately an overpriced and ineffective tool.  Amazon has some cheaper hot roller sets that do a much better job.</li>
    <li> I bought this after a friend recommended trying hot rollers. I have normal to thin long hair so i figured these would have no problem curling my hair. I let them heat up beyond how long it shouldve to ensure they were super hot...wrapped my hair around them easily and clipped them in. The actual rollers were hot but tolerable to touch when putting them in your hair. I let them set in my hair until the rollers were cold and my hair was no longer hot. They came out easily, but sadly what did curl, was kinked or didnt hold up much long after i took the rollers out. I tried different methods with my hair being freshly washed and blow dried, and even after it being a day since i had washed it, and nothing seemed to work. I def prefer my regular curling iron from conair more then these rollers.</li>
    <li> Good rollers--large as I wanted them to be.  I do not use them often but am glad I have them.</li>
    <li> This is great! It heats up really fast and makes great big curls.  Doesn&#x27;t burn your fingers when rolling either. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because the clips make marks where they are on your hair around the roller.  I have to use a flat iron to get rid of them once I am done. Other then that I love it!</li>
    <li> It heats up very fast and it is easy to use.  I have thick, very straight hair, and I am able to get some body.  I like that there are two different size rollers. The clips do a good job holding the curlers up.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it came with less clips than there are rollers.  Maybe mine was just a defect, but why wouldn&#x27;t there be the same number of clips as there are rollers.  However, it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
    <li> Looks  good and heats up quickly. i would like to have a couple more jumbo rollers and bobbie-pin  type holders - the clips sometimes leave a dent in my hair.  I think I would really like a set with just eight jumbos - but can&#x27;t find that. That would be more compact, easier for travel and just what I need for my long hair style</li>
    <li> I have had one or two sets of these rollers for years.  The newer super clips work much better than the old wire clips. Great product especially for thick and curly hair.  Leaves your hair soft and silky without having to go to the hairdresser.</li>
    <li> Works great love the clips, just need to practice so when I am done the rollers on top of my head don&#x27;t roll forward.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers! The idea that it heats up on its own just like how your electric curler works is brilliant. I have a hard time using those since I have kind of a thick hair. This saves me some time because I don&#x27;t have to really sit down and do my hair. All in all I love this one.</li>
    <li> I love these curlers....and plan to buy another set tonight.  However, has anyone experienced overheating?  I do not eat them with the lid on, however, after a while they overheat and this morning was smoking as the plastic on the purple ones where melting?  On the black super , the plastic either melts or falls off into a million pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all of this, I need the jumbo and super jumbo and have never seen them in one full set versus buying 4 or 5 .  I go through  about 3 sets a year ...just wondering if anyone has had this problem?</li>
    <li> rollers too big I was disappointed</li>
    <li> I bought these for my Mom for Christmas, and she loves them.  I have been using the same set of Conair rollers for the last 10 years, and they work great.  I wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product delivers on its promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very straight, limp hair.  These rollers give me twice the volume.  It takes me less time to style my hair in the morning.  After I roll my hair, I just give it a quick comb through and I am finished and on my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE these!  They heat up really fast and you don&#x27;t have to leave them in the hair very long at all.  Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Heats up fine, easy to use and not too hot on scalp.  Unfortunately, my hair texture did not hold the curl, but this is not the fault of the product.  If my hair was a bit longer and thicker, I think this product would be awesome.</li>
    <li> They curl nice but the curl doesn&#x27;t hold. As soon as I walk outside, the humidity kills the curl. I don&#x27;t think they get hot enough. I didn&#x27;t have the problem with clips leaving marks. This set would be good in cold weather, but don&#x27;t bother if you live in Miami like me. :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far but I&#x27;m EXTREMELY disappointed with them! They are easy enough to use.  I set my entire head nice &amp; tight, and left them in for a good 30 minutes.  When I took them out I had hardly any curl.  My hair was straightened before I used them so I&#x27;m going to give it another shot without my hair straightened &amp; see what happens. VERY DISAPOINTED</li>
    <li> good product but its only 110 v if you have 220v its hard find volt changer</li>
    <li> fast Shipping and works great!!</li>
    <li> LOVE the volume that it gives. Don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re wanting great curls to stay in all day. My hair turns out with a lot of volume and curls but the curls fall out pretty fast and then I have a great body wave going on. I don&#x27;t suggest using the clips that come with it, they left indentions in my hair. I have seen other reviews online suggesting that you use wire clips/pins. It&#x27;s def. quick, easy and convenient if you&#x27;re in a hurry to go, because you can pop these rollers on, get ready and take them out when you arrive at your destination. I may not get a lot of curl out of them considering my hair is almost to my butt and I only left them in for 10 minutes as the box suggested. I&#x27;ll leave them in longer next time and give an updated statement. They&#x27;re are worth the money and I am giving them four stars because of how much easier they have made my life when I am in a hurry.</li>
    <li> The quality is good.  I have used lots of hot rollers over the years and I was pleased with the heat level, roller design, and claw clips for this particular set.  However, I&#x27;m dropping to 3 stars because I didn&#x27;t like the way they worked in my hair.  I have long, straight hair, and found that these simply did not work well.  They curled my hair, but took a long time to set and actually looked quite strange.</li>
    <li> This came with everything described, and seemed like it would be great. Unfortunately, the heating of the rollers was very uneven. After allowing them to heat for more than enough time, some were super hot like you&#x27;d expect, and others were only warm. As a result, the curls would not be consistent, so I sent it back.</li>
    <li> I have stick straight hair, and it holds a curl for only a few minutes...Not with these rollers! They turned me into Farrah Fawcett with long, pretty waves that lasted. And, because they&#x27;re ceramic they won&#x27;t burn your hair and they don&#x27;t leave crinkled bits at the end.</li>
    <li> I almost never write reviews but after reading all of the comments about the clips this set comes with I felt the need to save others some frustration :)  I bought this set from Target this week (for ~ 28) and it comes with the metal clips that most reviewers are saying work better than the plastic ones in this set.  The set I bought looks the same except for the clips.  I have used them twice and think they work really well.  Makes my hair look like I did it with a round brush and hairdryer. They give hair a nice amount of volume and made my hair look a lot less frizzy.</li>
    <li> THEY ARE THE BEST HEAT ROLLERS I EVER BROUGHT&lt;br /&gt;YES I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM TO ANY ONE WHO WANTS TO BUY HOT ROLLERS, THE CLIPS ARE GREAT AS WELL.</li>
    <li> My hair is bra strap length, and these rollers practically straightened my hair. I bought these for a pageant coming up soon. It took us 30 minutes to figure out how to clip the hair in the roller, and they crimped my hair awkwardly. These will be returned, and we are continuing to search for a good product. Don&#x27;t waste your money on something that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> First time buying hot rollers. They give my hair lots of volume. My hair doesn&#x27;t really hold the curl after I&#x27;ve taken them out (and i let them get lava hot) but that&#x27;s fine. They still provide me with nice voluminous hair...which I love since I have medium thick, fine hair.</li>
    <li> Very gentle on hair.  Bigger rollers &#x3D; looser curls and a more natural-looking curl.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about the Shirley Temple curls!  The velvet roller is great for more fragile hair.  I now live in Europe and still I bought these because I missed them so much (it&#x27;s my third Conair set of these jumbo rollers since the 90&#x27;s!).  I just plug these into a transformer for European voltage, and they work like they&#x27;re supposed to!  Recommend these highly.  Stay away from any roller that is not velvet lined!  Your hair will thank you for it years from now.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected but I would have been happier with an on/off switch.</li>
    <li> I just need to get used to using them. It isn&#x27;t something you can do the first time in the morning. Also it takes a little longer than 20 minutes for my curls to be done (I guess that is the correct word). I have to keep practicing to get to where I need to be with them to do it in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give me great curls when I have more time to let them sit in my hair. I don&#x27;t really have &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; hair but I have a lot of hair (from what my hairdresser says).</li>
    <li> Great except for one thing. No on / off switch</li>
    <li> These are wonderful I have thick hair and it takes a long time to curl. These heat up fast and my hair is curled in no time.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice set of heated hair curlers. They heat up very quickly and I love the flocked outer covering as it makes it very easy to roll up the hair. The claw-style clips are very nice as well. They hold the curlers in position as they&#x27;re supposed to. I recommend this set.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter requested these on her Christmas list.  Sure glad I could find them for her.  She is happy with them.</li>
    <li> curlers are heavy they fall out of clips</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get as hot as I thought it would and the Hair Setters slipped out of my hair even with the Super Clips.</li>
    <li> The curls are gorgeous but the clips take some getting use to especially for thicker hair. I suggest using your own sturdier hair clips.</li>
    <li> . They make waves in my hair when I am using the rollers to straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> My wife says nice mix of larger sized rollers. They do heat fast and the clips are perfect. Some reviews indicate the clips are problematic but they have not been for her. Good price as well</li>
    <li> I do love this rollers. They heat up quickly and the curls last throughout the day. My only problem is I wear long weave and my longest hair 26&#x27;&#x27; isnt as curled as the top. I still use them for a Kim K inspired body wave look. I was worried there wouldnt be enough rollers for my head and its just enough</li>
    <li> This is my second set of these hot rollers.  I have one in my downstairs bathroom and one in my master bath for convenience.  I love them!  Doesn&#x27;t take much time to heat up, I roll my hair  and I leave the rollers on for about 5-7 minutes and my hair is ready.</li>
    <li> I am only giving 3 stars due to the clip that holds the roller.  The old set I had was a metal &amp;#34;pin&amp;#34; which didn&#x27;t always hold the roller in well so I as happy to see they updated with the new clip.  However, the plastic clip causes my hair to look rippled a little.  Especially in the front I have had to resort to using a curling iron to avoid the ripple look.  Theo rollers do work well, the unit heats up quick and otherwise does a good job.</li>
    <li> I have loved and use hear curlers for years. Was very disappointment when I bought my new set for it to not come with the &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shaped pins that don&#x27;t leave kinks in your hair like the hair clips do</li>
    <li> The previous set I purchased 2 years ago had an on/off switch. This does not, you have to unplug the set.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I thought it would be a good idea to purchase this set. I have naturally wavy, slightly frizzy, very long hair, Spanish/Italian mix so not brittle but not super soft.&lt;br /&gt;Positives: right after taking the rollers out, about 8/12 curls look fabulous. Five minutes later, they diminish in size, resulting in regular, still slightly frizzy, waves.&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: aside from the one i just said, many. The clips are extremely flimsy and don&#x27;t hold the roller in place.&lt;br /&gt;The rollers barely heat up (I waited five minutes before taking one out)&lt;br /&gt;I had my hair slightly damp, and also tried it with try hair so I wouldn&#x27;t be bias, and both times, my curls didn&#x27;t come out very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I received a dud, but these rollers are cheap for a reason. They don&#x27;t work!!&lt;br /&gt;I would like a refund, or at least credit towards another set of better quality.</li>
    <li> I have had this roller set for several months.  I am glad to have the large sized set of rollers, but while I appreciate that the new version includes the clips which I had to buy separately, they make marks in my hair.  The original wire clips would work better if the straight part was longer, so they would stay in.  Probably the worst thing about these rollers is that while they heat up quickly, they also cool down quickly, and the lovely curls are out within minutes because the rollers don&#x27;t become hot enough for long enough to be effective. I am very disappointed in the set and would love to have a quality, slow heating set that heats my hair long enough for the curl to stay in all day, like the older type of rollers that are made of a heavier plastic.  At least for my hair the \\&quot;Ceramic layered technology\\&quot; and quick heat up is unimpressive.  Perhaps Conair will read this and go retro, to the older, heavier type, and incorporate some modern elements like longer wire clips, the lovely velvet surface, auto shut-off and the large and jumbo size.  I would buy them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had limited experience with using hot rollers and I was glad to see that these weren&#x27;t that hard to get the hand of.  I did burn my finger tips a few times and still haven&#x27;t figure out how to stop doing that but hopefully I&#x27;ll get the hang of it.  The did a nice job of curling my hair (I use them to curl in under because my hair tends to fight it with a straightener or curling iron).  The style keeps for a long time also which is very nice.  The one downside is that I can&#x27;t figure out how to place the clips so that I don&#x27;t get a crease in my hair.</li>
    <li> Wife loves them, she says they get nice and hot</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and when style my hair using this curler, it stays curled all night until the next day. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I love it!  It heats up in 85 seconds, does a wonderful job, and was a great bargain!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I hoped I had ordered.</li>
    <li> This roller set had large 1-1/2&amp;#34; rollers, which is what my wife really wanted, but she only used the set for about 90 days before they stopped working.  The indicator light would illuminate, but the rollers would not heat.  I would not recommend this roller set.</li>
    <li> the curls hold all day  - works great to get a nice wavy look by only leaving in for 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t get hot enough fast enough when reheating to use all over the head and clips cause dents in some types of hair.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect these to give you the result of a curling iron or wand. These will smooth your hair and give you a nice loose wave with a nice big curl at the end. If you want a lot of tight curls you need an iron, but I love these because I just have frizzy hair and these really give it a nice look without much effort. They can leave a crimp where the clip is though, it is avoidable just irritating.</li>
    <li> Great for long hair. The jumbo and super jumbo size really help when your hair is waist-length. The clips are a bit flimsy but work.</li>
    <li> finally! found these after years of looking. had large rollers before and lost in move. glad to find these... not only are they all large but stay in hair</li>
    <li> I like the product but if you want a little more curls I would suggest going with med and large size. My hair is almost to my waist and it does not  curl it much.</li>
    <li> My hair just doesn&#x27;t hold a curl. It&#x27;s the world&#x27;s straightest hair. (Except when it&#x27;s humid and it feels like being wavy, but that&#x27;s another story.) these rollers are easy to use, heat up very quickly and the clips are kinda cool. All that being said, they did produce curls in my hair that looked awesome for about 10 mins and then went flat. It left my hair with slightly more body than usual but not enough to be worth it to go through the whole process. Will collect dust on my dresser for like 3 months till I throw it out.</li>
    <li> I bought these, couldnt wait to use them on my long hair. Ive used them only once and was so dissappointed. There was some lift but no curls whatsoever. I,m an ex hairdresser so i used them correctly. They were not what i expected at all. I wouldnt buy them again</li>
    <li> I think that I like the old school rollers better. These cool down very fast once in my hair and the curl seems to fall quickly with these. Plus, these are pretty heavy for hot rollers and the comb/clips that come with them leave marks in my hair. I use the old fashion U shaped pins that used to come with hot rollers and do not get a crimp.</li>
    <li> They are great for volume not so great for actually curling your hair. I am certain this is because of the size of the roller. I have the set that comes with the regular pins and not clips. I do have my own set of clips that I use for the top rollers that are prone to moving around. You can find this set on Walmart.com for far cheaper :)If you are looking for volume this set of roller is for you!</li>
    <li> These get really hot, so hot that it&#x27;s hard to put them in. They burn my fingers. And the curl doesn&#x27;t even hold. The curl is out within an hour. Other sets hold the curl much longer.You would think with them getting that hot, that the curl would hold. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have super thick and long hair.  They give me a ton of volume!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd set. I&#x27;ve only needed to replace them because of my own clumsiness, I usually end up breaking the lid. They heat up very quickly but I still let them sit for about 10/15 minutes before I use them because I have thick hair that is to my waist so I feel like the curl lasts longer when I let them heat up longer. As far as how long the curl lasts, I am in Texas so the humidity takes its toll. Definitely won&#x27;t last as long as a wand. Gives great volume!</li>
    <li> Extra Volume nice curls very easy to make hair with this product. Only 85 seconds to head up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A++++++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to have it.*****</li>
    <li> Great Product!!! I have long, thick hair that does not curl. These rollers give my hair just the right amount of curl for that sexy full bounce that I&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
    <li> These rollers heat almost instantly and give a great, bouncy curl.  The clips hold the rollers in place securely. Would definitely recommend  for a soft curl.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these curlers so far. They heat up very fast and they leave the curls looking very soft. I wish there were larger sets though. I have thick, long hair and I can only do about 3/4 of my hair. I usually just use a curling wand for what is left while the curlers are cooling. The clips work just fine for me. I wouldn&#x27;t expect them to hold the curler in a perfect spot or anything. They are weighty so yes, they will droop and move around a little. It shouldn&#x27;t affect the outcome though.</li>
    <li> So, easy. Less heat to my hair than flat ironing.  Fluffy, movie star hair!!  I recommend to anyone that wants easier hairstyles!</li>
    <li> Great product. Gives my hair the curls I want. I have very frizzy puffy hair and this tames it down and it looks presentable to the public without putting mousse or blow drying.</li>
    <li> Perfect for me. There are 2 sizes, 4 large and 8 medium. The clips might not travel easily, but I&#x27;ve only used them at home so far.</li>
    <li> They are ok.  My curls don&#x27;t hold long like my old Conair rollers used to.  They make big soft curls which I like.</li>
    <li> These rollers do what they are supposed to do - curl your hair. However!! be warned, you will burn your fingers on these puppies! They get very hot. The other issue I encountered was the weight of the curlers. The individual curlers are quite heavy and really pull at the scalp. Not nice. I returned the item for these reasons. Not willing to have great hair + burned fingers and a headache :-(</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick, so thick I cannot let it air dry, because it takes hours and hours.  So I have to blow-dry it.  It comes out looking limp and blah no matter what kind of brush or product I use.  So my solution, to give it some body, was nearly always to use a curling iron.  Curling irons are really hot and damage your hair with frequent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot Rollers to the rescue!  These things are so nifty.  Plug it in, I let it heat up for between 5-10 minutes (while I&#x27;m taking a shower), and then roll up the hair, and leave them in while I do other stuff like brush teeth, do makeup, etc etc.  Take out and hair has pretty waves and body!  I love that it fits into my routine so easily, I don&#x27;t have to spend 30 minutes curling my hair.  The rollers may get slightly hot to the touch, but it&#x27;s way less heat than a curling iron so they are much better for your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I started out using a Tresemme Heat Protectant spray, but putting product in before using the rollers made my hair a bit &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feeling.  I don&#x27;t use any product anymore and hair looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that the indicating dot on turns white before the rollers are really hot.  They are warm, and useable, but if you want defined curls, wait longer than 5 minutes, and leave them in your hair for more than 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only nitpik I have with these is that there aren&#x27;t enough rollers to do ALL of my hair.  If you have very thick and fairly long hair like me, you may find you run out of rollers.  Trying to use very large, thick sections of hair for each roller is problematic and I gave up on that.  But since you start from the top of your head, it adds body and volume to the top layers, and the very bottom layer of hair I either leave alone, or give a very quick curl with the curling iron just at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the &amp;#34;superclips&amp;#34; that come with the package.  I did order the wire clips since everyone seems to say they are better.  I couldn&#x27;t really figure out how to secure them.  The purple clips are really easy to use and I don&#x27;t see any &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; like some other people complain about.I couldn&#x27;t really figure out how to secure them.  The purple clips are really easy to use and I don&#x27;t see any &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; like some other people complain about.</li>
    <li> Excellent product does a fantastic job.  I just wish I could get more of the Super Jumbo rollers.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I read every review and purchased with reservations. Sadly this did not work for me. No matter what I tried these left my very straight hair with a mediocre &amp;#34;wave&amp;#34; at best not a good purchase if you have stubborn straight hair.</li>
    <li> Great set of hot rollers. Instructions say turn on, but there&#x27;s no switch, just plug in. Heated up quickly. Easy to handle because ends are cool so no burned fingers. Took about 5 min to heat up the first time. 15 min later I had nice big bouncy soft curls. This is just what I was looking for. The roller sizes are perfect for my long layers.</li>
    <li> 3rd set in 15 years love them</li>
    <li> Had to return these rollers. They were just not doing the job of actually curling hair. The curls would last around 30 mins tops even with hairspray and leaving them to cool. Could be okay for someone who has hair that curls easily. Also the curlers do not get very hot at all.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected thus far - I have thick/coarse asian hair a little longer than shoulder length and I wanted this to help the bottom be curly, but this made me have big voluminous mom hair rather than curls...maybe I should&#x27;nt have gotten the jumbo, but i also have so MUCH thick hair that it would take a zillion little curlers to do my entire head. Also the clips left little crimps in my hair - I am hoping with more practice maybe I can get it so they don&#x27;t do that, because I can&#x27;t find any curlers that have the metal pins anymore.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I brought this hot roller set. I was skeptical at first but after trying the rollers I am happy with my purchase. The curls come out so beautiful and give great volume to my hair. Thanks</li>
    <li> I like the size of the rollers and the clips but they just don&#x27;t get hot enough to do much for my hair. I would save your money.</li>
    <li> I imagine these curlers would be great for ladies with fine/thin hair, but I would need at least six more curlers to curl all my hair at once.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made.  Clips are so light weight they break if dropped.</li>
    <li> It is very difficult to handle this item.  When taking it out of its&#x27; box and rolling it I find it burns my fingers.  It even is too hot [[ASIN:B00005A441 Conair CHV14JXR Extreme Heat Jumbo and Super Jumbo Rollers]against my scalp and face once it is rolled in my hair.  I like the super jumbo size and speed with which it heats, but the safety issue is a real drawback.</li>
    <li> Set is ridiculously hot.  Can barely hold the rollers, no even by the edges,  and after getting them in they burn my head and I have to take them out almost immediately.  Would not recommend!</li>
    <li> As someone with fine hair, I have tried almost everything to get volume in my hair do, and this works the best by far! I have used a different model of hot rollers before. I was used to using many more rollers, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if only 12 rollers would cut it. It actually works better. First of all, fewer rollers means less time rolling and setting. Second, using bigger rollers with more hair rolled in them creates massive volume, as opposed to ringlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love how quickly it heats up, and how well the clips hold the rollers as they set in my hair. I know from experience that a lot of &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; hair products disappoint. I&#x27;m not an expert, but what works for me is a shampoo and conditioner designed to give you &amp;#34;thick and full&amp;#34; results. Then a volumizing blow-out spray when I use the hair dryer. Then cheap mousse to hold the curl. Careful with hairspray to set the hair, if it&#x27;s heavy it will weigh it down. Use something with a fine mist and flexible hold.</li>
    <li> The product does not work as it should, it smokes and smells burned when I plug it in.</li>
    <li> I have to curl half of my hair at a time to sustain an entire head of curls for a whole day. Sometimes I roll the bottom half and manually curl the top half with a curling iron.. Which defeats the purpose of the curlers. Obviously, these weren&#x27;t meant for normal medium length hair.</li>
    <li> Nice low price for a good product (I paid around $18 for my set). Negative - no off switch. I resolved that by attaching it to a $12 lamp on/off switch. Works like a charm!  It&#x27;s hard to find nice fat rollers for a low price. I&#x27;m pleased with my work-around.</li>
    <li> The set didn&#x27;t last very long at all. my hubby asked what happened to my curls.  I guess I will have to use a gel or spray to make it last.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough.</li>
    <li> the very first time that I used this it fell apart.this merchandise was supposed to have for screws in all four of the corners at the bottom. there was only one screw the rest of the three were just missing. this was very poorly made. I&#x27;m really upset about it. It was a waste of money</li>
    <li> This was my first hot roller purchase, and I found the rollers too hot to touch. I would take them out and have to let them cool for a minute, kind of defeating the purpose, before rolling them in my hair. I also think with the length, thickness and amount of hair I have I would need the whole set to be super jumbo rollers because I have to finish off the other pieces of hair with a curling iron. The clips also tend to leave slight indentation in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If buying another set, I would look for roller that had some type of heat protection that makes them easier to handle so I didn&#x27;t throw it around like a hot potato or be forced to let it cool off.</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the clips for these curlers.  They&#x27;re the comb-looking kind.  I prefer the wire clips because they don&#x27;t leave creases in your hair like these do.  Other than that, the curlers are great.</li>
    <li> My wife has naturally curly hair and she had been ION Shine rollers for 7 yrs... I surprised her by purchasing the Xtreme Instant Heat Jumbo Hair Setter &amp; she is very pleased with the heat time... only 2 minutes and they are ready to use!!  Great Product..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C.Smith</li>
    <li> This item is great, thank you</li>
    <li> I have been using electric rollers for 25 years. This is by far the worst set I have ever owned. By far. I only bought them because it was the only product available. The clips are bulky to store. They leave marks in my hair. And they don&#x27;t hold the rollers tight. The rollers flop around.The rollers are difficult to fit into the case. It&#x27;s hard to tell where the two bigger sizes are supposed to go. I intensely dislike this product.</li>
    <li> Cons:  No on/off switch (huh?); ridge causing clips (hang onto your wire clips); no place to stow clips; gaps at barrel end sometimes traps hair (ow!)&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Flocked barrel helps hold fine hair &amp; protects fingers from heat; quick warm up; generous diameters generate soft curls; longer curlers left in, tighter the curls.&lt;br /&gt;Conair products look cheap, but in my experience are a really excellent, effective value.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought I was ordering, I returned this item</li>
    <li> I would have given more stars, but there is NO ON/OFF SWITCH. You have to turn it on by plugging it in and turn it off by unplugging. This is a nuisance as my wife wants to hide power cords so the workspace looks neat. How did a heating appliance get UL approval without an on/off switch? It may turn itself off, but that still means you have to unplug it and plug it back in the next time you need to use it. My wife loves the rollers, they work, and well, but the on/off switch (or lack thereof) seems really odd.</li>
    <li> I loooooove these hair rollers. I have naturally wavy hair but i brush it out and put these in for a smoother frizz free wave. They are good sizes and can handle all of my hair. My only complaint is that the clips don&#x27;t always stay in perfectly, other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I had rollers for years and then stopped using them.  When I hurt my shoulder, I wanted something that would curl my hair and less time raising my arms then when I blow dry my hair.  These rollers work great.</li>
    <li> Definitely good to give your hair some volume.  Not a tight curl, just body.  Don&#x27;t use on a windy day though - hair ends up straight.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my daughter.  She said it works great, I would gladly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I bought this to supplement the other super jumbo curlers I got for my daughter.  This added to the other set manages to complete her hair curling needs.</li>
    <li> I like these curlers. I have used them about 6 times since purchasing them. They heat up very fast and maintain their heat evenly while set in my hair. The only complaint I have is the clips  are a little weak and you have to take a little extra effort in clipping so they don&#x27;t slip. I think if the clips were a bit more sturdy then I would give them a five star rating. As it is though I would still recommend these curlers, just be careful when clipping or the slipping curlers will be frustrating. I let my curlers completely cool, about twenty to thirty minutes I would guess, and my curl lasts all day with only minimal hairspray,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think these curlers would be great with fine hair. I have fairly thick and and slightly course hair, if my hair were any finer I don&#x27;t think the curlers would stay put. The curlers tend to slip more on my finer hair areas near my face.</li>
    <li> No longer has an on off switch... might be a safety issue??  I liked the on off button now you have to unplug to turn off.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Works great, gives a loose curl/wave to longer hair..Great..</li>
    <li> I have thick, shoulder length, wavy hair and it usually holds curl pretty well. These rollers are great for volume and giving my hair large, smooth curls. They&#x27;re great except for the hair clips it comes with that do leave marks in your hair, but it usually doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. If you&#x27;re really picky you can get the other kind of clips but these are ok for a beginner like me. The entire thing doesnt take up much space and heats up super quick. Overall, its a great product.</li>
    <li> Its hard to even correctly rate the rollers, because I couldn&#x27;t get them to stay in my hair. I wish they had the normal metal clips that every other set of rollers have ever had... instead they have these purple claw clips that DO NOT even hold up the rollers in place. And there is no storage for them.  The old metal clips used to just stick in a slot in the container, now you have to have another box or a bag to hold 12 large purple clips... basically this set is useless... I am going to see if I can get a set of the old clips and see how the actual curlers work....</li>
    <li> This is a great product, smooth transaction. I would purchase again and would recommend. Also the item was just as described online.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different hot rollers sets.  This one heats quickly and the rollers and clips are easy to use.  The downside for me is I can&#x27;t stand wrinkles--not waves, not curls but wrinkles--produced by rollers.  This one makes them.  Other than that (which I fix by ironing just those spots) this is a good buy and a reasonable way to improve second day hair.</li>
    <li> Large size is more useful for overall even look than ones with smaller rollers.  These heat up pretty fast but do get very hot so be careful as you can burn your skin. No on/off switch and light doesn&#x27;t change when they are ready, so that is not ideal. Sturdy, easy to use clips are helpful and case is sleek.</li>
    <li> Good product... for the price it works really well. I am please with how quickly heats up...the clips are not that great but overall worth the money</li>
    <li> great large jumbo curlers. I love them and they work great. Clipsdon&#x27;t hold as well as I&#x27;d like, but I don&amp;#34;t leave them in that long .</li>
    <li> I like this set a lot. It smooths my hair, adding a little curl and bounce.  The first few times I used it, the element between the two rows of black rollers smoked. I kept an eye on it, and eventually it stopped doing it. I still might contact the manufacturer and see what that is about!</li>
    <li> I found these locally at a Walmart and then decided to look on Amazon to see if I could find them for a better price, and I did.  They arrived fairly quickly, no damage and had a good price.</li>
    <li> I bought this to update an old set that I have.  This one does not have an on/off switch and the rollers burn my fingers when I am rolling my hair; there is no cool rims to hold onto.  I have begun using them so I will keep the set but I don&#x27;t recommend getting them.</li>
    <li> Worked great! Just forgot to buy the clips it needs.</li>
    <li> I like them a lot and will use them routinely.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my wife. My wife thinks it is the best set she has ever used.</li>
    <li> These heat up exceptionally well and very quickly. Edges aren&#x27;t too hot to handle. Curls very well. I only wish there were more and more sizes in this set.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for nice loose curls</li>
    <li> Love how easy these are to use. Puts a wonderful shine in my hair.</li>
    <li> I love the curlers. My only complaint is the clips are separate and they give you nothing to hold them in.  I use a cloth bag that I had, but if you are traveling it takes up a lot of room. If I were to buy another set I would get the kind that the clips attach to the curlers in the heating case.</li>
    <li> Replaced a duplicate set I already owned.  This set came with clamps instead of clips. Glad I kept clips from previous set. Perfect size rollers for my chin length bob.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect &#x27;hot rollers&#x27;!!! Just let the rollers heat, and then roll your hair and the clips that come with them are perfect. My hair is approx. 18 inches long and very thick... these rollers work very very well... Enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my long normal (on the fine side) hair. It did get warm, and did give me waves in 10 min even without any product. However, I do not like this product because the plastic clips kept sliding off and left hideous marks on my hair. Disappointed. And yes, there is no on-off switch.</li>
    <li> Not what I wanted but good product. Very loose large curls and I wanted a tighter curl but they are very nice to use.</li>
    <li> Heats up very quickly and curls come out soft and loose. Clips are hard to stay in the hair. Pins would have worked much better.</li>
    <li> The new style clips are not as good as the old ones. There&#x27;s no on/off button. Heats up fast, though.</li>
    <li> I like the way my hair had lots of bouncy body, but the clips won&#x27;t keep the roller in place and are super hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking about buying some clamp on clips that might help.  Also,  no place to store the clips either.</li>
    <li> I have really long thick hair and cannot get the rollers to stay in with the purple butterfly clips buy the metal ones and it will work wonders</li>
    <li> Item just as described and what I wanted.  If you want lots of body and not curls then this is for you.  I take my shower in the evening and dry my hair before bed. The next morning all I do is roll my hair with these and while they are cooling I put on makeup and get dressed.  By the time that is done, the rollers have cooled and all I have to do is take them out and give a quick brush.  Set lasts all day on my hair.</li>
    <li> Love the rollers. They heat up very fast and hold their heat fantastic. They work great in my stubborn hair and the curls stay vibrant and bouncy all day and even the next morning after sleeping on my hair.Would reccomend buying extra rollers when you buy and clips as well if you have full or thick hair or longer hair as you have to reheat and roll the remaining hair. Definitely reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> I have long, very thick Asian hair which is also straight permed and these hot rollers do a great job at curling them and they are also the few jumbo size hot rollers that I&#x27;ve found.  They heat up pretty fast and retain its heat for at least 15 minutes in the hair. The reason why I give this three stars is that, like many others have stated, the clips suck. They don&#x27;t hold that well and the best way I&#x27;ve found to get it to keep the rollers in your hair is to clip it on and then turn it towards your scalp. It does mess up a smooth roll but at least it actually keeps it in your hair.</li>
    <li> These are great rollers, heat up quickly and are very easy to handle and clip into your hair.  My granddaughter loved them.</li>
    <li> The description of this item says it comes with wire clips for the rollers. It does NOT! It comes with the plastic clips which I do not like. They don&#x27;t hold as well. Now I have to go purchase wire clips separately. This product used to come with the wire ones and I&#x27;m not sure why they stopped.  Otherwise, the product is good and it heated up quickly.</li>
    <li> Burned my scalp.  They would be wonderful for long hair, but I could not even put one in!  Had to return , but they do heat fast!</li>
    <li> no on/off switch you have to plug it in and take the plug out manually.  Horrible purchase</li>
    <li> Definitely holds the curl in long hair! That is what I was looking for - the only problem I had is that the light never tells me when the curlers are ready - so I just plug in and wait 15 minutes before using! Great product otherwise.</li>
    <li> Love this roller set. Large rollers! Gets very hit very quickly. Wish there was a smaller unit available that had 5-7 rollers so I would not have to lug the entire set around when traveling.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get them to do anything for my hair.  The only thing these rollers did for my hair was left marks from the awful comb like clips.</li>
    <li> These curlers heat up fast and give my hair more volume and a lovely wave at the bottom of my hair. The clips to leave a slight imprint on the hair though. For the price and speed to give your hair a salon look I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Clips man...clips!!! It had to go back</li>
    <li> I owned a set a bit smaller than these years ago and loved them. They lasted for years and worked great. When I found these in this size I was so excited and had to order.my hair is shoulder length and I really just volume and not so much curl and this size will be great for that.</li>
    <li> I just received mine today and it&#x27;s not working!</li>
    <li> LOVE the large size and the foam...BUT.....the pink clasps don&#x27;t seem to hold so I ordered the wire clips....not much better. Not a total disaster....I just can&#x27;t be moving around a lot for the ten minutes they&#x27;re in.....I&#x27;ll just read and relax!</li>
    <li> Get the soft hollywood curls you see in tv and magazines. These babies can really make curls last longer.  Very easy to use, in 20 mins while doing make up, your curls will be ready.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly.  Easy to handle and use quickly!  The set up is not compact enough for travel but works great at home!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly.  Claw clips take a little getting used to.</li>
    <li> While these rollers might work well to curl or straighten, or both, they lack an on/off switch and so have to be plugged in and plugged off every time they are used.  This might be convenient for some people, but not for me.</li>
    <li> My old Conair had finally died, so I found this one on Amazon. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because the edges sometime burn my scalp.  I don&#x27;t understand since I had the almost same roller set before.  Otherwise than being occasionally singed this works fine.</li>
    <li> The rollers didn&#x27;t get as hot as I expected.  And the product didn&#x27;t have any pouch or other container for the clips, which is annoying.  OK for the money.</li>
    <li> This item burned my head and then the curls were gone in about 10 minutes. Didn&#x27;t like it at all!!</li>
    <li> I have thick Asian hair and this did not work at all. The rollers are very hot when they come out, but even after leaving them in my hair for 30min my hair barely had any curls. I would have to heat them up midway through. This would be perfect for girls with thinner, fine hair, but if you have thick hair, stay away.</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair this is the product is not for you! Just know that this product does NOT give you tight curls. I have long thick hair so it did not work for me. I recommend to those who have thin hair.</li>
    <li> The clips that go around the rollers crimp your hair! It did not work AT ALL in my hair and i was so upset with the result.  It looked pretty straight and crimped at the top from where the clips were sitting.  The clips also do an AWFUL job holding the rollers in place.  I do NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nice set of rollers for the money!</li>
    <li> I love these curlers! I could never find any that worked for my hair, but these do! They are such a heaven sent.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, and wanted something to give some body and round out some pieces that were straighter than others. These did not curl my shoulder length hair at all. They did an ok job of giving some body at the crown.</li>
    <li> I bought these curlers to shorten my morning routine and give my hAir more body. It did that. The one drawback is that it did not come with curler pins and the provided clips crimped my hair. I ordered some generic pins and the problem is fixed.</li>
    <li> these rollers, while they heat up fast also cool down fast.  The curls don&#x27;t stay in my hair long.  Also I don&#x27;t like that there are no on/off switches.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the clips.  They didn&#x27;t leave a mark in my hair.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure whether or not to buy because of the clip controversy going on.  I&#x27;ve used it twice and have not yet had the clips leave marks on my hair.  My hair just needs to grow a little bit longer since it was cut in many different layers, but other than that, it works well in a short amount of time.  I does heat up fast and the rollers do not burn your fingers or anything.  The only thing that I think could be improved upon is having an on/off switch rather than what I consider unsafe by using the plug and it automatically goes on.  Even the direction booklet states to turn on the switch, but there isn&#x27;t one to be found.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with heated rollers and these do work very well.  My hair looks very cute when I take the curlers out.  I need to find a good hair product that will keep the curl for the entire day.</li>
    <li> love this! So easy and quick to use and it makes me hair look fabulous</li>
    <li> Conair Hair products are the worst. It will work well for few months and then it will stop working. When i asked couple of friends they had the same experience. Recently I bought a hair dryer and after 8 months it stopped working. When i called conair for warranty they asked me to send it to AZ with $7 in the pack (it will cost me 20$). Please dont trust Conair.</li>
    <li> Product arrive quickly and was packaged well. The curlers were as advertised, heated up fast, were easy to use and performed well. My wife says the only negative is the clips are made from plastic and did not perform as well as her old metal clips did. With thick hair, the weight of hair hair pulled the curlers out sometimes. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Really quick, effective, and good-looking curls. I have thick medium length hair and didn&#x27;t need to use all of them. I find the clips to do a good job of holding the curlers in place - at least for my hair type. I only take off one star bc the instructions say the light will turn from red to white when the curlers are done heating up, and that didn&#x27;t happen even though I let it heat up for at least15 minutes. So you need to keep an eye on it. Otherwise, I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to hot rollers so I think it worked pretty well.  It was a bit too hot on my right ear.</li>
    <li> These are VERY quick to heat up, with an indicator on one of the .  The lid is attached.  I use all of them when styling my long hair. There are 4 huge rollers and 8 large rollers.  This isn&#x27;t quite enough for my hair unless I am going for a very loose style.  So, I add in a few smaller sized from an old-fashioned set to get more body.  I have not yet burned myself on these and have been using them for a few months now.  (can&#x27;t say the same for the old-fashioned set!).  As with all hot rollers, remember to let the curlers cool completely before removing from your hair, and then let hair rest another 10 minutes before styling.  I just finger style though.</li>
    <li> Nice rollers good size I have thick hair</li>
    <li> I got these to go with the smaller set.  I can use the rollers and clips from either set on both heaters.</li>
    <li> I have been straightening my hair almost everyday for the last 3 years. On the rare occasions when I curl my hair with a straightener (curling irons don&#x27;t work for me), it takes me about 2 hours to achieve the look I want. Recently, I saw a YouTube video where a girl got big voluminous curls with these rollers, the Conair Xtreme Instant Heat rollers, and because I absolutely hate using a flat iron or curling iron to curl my hair, I decided to buy these and give them a try. I was beyond excited to get these (I was literally waiting outside for the mailman to deliver them)! When I got them, I immediately tried them. I thought I would be getting the straight circular pins for the rollers, but I got big plastic clips that clip onto the rollers.. I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled about those. The clips are made cheap, and they look and feel like they will snap in an instant. I love the fact that the rollers heat up in only 85 seconds. I can only fit about 9 of the rollers in my hair, and I&#x27;m glad I have a few extra rollers in case I need them for pieces I missed. After about 20 minutes of letting these rollers do their magic in my hair, I was ready to take them out, but when I took the clips off of the rollers, they basically fell out without me tugging because they made my hair smooth.. and I was left with a lot of volume, shine, and my hair looked like I just got done with a celebrity photo shoot. However, my hair wasn&#x27;t very curly. The ends were a little, but it just made me look like I had wavy hair/loose curls. Also, I put my hair in these rollers around 5:30 and around 9:45, my waves/loose curls were gone and I was left with what my hair looked like before I put the rollers in. Maybe I need to put more hairspray or some mousse to keep them lasting everyday, but I guess I&#x27;ll just keep practicing and see what works best. I would recommend these hot rollers for any woman who doesn&#x27;t have the time to take 2 hours everyday to get beautiful hair. I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because I am beyond happy with my results with these rollers.. I just need to figure out a way to keep my waves/curls lasting all day!</li>
    <li> I have been trying different hot rollers, my hair is long and thick so I needed the jumbo, large just wasn&#x27;t working. these heat up pretty quick and give me a slight curl.</li>
    <li> Item delivered quickly. I have thick waist length hair. It was easy to roll, set and style. The curls did not last a long time. Hopefully, it&#x27;s just me. Will keep practicing with the rollers.</li>
    <li> Efficient, very nice product</li>
    <li> I will never recommend as it did not work even for one day, It is not fair, I want replacement .......</li>
    <li> Heat up fast and work well on my hair! Since they don&#x27;t have clamps to hold them in, I just throw a shower cap over and go on about getting ready and it works great.</li>
    <li> Amazing curlers and so easy to use. Very happy with the purchase and they do not leave lines in hour hair from the clips</li>
    <li> Great set of hot rollers for the price!</li>
    <li> The rollers heat well, but there is no sliding on/off switch as described in user manual (turns on when you plug it in), no wire clips as described in advertisement, only butterfly clips which leave a ridge in the hair.</li>
    <li> I received this product on time and at my house. It works great to get curly hair! Overall this product is amazing!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair and this set works great to add volume and some wave but as far as curls that hold.... I would not say that the set is designed for that. The super jumbo curlers give great body but in my hair the curl comes out quickly. The large (the smaller ones in the set) curl well and add volume so I preferred those. The pros: the set heats up quickly and they work great for body (jumbo) and curl (large). Cons: Not only do they heat up fast, they cool down fast and since my hair is hard to curl.... I need something that stays warm for at least 15 min. These got cold in about 10 which will probably work for MOST other hair types. Also the set is LARGE so it over takes your bathroom work space. Overall I was still happy with the set.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as an addition to another set of Conair Heat Rollers, I have long full hair and one set just didn&#x27;t get it done.  This was a nice addition and works great.</li>
    <li> This product heats quickly and does a good job curling your hair.  The clips sometimes need to be adjusted to get them to stay in properly especially with rollers on the top of your head but all in all a nice way to perk up your hair for a new look</li>
    <li> This is my second set. I absolutely love these. The lid on the first set cracked because of travel. Now I have bought the travel version, so these ones can stay put! Just love them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these a few times, and also on another person with a different hair type.  My hair hates holding curl and these rollers fit within that rule.  All the effort of hair product, rolling, sitting and waiting and waiting some more I didn&#x27;t even get a mediocre wave for my troubles. The clips are kind of cheap too, I was expecting a clip that was a little more beefy.&lt;br /&gt;These will probably collect dust until I convince myself to sell them at a yard sale or something.</li>
    <li> My hair does not curl very easily and these heated up quickly and worked really well!  If it hadn&#x27;t been raining last night I think it would have been a great hair night!  Can&#x27;t wait to use them again!!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> These heat up nice and quick. However, they DO NOT curl your hair. They make it nice and smooth and shiny though! My hair is very long, but I think they would provide nice volume on medium length hair.</li>
    <li> Not pleased with these. I needed new jumbo hot rollers and these are the only ones out there from Conair. These are not a suitable replacement for the old jumbo hot rollers fir the following reasons: 1.). There is no longer a power switch on the unit. You have to plug/unplug turn on/off. I had to set up a power strip for ease of on/off control! Now, this unsightly power strip is ugly and in the way! 2.) There are no more metal clips, only plastic ones that are meant to fit around your roller to secure the hair; they are flimsy and don&#x27;t work well AND there is also no place to store them! 3.) These are no longer a full set of jumbo hot rollers, but only 8 of the Jumbos, with 4 Super Jumbos.</li>
    <li> I have used Conair Ion Shine hot rollers for years.  Then my set finally quit working so I found these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, there is no storage slot for the clips - big minus as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there is no on/off switch like my previous Conair Ion Shine set had.  So I have to plug this set in and remove the plug each time.  It&#x27;s just a hassel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair sure could have done a better job than this.  I&#x27;m now looking for a new set that are as good as my previous Conair Ion Shine set.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the reviews, the clips do leave kinks in the hair. These do look out of place compared to the smooth volume of the rest of the style. Plan on pulling out your straightener  to try to get the kinks out when all is said and done.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m one that does massive research before I buy anything. So needless to say, I googled searched, saw all the youtube videos there&#x27;s to see, and read most amazon review and decided to purchase The Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Jumbo And Super Jumbo Hair Setter with Super Clips and Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Multi-Size Hair Setter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as they came in, I put them to the test.  I washed and blow-dried my hair. It&#x27;s long and layered. They were ready to go after 5 minutes of plugging them in. I rolled up sections as I dried it (double the heat).  I also sprayed the dried sections with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Elnett Satin Hairspray Extra Strong Hold.  I used the multi-size rollers for the back to create tighter curls and the jumbo rollers for the front and bangs to create volume and loose waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I finished setting them all, I resprayed.  I put on my make-up, got dressed, and had coffee.  Left them in for about 45 minutes.  They were completely cool to the touch before taking them off.  I was very impressed with the end result. Beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the clips for the Multi-size roller.  They don&#x27;t hold the roller enough to stay in place.  Other than that, great buy!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair. I let my hair air-dry and while still damp, use these hot rollers.  My hair ends up looking like I have had a great &amp;#34;blow-out&amp;#34;.  I do touch it up with a straight iron at times, but his is my second set. I leave one in Florida and have the second set in my family home.</li>
    <li> I bought them for my sister and when they came we tried using them. We read the directions and tried it. The rollers DID NOT get hot and the product did not work. Unfortunate waste of money. Good Luck.</li>
    <li> I only got to use this product once and the second time I tried to use it, it would not heat up even though the power light was on!! Would give it a no star rating if I could!</li>
    <li> works great, love this purchase,</li>
    <li> Great product heats up fast</li>
    <li> Perfect size to smooth and create consistent waves on very thick, coarse, wavy hair., heats quickly, great price. Clips are very cheap and flimsy and there is no on/off switch.</li>
    <li> Clips do not hold - they&#x27;re way too flimsy.</li>
    <li> very very poor. when i first turned the rollers on, there was smoke coming out, and then it stopped heating. would like to get returns but the shipping cost from melbourne to USA is more expensive than the cost of this product. not recommended!</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased this product and was satisfied then, hence I bought more of the product</li>
    <li> I just returned these hair rollers.  I tried using them once, with great results, but the rollers were heavy and hot on my head.  It was not comfortable at all with them in my hair, waiting for them to cool.  The inability to roll them effectively is my lack of experience.  They certainly do add body and bounce to hair after you release each roller the proper way.  I have watched enough Youtube videos to see how they are supposed to be used. I have not tried any other hot rollers, so I have nothing to compare them to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are experienced with hot rollers, then maybe they will work for you.  I have fine, medium length hair.  I use volumizing shampoo and conditioner, so getting some lift and bounce from the rollers was not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend them one way or the other, having nothing to compare them to.</li>
    <li> Hate them! The stupid clips they give you leave folds in your hair. Only thing I like about them is they don&#x27;t burn your fingers</li>
    <li> arrived in timely manner, work well</li>
    <li> Ouch!  These rollers do get very hot but that just makes them hard to handle.  They are ceramic and are heavy -  they fall out of my hair.  There are no &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; on them like most hot rollers have so there&#x27;s nothing to grip your hair.  My hair is fine and I&#x27;ve had to shove Bobby pins under the curlers to keep my scalp from burning.</li>
    <li> Product heats up quickly.  I love the four jumbo curlers!  The clips work very well.  The only drawback is the curlers leave a mark in my hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this item from amazon because of the clips. Many stores carried these curlers but had single wire hair pins. This item from amazon has clips that go around the entire curler. Really like this feature.</li>
    <li> I just wished they had more Super Jumbo ones. They give you soft, huge curls/waves, depending on how long you let it set. Remember to use a heat protection spray as to not fry and damage your hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m all about EASY, big, bouncy curls, so I thought I&#x27;d try these out to replace my dying Revlon curling iron. Watched many tutorials, but still could not create the same curl as with a curling iron. These rollers always left a crease in my hair, even though I bought old-fashioned wire clips like many reviewers said. I returned these &amp; broke down &amp; bought a Sultra clipless iron, and MAN. That did the job. Never looking back. I&#x27;m no way affiliated with Sultra, just one happy customer. Price is good on Amazon, too. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> This set of hot rollers was the exact size of roller I wanted. I wasn&#x27;t look for super tight curls and this size of rollers wouldn&#x27;t provide that anyway. When I first took the rollers out of my hair, they provided beautiful and large waves, giving my hair the volume I had hoped for. Initially, I was very happy with the results. However, I quickly realized the waves would not hold up all day because after a few hours, they had dropped to the point they were non-existant and my hair was almost straight - despite me using hairspray. I didn&#x27;t expect this because my hair is already wavy and it holds curls well. When you initially pick up the rollers after they&#x27;ve heated - they appear warm enough to sufficiently curl hair, but the heat is simply not great enough to maintain the curl all day, hairspray or not. Needless to say, I returned the set and went on to try to the Remington brand of curlers - which I didn&#x27;t end up liking either, because the clips leave dents in my hair. Back to the drawing board!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a volume fiend- I&#x27;m always trying to get more volume any way possible (without looking like Snooki, or course- ew). I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products and curling irons, and I&#x27;ve also used extensions. I find that these rollers do the trick in half of the time that it takes with other products, and with half of the effort as well. You will definitely achieve those big, Kate Middleton-esque, loose curls with these jumbo rollers. The rollers get quite hot (but not curling iron hot), so I wear heat protection gloves when I use them. Overall, these are great- put them in your hair and let them cool off while you&#x27;re doing your makeup and voila! Instant glam.</li>
    <li> i spent over $30 on this product and was so excited to try it and when I received it I tried it on multiple different occasions and it did not work AT ALL! I was very disappointed with this purchase and I&#x27;m absolutely infuriated that I wasted money on this product that doesn&#x27;t even work !</li>
    <li> This is an pretty good product overall, and if you are too lazy to curl your hair, and if your hair is straight I would definitely recommend this. However, if you have frizzy or curly hair, I just want to warn you that it may get to be more work for you than you think. Another reminder, you have less control over how your curls look than you do with a curling iron (not to say that the curls don&#x27;t look natural with the rolls).</li>
    <li> Very nice for those of use with media to long hair!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these! Gives great volume and full wavy curls. They heat super fast and you don&#x27;t have to leave them in for longer than 10 minutes. I used with 18&amp;#34; extension and was able to do my whole head in one round.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money Had to return it dosent curl the hair</li>
    <li> the product had good ratings and was delivered on time and as described. I have purchased Conair hot rollers in the past and they provide consistent heat. The clamp roller clips are a big improvement over the former wire holders.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time using a heat hair rolly thingy. I have to say it wasn&#x27;t pretty, lots of cursing and hair pulling and rolls getting looose. However with practice, it&#x27;s worth the arm acrobats. You really get some nice wide curls! It casual enough for an everyday look and formal enough for a night out or wedding parties. I give it a 4 star for the great curls but not a big fan of the claw like clamps.</li>
    <li> worth every penny, you will need to buy extra clips if you have hair like mine (thick), but really great product, does what it says it will.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it heats up very fast.  I have medium length hair. The large &amp; jumbo size curlers allows me to slightly straighten by very wavy hair.  The curls stay in for about 8 hrs.  Very satisfied with product.  It also comes with  clamps that holds the curlers well.</li>
    <li> I like these curlers as they heat up VERY quickly. I can plug them in, do my make up and they&#x27;re ready to use by the time I&#x27;ve applied my lipstick. My curls stay nice all day! My only complaint is that the clips to hold them in place are a bit flimsy.</li>
    <li> These rollers heat up very quickly. the curls are nice, but they do not last all day. I also would have like storage for the clips.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the Jumbo Heated Setter-Since my hair is long it was great how my hair turn out.  The time it took was a time saver fro me. I really loved it.</li>
    <li> We received this product in time and in perfect conditions. It´s easy to use and is durable. It´s a great choice.</li>
    <li> these con air are the hardest to use. One thing, when these rollers get heated up, you will find it hard to grab these and roll your hair with it. i have only tried this once, when I opened the box for the first time. I never want to try it again!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product was a TOTAL FAIL for me. Based on YouTube Recommendations and Reviews I wanted this to be a hit for me but sadly it was not working out for me. I tried it on my Mid-Back hair length and the curl just wouldn&#x27;t hold let alone stay it would fall out as soon as I took it off the roller. The clips that also came with it were terrible as well since it did dent my hair so the end results for me &#x3D; FLAT DENTED HAIR with no curl at all :( I HAD HIGH HOPES FOR THIS PRODUCT BUT IT JUST DIDN&#x27;T WORK OUT FOR ME. But on a positive note the return of this product was with such ease so thank you so much for that!</li>
    <li> The product  It heats up fast and works well.  The different sizes of rollers provide loose curl  or more curled look.  A little bulky for travel.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had practically given up on trying to curl my hair because it&#x27;s thick and straight, curls just wouldn&#x27;t stay. I thought I would give these a try after a friend recommended them, and I looked up a few YouTube videos. Well I love them, I don&#x27;t use them very often because it takes some time. I usually leave them in about 15-20 mins, run my fingers through the curls, use a little hair spray and voilà!</li>
    <li> This is a great roller set at a great price.</li>
    <li> Great set ... just not so much for me.  I&#x27;ve had the purple set for many years, but thought it would be nice to have larger rollers.  The clasps are different; tend not to hold as well as I&#x27;d like.  My hair is long and very thick, so that may not be an issue for everyone.  The curl is lovely ~ the heat seems hotter than my other sets, but that is not necessarily a negative.  I would recommend this hot set, just not exactly great for me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I have thick, medium long hair and It works wonders. My curls stay in and my hair is bouncy and shiny. Some reviews claim that the clips leave crimp mark in their hair, but I don&#x27;t experience this problem. This product is easy to use, and after only three times I can put all the rollers in in under five minutes.</li>
    <li> Great product but curlers were too large. Had to supplement with old set.</li>
    <li> Love them, wish they had all Jumbo as they really straighten and smooth out my hair very well.  So much easier and better for your hair then irons, just leave them in 5 min and you are all smooth with lots of body.  Don&#x27;t like those purple plastic clips tho, they do make dents if you aren&#x27;t careful.  I think I have figured them out but sometimes you do get a weird dent, the old metal clips are much better but I can&#x27;t find Super Jumbo ones, tried bending my jumbo ones and didn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> These hot rollers are perfect.  They heat up quick and are easy to use.  I only wish they came with those metal clips.  I still love these.  It took a few tries on my hair but I finally found the right was to use them on my hair.  Don&#x27;t give up.  Also if you want loser curls use bigger sections and don&#x27;t leave them on too long.  I take them out in 15 minutes and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> The clips make dents in you hair</li>
    <li> I love it! It was recommended by my stylist since my hair is super fine and straight. This setter helps my hair atleast to be curled for couple hours.</li>
    <li> rollers are much too large for fine hair</li>
    <li> These rollers are great and I believe that every woman should have a set. I love the size of them because I love big and bouncy curls. I would have given it 5 starts if it had an on/off switch, so unplugging can get annoying, but other than that they&#x27;re excellent!</li>
    <li> I tried it as soon as I opened the package and the curlers warmed up very quickly. I have curly hair and bought these to relax the curl and it worked. I was tempted to buy really expensive curlers and honestly i think these do the job. So far so good.The only drawback is that there is not an on and off switch you have to unplug them but I dont have small children so it doesnt matter. These are the biggest rollers I&#x27;ve found so I am very happy.They arrived really fast.</li>
    <li> I love this prodoct!! I can quickly roll my hair up in these and finish my make up while the rollers cool down! Its definitely a time saver for us ladies</li>
    <li> works great for body, but i can&#x27;t ever seem to get curls like the reviewers on youtube. i still use it from time to time to give my hair body and shape. wish it came with more rollers maybe then i could use less hair for each and get more of a curl.</li>
    <li> I have insanely thick, stubborn hair. I got this set for the jumbo curlers, and my other set of hot rollers, though twice as many, doesn&#x27;t have enough to.get all my hair in one pass.&lt;br /&gt;I have straight but frizzy hair, that looks coveted in split ends if I don&#x27;t subject it to hear.&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve been pleased with this set. I do wish there was storage for the clips!!! I&#x27;ve no idea how long before they are gone, and I cannot use the metal pins.&lt;br /&gt;They did heat quickly, as promised. And I agree they do cool really quickly as well.&lt;br /&gt;1 set did get all my hair onto curlers, but with one-year setter, and hairspray- I really needed to pull out an iron for touch up.&lt;br /&gt;If long/dense hair, you&#x27;ll obtain smoother texture, and big waves. For me, they didn&#x27;t last long (compared to my other rookies or an iron), as it &amp;#34;fell&amp;#34; in a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;I think as my original intention of using them to supplement my other rollers, they will be just fine. Not as my sole &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; hair treatment.</li>
    <li> takes a while to heat up</li>
    <li> they work very well for longer hair.  the clips hold the roller securly and one roller has a dot that will change colors whemn rollers are heated. i like this feature because it takes away the gueswork</li>
    <li> These are okay.  They do an adequate job.</li>
    <li> Nice and works great but no regular metal clips and no on/off switch. Either plug or unplug are only option</li>
    <li> I never tried the rollers so can not rate how they were because I returned them when I found out there was no On/Off switch on the rollers. If the rollers are plugged in, they are on and if unplugged off. I wanted to leave them plugged in all the time and use an On/Off Switch.</li>
    <li> Now I have great hair!</li>
    <li> Great item, wife loves it!</li>
    <li> It does what I want it to do, but within the first use the plastic cracked near the logo. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be losing any heat from it, but it only can get worse and I can assume it probably won&#x27;t last as long as it should. I don&#x27;t plan on using it too often but I can provide an update a month or so from now to see if the crack worsens or if anything else happens.</li>
    <li> Love this hot roller set. I&#x27;ve never had one before and this was fairly simple to use and made my hair look super pretty with light curls. Only thing I wish was different is I wish it had come with hot roller pins instead of the clips. Being a newbie I have trouble getting the clips to hold onto my hair, the roller and then the hair on my scalp. It usually flops all over the place which is annoying to have to let it set like that while you&#x27;re trying to get ready. Other than that, I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this Jumbo Roller Set for my daughter for Christmas. I thought it would make a great gift for her since she loves doing her hair and her friends hair. I bought the regular size set and this jumbo size roller set because she has long hair and I thought that she might like to have both sizes because of the different styles she likes to wear her hair in. With the jumbo size rollers you get the perfect size wavy hair. I definitely would recommend this product to anyone looking for the perfect roller set.. Thank You</li>
    <li> I had never used curlers before, in fact I know nothing about hair or how to do anything with mine. This product is truly amazing! After using these curlers I look like I came out of a hair salon or that I had a personal stylist do my hair. These are truly a must buy!</li>
    <li> I wanted these to try out since I had never used curlers before. But I am still learning. YouTube has tons of great tutorials and you can learn quickly. They get hot really quick and your hair DOES look healthier when they come out. Just make sure your hair is clean and doesn&#x27;t have any product in it or you will have greasy waves.</li>
    <li> Great starter set of rollers, they are easy to use and the clips are easier than the pins.  Wish it were a bigger set but for the price these are great.</li>
    <li> It took me awhile to find a place for this little machine.  The times I&#x27;ve used it -- I like it a lot.  My hair is fine, so I do not need to leave the rollers in very long.  The loose curl that I was looking for works fine!</li>
    <li> Size and heat were as stated in the description. I would buy a second set since I need more rollers</li>
    <li> The vendor was great.  Shipped promptly and was just as stated.  However, having been a hot roller customer since the 70s, these fall short of all the other sets i have had.  They do not heat up to a temperature that creates lasting curls, the clips do not keep rollers securely in place and they make bumps in your hair, which ironically last much longer than the curl.  Also, with no area to place clips in the roller set you have to have an additional space to store them.  This is very inconvenient.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
    <li> I had one before, and after years of use and traveling, to top split. It still worked, but I decided I wanted a new one anyway :-)</li>
    <li> My hair is long and super thick. This did not work for me at all!!! Would probably work best for short hair or thin hair. If your hair is thick and super long, don&#x27;t bother wasting your time and money!!!!!</li>
    <li> These did not work for me at all. I was hoping they would eliminate frizz which they didn&#x27;t. I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very good item very good Servis</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and curls last, however please be advised the clips that hold the rollers in place leave marks in your hair.</li>
    <li> These rollers heat up very fast and stay very hot (be careful, it was hard to roll my hair without burning my fingers).  They gave me a lot of body and nice soft curl to my hair.  I do have thick hair, so the curl did not stay in place, and I even rolled only small sections, but it did leave my hair feeling soft with a decent wave.  It also seems like they will not dry out my hair like a curling iron will and since they heat quickly, I can easily roll my hair just as quick as if I used a curling iron and let it sit while I get ready. I&#x27;m keeping these!</li>
    <li> i really like these. heat up a little too hot some times to the touch. but overall am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Not worth your money</li>
    <li> Did not curl my hair. Maybe it was my hair and just didn&#x27;t work good for me.</li>
    <li> I love this because I don&#x27;t have to be super perfect with the curls and I can leave it in while I do my makeup to do its thing. The clips that they come with leave dents in my hair so I bought the old pin type ones and they are perfect. I use it more for body than o so for curls</li>
    <li> I have very long hair - almost to my rear end - and curling my hair with an iron just isn&#x27;t working anymore. These hot rollers are great for long, thick hair.</li>
    <li> I am quite satisfied with these rollers. They stay in firmly, never get tangled up in my hair, and curl nicely. The plastic lid broke much too easily in my opinion (just by opening the lid one morning), and it&#x27;s wobbly now.  However, the product still functions fine.</li>
    <li> My fiance has thick curly hair, and she used this right after it was straighten and it did not do anything to it. Perhaps this is meant for thin hair.</li>
    <li> Loved these curlers for the price! They work well, they just have to be left in for a while to get the curl you really want or else they kinda just kink your hair and it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used electric rollers in  years, but my hair was droopy and I decided to try something new.  I love this set!  It heats in 3-5 minutes, and cools quickly too, so that I can put it away when done.  I like the clips too - much more comfortable then old wire pins.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Best curling stuff ever.. Do not damage my blond hair.</li>
    <li> Not pleased with these.  I needed new jumbo hot rollers and these are the only ones out there from Conair.  These are not a suitable replacement for the old jumbo hot rollers fir the following reasons:  1.). There is no longer a power switch on the unit.  You have to plug/unplug turn on/off.  I had to set up a power strip for ease of on/off control!  Now, this unsightly power strip is ugly and in the way!  2.) There are no more metal clips, only plastic ones that are meant to fit around your roller to secure the hair; they are flimsy and don&#x27;t work well AND there is also no place to store them! 3.) These are no longer a full set of jumbo hot rollers, but only 8 of the Jumbos, with 4 Super Jumbos.  This does not work as well for me as the previous set, with a total of 12 Jumbos; the Supers are too big to snugly fit my hair around them and the rollers struggle for position with the Jumbos to set the hair.  They work, but I am missing my old set of Jumbos!  Tip:  Save those metal clips, because the plastic ones are junk!</li>
    <li> It does get very hot, so be careful. I think it is superior to the other ones I have used, but unlike my Rusk hot rollers, they only included claw type clips that make a dent in the hair rather than the usual wire pins</li>
    <li> the rollers heat quickly and are easy to roll my hair in.  But the clips that hold the rollers in place are hard to get tight so the rollers stay snug against my head</li>
    <li> Like them but there just doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough in any of the sets.</li>
    <li> Nice for the $. Directions could be better. Clips are included.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t seem to get as hot as I need for my thick hair but they do serve their purpose. I only wish they worked better on thicker hair.</li>
    <li> My older set seemed to work alot better</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work.  I might have gotten a lemon, it just didn&#x27;t get very warm at all and didn&#x27;t curl.  I had to return it.  The process of returning it went well though.</li>
    <li> The case is nice, and the rollers are just the right sizes. It heats up in only a few minutes and the rollers stay hot long enough in case I need a little more time.  The only thing I am not pleased with is that the teeth on the clips are so soft that they tend to bend and twik out of place. I don&#x27;t see them lasting for very long.</li>
    <li> I have used hot rollers everyday for years and these are by far the worst ones I have ever used.  They did not heat to a very high temperature and hardly curled my hair at all.  I don&#x27;t even have waves.  They actually made my hair bone straight with a slight curl at the end.</li>
    <li> Did not get hot enough</li>
    <li> This affirmed why I do not bother styling my hair.  I thought I would be able to roll my hair, leave it in the rollers while I got ready, then have luscious, wavy hair for the day.  WRONG.  I have tried to use this a few times thinking it was just me, but each time I took out the roller instead of a springy curl I had a floppy lock of hair.  This last time I even put the lock of hair into a pin curl after I took out the rollers, but it was still just a flop.  This is after waiting for the thing to warm up for 30 minutes (the indicator light never turns off), spraying each lock with setting spray, burning my fingers and ears trying to get the stupid rollers to stay in my hair, leaving the heavy rollers in for an hour, the pin curls in for another 30 minutes, and then taking them down; just a floppy, limp mess.  I have a Caruso hair roller set that I have had since high school.  Whenever I get a whim I can fire it up and have curls that last all day.  I don&#x27;t know how I got seduced into buying this set, but it will definitely be going into the closet with all of the other hair appliances and gunk that did not work as hoped.&lt;br /&gt;I think us girls should have a swap shop for all of the things we buy then do not like.  At least I could empty out the rejects closet.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  12/23/2013&lt;br /&gt;While these are good rollers, I have taken then down to 3 stars versus 5 because now that I have used them a couple of times there are a couple of things that could improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  the roller clips are kind of flimsy and if they were made of better plastic they would hold the curlers in place.  It needs to be thicker and less bendable, the rollers slip out of shorter hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  These are for longer hair, I have a long shag, hair below shoulders, and cannot use these in the crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Hair seems to be slippery when rolling, do not know if it is the coating or what but you need to be able to wind you hair around it at least twice for a good hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It heats up really fast&lt;br /&gt;2.  Stays hot&lt;br /&gt;3.  Roller clamps are a better way to hold the roller in place than other ones, they are like a clamp/jaws&lt;br /&gt;4.  Gives a nice wave, this is for longer hair and it does not come out overly curly as with some other hot rollers, which is what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would NOT pay over $30 for it, I am keeping it and will probably use it more after my layers grow out more in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_______________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the best hot curlers/rollers to buy if you do not want too much of a curl.  They are big enough for a great wave but not so big that people with medium length hair cannot use them.  I have longer hair, past my shoulders, but also layered and the standard size was just too curly.  I love these are they are the perfect size for even longer hair as growing mine outs longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, an excellent buy at $30 with free shipping as elsewhere they are at $50!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a velvety cover and the plastic clips with teeth that cover the entire roller which also is better than just the skinny metal bobby pin type.  It keeps the hair in place and gives great lift from the root up.  Lasts all day and cuts my morning routine by about 20 minutes as I do not curl my hair with a curling iron now.  Dry my hair upside down, pop these in, put on my make up and by than my hair is curled and I am done!about 20 minutes as I do not curl my hair with a curling iron now.  Dry my hair upside down, pop these in, put on my make up and by than my hair is curled and I am done!</li>
    <li> Theses are the worst  rollers I&#x27;ve ever had.  No matter how long I let them heat up, or how long I leave them in, I hardly get any curl.  And the clips are awful. They don&#x27;t stay in at all.</li>
    <li> so so great! They heat up fast and make great curls. I have many different sets of curlers and these by far are my fav!!</li>
    <li> These hot rollers get really hot and the curls last for a long time.  Perfect for thick long hair.  Colors r attractive as well</li>
    <li> I have a pair of Conair heated rollers from many years ago but wanted to get an updated version. The switch from the metal u-clip to secure the roller with your hair to the plastic hair clip style is possibly the worst decision from Conair. The plastic clips do not stay put, and incredibly bulky to store. I have a separate container just for the clips, which pretty much rules out traveling with these ever.</li>
    <li> rollers weigh a ton fall out of your hair I would not buy this product . This product must have been designed by a man with short hair.</li>
    <li> What I wanted and exactly what I needed.  Instant heat means no waiting and ease of use.  Very large rollers means style!</li>
    <li> I had a difficult time locating a jumbo hair setter at my local retail stores.  I was delighted when I found the set on Amazon and the cost was less than what I was seeing at retail stores.  It heats up quickly and gives my hair a loose curl which is what I was looking for.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This instant-heat hair setter is my #1 styling tool (well, right after my blow dryer!). I have fine, curly, frizzy hair, which is not a combination that responds easily to styling products, and these quick and easy curlers make my hair look terrific in no time. I no longer have to go through the tedious task of accomplishing a great look with with a big-barrel curling iron, and the results are always fast and consistent. I recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase a hair setter!</li>
    <li> Nice package with good sizes, convenient to yes. I only think it could heat more, even tough it gets warm very fas</li>
    <li> I have very heavy, stubbornly straight hair that usually won&#x27;t hold a curl.  If I mousse my hair when wet, blowdry upside down, and then roll it with these rollers, the body and bounce survive being shoved under my bicycle helmet on my commute to work.  They smelled a bit like they were going to catch fire the first time I plugged them in, but that problem has abated with a few uses.</li>
    <li> Easy to use product, decent price, however curl did not keep longer than a couple of hours. My curling iron works better... Would not recommend for thick hair.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love the fact it heats up instantly and I can curl my hair in half the time than the older version.</li>
    <li> This is tricky to review because it does work, just not for my hair. The ONLY reason I gave it one star is because it doesn&#x27;t hold curl for my kind of hair: long and thick. When I first take out the curlers my hair would look great but no amount of hair spray would keep them in place. It just wasn&#x27;t enough heat for my thick hair. My hair would be so heavy around the curler that the claw clips wouldn&#x27;t be enough to keep them in place and so I would have to get creative and it would end up leaving a big pinch mark in my hair.  These would be ideal for someone with fine hair. I&#x27;ve switched to a 2 inch curling iron with no clamp that I LOVE.   Bottom line: not for people with thick, long hair.</li>
    <li> Who designed this without an on/off switch?  I have to get down almost to the floor every time I want to plug/unplug to  heat up rollers or to turn off after use. I can purchase an extension cord with a switch-that will look great running across the bathroom counter.  I used my old Conair rollers for a longtime and thought I would just replace them-ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I have had Conair hot rollers for years, without complaint.  I purchased this new one because I thought that the rollers would be bigger than what I have (they aren&#x27;t) and the fast heat up time sounded good.  They do heat very quickly but, understandably, are extremely hot to the touch and I keep scorching one of my fingers.  My biggest issue with this product however is the design.  The clips - they don&#x27;t hold my long hair in place and when they do, they leave marks.  And, they are very inconvenient because there is no convenient way to store the them in the unit.  What a pain.  I just cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think these are that good at all.  I have medium long hair, and these don&#x27;t really hold a curl in my hair.  I have had alot better luck with velcro rollers.  I will keep trying them out though.</li>
    <li> Rollers do not get hot enough to keep a curel.  Older models were much better.  Would not buy another or recommend.</li>
    <li> I think my hair wasn&#x27;t made for this.  It&#x27;s a nice product.  I tried another one in the Conair line, and it worked much better because the curlers were smaller, and after some time, my curls loosened into the size that these would give initially.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many sets of electric hair rollers over the years and so far I like this one the best.  It has 4 extra large rollers and 8 large rollers which work perfectly.  Large hinged clips make it easy to keep the rollers in place.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about purchasing these after reading some of the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with these dry hot rollers. The have 6 large rollers and 4 jumbo rollers.&lt;br /&gt;The clips are flimsy but do the job.  I may try to order extra clips if possible...in case these break.</li>
    <li> The rollers are awesome, but the clips the come with it leave creases in my hair. I would recommend possibly trying the ones with the metal pins rather than the clips. But overall I am very satified and it really didn&#x27;t take much time to curl my hair. My hair type: lots and lots of fair, non-dyed/permed, black, Asian hair.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until after I used them to write a complete review.  I had no problem with crimping or marks on my hair as indicated by previous reviews.  I really like them.  I received them on time exactly as promised.  I would definitely buy these as a gift. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Conair hot rollers for years and when my last set was smashed by Delta Airlines (thanks, Delta), I needed a new set. I bought these, then quickly regretted it because of the plastic butterfly clips that hold the curlers in your hair, rather than the traditional metal clips. Luckily, I still had the metal clips from my destroyed set and they fit all but the four jumbo rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic butterfly clips leave a crimp line in your hair, which is unattractive.</li>
    <li> This product is what I wanted, it is easy to use, easy to care for. I am pretty darn happy.</li>
    <li> I like these roller.  The are large  and although I have short hair, the hair wraps around them  because of the velvet .  I had to get use to using the clips as I had pins with my other conair  hot rollers, but they hold the hair  ok.  It does not take long for them to  get hot.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to really curl my hair well. The clips are flimsy.</li>
    <li> Please add where necessary to items sold from the USA going to other countries that units require transformers in order to convert the required voltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first internet order for an item from the USA to South Africa, only to have the unit burn out as I was not aware that it required a transformer to convert 220V (South Africa) to 120V (USA).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would cost me more to send the unit back and have it replaced, I was really excited for this product, but it no longer works after 1 use.</li>
    <li> The rollers don&#x27;t heat up enough to create a nice curl and the hair clips create funny indentations on the hair.</li>
    <li> It is the direst thing I have ever bought from Amazon.com and I have bought quite a few things. First, when I opened up the box to look at the clips above the curlers. I seen a long strand of hair which was either white or really blonde and I have dark hair but I knew that it couldn&#x27;t have been my hair since I just opened the box. I was freaked out just by that, but my husband said just wipe them down with lysol wipes. So I started to do just that and then I see that the wipe is actually dirty from dirt and dust and then I see the side of the curler container has a glump of dirt with a strand of hair like it has been sitting on a dirty floor then dragged. So I opened up the curler container and the rollers have dirt/dust on the bottom of the container and the rollers. I think I have to return this set. I don&#x27;t want to take a chance of getting anything in my hair or catching something? This really disturbed me, I am a little OCD but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m over reacting.</li>
    <li> The clips that come with it don&#x27;t hold tightly and leave marks or lines in your hair.  It also has no on/off button.  I have had Conair rollers for years and was just replacing a worn out set.  I like the old set better and wish I could still use it.</li>
    <li> Clips it comes with leaves lines in my hair, purchase wire clips.</li>
    <li> I love my hair using these hot rollers. I have amazing body now. I will never use a curling iron again,.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this set of hot rollers in the jumbo size, and the price was great.  Unfortunately, the clips that are supposed to hold the rollers in are flimsy plastic and do not hold the rollers.  They flop and unroll instead of staying clipped.  Also I found that the rollers get so hot to the touch that it is hard to handle them to put them in your hair.  It was a quick turnaround on this one ~ delivered in the afternoon and back in the return mail the next morning.  AMAZON, however, was quick and efficient with the return process :)</li>
    <li> Conair needs to bring back metal pins. The plastic clips are terrible, cheap and break and get crushed during travel.</li>
    <li> Hardto use and did y like how my hair los at the end</li>
    <li> perfect rollers size for my long hair. its so good, i use it almost every day! it gives the &amp;#34;fresh out of salon&amp;#34; look with little to no effort!</li>
    <li> These hot rollers remind me of the ones I used to use back in the 80s and 90s...except they heat up so quickly!&lt;br /&gt;They are hot and ready to go within 2 minutes. The size provides nice large curls for long hair. I leave them in for 10-15 minutes while I eat breakfast and my hair retains the curl for the whole day. The only minor inconvenience is that the clips don&#x27;t come with a storage container. Not a big deal, I just bought a small Sterilite bin and keep them in there.</li>
    <li> These rollers heat up very quickly.  They are ready in about 2 minutes.  I like the super clips (to hold the hair).  They really work alot better than the wire ones.  I can move around and the rollers do not fall off.  I really only use the purple size, but with longer hair the black ones would be needed too.</li>
    <li> these are great rollers especially for people who have really curly hair and want a looser curl!Please dont get these if you want tight curls.</li>
    <li> this hair curler will dry ends of your hair out so badly they look like straw there is no temperature regulating the temperature so it just burns and burns gets hotter and hotter do you want fried hair this is for you</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase. These are just what I have been lookin g for! They give my hair volume...body and shine.</li>
    <li> This proved to be a very efficient purchase, rollers heat up extremely fast and the curl stays, (make sure you do proper &amp;#34;curl prep work&amp;#34; with your favorite hair product.</li>
    <li> These hot rollers are great. They heat up really fast and set hair quickly. You have to be careful where you set them because sometimes they leave crinkles if they move around at all</li>
    <li> I gave this item three stars because, the rollers don&#x27;t warm up very fast and they just don&#x27;t work on my hair.</li>
    <li> Pretty good rollers,&lt;br /&gt;Clips don&#x27;t hold hair.&lt;br /&gt;I had to buy other clips.</li>
    <li> THe clips do not hold the curlers in place and I burnt me head and hands</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive these after researching all hot rollers I could find.  I thought this would be a good fit for me.  Boy was I wrong.  I read and followed all instructions prior to use.  I have long layers and when I used these rollers, they burned my scalp.  I am thinking they were designed for people with shoulder length or longer hair.  Bad experience made good by Amazon customer service.  They are allowing me to return at no charge!</li>
    <li> It does not heat well, not worth the money.</li>
    <li> great curlers but the clips leave crimps in your hair.  need different types of clips that leave no sign of curlers.  curlers get hot very fast but I am rating lower due to the clips that make curling your hair a waste of time, unless you like crimps in your hair.</li>
    <li> Crimped my hair in a funny way along the side and didn&#x27;t hold curl at all.</li>
    <li> Perfect for large curls and for thick hair. The clips don&#x27;t crimp your hair like most clips for big rollers do.</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair turns out and my style lasts&lt;br /&gt;the clips included was a nice bonus too</li>
    <li> Happy with item and delivery, had no problems and my daughter is happy with the item.  would recommend for others to purchase</li>
    <li> Great rollers. They heat up fast. My hair goes all the way down my back and it just takes too long to style.  But this is so quick and easy. Cant beat the price</li>
    <li> I wanted a set of curlers that would give my hair more volume rather than spiral-y curls, and this set is the perfect one.  Most curling sets only offer a few &#x27;jumbo&#x27; rollers, but this kit has almost all jumbo size.  The clips that come with it are the best I&#x27;ve ever owned:  they actually STAY PUT.  My hair always turns out fantastic with these.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have two sets of these rollers as I need more than 12 to put in my long hair.  They heat up pretty quickly.  While I&#x27;m putting curlers from the first set in my hair, I have to make sure to open the lid of the second set otherwise the rollers get a little too hot to work with.  There are clips for the jumbo rollers and slightly smaller clips for the large rollers.  However, the length of the clips are shorter than other sets and this is not so good.  A longer length clip helps brace the roller by leaning on your scalp.  Luckily, I have longer clips from an old set that I can use with them.  Of course, you can pick up plastic claw clips to use too…but they can leave dents in your hair…so don&#x27;t use in visible spots.  Overall, great rollers.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair.  These are the perfect size, heat up quickly and curl hair well.  As others have said, the clips do leave marks on your hair - so you will want to order (or purchase from your local beauty supply) the old metal clips.</li>
    <li> My daughter in law loves these electric rollers I gave her for Christmas.  She has used them everyday and her hair looks great.</li>
    <li> These are so easy to use and they heat up so quickly. I love this hair curler. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great curlers. Easy to use and heat up quickly. People are mega-jealous of my hair when I use them. Highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> I have waist length hair and these barely curled the ends. :( maybe would work better for thin and shorter hair :/</li>
    <li> Bought it on 22nd July 2014, used only twice but it didn&#x27;t heat up despite the orange light being present.&lt;br /&gt;Waited fr 10mins but it still didn&#x27;t heat up.&lt;br /&gt;This is just my 3rd time of usage.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for several months and they are great for adding volume and a little curl to my hair.  I have very thick shoulder length straight hair.  I barely have enough curlers to get all of my hair so if you have long hair, you may need 2 sets.  These heat up quickly which was the selling point for me.  If you&#x27;re wanting mostly volume and just a little bouncy curl, these are perfect.</li>
    <li> These are great. I am terrible at curling my hair. I have really thick long hair with layers. So when I want to dress up, I end up wearing my hair up which just isn&#x27;t as pretty. I tried these out and I LOVE them. I&#x27;ve used them several times now, for my bachelorette party, rehearsal dinner, and to go to another wedding. Big sexy hair my friends! Love it. I keep my clips in a zip lock tuperware (that&#x27;s the only bummer is the case doesn&#x27;t hold the clips too, but easy fix).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very VERY happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I like my new hot rollers, but the clips they send don&#x27;t fit too good. Plus, sometimes I noticed a roller will be extra hot and it is burning so I have to put something under to get it off the skull. Gives great body to my hair.☺</li>
    <li> So quick and easy.  I have super thick, very long hair.  My hair does hold a curl well.  HOWEVER, my step daughter has very fine hair and it did not curl,  her hair usually doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well.</li>
    <li> I had to replace my old rollers after 10 years of use.  I really like this set; the size of the rollers and the clips are great.  I am hopeful that this set lasts as long as my last set!</li>
    <li> These work pretty well on my hair. The clips sometimes leave marks in my hair but, all in all, they are good rollers. They get really hot too, which is a plus, but they can be a little difficult to hold on to.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t bought hot rollers in 20 years or more, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  These heat up quickly and stay hot in your hair for a long time, but you don&#x27;t need to keep them in forever to get the effect.  Clips are good, after you remember to put the longer side on the top to hold the curler up!  Good buy, I&#x27;d do it again!</li>
    <li> I bought it through Amazon because of the clips.  Other places carry wire clips only and they are virtually useless so I don&#x27;t understand why they were made in the first place.  The heating plates get hot in 85 seconds but the rollers do not.  I leave the set on for 10-15 minutes before putting them on my hair. It&#x27;s true that the rollers don&#x27;t get as hot as those made in the 80&#x27;s.  I guess it&#x27;s because of the lining and the jumbo sizes.  They work well for my long and wavy hair.  The rollers tame fly away and give volumized soft curls.  Some users said it doesn&#x27;t curl their hair at all.  If you have naturally fine and straight hair, I&#x27;m almost certain it&#x27;s not a product for you.  When I opened the set for the first time, I understood why people complained about the clips.  The claw part of the clips are flimsy and I thought they would break at any moment. So far I have used the set for 10-15 times and they are still intact. Conair should re-do the clips and it would receive a 5-star.</li>
    <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use this product but i&#x27;ve watched so many youtube videos and it&#x27;s still not giving me the results I want.&lt;br /&gt;the clips leave creases in the hair so they&#x27;re no good. I bought different clips and they still don&#x27;t work well. My hair is always falling out of them.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly.  Lots of large rollers.</li>
    <li> VERY HAPPY. CONAIR is the way to go and Amazon had what i wanted as always. Thank you</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT...its everything it says I got it in 3 days and it heats up in (1 min) ive never had anything that heats up that fast...it has some foam on the rollers so your hair stays on it when you roll it up..its just amazing and if it ever breaks I will buy one  again..:)</li>
    <li> Just got them today and used them right away, gave my waist length hair a beautiful curl, more like big waves. Only thing I was disappointed with was they should have included a bag for the clips, no where to store them.</li>
    <li> Great curlers! They heat up fast and the size of the rollers is great.</li>
    <li> Burnt fingers, curlers don&#x27;t stay in, over curls my hair so it looks like the 1960s.</li>
    <li> I was sad that it doesn&#x27;t have an ON &amp; OFF switch. The last set I had did and it was almost exactly the same set</li>
    <li> I have used these almost every day for the past 3 years. They make my hair smoother and fuller, giving a much more styled look. I have longer hair so tend to use the jumbo size with just a couple of the smaller ones for any loose bits of hair. That means I have to put a lot of hair in one roller as there are only 4 jumbo size. I wish there were more jumbo and less of the smaller ones which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, but I make them work anyhow. It gives a fuller look than when using a straight iron. I do put a leave in conditioner before using them as you would with any hot styling tool and using these hot rollers hasn&#x27;t damaged my hair at all.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but they really do hold the curl in a laid-back, beachy look (which is what I wanted).  They do get a little hot on my scalp but I place a cotton ball under the curler when I feel the heat. I recommend them</li>
    <li> I really love them.  It makes quick work of styling my hair!</li>
    <li> These Hot rollers give great volume and big curls that are very fun and flirty for a night out or even a day at work</li>
    <li> There rollers are great.  They heat up quickly and they curl my rather rough hair perfectly.  There is a tony bit of a learning curve on how to set your hair using the clips that come with it but otherwise, after a few times, I&#x27;m already getting really good at using these in the most effective way.  Great price, great quality, exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one  con that  someone might mention is that these are rather heavy and with a head full of rollers it can weigh a bit, but this does not bother me much.  I love these.</li>
    <li> I have used this Set for years and love it! Especially the large size.  HOWEVER,  my 2nd set just malfunctioned like the first one in thant one of the heater bars gets so hot so fast it starts melting the plastic and burning my scalp!!!  The other bar stops working.  I figure every 2 years I can replace it.  OR maybe Conair can send me a new one?????</li>
    <li> Not the same as the picture. But love it! And stays in you hair pretty good. I&#x27;m able to put them in and do my make-up.</li>
    <li> I have really long hair (past belly button) with layers. right after i take the rollers out, they create really loose curls and last for about 30 minutes. but for the rest of the day, it looks like you styled your hair with a round brush and blow dryer. i reccomend this for people who have layers because it makes them look more polished. one small problem is that the clips leave dents in the hair. they do come out if u comb it with your fingers, but that also makes the loose curls go away. if u want the hair just flipped at the ends, these hot rollers are good for u :)</li>
    <li> After having the same set of rollers for ages, my old set finally died.  They were so old that a replacement product wasn&#x27;t even offered so I scoured the internet looking for a new set.  I was worried that I would not be able to find a set that would heat up quickly and curl my hair, but I have been pleasantly surprised with how well these worked.  I also love that they are larger rollers so they provide a nice even curl and waves.  And the clips (kind of like a butterfly hair clip) work well too.  Update March 2015 - dropped from five stars to three stars.  I have had these curlers for a little under 1.5 years and today, one whole side of the set is inoperative and will not heat.  All in all paying ~$2/month for the use of curlers isn&#x27;t going to break the bank, but considering my prior set of rollers lasted for nearly 15 years, I am disappointed.   Now I need to decide if I should purchase another set of these knowing that they will probably peter out in about a 15 months or look for another set altogether.  Pity since I did really like them...</li>
    <li> These heat super quick and the result was exactly what I hoped for. I have long hair that is super thick and these give the soft look and slight curl but also smooth the hair. So easy to use just wish the clips were a bit stronger.</li>
    <li> Does exactly like it should. It heats up fast and I love the fact its all the big rollers and no small rollers. The one thing I didn&#x27;t like is the clips. It&#x27;s pretty flimsy and some of the teeth got bent as I was clipping them on the rollers. Just be careful as you use them.</li>
    <li> Love this roller set, heats up in a jiff, just takes some practice to get the results you want. Cannot complain!</li>
    <li> I like the idea of hot rollers, but xtreme heat is stretch.  I let them heat up for 20 minutes and after putting them in my hair, they were cool after 10, so I left them in longer but it didn&#x27;t matter.  Not much curl.  Takes as much time as using a curling iron with less results.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of very thick, very coarse long hair. Unless I roll it, it gets frizzy. The jumbo rollers give me just enough body and curl to look great, but without looking like a curly-head. I love this product. I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I have used hot rollers in the past, mostly smaller ones, and was always disappointed because of the weird and unnatural curl I am left with. After watching tons of YouTube videos I decided to buy these rollers, and I love them! I have pretty thick hair and when my hair is completely rolled I still have 3-4 rollers left over. These rollers are really great for smoothing out hair and leaving it shiny. It takes me about 5 minutes to put them in my hair and then I let them set for about 20-25 minutes while I do my make up. When I take them out, my hair is left with tons of volume and really pretty waves. I love these rollers!</li>
    <li> I used heated rollers years ago and they worked really well.  I wanted to use them again and these are great.  I will recommend them to everyone.  Price was also very good.</li>
    <li> I just wish this hot roller set had also come with the other kind of clips. The metal ones. Otherwise, it works great!</li>
    <li> I was exited to use these hot rollers. I opened the box, It looked like it had been opened before.&lt;br /&gt;At the bottom of the container and around the rollers, there were pieces of hair! Yuck!!&lt;br /&gt;It was so nasty I had to return them.</li>
    <li> I read a couple of reviews from people who have had the same problem I have. Althought I love how these rollers work, I have had 2 sets break on me after about a year of use. One of the heating bars stops working and the other one gets so hot that it melts all of the rollers. Wierd. Strange that it happened with both of the exact same sets I bought.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my friend is crazy about this product &amp; it gives her hair very good volume &amp; style. The first time my friend tried it in my hair, it didn&#x27;t work. We think it&#x27;s because we didn&#x27;t have the right styling products. After watching tons of youtube videos &amp; reading all the possible reviews, I finally bought it. And boy, was I very disappointed! Armed with all the possible styling products, my hair would only have that \\&quot;good volume &amp; curl\\&quot; for a good 1 hour. I keep the curlers hot for the longest time I can but it still wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair even if I apply the styling products as generously as I can. This would probably work for girls with not so thick hair, but if you have really thick hair, don&#x27;t even think buying this product. And now I can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s past its return days. I&#x27;m stuck with it!</li>
    <li> Takes a bit to heat up, not impressed with the heat it reaches.  Clips are weak to say the least. For the price it is what it is.</li>
    <li> Does work, but the rollers are quite hot so I leave them off the posts for a minute before putting them on my head.  It&#x27;s okay, just not what I had expected.</li>
    <li> Barely put a slight wave in hair.  No place to keep clips. Cannot return item now either.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described!</li>
    <li> It heats up really fast and doesnt damage your hair due to the covering on the rollers. The clips make a little dent in the top of hair but I just touched up top with flat iron.</li>
    <li> These rollers burnt my scalp, clips didn&#x27;t hold and curl only held for about an hour. had to return this.</li>
    <li> Never too hot......fast and easy and don&#x27;t damage hair.</li>
    <li> These are okay curlers.  They don&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
    <li> Leaves dents in your hair. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great although I&#x27;ve always preferred the metal u - shaped pins over the plastic claw clips but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and thin and they were much too heavy and wouldn&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
    <li> Love the size of these rollers but unless you like to be tortured with burned fingers ears and scalp I say...NO WAY!  I have subjected myself to these 3 times and 3 times is the charm, eye opener for me.  Never in my life have I had curlers get SO HOT as to not be able to be handled at all.  I will try another kind of set and if they turn out to be the same, I will go to the hair salon whenever I need my hair styled.  Cannot understand the high reviews this product gets.  I usually give anything Conair a 5 star but I just can&#x27;t these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anybody know the customer service email address for amazon that actually works?  When I go to this order it says time has past to return and does not have the contact us button.  I believe that I have a defective set.</li>
    <li> Seems like a great product!</li>
    <li> These curlers are wonderful! They heat up really fast and are easy to use.  Make really nice curls and lots of volume, too.  Can&#x27;t beat the price for this &amp;#34;gotta have&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> It does what is promisses (waves and curls) but it looks cheap to me. My mother used to have one from GE, like 30 years ago, and it was much better quality. I have a lot of hair, thick, and the amount of rollers seems to be ok, the diameter of the rollers too. I order this one without seeing it in person as I havent seen other brands either, so I cant make comparisons. It&#x27;s not very bulky, easy to store. The clips are extremely cheap too, but do the job.</li>
    <li> Love them and there are just enough to do my whole head and my hair touches my lower back.</li>
    <li> Quick heat up and large rollers are great.  I have several sets.  Only thing I dislike is that the plastic top always cracks or comes off.&lt;br /&gt;I like the superclips that come with it, but they are flimsier than they were in the past.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these hot rollers for about a year. I use them on my thick, medium long hair on a regular basis, usually right after I&#x27;ve washed and dried my hair. Using hot rollers is my &amp;#34;quick fix&amp;#34; hairstyle- put them in, take them out, run my fingers through it, go! I like the fact that they have the velvety surface against my hair and they definitely don&#x27;t damage my hair. If I want the curl to last, I use a spray on heat styling product prior to putting them in. I get a &amp;#34;soft curl&amp;#34; with these-definitely not really curly- but that&#x27;s what I want, generally speaking. I don&#x27;t particularly like the way the slice down the middle of the curlers (where it fits on the bar to heat up) can impact my hair making a &amp;#34;dent&amp;#34; in it, but I&#x27;ve learned to work around it. I had to buy the super clips myself with my set, so nice to see that they&#x27;re now including those. Both the super clips and metal clips can leave marks if you&#x27;re not careful. I always have a curling iron heated up to quickly iron any of those out. You get better at putting the rollers in and avoiding the marks over time. I really wish the lid of the unit had a little something the grab onto to open it-I end up having to use two hands a lot of the time- but that&#x27;s minor.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a nice set for soft curls.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS...-- They heat up fast and there is just enough of them to give my hair curly waves... the clips make it easy . I tried a curling iron .. and just to hard to reach the back efficiently .. this makes it way easier .. Its a good buy!</li>
    <li> I was very happy to get these Xtreme Jumbo electric rollers for a major deal here on Amazon.  The rollers arrived very quickly and so far, my hair is loving the awesome curls these rollers provide.  I highly recommend the Conair Xtreme Jumbo &amp; Super Jumbo Hair curlers for anyone with long hair.</li>
    <li> How can I even rate these if they won&#x27;t stay in my (not short) hair??  I&#x27;m getting rid of them</li>
    <li> I love them! I have been on the fence about buying hot rollers but decided to give it a try and am glad I chose this brand!</li>
    <li> Curlers are great heat up fast. Don&#x27;t buy pins as they come with them. They have large and small just wish they stayed on better.</li>
    <li> It never worked because the power is not suitable outside the US. I tried all electricity devices in vain. Disappointing</li>
    <li> Love the clips, especially. They leave no awful marks like most others. Conair  makes my fave heating rollers. I am equally pleased with this jumbo set.</li>
    <li> They work wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I really like these curlers the new ones come with the clips that aren&#x27;t those metal ring ones. They are a great because they hear up quickly and give really nice curl! I find that I have a little trouble keeping the jumbo ones in place and that&#x27;s annoying. But they are great for the price and really wk. I&#x27;m researching ways to keep them more secure on top!</li>
    <li> Read the reviews, liked the idea of the larger rollers and the fast heat up.&lt;br /&gt;The Good: the rollers heat up very fast, good large size.&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: Clips don&#x27;t hold rollers in my hair so the rollers fall out. There is no storage for the clips. The set does not last long in my fine but thick hair. Maybe a few hours if I use lots of hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have pretty long thin hair (comes down to under my chest) and these work great to just give me a bit of body and make it look like I woke up showered and did my hair when I didn&#x27;t. They take a little getting used to as I had never used hot rollers before, but after about two times using them I was a pro. The clips they come with are awesome and super easy to use as well.</li>
    <li> I loved the product, it gives you amazing curls and gets rid of any frizz. Easy to use and well worth the money</li>
    <li> I have a hard time to keep my hair curly longer than one hour. I used this product (and a lot of hairspray) and it lasted all night. I love the large, soft waves.</li>
    <li> First time used it worked, and made nice curls. but the item doesn&#x27;t go hot anymore. Don&#x27;t know why, and tried checking everything that possibly could be causing the issue unable to find one.</li>
    <li> The product no longer has an on/off switch although the directions indicate that it is there!?  The hair clips are completely useless and do not hold the curlers.  The heat up time is good but the curlers will not stay in your hair!</li>
    <li> These rollers have the same great quality of my old Conair travel rollers from the 80s; however, the cheap plastic clips on these things will not hold your hair, that is unless you have  baby fine, thin hair,(I have thick course hair) then they may work. The metal clips I ordered after reading the reviews are too small, which leave the rollers almost unusable. I think I&#x27;m going to just sent them back rather than going through the trouble of searching for proper metal clips, like the old rollers used to have.</li>
    <li> this was a replacement set for me, had my other one for four years and use it almost daily.  nice size rollers and heats up fast and really holds a nice big curl or to add volume to your hair.</li>
    <li> I have mid length long hair, and these rollers with the clips would not stay in place.  Also the indicator button letting you know the rollers were on or off did not work!</li>
    <li> My hair is long to the middle of my back i figured since it is not extremely thick it would be fine but they still do not heat all the hair up i wrap it and wrap it and clip it and leave them on long but the curls are not locked in good and they dont stay long , if they were all the size of the four bigger ones in the middle they would be great but the thinner ones are not fat and thick enough to keep the curl hot and lock in , i would reccomend it for shorter hair maybe shoulder length or a little longer but not to the bra strap length hair.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair and was looking for a hot roller set that would put only a slight curl in my hair after it is blown out.  These rollers fit the bill.  The purple rollers are the smaller of the two rollers and there are plenty of them to cover my head of hair.  I wish the set came with wires as I feel they hold the rollers more securely to your head but the clips work okay and I do not notice clip marks on my hair.  I tried the Frieda set of rollers and that is also a really nice set of large rollers but they were too big for the length of my hair.</li>
    <li> First of all, I am completely inept when it comes to hair. Second, I have a LOT of insanely fine hair. That being said, after watching a couple YouTube videos, I ordered the curlers... and it&#x27;s not too bad! It came with the claw clips, not the pins. I did leave a little dent in the front - I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll figure out how to avoid that eventually. But the curlers heat well and my hair looked really awesome with a lot less time or risk of burn than with a curling iron!</li>
    <li> Great roller set. Arrived in less than a week and get hot quick.</li>
    <li> I have been a hot roller user most of my life and these are a great medium size to add body to my straight hair without the &amp;#34;Shirly Temple&amp;#34; curls.  However, I prefer the old-fashioned wire hooks to these plastic comb clips because the clips leaver dents in the hair if you aren&#x27;t careful how you clip them.  The rollers are lightweight so my head doesn&#x27;t feel weighted down while my hair is setting.</li>
    <li> These are just what I was looking for. They create loose curls and waves that give your hair volume instead of the shirley temple curls. I have fine straight hair just below my shoulders and these stay in great and I did not experience dents from the clips. Highly recommend if you want some volume to straight longer hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this after watching many a Youtube video review from beauty gurus. Nice investment for a busy girl who wants instant volume and effortless, soft curls. The hardest part is waiting for the curlers to cool to get the look!</li>
    <li> These get hot very quick and stay hot for a long time after setting your hair. The case and quality of rollers are nice and the flocking makes them not too hot to handle and roll nicely. The clips are not strong enough.  I have very fine hair and the rollers are too heavy to stay put so I can&#x27;t walk around while they are in. My hair curls very quickly and holds curl, so I didn&#x27;t leave these in long and still achieved bouncy curls. The first time I used these, I just tousle dried my hair and I saw a lot of crimp marks.  The second time, I blew dry out smooth with a round brush and then used the rollers. The result was much better and very full of volume.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t get warm enough to curl my hair. Terrible purchase. I have thick hair.</li>
    <li> I was very hopeful when purchasing these hot rollers as I have used steam rollers in the past and loved them. However, these curlers  did not work anywhere near as well.  Very hot and very little curl imparted to the hair no matter how long you leave them in. A big disappointment.</li>
    <li> Been using these rollers for years.  I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t do well w/blow dry...LOVE these.</li>
    <li> The curlers do not work as well as expected.  I also do not like the clips that hold the curlers.  They leave &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34; marks in the hair.</li>
    <li> I bought these rollers, because my friend uses the smaller ones and loves them. Her curls last for 3 days so I figured the big ones would be great for my thick, very long hair. I tried it yesterday and left them in until they were completely cold. After I took them out, I immediately sprayed hairspray in my hair to make the curls last. Half an hour later, the curls were almost gone, leaving my hair frizzy. My hair is naturally curly -very curly- and usually curls last forever in my hair. Looks like these work for fine hair, but not for thick hair.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about this set until I got it.  It&#x27;s probably the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  Curlers are the right size and hold the hair without slippage when applying them.  The clips have the right tension and keep the curlers secure without giving me a headache like the pins do.  Overall very good.</li>
    <li> Love them they fit in with my weekend plans and do a wonderful job with my hair and so easy.</li>
    <li> I bought these with really high hopes and was so excited when they arrived. Usually, if a product doesn&#x27;t work out for me, I will still find a use for it and keep it around.But I was so disappointed with these that I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The rollers heat up almost instantly. But that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The clips that come with it are terrible and do not hold the roller in place. Hair starts to slide off from the side of the rollers. And the clips are just not ideal for holding the rollers in place. And if you have lots of hair or really long hair, the clips will not hold the hair and roller in place, it just won&#x27;t support it. I personally prefer the other kinds of clips over the flimsy ones provided with the set.&lt;br /&gt;The opening of the roller that allows for the rollers to get attached to the heater has a weird design so that hair get tangled and caught up on the sides. It is very hard to unroll the hair when some strands get caught, it completely messes up the entire curl.&lt;br /&gt;Although the rollers heat up quickly, they cool down just as quick too. By the time I get to the last 2 or 3 rollers, they are already cool.&lt;br /&gt;And finally, there is a nasty smell that is emitted when the rollers get hot. For people who are sensitive about smells, this will definitely bother them. It made me a little nauseous even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to someone with long hair. My hair comes down to my navel so it is quite long. And please do not think I didn&#x27;t give this a chance. I tried using the roller set 5 different times before I gave up on it.</li>
    <li> it says 85 second heat up wrong try 15 minutes. the directions say turn the switch to on there is no switch</li>
    <li> They are okay, I have used better</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair and it takes forever to curl with the traditional curling iron. I&#x27;ve ever bought a Miracurl to try to speed things up but nope, still takes forever and doesn&#x27;t look half as a good as when I use these. They are the large and jumbo sizes so I get different curls around my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well so without any pre heat hold products such as bumble &amp; bumble styling spray, I get big waves and volume with these curlers left on for about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my routine for when I want to use them:&lt;br /&gt;- Plug it in before shower&lt;br /&gt;- Shower, tower dry hair, use heat protectant such as Tresemme or Moroccan oil or Phytolisse serum, then dry my hair. Hair has to be completely dry before using rollers&lt;br /&gt;- Put in rollers (I have a lot of hair so I end up using the entire thing) for middle, left and right sections&lt;br /&gt;- Put on my make up (takes me about 10 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;- Take out rollers&lt;br /&gt;- Fix, then set curls with holding spray&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Super clips are awesome and way better than pins.</li>
    <li> Enough rollers for long hair. They heat very fast. They are easy to put on without burning my fingers. Loved the clips that came with rollers too.</li>
    <li> My wife saw this at a friend&#x27;s house and tried it before we purchased this.  It is easy to use and does a good job.  Her hair is very thick so normally it is a difficult task for her but within a few minutes, she was able to use it and finish her hair and it does not take too much countertop space which was an important factor.</li>
    <li> I used these in conjunction with another larger roller and the whole combo worked for my hair.  I am replacing the clips with the old school wire ones so I can avoid that problem.  Heated well and created a curl that lasted all day.</li>
    <li> Heat up really quick and works well.  I use larger clips from a previous set.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly (but not quite instantly), mine take about 4-5 minutes. Curls well and I like the jumbo size. The texture of the roller holds hair well and doesn&#x27;t burn your fingers. BUT... they have got to do something about the clips. They hold the roller in place well, however, they leave horrible kinks on the hair. I have tried using the clips in every possible way but every time I have used these rollers I have had to come back with my flat iron and straighten out the kinks, trying to leave the curl at the end. Needless to say, it&#x27;s a pain in the @$$. So I wont be using them again until I can find some clips that will work.</li>
    <li> as a new mom i was looking for some way to still be cute and maintain my hair.. i thought i had to give it up... this is a quick easy practically dumby proof way to look amazing !!! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I think I might just have hair that will never curl because I purchased a curling iron last year and it never made my hair curly. After purchasing this, I was optimistic but it just doesn&#x27;t work. I left it in for a massively long time and when I took it out, there were no curls and my hair was still completely flat. It&#x27;s a shame because I really wanted this product to work but what can you do? Perhaps my hair is \\&quot;uncurlable\\&quot;. The one serious complaint I do have with this product is how hot the curlers are to touch. I understand they&#x27;re supposed to be hot but my mother uses a curling set and she can touch them with her bare hands. I could NOT touch these with my hands because when I tried, they seriously burned my fingers. I actually had to use gardening gloves to put them on and it was pointless anyway. Sorry to say this product failed for me but I still like Conair products in general.</li>
    <li> Replacing an old set of Conair rollers and purchased these. Nice big rollers for longer hair and the bonus is that you get the plastic clips, which you used to have to purchase separately . The rollers heat up quickly as promised and are easy to work with. These rollers don&#x27;t damage the hair either like curling irons or Velcro rollers and do a better job in less time. Good product and value.</li>
    <li> Bought these on a whim for my wedding day. I needed great volume for an up do and these did the job. In fact, once I took them out, my waves were so big and beautiful I considered wearing my hair down. They heated up quickly and gave a great look. Used on below shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> The rollers are NOT big at all as Promoted! They are regular &amp; small sized. They also dont heat up as much as I thought the minimal persistent heat is not enough for all day curls. Not Pleased at all.</li>
    <li> I had to send these back. I was sorry to return them, but they burned my scalp. They came in the usual plastic case that is good for home use, but not travel. The clamps though not as sturdy as the ones that I bought separately years ago, where included. The size was good for long hair. However the first time that I tried the rollers, I had to take the front two out after a few seconds, they actually burned my scalp! Then the back curls when I took the rollers out, didn&#x27;t hold the curl! May be good for some people but not for me. I have medium- length, fine hair</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work! I use it once, there was smoke and it smelled burnt... Since then it doesn&#x27;t work at all!! Can be very DANGEROUS!! Definitely don&#x27;t recommend, unless you want to burn your house! I&#x27;m very disappointed that Amazon leave this kind of seller continue to sell this product on their website!!</li>
    <li> These rollers don&#x27;t slide onto heated circular sticks like the traditional rollers. These slide onto a row-like heating apparatus, so instead of a circular hole in the bottom, they have two giant openings up both sides, which when your hair wraps around, leaves a weird, crimp-like effect, instead of a smooth curl.</li>
    <li> I regret this purchase. The rollers are overly heavy and the clips are very weak. The clips won&#x27;t hold the rollers tight enough to keep volume at the root. I&#x27;ve been using velcro rollers and they&#x27;re so time consuming that I thought this might be a better option.&lt;br /&gt;These rollers create a style I could best describe as &#x27;mushroom head&#x27; flat at the top with a full ring at the bottom.</li>
    <li> It is great product my wife and my duagther loves this. It is great product for the money you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> works great but I wish there were more of the large rollers&lt;br /&gt;heats up fast and the clips work great</li>
    <li> The rollers with clips work great on my long wavy hair. It creates some curls that overnight drop and look wavy which was exactly the look I was going for. Highly recommend it to anyone that wants curls without damaging your hair.</li>
    <li> I have quite long hair and an intolerance for spending more than a few minutes setting my hair. I love this set--actually have two plus another I keep at a son and daughter&#x27;s home out of state. I use the four jumbo rollers on the crown of my head and section fairly large sections of hair and use the smaller rollers. I leave in for about 2 minutes, pull them out, tease the crown a bit and am out the door in no time. Great product for me!</li>
    <li> I like how my hair has a lot of volume and I&#x27;ve purchased two of these unit the past 6 years.  What I don&#x27;t like is the plastic cover tends to crack and break apart.  So I removed the cover and throw a towel on the hot rollers to keep them hot as much as possible.  I agree I don&#x27;t like the hair clips the white plastic or the metal clips.  I actually use the big brown clips that have big teeth and you can get it at a swap meet.  Make sure to get the thicker kind and the clips work great on the lavender rollers. This way you don&#x27;t have the marks and they are cheap to replace.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine, straight hair and lots of it.  I was not looking for tight curls, just loose curls, bounce, body and wave and these rollers have performed better than I could have hoped.  They heat up quickly and it takes less than 10 minutes to get them all in.  I don&#x27;t find huge dents from the clips...some curls left a small mark but I think I just need to place them better and it was not a reason not to purchase.  They slip out of my hair easily with no catch and tangles.  For me the body (not the full curls) holds without hair products until I wash my hair again 2-3 days later.  Very much recommend if your hair is similar as I have described mine and you are looking for similar results.</li>
    <li> I have always used these Conair rollers and purchased an additional set to keep at another location. If you look at the picture closely, you will see that this new model does NOT have an Off/On power switch. The set automatically begins to heat as soon as it is plugged in and obviously must be unplugged to cool. This seems like either a serious design flaw or an attempt to save money in the manufacturing process. Either way, it is unacceptable and I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> These are good for volume but they were too big for me to get any curl. The clips are terrible, they dent your hair, but the curlers are too big for any of the other clips on amazon.</li>
    <li> Well, when you have 3 kids and try to get yourself put together in the morning, this is the quickest set of rollers that i&#x27;ve used that gets hot in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it takes awhile for them to cool down, so i usually set my blow-dryer to cool and go over my head to set the curls. Another trick is that i set the roller, take it out, and clip the curl with long-clips. This keeps the curl and lets it cool much quicker. No snagging, the velvet lined rollers make it easy for removing.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like them, they never heat up. my hair was straight and ugly. I would not buy them again.</li>
    <li> This set is more compact that a previous, but similar Conair set, and I like that a lot.  The interior open housing is much easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, this style of Conair elec. curlers heats very fast, and takes just a minute to curl for a quick finish in styling hair.</li>
    <li> Lasted barely a year... then it started severely overheating on just ONE of the heating elements (of 2) and everytime I plugged it in it started to smell of burning plastic.  The thing began charring the rollers and making them so hot they burned my fingers (and I can only imagine what they would do to my hair).  My hair tech said my hair &amp;#34;looked unusually dry&amp;#34; the last time I saw her, so... into the trash they go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY reason I gave them 2 stars (instead of 1) is because the roller sizes are great - and the unit gave me about 10 months of no trouble.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Just takes some practice tk figure out how to place the curlers in my hair so that when unravel them, I like how they look. I just wish the clips came with a holder or something. But at least there are actual clips instead of pins.</li>
    <li> going to buy another one its nice!</li>
    <li> I like these.  I wish however that they came with wires instead of plastic clips.  They kink my hair and are a little harder to handle.</li>
    <li> Be careful not to get the ends of your hair into the slots where the roller sits on the heating unit.  FRIZZY knots.</li>
    <li> I really love the body these rollers give my hair. I have pretty long hair and I don&#x27;t get much curl from the rollers.</li>
    <li> Um I just gave myself a &amp;#34;blowout&amp;#34; look while getting ready for work. pop these in,make my coffee, get dressed, pull them out and look like a super model!</li>
    <li> clips are a little flimsy</li>
    <li> First time using it out of the box was used in a serious time crunch. I had to heat up the curlers while getting everything else ready.  It was used on dry hair quickly sprayed with light hair spray.  The curlers were put in and taken out within 25 minutes, and the result was amazing.  Soft large curls, I couldn&#x27;t have done better with a curling iron! I prefer to use them with dry hair rather than wet, as they are kind of heavy and the heat from the curler wont dry your hair very fast.</li>
    <li> It heats fast,the rollers are the large size which is just right for long hair,It was shipped and here quickly.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted large curlers as a gift for Christmas and I knew these were ones she would like. Ed</li>
    <li> I am typically a flat-iron girl, but decided to add a little curl to my locks.  I have long hair and wanted a large barrel roller.  These are great.  The 2&amp;#34; curlers really give that wavy, tousled look I was hoping for.  The clips that come with work just fine.  I read that many others were dissatisfied with them, however I haven&#x27;t experienced any issues (other than trying to find a place to store them!).</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Christmas gift for my neice who is in her mid 20s. She loves them and says that they work well. Much easier for her than the curling iron to get all of her hair styled as she wants it.</li>
    <li> Not as nice as my old set of rollers. Sponge is cheaper feeling. I have to leave in hair longer to get curls to stay</li>
    <li> I was looking for large rollers for my long hair (past my shoulders, near shoulder blades).  These worked great.  They have an easy to use system with the clips to set them and they give a nice, soft curl just like I wanted.</li>
    <li> If it&#x27;s body and volume you are looking for these are amazing. They actually make my hair look softer and more luxurious. I have shoulder length hair and it does not hold curl well. But due to my hair length and the roller size it shouldn&#x27;t produce a tight curl which is why I purchased them.  For long hair I would recommend buying 2 sets of rollers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once and my hair was flat within 2 hours. It was for graduation... i was disappointed. my hair still had volume but no soft wave or curl. I maybe i should have set it longer since i have a ton of hair but i waited for the white light as the instructions said. If you are going to buy i would recommend getting stronger hair clips. If you have fine hair the ones included should be good. I should also mention my hair is extremely hard to curl in anyway, haven&#x27;t met a single stylist that could curl my hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE these rollers! They heat quickly and roll well. Great prouct!</li>
    <li> Uses these every day.  Love them.  Perfect size for my hair.</li>
    <li> Incredibly easy to use. However, I had the same issue with the clips crimping my hair. I like the rollers tho so am buying some separate clips to use with it. Too bad they couldn&#x27;t just have sold it with the wire clips that don&#x27;t crimp. The clips that come with this are not well designed. Hence 4 stars and not 5.</li>
    <li> I really like these rollers. I have long hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curls and they are great. I just let them heat up for about 5mins roll op my hair and let them cool to set (20-30mins) I get the kids dressed and my makeup on and viola! I have great volume and Super Model Hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already recommended these to girlfriends. I just with there were say 2 more of the super jumbo and 2 more of the jumbo rollers. just because I have so much hair. But I make due!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t grab my layered hair and the rollers do get hot.  Sticking with the good old fashioned round brush and hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This product heats up fast and is easy to use.  Works as you would expect them to work.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try these.  Was looking forward to having wavy hair.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried these several times and the curl didn&#x27;t hold at all after leaving the curlers on for more than the recommended time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned them obviously.......</li>
    <li> I know a lot of reviewers claim to love the clips with this set, and they claim not to get dents with these... but I get dents in my hair every time I try using these. Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set seems pretty high quality, and the curls definitely stay, assuming you use the right product in your hair to start with. But so far I haven&#x27;t accomplished big, bouncy curls with these, because of the denting issue.</li>
    <li> These are great!  Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Wife bought this to replace an older model which finally gave up after 8 years.  Works great for her purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She uses it to smooth out her wavy, almost shoulder-length hair, which has a tendency to frizz, and to give it volume.  The jumbo and super jumbo rollers (and large rollers, if you have some) work well for this purpose, necessary in hot humid Florida.  (Don&#x27;t need those wimpy medium and small rollers you find on other hair setters.)  It doesn&#x27;t have enough rollers (12) so she adds extra rollers (6 more) as she uses the hot ones.  (Always save your old setter&#x27;s rollers and clips for this reason.)  This works out because the setter heats so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She doesn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;claw&amp;#34; clips so she uses the clips from two old hairsetters.  One style resembles wooden clothespins (came with the old model); the other style resembles a large hairpin (came with an even older hair setter).  The hairpin style works well for that front roller on the top of your head; put the clip on the roller backwards, open end towards your forehead (clip is too small for the super jumbo roller, use the jumbo roller).  Also, be sure to hairspray each segment of hair before you roll it and spray your whole head after all the rollers are in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair setter doesn&#x27;t have an on/off switch (the old model did) but if you read the instruction sheet, it clearly states you should unplug the unit when not in use for safety reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a 4-star rating.  Heats up fast and gives a smooth, long-holding result.  The suede-type rollers are more comfortable than the hard plastic ones.  The only negatives (and these aren&#x27;t deal-breakers) are the &amp;#34;claw&amp;#34; clips and the lack of enough rollers (you can buy more clips and rollers) which keep it from a 5-star rating.</li>
    <li> Nice, but I was disappointed that they were not larger rollers.  They are very nice though and worked beautifully.</li>
    <li> These are very nice! They stay well in your hair and give you a really cute curl! Heat up fast and easy to place in hair!</li>
    <li> These got waay too hot for me, a lot hotter than I remember heated rollers ever getting in the past.  Used them once and returned them.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE! I have long thick hair &amp; they work perfectly. I don&#x27;t set them for long (15 mins max) so I get more volume than curl. The photo is after 10+ hours of wear.</li>
    <li> Waste of my time and money. It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair at all. Even with product in and 30 to 45 mins in my hair. I was very up set. But I&#x27;m returning it for another product that may help me better get the results and finish a want.</li>
    <li> The curl doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair whatsoever.  And my hair normally holds curl really easily since I have naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Very quick and easy to use.  They get very hot.  Great purchase...</li>
    <li> These do not get as hot as my revlon velvet rollers. I cnt get a curl w these. I dnt recommend these. Spend a little more &amp; get a better set. I like the clips. They dnt leave marks in my hair. Since they have 1 side thats longer &amp; goes on the underside the rollers. Shorter side holda ontop of ur hair.</li>
    <li> I say if you buy these,give them longer try than a few tries. This is the second time I bought these and returned them the first time without having patience. They require some practice to perfect the technique. I think they are good quality,heat up quickly. Depending on hair length and thickness whether or not these will be have enough size variety for you.I like jumbo and super jumbo for volume and soft curls. I originally tried these on my longer hair and gave up to quickly. I now have medium hair ,shoulder length with layers. Not used to it quiet yet,cause i typically have longer hair. I do not like straight  hair on me so I take the time to curl and style and have for 20 plus years. So I know how to do hair and take it seriously,like, I&#x27;ll be late if my hair looks like crap cause thats more important! So still trying to perfect these rollers,but, I like the volume they give for sure. Im giving it a few more weeks and then possibly update. I think they are worth trying.</li>
    <li> The most curl I got from these was a little &amp;#34;swoop-y-ness&amp;#34;. Very disappointed because i saw a review on Youtube where a girl used these on thick black very very long hair and it worked great. I have fine blond hairs (but lots of them) that only goes to my shoulder blades and I ran out of curlers and hardly got any curl at all! I left them in for an hour to be sure they had cooled. NO luck. I do, however, love the wide clips they come with; much better than the old kind.</li>
    <li> pretty great! I purchased 2 of the same product!</li>
    <li> The curlers heat up in no time, and the clips are great. I have very long thick/coarse hair and these curlers are the perfect size. I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I bought these curlers because of their larger size.  i thought they would be good for the loose waves that are popular now.  They do a good job, but I have a lot of trouble getting the clips to hold the curlers in place.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this set of hot rollers after reading all the reviews because I didn&#x27;t want curls, I just wanted fullness in my hair (which is about shoulder length). I did not receive the Super Clips as advertised - I received the wire type holders which didn&#x27;t work well at all.  The rollers are too big/heavy for that type of holder and most of the rollers kept falling out.  I was going to return the rollers, but instead decided to purchase super clips and try again.  The rollers definitely work better with the super clips (very diasppointed that the seller didn&#x27;t include these with my purchase). I also don&#x27;t like the velvet-like covering on the rollers.  I think the velvet inhibits the little bit of curl that I did get with the rollers and the fullness didn&#x27;t last very long. I would never purchase this set of rollers again.</li>
    <li> Heats up very quickly.  the clips definitely leave dents in your hair and other reviews suggested buy other clips but I have been unable to locate any that are not the same design.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;m still getting the hang of creating different types of waves but it works, makes my hair shiny, and the clips stay put.</li>
    <li> This is my very first roller set and I am very disappointed!!! The rollers were easy to apply, the result was very nice, but only for ten minutes.No matter how long I keep the rollers on, sometime even as long as half an hour before I take them off, the curls never last. I wish I could return it. Waste of money! Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> Forget about the old fashioned &amp;#34;hot rolled hair&amp;#34; look.  Your locks will be swinging with beauty with this product.  Heats up fast.  Only down side--heats up really hot.  So mind the effects of burning your hands.  If you can deal with that factor--this product is a champ.</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> Love the rollers don&#x27;t love the new plastic clips, using the metal roller clips that came with an older version of this same model .</li>
    <li> I have spent a little money on the wrong hot rollers - so I thought that I would review these so that others will benefit from my experience and hopefully not waste theirs as well.  This is a nice set of rollers with very functional clips; they fit both sizes of the rollers and hold my shoulder-length hair well.  The clips&#x27; &#x27;claws&#x27; are not symmetrical (one side is longer than the other).  You will soon learn which way to put them in so that they stay put.  My hair is fine (but full) and other brands with plastic clips have left ugly crimps in my hair that I had to flat iron out.  Not these; possibly it is the fine width of the tines...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These larger rollers are for body and wave versus curl and saves me a whole lot of time in blow drying my hair with a round brush.  I just dry and set then put on makeup while I let the curlers do their thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been aggravated in the past with rollers that are too hot to handle when fully heated - not these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not too large for travelling (in my world anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving these a thumbs-up.</li>
    <li> I would like for it to heat more and I don&#x27;t like the clamps it comes with</li>
    <li> Heats fast! Great quality product.</li>
    <li> Curlers went out after only a few uses. Amazon would not return or replace. Half of them stopped heating and the other half gets so hot you can&#x27;t pick them up.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty nice set....it is hard to find rollers in a set of more than 4 that are larger sized rollers.  I don&#x27;t like the clips though - they do leave weird dents in the hair....I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try to figure out a way to prevent that; possibly using perm end wrapping papers would help (to cover the hair before the clip is clamped on.  The set heats up quickly and I like the larger sized rollers....I&#x27;m looking for more wave and body in my hair vs a lot of tight curls, and this does the trick.  My hair is about 3 inches past my shoulders.</li>
    <li> No curl. Mark left where clip was used to secure roller.  Completely dissatisfied. I&#x27;m questioning who writes the reviews. In this case the reviews were completely untrue.  Buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The size is just what I wanted and heats up quickly which is so handy!  The only down side to these type of rollers is that I haven&#x27;t figured out how to keep them tight once the hair is rolled.  I haven&#x27;t figured out how the clips included hold rollers tightly in place.</li>
    <li> Rollers get too hot against my scalp. Not sure if it&#x27;s because of inadequate barrel cover or what. Didn&#x27;t like the large clips to hold rollers on. They left &#x27;crimp&#x27; marks in my hair as they didn&#x27;t hold tight enough to my scalp.</li>
    <li> I love these curlers for my long, thick hair. The only thing I wish in terms of product improvement, are the curler clips. They are made of thin plastic and the teeth get easily bent out of shape.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Curls my hair without the damaging heat.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I have hella hair (thick and long!.... *thats what she said?*). It will transform my frizzy and stubborn hair into beautiful, loose curls. I love using these rollers before getting ready because I can just carefully unroll them once I am ready to walk out the door. I am by no means an expert with doing anything with my hair, so the fact that I can use these and tame/beautify my hair in the matter of 15-20 min. says a lot about how easy and convenient this is to use. My only wish is that it came with better clips.</li>
    <li> Clips leave bends in my hair.  They heat up quickly and I love the size but the clips are a terrible idea.  I wish I could buy traditional type wire clips because these plastic comb type allows the roller to move around and then leaves bends at the top of my hair.    UPDATE: I contacted customer service at feedback@conair.com and they sent me traditional wire clips at no charge.  I love the curlers with the regular clips so will change my review to three stars</li>
    <li> Item as described Fast Shipping  A+++++</li>
    <li> Great product.  Could no longer find them in the local stores.  This is my favorite size curlers.</li>
    <li> They are not too heavy but can become too hot if left sitting for too long. Do use thermal protectant.</li>
    <li> I really love these!!! just as good as the T3!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great simple hot rollers.  They don&#x27;t burn my hands and heat up very quickly.  I only wish I could travel with these.  Too bulky for travel but great for home - everyday use.</li>
    <li> It needs to be plugged at least 10-15 minutes for it to be effective, and then I burn my fingers in handling. The curls last about 10 minutes and then nothing. I need to use hair spray on each section of hair beforeI put in the curler. It&#x27;s cumbersome to use, and then the curlers are so heavy that they fall over or out. Difficult to use. Guess I need practice. The curls when they do &amp;#34;take&amp;#34; are too loose. My hair is down past my shoulders for a few inches and I don&#x27;t think the smaller curlers would be big enough. I ordered the jumbo/large set. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like this set a lot - I was able to get a lot of body in my hair when it was long without teasing it, which was great because I was damaging my hair trying to add body with teasing.  It warms up quick and the curls stay in my very stubborn straight hair quite well.  I had my hair cut over the summer, and it is finally getting long enough to use them again, and I can&#x27;t wait till it is even longer so that it is easier to use, so my hair looks good again.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd version of this product that I purchased, and both had terrible clips to hold the rollers. My mom has an older version with great clips, I don&#x27;t know why they changed it!&lt;br /&gt;These \\&quot;Super Clips\\&quot; left my hair with marks where the clip was placed, not a good look at all.&lt;br /&gt;That is too bad, because the rollers themselves are great and heat up in a flash, and retain the heat very well.</li>
    <li> Nice rollers for the price that i paid during Black Friday or Cyber Monday.  They&#x27;re not as hot as i would like them to be.  Longer hair needs hot rollers in order to get the longer layers to curl or wave, and I found that i need to leave them in a little longer than i&#x27;m used to which holds up my \\&quot;getting out the door\\&quot; time, and i get nice waves not great ones.  Need to use hair spray on hair before the curlers go in or else there&#x27;s no good results.</li>
    <li> Heats fast and let it set in your hair till they are cool, 20-30 minutes then you get better curls.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair so usually when I use any type of curlers, the set will last. With these curlers, The curl did not stay in.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers because I have thick, long hair.  They heat up very quickly and I can easily get all my hair onto the set.  I don&#x27;t miss the mini size rollers that are always useless for me.  I have two complaints: first, there is no clip storage.  I have never had a hot roller set that doesn&#x27;t have any place to store the clips, so I have to keep the whole thing in the box.  Secondly, the clips are truly awful.  They grip next to nothing.  I have to put a large shower cap over the rollers to keep them in my hair and will definitely have to go to Sally&#x27;s to buy other clips.</li>
    <li> I used to used hot rollers a lot as a teen, when big hair was &amp;#34;in.&amp;#34; But I haven&#x27;t really used them much since. But thought I would give these jumbos a shot. I&#x27;m really happy with them. I have naturally thick and full hair. But this really gives loads of body, and it sticks around for a couple of days (not so much the curl as the body and lift). I feel so old school with rollers on my head. It&#x27;s kinda&#x27; fun, and they work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do get very hot. They don&#x27;t bother my fingers, but they do burn if they rest on your face. The two along my hair line left a pink mark in their wake. I&#x27;ll just position it better next time, but beware. I think it&#x27;s a little harder to get the clips to keep the rollers in place, tightly, than I expected. I actually prefer the metals ones I used back in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was happy.</li>
    <li> The butterfly clips make it impossible to secure the rollers, therefore, making this product useless. I have longer hair. This product should note length is important in the success/performance of this product. An alternative to the \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; clips should have been provided.</li>
    <li> on time and works well</li>
    <li> Had one before . Lasted many years.</li>
    <li> The picture showed them with an on/off button but this model doesn&#x27;t have them.  however they do curl good though</li>
    <li> Works good once you get used to the clips for the rollers. It says you cant use these in wet hair (too bad I didnt remember that beforehand..) my hair is 12&amp;#34; sausage curles, but when straight is 14 &amp;#34; long. I use on slightly damp hair and I leave the rollers in until my hair is dry and there is no more heat from the rollers. I dont add anything to my hair before rolling  because of their velour covering on the rollers, just makes them nasty over time. Spritz and go, lasts all day. Gives nice curly flips, use the four big rollers down center for volume.</li>
    <li> I did not realize the rollers would be so heavy. Used them once only, probably won&#x27;t use them again. Gave me a headache and made my hair very staticky, not what I expected.</li>
    <li> The roller are held in place by plastic clips that don&#x27;t work very well, and don&#x27;t seem like they will last very long.</li>
    <li> I have only used these once and it was my first time using hot rollers ever! Didn&#x27;t come out as good as I expected but I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t do such a good job rolling them. After watching a itsjudytime tutorial I think I&#x27;ll have a much better outcome! Not entirely happy a with the flimsy clips. I will definitely be looking for the metal pins if anyone has any idea where I can find some that will fit these rollers, it&#x27;d be much appreciated! Happy Rolling!</li>
    <li> A co worker of mine recommended these.&lt;br /&gt;I love them, they&#x27;re so easy to use and set and heat up FAST!</li>
    <li> Amazing. Obsessed with these. I have fine naturally curler blonde hair that never curls uniform/top layer hangs straight. These curlers make my hair stunning with bouncey big curls. I buy from Amazon every day the last five years and never wrote a review so you know I am ecstatic right now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of different Conair hot roller sets over the years, and they were always long-lasting products that were reliable. I regrettably got rid of my last set of flocked rollers, primarily because my hair style had changed from curly, bouncy medium-length hair to sleeker, smoother shoulder-length hair, and that set simply had been taking up space under the vanity because I used other styling tools to get \\&quot;my look.\\&quot; However, when I found these larger rollers, much larger than my old set, I knew I had to try them. Although it&#x27;s good set, it&#x27;s not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my hair&#x27;s length, style &amp; texture, ideally I need a set of Super Jumbos Rollers (1.75\\&quot;) to smooth, style, &amp; add shine, This set has 4 of this size, so that&#x27;s better than nothing, I guess. However, it&#x27;s very difficult for me to get the look that I want. I do my crown first with the Super Jumbos, then move to the lower layers with the purple Jumbos (1.5\\&quot;). The lower layers are still get too much curl and I am still working on the best timing &amp; set. Right now, I basically have two different set times - some time for the Jumbo on my lower hair, and triple the time for the Super Jumbo on my crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair also makes a Mega Jumbo (2\\&quot;) set of 5 rollers branded as Infiniti Pro, which I picked up at wally world. I suspect I will end up transitioning to using the Mega Jumbos on the Crown and Super Jumbo on the lower layers. Unfortunately, this means 2 sets on the vanity, plugged in &amp; using all that electricity. I still would prefer Super Jumbo on the crown. Life could be worse but I really wish there was a better solution than using 2 tools to get the style that I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my previous Conair models, this set does not seem to heat up as much. The Jumbos seem to get hot enough, but the Super Jumbos and Mega Jumbos need to get hotter. Perhaps this is a feature of these larger rollers, that they can&#x27;t retain heat or lose it quicker? Regardless, the biggest rollers are not hot enough. I deducted 1 star for the low heat in the largest rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, like others have stated, the clips are the pits - just terrible. They leave bumps and marks, and I actually have to go back with a curling iron on top layers. Give me the metal pins of torture any day - those worked and didn&#x27;t crimp hair. As a side note, the Mega Jumbo clips are designed differently, with out as many combs, and they don&#x27;t crimp the hair. So, Conair already has a better clip design in one of its products. I deducted 1 star for bad clips in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, these rollers do what they should - create a smooth style with shine &amp; body. Conair already makes a set of 12 purple Jumbo rollers (1.5\\&quot;). If Conair would make a set of 8 to 10 Super Jumbo rollers (1.75\\&quot;) that gets hot enough and uses an improved clip design, I would pay $40 to $50 for it. I bet others would too.enough.

    <li> The large curlers leave a ridge in your hair. The smaller size doesn&#x27;t really leave curls or smooth out your hair. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Firstly, they took forever to ship for whatever reason. The actual product itself isn&#x27;t too useful. It takes quite some time to heat up, has very little effect on my hair, and the clips (as many reviewers have mentioned) leave dent marks on the hair and there is no where to put them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> These curlers help smooth out my frizzy hair without making it look like it did in the 1980s!  I love the big rollers.  There are plenty of them and the clips work great.</li>
    <li> The hot rollers didn&#x27;t work on my short thick wavy hair. The curls didn&#x27;t come out at smooth as I thought it would, they were frizzy. I&#x27;ve heard many good reviews about the product but I guess it works better on people with thinner hair.</li>
