<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with these gloves.</li>
      <li>great for mail carrier hands!</li>
      <li>I am very impressed with these gloves.</li>
      <li>Work great!</li>
      <li>The feel great.</li>
      <li>The tightness just made my hands throb even more than they already were!</li>
      <li>I love them!</li>
      <li>They fit great -  snug, but not too snug.</li>
      <li>For lady hands they are probably ok and fairly well made.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable.</li>
      <li>There were so many gloves to choose from that</li>
      <li>I love the colors</li>
      <li>So glad I found them.</li>
      <li>They work okay, and handle being washed well.</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>Love these gloves.  </li>
      <li>You will love them, too - I&#x27;m sure.</li>
      <li>The very first time I used this glove it seemed to help my hands absorb my moisturizer faster and more effectively, but also formed a hole in the side of the glove.</li>
      <li>is they hold moisture in really good because the&lt;br /&gt;material is not thin.  </li>
      <li>won&#x27;t be as strong machine stitching would be...or,no ripped seam at all.</li>
      <li>Great concept - they just need to be bigger!</li>
      <li>and it is comfortable to wear at night.</li>
      <li>Otherwise comfortable</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I got these gloves...</li>
      <li>I had purchased a pair of cotton gloves in Walmart which I thought were ok, but after receiving these I don&#x27;t care as much for those because these fit so well and are so smooth feeling.</li>
      <li>So comfortable &amp; hands fill amazing the next day.  </li>
      <li>If you have tiny, petite hands, they&#x27;ll probably do the job for you, but I&#x27;m sure most of my lotion was wiped onto the inside of the gloves right as I put them on, because they are so snug.</li>
      <li>Be gentle with them, they can tear at the seam rather easily.</li>
      <li>They are stretch and they fit my hand very well.</li>
      <li>These are soft and fit well.</li>
      <li>However, the first time I put them on, they split on the side.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy to see the yellow build up) and caked around my wrists, and after just a week of use there&#x27;s a hole where the seam split on one of them.</li>
      <li>These are sewn strong and I think they&#x27;ll last a while.</li>
      <li>I type, do paperwork, and even use my smart phone with these on.</li>
      <li>I like about them so much</li>
      <li>Very breathable</li>
      <li>Not really what I was expecting, but it does work okay</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m gentle putting them on&amp;taking them off as well as while hand washing them.</li>
      <li>I have to lotion frequently, but I also need to work, these work very well.</li>
      <li>Although nicely fitting and comfortable to wear, they are just thin, basic cotton gloves.  </li>
      <li>Comfortable, conforming, so soft and go down below palm-believe it or not, that makes a dif.</li>
      <li>Got these for my 6th grader who has itchy sensitive skin, eczema.</li>
      <li>Hand lotions don&#x27;t seep through nor do they soak completely into the gloves.</li>
      <li>My hands felt smooth after a few uses</li>
      <li>I think if they were slightly sized up, these would be lovely for helping to moisturize your hands while you sleep, but I can&#x27;t keep them on that long.</li>
      <li>and unfortunately, I actually feel that the cotton material does the exact opposite</li>
      <li>only issue, is they are tight, my hands are not that large, but since the beginning they have been a tight fit.</li>
      <li>I was surprised these were regular cotton, poly gloves.</li>
      <li>After a few uses I noticed that most of my lotion rubbed off as I am putting them on (I&#x27;m using raw shea</li>
      <li>If your guy hands are normal or even slightly larger than normal these gloves are a bad fit.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with these gloves.They don&#x27;t fall off.Hand lotions don&#x27;t seep through nor do they soak completely into the gloves.I&#x27;m gentle putting them on&amp;taking them off as well as while hand washing them.BUT...I just had to sew the seam in one of the fingers &amp; hand-sewing won&#x27;t be as strong machine stitching would be...or,no ripped seam at all.The seam is the reason I took 1 star from my review.</li>
    <li> Oh!!!! So comfortable &amp; hands fill amazing the next day.  Wear them every night.  You will love them, too - I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> It is a bit small for my hands so it slides  up a little when I sleep . But it does keep the lotion in. My hands felt smooth after a few uses</li>
    <li> If your guy hands are normal or even slightly larger than normal these gloves are a bad fit.  If you attempt to stretch them some they will rip out at the seam.  For lady hands they are probably ok and fairly well made.</li>
    <li> These are soft and fit well. I appreciate that they&#x27;re made in the USA.  However, the first time I put them on, they split on the side. Now they have a big hole. I don&#x27;t want to take the time to go to the post office to send them in for a refund and the company doesn&#x27;t offer replacements.</li>
    <li> I love them. Comfortable, conforming, so soft and go down below palm-believe it or not, that makes a dif. I love the colors and I have to wear gloves 24/7. So glad I found them. $10 is NOT a lot to pay for gloves. I&#x27;ve gotten really BAD quality for more. These are sewn strong and I think they&#x27;ll last a while. They&#x27;re thick not suffocating and stay on during the nite.</li>
    <li> I have to lotion frequently, but I also need to work, these work very well. I type, do paperwork, and even use my smart phone with these on. They wash well and have held up to constant use.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue, is they are tight, my hands are not that large, but since the beginning they have been a tight fit.</li>
    <li> Love these gloves.  My hands are medium size and are a bit snug but they stretch.&lt;br /&gt;What I like about them so much is they hold moisture in really good because the&lt;br /&gt;material is not thin.  You can tell difference once wear overnite in your hands appearance.</li>
    <li> Be gentle with them, they can tear at the seam rather easily. Otherwise comfortable and I can still do a lot while wearing them too. Doesn&#x27;t bother me to sleep in. Very breathable</li>
    <li> Used for a month with Vaseline Petroleum Jelly Deep Moisture every night, but did not see any visual change until I switched to simple $1.50 cotton gloves from my local Daiso. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I got these gloves... They fit great -  snug, but not too snug. After a few uses I noticed that most of my lotion rubbed off as I am putting them on (I&#x27;m using raw shea so it&#x27;s easy to see the yellow build up) and caked around my wrists, and after just a week of use there&#x27;s a hole where the seam split on one of them. I&#x27;m terribly disappointed.</li>
    <li> Although nicely fitting and comfortable to wear, they are just thin, basic cotton gloves.  They do nothing to enhance the absorption of my hand lotion like I thought they were supposed to and unfortunately, I actually feel that the cotton material does the exact opposite and instead whisks it away from my skin.  I wore them a few times and stopped bothering months ago.</li>
    <li> Got these for my 6th grader who has itchy sensitive skin, eczema. She wears them at night so she doesnt scratch herself to death in her sleep. Work great! Size is small adult size.</li>
    <li> There were so many gloves to choose from that I had a hard time deciding which one I was going to select. I am very impressed with these gloves. The feel great. They come up past your wrist a bit so they aren&#x27;t so short all they want to do is roll down. They are stretch and they fit my hand very well. I had purchased a pair of cotton gloves in Walmart which I thought were ok, but after receiving these I don&#x27;t care as much for those because these fit so well and are so smooth feeling.</li>
    <li> I was surprised these were regular cotton, poly gloves. They work okay, and handle being washed well. Not really what I was expecting, but it does work okay and it is comfortable to wear at night.</li>
    <li> The very first time I used this glove it seemed to help my hands absorb my moisturizer faster and more effectively, but also formed a hole in the side of the glove. No idea how that happened, but it definitely detracts from my appreciation of the product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wear these at night with lotion to sooth my aching, dry hands but even being somebody who has what I&#x27;d say are average hands, these are just way too tight. If you have tiny, petite hands, they&#x27;ll probably do the job for you, but I&#x27;m sure most of my lotion was wiped onto the inside of the gloves right as I put them on, because they are so snug. The tightness just made my hands throb even more than they already were! Because they are so tight, it also puts pressure on the seams and one glove started splitting at the side seam.

I think if they were slightly sized up, these would be lovely for helping to moisturize your hands while you sleep, but I can&#x27;t keep them on that long. Great concept - they just need to be bigger!</li>
    <li> great for mail carrier hands!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable. I love them!</li>
