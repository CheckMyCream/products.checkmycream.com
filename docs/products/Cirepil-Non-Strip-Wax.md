      <li>Great for face and bikini waxing.</li>
      <li>Great wax.</li>
      <li>Smells good and great removal.</li>
      <li>but it works great and has a nice smell.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Smells more like wax, but that is what it is!</li>
      <li>\\&quot;escential\\&quot; rose wax for use without strips.</li>
      <li>The rose smell</li>
      <li>This one does not break and removes hair effectively.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this wax, it smells awesome and comes off so nicely it doesn&#x27;t flake or break</li>
      <li>First impression was great, easy to use and am so happy I made</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Easy to use and does the job!</li>
      <li>The rose smell is extremely strong, if you are ok with that then this is an amazing product</li>
      <li>Did a great job removing a large area of hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this wax.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I started out using the Gigi wax that came with the warmer, then when that ran out I went looking for more.</li>
      <li>Recommended by many esthecians</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this wax.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m just as satisfied</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance, melts easily, so easy to use.</li>
      <li>This is better than the blue one of you can&#x27;t find this rose the cristalline is good too</li>
      <li>the consistency of the wax doesn&#x27;t allow you to spread easily</li>
      <li>I can definitely say that the Escential Rose is superior to the Gigi.</li>
      <li>Hands down the BEST wax I ever used for a Brazilian.</li>
      <li>I boiled water in a pot on the stove and let the wax sit for about 45 minutes and it worked just fine.</li>
      <li>Smooth, creamy and catches almost every hair.</li>
      <li>Have tried different brands, this is the best one so far.</li>
      <li>Find it way more gentle and so do my clients.  </li>
      <li>It only adheres to hair, not skin, making it a more comfortable experience.</li>
      <li>but I received the cerapil rose wax which is for use with strips, completely different.</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin nice and smooth not leaving much wax residue, easy to grip, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and it being white is a plus just because you can actually see it&#x27;s pulling out the hair from the root!:</li>
      <li>It smells better (it actually doesn&#x27;t have a smell at all), it sets more quickly, and for some reason it actually doesn&#x27;t hurt when I pull it off.</li>
      <li>Be sure to prep the area with a toner or witch hazel prior to waxing.</li>
      <li>I just used this for the first time yesterday to was my underarms-</li>
      <li>Performs exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>It melts fast goes on smooth and softly.</li>
      <li>I ordered the Essential Rose Wax in the Pink Tin because I thought the wax would be pink aswell, but it isnt, its ivory/clear Other than that, Great Product!</li>
      <li>Very stringy, which makes it messier than I would like.</li>
      <li>and I give this one hands down for sure.</li>
      <li>Works decent- takes some hair off but leaves some.</li>
      <li>I highly recomend it to anyone who waxes at home..</li>
      <li>I just didn&#x27;t like the texture of that one, but Since i purchased this rose hard wax</li>
      <li>Regardless, I&#x27;ve finally gotten what I wanted and enjoy using the hard wax very much!</li>
      <li>Not recommended for use on large areas such as the arms or legs.</li>
      <li>The Amazon reviews for that product led me here, and while I initially balked at the price (twice as much as the Gigi wax)</li>
      <li>My skin (sensitive) had a much better reaction from this wax; only red for a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>It spreads easily and is not stringy like a lots of hard waxes.</li>
      <li>This is better than the blue hard wax.</li>
      <li>I love this hard wax!</li>
      <li>you can barely smell it.</li>

<li> I love this hard wax!</li>
<li> you can barely smell it.</li>
<li> I am confused because the item pictured from my original orders showed the correct item.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t take off my hair good. :(</li>
<li> Ill order the Blue one next time just because that one is actually blue and just looks cool</li>
<li> Not anywhere near as sticky as a typical honey wax</li>
<li> Love this hard wax!!!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been seraching for a stripless wax for a long time.</li>
<li> I am not a professional; I wax myself at home.</li>
<li> This is a hard wax for use on sensitive areas like the bikini, lip, brows and face.</li>
<li> I also don&#x27;t need to use oil on my leg like I do with the other wax because this one doesn&#x27;t stick to my skin.</li>
<li> i.e.: underarms, face and other body areas</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other wax that doesn&#x27;t require strips</li>
<li> Will only buy this for my hard wax.</li>
<li> Hurst less when pulling</li>
<li> Forms less strings than the others.</li>
<li> i used to use Bliss and for half the price</li>
<li> It did not irritate, burn or leave a sticky mess.</li>
<li> BUT i do hate the strong floral smell (roses i guess).</li>
<li> but when I would go and pull it the wax would break in little pieces.</li>
<li> Grabs hair well, unless their thin and blonde.</li>
<li> When I found this item sold by another seller it showed the correct picture but was changed the the cerapil picture a few days after I placed my order.</li>
<li> BUT, it&#x27;s the least painful wax i&#x27;ve tried yet, AND it&#x27;s not as messy as another hard wax brand i tried first.</li>
<li> I returned the item and they sent me the same wrong wax (cerapil) in return.</li>
<li> I use to use the Gigi hard wax</li>
<li> The &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; of the wax was not as bad compared with the honey wax</li>

    <li> great wax. i didn&#x27;t realize you can&#x27;t microwave it and you&#x27;re supposed to use a wax heater. I boiled water in a pot on the stove and let the wax sit for about 45 minutes and it worked just fine. the consistency of the wax doesn&#x27;t allow you to spread easily but it works great and has a nice smell. i used to use Bliss and for half the price i&#x27;m just as satisfied</li>
    <li> Works decent- takes some hair off but leaves some. BUT, it&#x27;s the least painful wax i&#x27;ve tried yet, AND it&#x27;s not as messy as another hard wax brand i tried first. BUT i do hate the strong floral smell (roses i guess).</li>

    <li> I love this wax.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for sensitive skin and it&#x27;s smells great!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried alot of different brands and none of them compare to this</li>
    <li> Grabs hair well, unless their thin and blonde. Very stringy, which makes it messier than I would like. Please note that it comes in a metal tin, so you HAVE to use a warmer, you CANNOT put in the microwave!</li>
    <li> The rose smell is extremely strong, if you are ok with that then this is an amazing product</li>
    <li> Works great! I use it for my underarms.  Smooth, creamy and catches almost every hair.</li>
    <li> This is not cerapil, it is the brand \\&quot;escential\\&quot; rose wax for use without strips. This is a hard wax for use on sensitive areas like the bikini, lip, brows and face. I tried to order this from amazon and it was described as \\&quot;escential\\&quot; but I received the cerapil rose wax which is for use with strips, completely different. I returned the item and they sent me the same wrong wax (cerapil) in return. I am confused because the item pictured from my original orders showed the correct item. When I found this item sold by another seller it showed the correct picture but was changed the the cerapil picture a few days after I placed my order. I did get the correct item but I don&#x27;t know why the picture is changed to cerapil when you are getting escential. Regardless, I&#x27;ve finally gotten what I wanted and enjoy using the hard wax very much! It only adheres to hair, not skin, making it a more comfortable experience. Not recommended for use on large areas such as the arms or legs. Happy waxing!</li>
    <li> Performs exactly as advertised.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> This is better than the blue hard wax. Find it way more gentle and so do my clients.  Will only buy this for my hard wax.</li>
    <li> This wax smells beautiful! It melts fast goes on smooth and softly. Gets all the hair. Be sure to prep the area with a toner or witch hazel prior to waxing. It did not irritate, burn or leave a sticky mess.</li>
    <li> Smells good and great removal. Stringy as hell tho.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance, melts easily, so easy to use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wax. I use to use the Gigi hard wax and I give this one hands down for sure. It leaves your skin nice and smooth not leaving much wax residue, easy to grip, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and it being white is a plus just because you can actually see it&#x27;s pulling out the hair from the root!:) I would recommend this one to everyone. After trying the Gigi wax I had to change I just didn&#x27;t like the texture of that one, but Since i purchased this rose hard wax I been buying it all the time❤</li>
    <li> Hands down the BEST wax I ever used for a Brazilian. ZERO pain!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been seraching for a stripless wax for a long time. I finally found one that agrees with my skin. This was a great purchase! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I started out using the Gigi wax that came with the warmer, then when that ran out I went looking for more. The Amazon reviews for that product led me here, and while I initially balked at the price (twice as much as the Gigi wax), everyone who&#x27;d tried both said that this was the wax to use. Plus, I had a gift card. I can definitely say that the Escential Rose is superior to the Gigi. I took away a star because it takes longer to heat up than the Gigi wax, but that&#x27;s the only con to it. It smells better (it actually doesn&#x27;t have a smell at all), it sets more quickly, and for some reason it actually doesn&#x27;t hurt when I pull it off. I don&#x27;t know how they do that. I also don&#x27;t need to use oil on my leg like I do with the other wax because this one doesn&#x27;t stick to my skin.</li>
    <li> Have tried different brands, this is the best one so far. Forms less strings than the others. Hurst less when pulling</li>
    <li> This is better than the blue one of you can&#x27;t find this rose the cristalline is good too</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time yesterday to was my underarms- First impression was great, easy to use and am so happy I made this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;-Smells great&lt;br /&gt;- Not anywhere near as sticky as a typical honey wax&lt;br /&gt;- My skin (sensitive) had a much better reaction from this wax; only red for a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;- The &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; of the wax was not as bad compared with the honey wax&lt;br /&gt;- Did a great job removing a large area of hair.&lt;br /&gt;*** I am not a professional; I wax myself at home. i.e.: underarms, face and other body areas (I DO NOT wax my bikini area at home)</li>
    <li> Love it! does not crack and break when ripping off. Great for face and bikini waxing.</li>
    <li> I love this hard wax! Recommended by many esthecians</li>
    <li> The rose smell you can barely smell it. Smells more like wax, but that is what it is! Doesn&#x27;t bother me. Great wax. I&#x27;ve used other wax that doesn&#x27;t require strips but when I would go and pull it the wax would break in little pieces. This one does not break and removes hair effectively.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and does the job!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t take off my hair good. :(</li>
    <li> Love this hard wax!!! It spreads easily and is not stringy like a lots of hard waxes. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this wax, it smells awesome and comes off so nicely it doesn&#x27;t flake or break I purchased the rosewater cleanser to go with it and it is just wonderful I highly recomend it to anyone who waxes at home..plus you can purchase the refill bag of wax beads and it will last you forever</li>
