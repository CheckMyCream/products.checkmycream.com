      <li>My wife loved it.</li>
      <li>The product isn&#x27;t any good.</li>
      <li>A good product is one that does</li>

      <li>Works nicely.  </li>
      <li>2 in 1 Electric Epilator and Shaver is a nice unit &amp; works as it should.</li>
      <li>The shaver attachment is nice, but I haven&#x27;t used that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>my arms nice and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t use most of the depilatories out there</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this product.  </li>
      <li>I will buy again for sure.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Nice and smooth for 3weeks and no ingrown hairs.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>electric shaver worked perfectly on my legs, chin &amp; upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can use it in a circular motion which seems to get more hairs.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
      <li>I tested one patch of hair on one leg to start, on the most insensitive area.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t need to have the limiting guard on it for it to be comfortable to use (you know after getting used to removing hair this way!)</li>
      <li>so it feels like it pulls more hairs in each sweep than the ones I have had in the past.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It must be plugged in to work, but many require that, and the ones that don&#x27;t end up needing replacement sooner in my experience.</li>
      <li>it hurts way more for me when I pluck my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>know many people prefer battery operated or rechargeable devices, but I prefer corded</li>

      <li>Just love this.</li>
      <li>buy again if this one won&#x27;t work any more.</li>
      <li>I have gotten alot more ingrown hairs</li>
      <li>Doing this will make your skin more pliable.&lt;br /&gt;-Hold</li>
      <li>I love mine!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>very happy finally got a product for the purpose.</li>
      <li>So this one did the job a lot quicker:)</li>
      <li>I was more than a bit hesitant to try this.</li>
      <li>which I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
      <li>But I followed the instructions of keeping the Emjoi perpendicular to the skin and the skin taut (which is VERY important), and it worked just fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fairly effective and pulls the hairs quickly</li>
      <li>best results,  take a warm bath or shower first to open up your pores, also using a loofa will exfoliate too.</li>
      <li>So far it works great.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave legs as smooth as shaving would, but maybe with repeated usage that will get better.  </li>
      <li>So far I am happy with this product.</li>
      <li>I receive this about a month ago and it works great, i have the larger one for my legs and this one is for my face only and the size is perfect for that use.</li>
      <li>In my experience, plastic geared doodads break easily so be prepared to take care of it.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has two rows of tweezers which go in opposite directions, so it does a great job at pulling our the hairs and making the process more efficient.</li>
      <li>The bikini area is full of nerves so prepare yourself for more than just a sting.</li>
      <li>I mean...using the epilator on my legs felt like a mild, static electricity shock each time a hair was plucked.</li>
      <li>I felt a mild shock (like static electricity) when the epilator pulled out a hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a plug in unit, which I think makes a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>, it leaves a smooth touchy after effect.</li>
      <li>The hair took a while to grow back in after just one use which was great.</li>
      <li>Enjoy the freedom of shaving.</li>
      <li>Silky smooth skin afterwards.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t feeling comfortable with the epilator on my armpits, so I used the shaver attachment.</li>
      <li>It worked great on my legs, but did not work on my chin or upper lips.  </li>
      <li>detailed instructions can be found in the included manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As expected, epilating isn&#x27;t the most comfortable experience and it takes time, but I&#x27;m generally happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
      <li>For me, the results are so worth it!</li>
      <li>You will have clean hairless legs, underarms and bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
      <li>/&gt;Rechargeable batteries lose power &amp; stop taking full charges and batteries always need</li>
      <li>/&gt;Rechargeable batteries lose power &amp; stop taking full charges and batteries always need</li>
      <li>but this product really does make the job more efficient and a lot smoother.</li>
      <li>I was pretty nervous about trying it, so I used it very lightly on top of my skin to get used to it, and the first time I used it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very compact and easy to hold and store.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>The cord was a great length for me, and I like the little bag you can keep it in as well as the cleaning brush.</li>
      <li>It is powerful and the tweezers work well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Worth the pain.</li>
      <li>The first time I used emjoi epi; I loved it because it&#x27;s so cute and small and fits in the palm of my hand..</li>
      <li>The little bag that it comes with is very handy for keeping everything in one place.</li>
      <li>I go pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>what a difference!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I used this right away, and it works .</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>Got it super fast.</li>
      <li>Quite honestly, I prefer epilating when dry</li>
      <li>I hardly ever give a review on Amazon, but this product exceeded my expectations so much that I just had to give a good review!</li>
      <li>I think this is because the epilator grabs more than one hair, so you don&#x27;t have a specific point of pain.</li>
      <li>A 20-30 minutes leg session once every 7-10 days keeps me pretty clean.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works exactly as promised.</li>
      <li>I actually think it hurts more to use the electric shaver attachment that came with this one than to epilate.</li>
      <li>is the first time I&#x27;ve used an epilator...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure results are different for everyone though.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves</li>
      <li>exactly as it is.</li>
      <li>I did scream the first time.  </li>
      <li>My first epilator.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had an epilator about 10years ago, what a difference!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I used this right away, and it works . With the one I Owned before I had to go over the same area again and again and it still didnt get all the hair, with this it got all the hair in a short time. Yay!!!!.&lt;br /&gt;On the arms and legs it didnt hurt too much, the bikini area and underarms did hurt though. However it removed all the hair and hopefully it will hurt less the next time. Its been 5 days since i used this and I have no stubbles yet. Worth the pain. The unit is small and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with this purchase and the price was very good.</li>
    <li> Nice little product. It removes the hair as described. The facial hair was very tender and it will still take time to get used to the pain of the plucking. However, the Emjoi took off those old lady whiskers off my chin and stash with no grow back in 3 weeks. The hair removal on my legs was without pain and again, very little grow back in 3 weeks. Haven&#x27;t tried my underarms cause I&#x27;m a little chicken but I will..just have to get my courage up.</li>
    <li> It works..after several passes.That&#x27;s why i&#x27;m only giving it three stars.</li>
    <li> I wish I had known about this product years ago.  I can&#x27;t use most of the depilatories out there and I hate waxing.  The Emjoi eRase works like a charm.  They say you shouldn&#x27;t use it on your face cheeks, but I did without any problems.  It took care of my face cheeks, upper lip, chin and neck.  I love, love, love this product.  I will buy again for sure.  Thank you Emjoi.</li>
    <li> doesnt work as well as i thought it would..shaving is faster and easier..pain isn&#x27;t too crazy but it doesn&#x27;t even seem to be pulling from the root like its says it should</li>
    <li> Wow, this little guy really does work!  It&#x27;s a plug in unit, which I think makes a huge difference.  Very minimal discomfort.  It is so fast, you hardly notice it.  Takes seconds to remove all hair.  Silky smooth skin afterwards.  You will not be disappointed with the unit and the price on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat.  Enjoy the freedom of shaving.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Got it super fast. But it still hurts,  especially on facebook event!</li>
    <li> This unit has been able to remove hairs that at least 6 other epilators of various brands couldn&#x27;t.  That makes it A-1 in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all epilators, individual tolerances will vary and your comfort level will probably not match mine.  However, this little unit has been able to remove hair shorter than any other brand I tried and did it quickly on the first pass.  That means less friction from the rotating heads and a cleaner profile for a longer time.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it. One application lasted her a month on her legs.</li>
    <li> This is my third epilator in 10 years.  The first wore out after 3 years, the second was cordless, which seemed like a good idea, but the cordless ones won&#x27;t work when plugged in (and I don&#x27;t take long enough showers to epilade in the shower anyway), so when the rechargeable battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more, it was toast.  Took about two years for that to happen, at which point I gave up and started shaving again. When stubble and expensive razors got old I bought this Emjoi.  I love it. Maybe I am just happy to be getting rid of hair cheaply and at the root again, but this thing makes me happy.  I have only used it about 5 times so far, but this is what I have noticed:&lt;br /&gt;1. It is powerful and the tweezers work well.&lt;br /&gt;2. You can use it in a circular motion which seems to get more hairs.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s very compact and easy to hold and store.&lt;br /&gt;4. It doesn&#x27;t need to have the limiting guard on it for it to be comfortable to use (you know after getting used to removing hair this way!) so it feels like it pulls more hairs in each sweep than the ones I have had in the past.&lt;br /&gt;5. Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;6. Works well on legs and underarms, haven&#x27;t tried anything else.&lt;br /&gt;7. A 20-30 minutes leg session once every 7-10 days keeps me pretty clean.&lt;br /&gt;8. My husband things it is too loud&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s noisy. I use it exclusively to control facial hair. Small size makes it easy to hold and use, and the little case keeps it contained nicely. Once I was used to the feeling of it working, it is not uncomfortable. I have never used an epilator before so I am not sure what to expect as far as performance; however, while it definitely does a good job on &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; I find that I am still using tweezers to keep the coarsest hairs at bay.</li>
    <li> Smaller then I expected but it works well.  I have gotten alot more ingrown hairs but it lasts alot longer.</li>
    <li> I love this device!  I ordered it because of annoying facial hair that developed as I entered menopause.  Shaving resulted in stubble, which I hated!  Does it hurt? Yes, of course.  Is it unbearable?  No.  Does it work?  Yes!!  I&#x27;ve had this now for a couple of months.  I&#x27;ve gone from using it every other day to once a week to now once every two weeks just to keep things clear.  I use it on my legs as well and awesome results there as well.  As you&#x27;re using it you do get used to it.  The first minute or so, particularly on the face, is uncomfortable.  For me, the results are so worth it!</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! Does not hurt at all when i use it on my face  😉Worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t have much experience with depilate on but so far I am really happy with this small machine. Yes, it might be painful at the beginning but you get used to the feeling and also it is less painful when there are less hair left. And yes, you have to go with it several times on the same place but at the end you will be happy with the results. You will have clean hairless legs, underarms and bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;Long time ago I had a brown epilator which was extremely painful experience which kept me away from epilation and brought back to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;This machine won&#x27;t disappoint you! I love mine!&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again if this one won&#x27;t work any more.</li>
    <li> Does it hurt? Well, you&#x27;re tweezing a bunch of hairs out of your body, of course it does! Is it bearable? Totally, and it gets easier and less painful over time. The process takes longer than shaving, but the results last longer and the upkeep is easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This specific product is great - it&#x27;s really small, so it takes up little space and is great for traveling. It must be plugged in to work, but many require that, and the ones that don&#x27;t end up needing replacement sooner in my experience. It has two rows of tweezers which go in opposite directions, so it does a great job at pulling our the hairs and making the process more efficient.</li>
    <li> Disappointed by the quality. Looks cute but did not really working well.</li>
    <li> Very small but powerful! Works great find it less painful then other epilators that I have tried.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> I tested one patch of hair on one leg to start, on the most insensitive area. Not only was it painful (something I&#x27;d honestly put up with if the results had been worth it because eyebrow plucking tells us gals we get used to the sensation doesn&#x27;t it? haha) but it didn&#x27;t get every hair within that patch (after running this over the area several times I finally just had to shave the rest with a regular razor) and the hair it did get grew back ingrown. Every single hair. I had to use pointy tweezers to dig each individual hair out of my skin so I could then shave it off with a razor. Maybe this works for some but it was a dismal, expensive, and disappointing experience for me. Really wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> It worked really well on my legs. I does hurt a bit, but that&#x27;s to be expected. The hair took a while to grow back in after just one use which was great. The reason I have it three stars instead of five is because I bought it especially for my bikini area. I did not work very well at all in that area. Some spots it worked and others, not at all.  Other than it not working too well on my bikini area, it worked and kept the hair away longer than shaving.</li>
    <li> I returned this item. It was used and still had hair in it.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> The product isn&#x27;t any good. It didn&#x27;t remove the hair.</li>
    <li> Just got this from a friend who bought it for me and I&#x27;ve tried it for the first time. I&#x27;m not really into this stuff so at first it felt a tiny bit painful but this product really does make the job more efficient and a lot smoother. It feels like a small ball gently plucking the hairs and after a while it&#x27;s not really painful. A good product is one that does it&#x27;s job well and I can happily say that this is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I receive this about a month ago and it works great, i have the larger one for my legs and this one is for my face only and the size is perfect for that use. The cord is a great length for use and this has to be plugged in while you are using it.  All in all this is a great item at a very good price, QVC was selling this at a much greater price, i looked her and i am glad i did, if you are on the fence get it a try, the pain level is very little.</li>
    <li> I received the yellow Emjoi eRase 2 in 1 Electric Epilator with Shaver for review purposes. I used the epilator on my legs, chin &amp; upper lip.  I felt a mild shock (like static electricity) when the epilator pulled out a hair. It worked great on my legs, but did not work on my chin or upper lips.  Maybe the hair wasn&#x27;t long enough.&lt;br /&gt;The electric shaver worked perfectly on my legs, chin &amp; upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve used an epilator...I will say it was a &#x27;shocking&#x27; experience.&lt;br /&gt;When I say shocking I mean...using the epilator on my legs felt like a mild, static electricity shock each time a hair was plucked. (Like when the air is dry, you touch something &amp; your finger gets shocked.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the epilator:&lt;br /&gt;-For best results,  take a warm bath or shower first to open up your pores, also using a loofa will exfoliate too. Doing this will make your skin more pliable.&lt;br /&gt;-Hold the epilator at a 90 degree angle, stretch the skin tight surrounding the area you&#x27;re working on.&lt;br /&gt;-Glide the epilator in short, quick, sweeping strokes in the direction of hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t press down, just hold the epilator against your skin. If you press too hard, it is designed to slow down or stop operating.&lt;br /&gt;-More detailed instructions can be found in the included manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face:&lt;br /&gt;The epilator can be used on your chin, upper lip &amp; jaw line only. Angle the epilator so that only one side of the epilator is used. I attached the the sensitive cover when I used the epilator on my upper lip &amp; chin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not recommended to use the epilator on your cheeks or forehead. It didn&#x27;t work on my chin or upper lip...maybe the hairs weren&#x27;t long enough. (they were about 1/8\\&quot; long)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric Shaver:&lt;br /&gt;It works like it should and can be used on your face too. Use the high speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cord is almost 6&#x27; long (measurement doesn&#x27;t include the plug)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 2 in 1 Electric Epilator and Shaver is a nice unit &amp; works as it should. It comes with a zippered carrying case that holds all the accessories and the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hover your cursor over Amazon&#x27;s product photos to see all the included accessories.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s product description is very thorough so I tried not to repeat too much of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know many people prefer battery operated or rechargeable devices, but I prefer corded devices.&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable batteries lose power &amp; stop taking full charges and batteries always need replaced.&lt;br /&gt;A corded device usually retains the same level of power...nothing needs recharged...nothing needs replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One Year Warrantys it should.

    <li> I hardly ever give a review on Amazon, but this product exceeded my expectations so much that I just had to give a good review! To start off with, I have never used an epilator before. In fact, I&#x27;ve never even waxed. I&#x27;ve only ever shaved and recently tried Nair. So, I was expecting this thing to hurt, but I was pleasantly surprised that it didn&#x27;t hurt that much! I hadn&#x27;t shaved or done anything in a few weeks, so my leg hair was pretty long. I was pretty nervous about trying it, so I used it very lightly on top of my skin to get used to it, and the first time I used it I went super slow. Like I said though, it really didn&#x27;t hurt that much- it hurts way more for me when I pluck my eyebrows. I think this is because the epilator grabs more than one hair, so you don&#x27;t have a specific point of pain. I was also really impressed to see the hairs that the epilator got; I could see roots on all of them! Two weeks later and my hair still hadn&#x27;t grown back like it usually does. I wasn&#x27;t feeling comfortable with the epilator on my armpits, so I used the shaver attachment. That worked great too! I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between using the shaver attachment and using a razor as far as outcome. In fact, I wasn&#x27;t so scared of cutting myself with the razor, so with the shaving attachment I was able to get some of those hard-to-reach armpit areas like the dimples near the top. To get both an epilator and an electric shaver in one was quite a deal! And now that I have the hang of it I go pretty quickly. I put aloe lotion on my skin after epilating because it calms the skin (I get red dots where the hair was yanked out of the skin). The cord was a great length for me, and I like the little bag you can keep it in as well as the cleaning brush. This epilator really exceeded my expectations, and as a first-time epilator user I would definitely recommend this one to other first-time epilator users!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had for a little over a week.  So far it works great. Minimal discomfort and redness after using on face.</li>
    <li> Emjoi eRase e60 Dual Opposed Heads 60-Disc 2-in-1 Electric Epilator Tweezer with Shaver/Trimmer and Sensitive Attachments - Yellow  I&#x27;m a big fan of eiplators. This is my third emjoi in 10 years. The plastic gears give out over time (years), but I am very pleased with how the opposing tweezers function. This one is smaller than my previous emjoi (which is discontinued, Emjoi Optima, with more tweezer heads), but I like the small size for getting into smaller places.  No complaints except for that I wish the cord was a bit longer. It comes with a travel case, a electric shaver head, a plastic guard to have only a few tweezers work at once and a cleaning brush.  Since I have epilated for so long, I only have a few dark hairs that grow back on each leg below the knee.  The hair that does grow back is soft, fine and light colored.  I don&#x27;t get ingrown hairs.   The first few times I used an epilator, I had to go very slow and it hurt so bad I cried! My legs were red and bumpy and it was not a great experience.  But, over the next few times, my legs got used to it and it doesn&#x27;t hurt AT ALL! I actually think it hurts more to use the electric shaver attachment that came with this one than to epilate. For me, there is no other way to go!  If you are ready to commit to a long term solution, give it a try! The price is the same as just a few packs of razors and you may just love it.</li>
    <li> For now, I am rating this epilator 4* I absolutely love this product.  As I mentioned before on another comment I also rate items on how long they last me and my previous epilator didn&#x27;t last me long about 1yr and 6months(or less) and it was by Remington the wet/dry. Quite honestly, I prefer epilating when dry it&#x27;s much faster than when the skin/hair is wet if makes the hair harder to grip. Dry, it does hurt, but I simply put some body powder and BAM does the job! I&#x27;ve only had EMJOI product for about a week but made use of it once, so far. (I will make sure and leave another comment later on-maybe few months and let you guys know how it&#x27;s still working) The first time I used emjoi epi; I loved it because it&#x27;s so cute and small and fits in the palm of my hand.. Not only that but it has 60 tweezers!! 60! My previous one had only 40. So this one did the job a lot quicker:) which I&#x27;m pleased. Honestly, the noise is loud, but not as loud as other ones I&#x27;ve heard. Because is so small I think it also varies in the size on how loud it will be. Anyway I rated it 4* only because it ISN&#x27;T cordless:\ sometimes the cord can get in the way. It is September- I rated this product before but my stars changed.. I rate it 3* now because this little thing doesn&#x27;t work for me anymore:( it stopped working on me! So this only lasted me literally 5months 1/2</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male with thick course black body hair.  I used it emoji twice a week on my chest,stomach and lower back and love it.  I epilate Monday and still shave, smooth until wed late night ,then Thursday epilate and still shave, but lately my hair has been growing back thinner  Loving it</li>
    <li> i read reviews before buying this. exactly as it is. very happy finally got a product for the purpose.</li>
    <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it and he fact it has a carrying bag. It&#x27;s fairly effective and pulls the hairs quickly so the pain is at a minimum (think of a little, faint sting). Of course the sensitivity changes according to the area. The bikini area is full of nerves so prepare yourself for more than just a sting. Hee-hee. I was a little startled when I turned it on and the wheels were spinning faster than I expected, even at its slowest setting. It gave me the impression it was gonna eat my skin. But I followed the instructions of keeping the Emjoi perpendicular to the skin and the skin taut (which is VERY important), and it worked just fine. Also, the protective lid with the open middle DOES give you better control when placing it on sensitive areas like the upper lip. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it five stars is because of the fact it&#x27;s plastic, including its gears. In my experience, plastic geared doodads break easily so be prepared to take care of it. A fall could mess it up. I&#x27;m hoping that doesn&#x27;t happen to my Emjoi cause I&#x27;m looking to use it for a very long time.</li>
    <li> So far I am happy with this product. It works as expected and the shaver attachment works well too.</li>
    <li> Just love this. It is my second one. Even my daughter bought one. I am no sure there is really anything on the market that total removed facial hair, but this works good. Must admit it stings a little, but after you get use to it you don&#x27;t even notice it. Works great. Don&#x27;t be afraid of it. Easier than waxing!</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator that I have ever purchased, so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other brands or models. That being said, I like it. The little bag that it comes with is very handy for keeping everything in one place. It isn&#x27;t bulky or heavy, so it easily fits in my hand. It is wired, but I like that since I never have to worry about charging it. The shaver attachment is nice, but I haven&#x27;t used that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it on my leg, upper lip, and armpits. Although I will probably never use it on my face again, I do like the results elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has different pain tolerance levels, and I was anticipating my underarms to hurt A LOT, but it honestly wasn&#x27;t as bad as I had thought it would be. I did follow some external instructions on epilating, though. 1) Shave the area. 2) Wait 1-2 days. 3) Epilate every other day for a week 4) Maintenance epilating once a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with my purchase of the Emjoi eRase e60.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping.  It works, but it is painful.  I did scream the first time.  It does get easier though, once you know what to expect.</li>
    <li> I was more than a bit hesitant to try this. I experienced the painful epi lady product almost 30 years ago and never thought I would try something &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; ever again!! After seeing it on QVC, I thought I would give this a try...I found it for less on Amazon. Emjoi is nothing like the old epi lady. This was not as painful....the first time I used it, I was pleasantly surprised. It did not get every hair, so I used the shaver attachment that came with it. I have been waiting for hair to regrow so I could use it again....the hairs haven&#x27;t grown back yet....it&#x27;s been well over a week. Maybe it will be the 4 weeks, as advertised...?? Anywho....I like it. and I anticipate the hair that does grow back, will not be as thick, or as painful to remove...which really was tolerable the first time. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a different model epilator that died after several years of use. I basically only epilate my underarms and this one is very poorly shaped for that. The head is much too big so it can&#x27;t really deal with concave areas. Getting it to work involves a series of awkward and time consuming contortions to try to get the skin flat enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably fine if you&#x27;re only planning on using it on your legs/arms.</li>
    <li> It does hurt the first time...but will get use to it fast.  Nice and smooth for 3weeks and no ingrown hairs.  I use tea tree oil before and after.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the epilator doesn&#x27;t seem to pull out any of my hair no matter what I do. But I love the electric razor attachment, so I&#x27;m not too disappointed!</li>
    <li> My first epilator.  Works nicely.  As expected, epilating isn&#x27;t the most comfortable experience and it takes time, but I&#x27;m generally happy with the results.  Doesn&#x27;t leave legs as smooth as shaving would, but maybe with repeated usage that will get better.  I experimented a bit and found that some hair on my legs hasn&#x27;t grown back in some places, so it seems to have permanent results.  I&#x27;m sure results are different for everyone though.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my arms nice and smooth.  I already recommended it to a friend who bought one immediately after.</li>
    <li> I really fell in love with this convenient piece of beauty, not only does it removes the smaller inner hair particles inside my facial skin area, it leaves a smooth touchy after effect. Most products like Panasonic for example that I&#x27;ve dealt with usually leave my face feeling horrible the next morning after waking up, but haven&#x27;t had any problem with this particular one.</li>
