      <li>I love this hair turban!</li>
      <li>Love them!</li>
      <li>On the bright side, the packaging is really cute.</li>
      <li>Nice microfiber towel that dries my curly hair without pulling it and causing frizz.  </li>
      <li>Also, the Twisty Towels were cheaper, and the fabric was just as nice.   </li>
      <li>This is a nice idea that doesnt work at all.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be tempted to think it was my own lack of coordination, but I have no problems with the Twisty Towels I got at Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
      <li>They wash nice and keep their shape.</li>
      <li>sure it is good.</li>
      <li>I already owned my own microfiber turban (another brand) and was satisfied...until...</li>
      <li>and I liked the packaging</li>
      <li>This hair turban is nice to twist my hair in when I want to leave a towel on for awhile.  </li>
      <li>This product gets 3 stars instead of 2 because it is effective at keeping the hair off my face while I apply moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product with the intention of having it handy for our many granddaughters visits.  </li>
      <li>i returned it as quickly as I could!!</li>
      <li>Plus it looks better than a plastic bag on your head.</li>
      <li>(but maybe it&#x27;s easier for more coordinated gals).     </li>
      <li>It helps heat up the hair and provides better conditioning.  </li>
      <li>I love taking care of my hair the correct way to stregthen it.</li>
      <li>Lovely thing totally love it</li>
      <li>She enjoyed using this</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck for 15 years with the aquis turban (non Diva Dryer)</li>
      <li>Its MUCH better.</li>
      <li>I have others that are much more absorbent.</li>
      <li>I love the microfiber.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>or I lose it! :)</li>
      <li>So much better than using a towel on your head, which falls off.</li>
      <li>Both of them love them.</li>
      <li>I love the retro look and won&#x27;t be without one.</li>
      <li>It is efficient and cute.</li>
      <li>This product would be much better off without the elastic.  </li>
      <li>I have used this for months and love it.</li>
      <li>I am glad</li>
      <li>I have used several of these over the years, but this is the best.  </li>
      <li>These are PERFECT, they hold all their hair, which is long, and stay on their head!  </li>
      <li>Microfiber is great for naturally curly hair as it doesn&#x27;t cause the hair to frizz.  </li>
      <li>But I can honestly say it is worth the hassle to redo the button.  </li>
      <li>It makes my morning routine easy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s easy to put on if I:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
      <li>I was kind of disapointed in this product because I am so happy with other Aquis products.</li>
      <li>She wasn&#x27;t very good at using a towel to dry her hair, and would proceed to soak her clothes and the couch with her dripping head.  </li>
      <li>The button used to secure it is about the size of a quarter which you would think would make it easy to button, but I have difficulty with it.</li>
      <li>Note, I said more quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
      <li>I usually use the Aquis microfiber turban which fits perfectly and doesn&#x27;t ride up.</li>
      <li>When I first got it out of the package, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice the scratchy texture of the towel and obnoxious plastic odor (although I&#x27;m sure the odor will go away after washing.)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Might sit better on adult with more hair or longer hair to hold.</li>
      <li>So great for pinning up wet hair while you do your make-up!</li>
      <li>Helps to dry my hair a bit quicker, but what I love the most is that they are lightweight &amp; secure...</li>
      <li>however I bought one first, before getting one for a gift!</li>
      <li>Thus, I don&#x27;t think this costly towel is worth the money.</li>
      <li>With this kind of report I will be doing business with them in the future.</li>
      <li>Easy on the hair, light on the head, and yes it does pull more water  out of the hair (not necessarily from twisting but a light patting down before  I lightly twist it up on my head).</li>
      <li>This is so superior to my other turban that I threw that one away and will purchase four or five of this brand to keep on hand for granddaughter visits!</li>
      <li>I like the snug fit with the button to secure it on the back.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t exactly way I pictured</li>
      <li>I love that the turban holds my hair off of my neck and back.</li>
      <li>If you want microfiber make sure the material actually feels like microfiber.</li>
      <li>the most useful hair towel product for long hair I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty darn close.  </li>
      <li>This product works just a bit better than using a regular bath towel.</li>
      <li>This is a good size for adult heads with long hair.  </li>
      <li>I believe it really does help my hair dry more quickly.</li>
      <li>My hair falls right in place and it is easy to twist and attach to the big button.</li>
      <li>The only good thing about it is that it&#x27;s lighter than a regular towel and doesn&#x27;t move around.</li>
      <li>I wish it was a little more absorbent, though it&#x27;s nice to have a towel for your hair instead of having to use a Regular one</li>
      <li>I apply my product, pile my hair on top of my head and let it dry for 15 minutes or so.  </li>
      <li>Colors are cute; got the pink one.</li>
      <li>So, if you like a challenge and want to spend twice as much, then buy this product.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s absorbent and doesn&#x27;t take up much room.  </li>
      <li>Dries fast.</li>
      <li>When I am ready I take it off and do my hair.</li>
      <li>towel was very helpful for my daughter to use.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know much about the item itself, but</li>
      <li>My hair dries so much faster</li>
      <li>I thought the pink was cute</li>
      <li>The towel is very absorbent, their hair is not dripping all over like it used to be.  </li>
      <li>Dries it fast</li>
      <li>This towel makes it easy for me to get ready without my wet hair dripping everywhere.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think a person can go wrong by doing business with Amazon as they seem to associate themselves with top notch companies that not only handle quality materials, but also keep good stock.</li>
      <li>I always use some type of hair wrap after my shower and this works perfectly to dry my hair fairly quickly!</li>
      <li>I just happen to have super frizzy hair that requires extra $$ to manage.</li>
      <li>So, I had high hopes that the diva dryer hair turban would shave time off my showering routine.</li>
      <li>tried it on, followed directions, but still could not get it to clasp because the button is too high up and</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve purchased all year.  I love taking care of my hair the correct way to stregthen it.</li>
    <li> It has really cut the drying time in half every morning. I just throw in the washer with my towels and hang up to dry and it&#x27;s ready to go for the next morning. I&#x27;m getting one of these for all my female Christmas gifts next year!</li>
    <li> This product was a complete waste of money.  I would have returned it if I could.  It is no better than a towel and much more expensive.</li>
    <li> I bought this towel with the intention of using it turban style to \\&quot;plop\\&quot; my curly hair and dry it faster.  The turban style is hard to accomplish (it took me several tries to figure out how to make the little rubber band go around the button to make a turban) and not good for plopping.  I use it sideways so I can plop and encourage curl formation.  So for curly heads, if you want a microfiber towel, stick with the regular ones.  The turbans smush your hair and won&#x27;t really work for plopping unless you use them just as you would a regular t-shirt or microfiber towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Diva Dryer does not dry my hair faster, as advertised.  I don&#x27;t notice any difference when using the Diva Dryer compared to using a plain old men&#x27;s t-shirt.  Both will absorb excess water (the t-shirt will feel wetter) and my hair will not be discernably drier after using the Diva Dryer.  Thus, I don&#x27;t think this costly towel is worth the money.</li>
    <li> This hair turban is a weird shape and hard to use.  Spend the extra couple of buck and get the real Aquis turban.  Its MUCH better.</li>
    <li> This product works just a bit better than using a regular bath towel. The only good thing about it is that it&#x27;s lighter than a regular towel and doesn&#x27;t move around.</li>
    <li> Will never NOT own these! So great for pinning up wet hair while you do your make-up!</li>
    <li> This is a nice idea that doesnt work at all.  I bought this to have a small,light, neat way to keep my hair out of the way while using facial masks, bubble baths etc... but the thing wont stay on your head, it rides up so your hair is exposed, it pulls uncomfortably at the front of your hairline-- it&#x27;s pretty useless.      Stick to using a towel and save your money.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t exactly way I pictured but Ive grown to love it! I have curly, think, long hair (Im mixed), and this towel dries my hair without making its frizzy. Ive only had it a week or so now, so I haven&#x27;t washed it yet and am not sure how that will affect it, but its definitely worth the buy!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my nine-year-old niece. My sister told me that is was too big for her head. Now my sister has a new turban towel, and I am still trying to find a smaller one for my niece!</li>
    <li> I was kind of disapointed in this product because I am so happy with other Aquis products. I expected it to be much more absorbent and dry my hair much faster. Unfortunately it does not seem to be any different from other turbans or just using a plain old towel. The button used to secure it is about the size of a quarter which you would think would make it easy to button, but I have difficulty with it. I have arthritis in my hands and it is difficult for me to raise my hands above and behind my head, so if you are healthy you will not have any trouble. If you have problems with your hands, I would skip this item.</li>
    <li> this towel stinks! it&#x27;s a cotton towel not a magic hair dryer!!! it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair or stay on your head!! i returned it as quickly as I could!!</li>
    <li> The microfiber doesn&#x27;t absorb water well and my hair is soaking wet long after I wash it.  I have others that are much more absorbent.</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely long and very thick. Whenever I used a regular towel to put my hair up, my hair would stick out the end and drip all over me. Not to mention this is 10x lighter than a towel. I love it. I&#x27;m thinking about getting another one, just in case the one I have is in the wash or I lose it! :)</li>
    <li> I wanted the microfiber towel but the beauty shop I was in didn&#x27;t have it, just this head wrap. I tried for a few weeks but couldn&#x27;t get it to work satisfactorily, so I took it back in. The clerk showed me how to use it, though, and I tried again but it still had the problems of it being unwieldy and too tight that others have reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to make it a towel, I then attempted to remove the elastic, but it&#x27;s sewn in, so I just chopped the blasted thing apart and use it as a strange, star-shaped towel.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a hat type turban this thing is big its to dry your hair like a big towel.</li>
    <li> This is better than a towel, not so bulky and heavy.</li>
    <li> Not easy to figure out how to use, took a couple of tries. Dries NO better than wrapping your head in a towel!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I wanted something to wrap my met hair in that would stay in place.  I&#x27;ve just used a bath towel in the past, but it didn&#x27;t stay in place very well.  My hair is about shoulder length, and it probably doesn&#x27;t need the capacity of this turban.  Ifind the turban useful because it has a button at the back and a loop a the front to allow you to secure the turban in place once you have wrapped your hair in it and twisted the turban.  It takes a bit of practice to get it right, but it does provide a means of keeping wet hair in place while you are drying off.</li>
    <li> Someone gave me this towel maybe fifteen years ago, and I never used  it much until recently. I have long hair and a small head and it works  great for me. Easy on the hair, light on the head, and yes it does pull more water  out of the hair (not necessarily from twisting but a light patting down before  I lightly twist it up on my head). No need to tightly twist to secure it. Yes, the button  did fall off and I had to reattach it. But I can honestly say it is worth the hassle to redo the button.  I take this towel wherever I travel...almost everywhere. Great in cold  climates. It did take a few tries to figure out that you want to pull the largest end over  the top of the head (easiest when leaning forward and letting hair hang in front of you)so that the button ends up at the back of your head.  All in all...the most useful hair towel product for long hair I&#x27;ve ever found. I&#x27;m going to  buy some for my neices.</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews BEFORE I went and bought this item! You will have to guess how to apply this turban to your head because the picture is quite vague. However, the key is to stretch it, then twist it, and then button int he back. This doesn&#x27;t work, because the item is EXTREMELY SMALL. I have thin medium-length hair btw so I cannot imagine who this product would be useful for, except possibly a very small child.  I wrote to the company to inform them I was VERY disappointed. I am glad however I bought one first, before getting one for a gift!</li>
    <li> The fabric and size of this hair towel is the worst I have ever used.  I have at least one of every hair towel on the market from over the years because my hair takes forever to dry so I need to wrap and then blowe dry after awhile of soaking the water out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is ridiculous - it squeezes my head so hard it gives me headache in 5 minutes or less-granted my head is sensitive but has never been sensitive to a hair wrap. It&#x27;s agony to wear this.  The fabric has an awful static quality to it - it sticks to everything, zaps your head or hand with static, collects everything from the dryer, lint, strings, anything it can suck off of other fabrics, it does.  But the worst part is that it is rough on your hands.  The inside is soft but the outside snags and catches on your hands, or a blankets/pillow case if you lay down, it&#x27;s just the worst quality and most expensive hair towel I have found.</li>
    <li> This microfiber towel is wonderful.  Microfiber is great for naturally curly hair as it doesn&#x27;t cause the hair to frizz.  I apply my product, pile my hair on top of my head and let it dry for 15 minutes or so.  Then diffuse for a few more minutes.&lt;br /&gt;My microfiber towels are off limits to the rest of my family.  Love them!</li>
    <li> I own 2 of these already in \\&quot;White\\&quot; and they&#x27;re great. I thought the pink was cute and I liked the packaging so I&#x27;ve given these to 2 of my friends as gifts. Both of them love them. So much better than using a towel on your head, which falls off. These hair turbans are the best way to go! I recommend having 2 of them. One for back up while the other is in the wash.</li>
    <li> This is an absolute waste of money and it is ridiculously hard to maneuver.  Thumbs down.  I returned mine.</li>
    <li> Use this every time I wash my hair. Stays in place and helps to absorb the water from my hair. When I am ready I take it off and do my hair.</li>
    <li> I am giving this as a gift. I don&#x27;t know much about the item itself, but sure it is good. I received this item as date promised which is a relief this time of year. I don&#x27;t think a person can go wrong by doing business with Amazon as they seem to associate themselves with top notch companies that not only handle quality materials, but also keep good stock.With this kind of report I will be doing business with them in the future.</li>
    <li> I like this hair towel but I find that my hair is still very wet when I take it off. I wish it was a little more absorbent, though it&#x27;s nice to have a towel for your hair instead of having to use a Regular one</li>
    <li> I love this hair turban! I&#x27;ve tried 2 other kinds; this one is so much lighter, softer, and fluffier AND stays in place. Very nice.</li>
    <li> My daughters always wanted to put a towel on their hair \\&quot;like mom\\&quot; but the towels were too big and always fell off.  These are PERFECT, they hold all their hair, which is long, and stay on their head!  The towel is very absorbent, their hair is not dripping all over like it used to be.  The button is a little hard for them to do themselves, but overall this is a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I have long hair (waist length, but thin). I prefer to air dry my hair, but that is just too uncomfortable in the winter, so I decided to try the turban.     I love the microfiber. I believe it really does help my hair dry more quickly. Note, I said more quickly. Not necessarily quickly. I love that the turban holds my hair off of my neck and back. Ideally, it always does that. Realistically, while my hair all fits in the turban, wrapping it so I can button it, and it stays in place, is a pain! Really difficult for me to do (but maybe it&#x27;s easier for more coordinated gals).     I&#x27;d give the microfiber itself four stars, but because the turban is a hassle, I&#x27;m only giving this product three stars. If I needed another such product I&#x27;d just buy a microfiber towel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I ever survived without one of these.  This is my second one purchased because I wore out the first one.  It stays put while I put on my makeup and skincare products and dried my hair a bit before blow drying it. After using it for a long time day after day, the elastic will ware out, but it is worth it for the price.  Definitely recommended for women.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and this thing is way too small!  Loop on one end button on the other just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Love this! My hair dries so much faster and it cut my blow dry time way down.</li>
    <li> I have used several of these over the years, but this is the best.  It really soaks up the water in  your hair and when you take it off, your hair is ready to be blown dry in a very short amount of time.  It really saves on hair blowing time and therefore you have less damage to your hair.</li>
    <li> When I first got it out of the package, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice the scratchy texture of the towel and obnoxious plastic odor (although I&#x27;m sure the odor will go away after washing.)&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on, followed directions, but still could not get it to clasp because the button is too high up and the button-hole is too far down (the button is underneath the turban so you have to flip it up.) Needless to say, unless you have a small head, this turban will not fully cover your head. I even had my sister try, and even she could not get it to clasp.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, everything about this product was disappointing. I&#x27;ll just stick to a regular towel from now on.</li>
    <li> I have used this for months and love it. I have long, thick hair and it takes a long time to dry my hair. The Diva Darling has been a great time saver. I can put my hair up in the CD while I put on my make-up. My hair is almost dry when I am ready to finish it. It is efficient and cute. I love the retro look and won&#x27;t be without one.</li>
    <li> A little pricy, but you get what you pay for! I have medium length hair and don&#x27;t like blow-drying. I always use some type of hair wrap after my shower and this works perfectly to dry my hair fairly quickly!</li>
    <li> I love these turbans!  Helps to dry my hair a bit quicker, but what I love the most is that they are lightweight &amp; secure...I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m having to balance my head all the time like a do when wearing a regular towel.  I know some other reviews complained that it was too small &amp; too hard to put on, but I don&#x27;t find it to be so.  With the elastic banding I think that is plenty big - and I have a large-sized head and lots of hair.  I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s easy to put on if I:&lt;br /&gt;1.  flip my head &amp; hair over upside down&lt;br /&gt;2.  put the button on the back side against the nape of my neck&lt;br /&gt;3.  get all my hair tucked inside&lt;br /&gt;4.  twist the whole thing, starting at the end of my hair&lt;br /&gt;5.  pull the twist back over my head &amp; clip the elastic over the button.</li>
    <li> Button popped off after a month--I felt it was too late to return it. I&#x27;ve had better luck for 15 years with the aquis turban (non Diva Dryer)</li>
    <li> I desperately wanted a Twirly Towel.  I have one that&#x27;s like probably 10 years old and gross, but can&#x27;t part with it!  I ordered one from Beauty Fanatic and 8 months later, still nothing.  So I got a refund and ordered this.  It&#x27;s pretty darn close.  It fits slightly different, but I have no problem with it falling off.  If you are looking for a Twirly Towel replacement, this is your product!</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the receiver said it worked well and she used it often. She has a second one for when she is at the gym.</li>
    <li> Bought 3 of these and gave a couple to family members. OMGosh! I couldn&#x27;t live without it. I have curly hair so this does wonders for me. Dries it fast so I prefer to use this as a towel to scrunch the water out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I do the DevaCurl method so this is an essential. My hair is the frizziest thing you can imagine. This product is one of the several things I use regularly to fight off frizz.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re one of those that think it takes a college degree to figure out how to use it.....Trust me college students are very smart, they choose to go into debt so that says it all (not being cynical just keeping it real). Well youtube it! It&#x27;s super easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Plus this item works for people of all hair types. I just happen to have super frizzy hair that requires extra $$ to manage.</li>
    <li> The material of this towel is like a microfiber cloth.  It can absorb liquids but does not drink water like a sponge .This towel was very helpful for my daughter to use.  She wasn&#x27;t very good at using a towel to dry her hair, and would proceed to soak her clothes and the couch with her dripping head.  She enjoyed using this and it solved the issue completely.  Another use is, you can use it as a cover for deep conditioning treatments, after plastic is applied.  It helps heat up the hair and provides better conditioning.  Plus it looks better than a plastic bag on your head.</li>
    <li> I have had microfiber hair turbans in the past and I must say that I am the least satisfied with this one.  The elastic is constantly riding up and the turban just pops off my head.  Maybe I have an odd shaped head.  This product would be much better off without the elastic.  I am thinking of trying to take it out somehow.  It is basically useless to me.  I would definitely go with the other ones.  On the bright side, the packaging is really cute.</li>
    <li> This hair turban is nice to twist my hair in when I want to leave a towel on for awhile.  It&#x27;s weighs so much less than a bath towel.  It also works really well for my 5 year old daughter when she wants to be like mommy and have a towel on her wet hair, too!  You have to be careful stretching it back to fasten with the button.  If I don&#x27;t pull the right amount of slack, it can be a bit tight and it hit some migraine pressure points on me.  But after using it a few times, the elastic seems to have stretched a bit, making it not so tight.</li>
    <li> I had trouble getting this to fit on my head. It seemed small, even though I don&#x27;t have a huge head. Twisting it and getting the button attached were a hassle. I&#x27;d be tempted to think it was my own lack of coordination, but I have no problems with the Twisty Towels I got at Bed Bath and Beyond. Also, the Twisty Towels were cheaper, and the fabric was just as nice.   So, if you like a challenge and want to spend twice as much, then buy this product. Otherwise, try the Twisty Towels.</li>
    <li> Nice microfiber towel that dries my curly hair without pulling it and causing frizz.  I like the snug fit with the button to secure it on the back.  This towel makes it easy for me to get ready without my wet hair dripping everywhere.</li>
    <li> Had a white one for years and decided to upgrade to the pink.  Keeps hair in place and away from your face.</li>
    <li> Tried others, never as good as Aquis.  This is a good size for adult heads with long hair.  Dries fast.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a microfiber towel in my gym bag for a reason: it&#x27;s absorbent and doesn&#x27;t take up much room.  So, I had high hopes that the diva dryer hair turban would shave time off my showering routine. Nope. It doesn&#x27;t seem to remove that much moisture from my hair, which is short and thick. This product gets 3 stars instead of 2 because it is effective at keeping the hair off my face while I apply moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with the intention of having it handy for our many granddaughters visits.  I already owned my own microfiber turban (another brand) and was satisfied...until...that turban was in the wash and I needed one to wrap my wet hair.  WOW! What a difference!  This is so superior to my other turban that I threw that one away and will purchase four or five of this brand to keep on hand for granddaughter visits!</li>
    <li> This is simply a regular old towel, there&#x27;s nothing microfiber about it. It&#x27;s big, bulky, and takes a long time to dry vs. real microfiber which is thinner, softer, has some stretch to it, and dries quickly. It also has a strange design, other hair turbans are far easier to use and secure than this, the tab and button don&#x27;t work properly. If you want microfiber make sure the material actually feels like microfiber. If you don&#x27;t know what microfiber feels like go to a store and feel the difference.</li>
    <li> Lovely thing totally love it</li>
    <li> Got this for my 7 year old daughter who has long hair. It&#x27;s a little big, but still fits and absorbs moisture in hair. Colors are cute; got the pink one. I tried it on - it&#x27;s a little boofy around the edges so it has tendency to ride up. Might sit better on adult with more hair or longer hair to hold. I usually use the Aquis microfiber turban which fits perfectly and doesn&#x27;t ride up.</li>
    <li> I now have three of these and think they are the best.  It is a convienient shape and the ends are gathered.  My hair falls right in place and it is easy to twist and attach to the big button. I have one for water aerobics and two for home.  They wash nice and keep their shape. A perfect way to pamper yourself.</li>
    <li> This microfiber turban is wonderful. After I wash my hair I use the hair turban. When I finish showering my hair is ready to be dried. It makes my morning routine easy.</li>
