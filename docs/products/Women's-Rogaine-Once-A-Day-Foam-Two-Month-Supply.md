      <li>I&#x27;ve used the 2% solution for years and it worked ok</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m sure it will work</li>
      <li>thank goodness I already love animals!&lt;br</li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>So glad they have Rogaine for women</li>
      <li>I feel and look so much better.  </li>
      <li>Great price and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>As I found out, it&#x27;s better to massage scalp and drink Biotin</li>
      <li>/&gt;After more than 3 weeks of use</li>
      <li>I will update this review after I have had more time to see the results, but of all of the minoxidyl products you can choose, to me this is the easiest to use</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing.</li>
      <li>So I thought this might be a step up - maybe more convenient.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife says it&#x27;s working, so OK. She should know she was a licensed cosmotolgist for 34 years. Enough said.</li>
    <li> I have embarrassing hereditary hair loss. My hair is thin and brittle too. I thought I would try Rogaine. I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t take up a lot of my time and I find that this product is fast and easy to use. Yes you have to part your hair and make sure you get it on the scalp but really it isn&#x27;t that hard. Especially at first when I didn&#x27;t have that much hair. I have seen a lot of people complain about not being able to measure half a capful... I use the cap and fill it half full... not that hard to figure out. It does take quite a few weeks for a noticeable difference. Do I have luscious locks now? No. That isn&#x27;t what I was expecting. I just didn&#x27;t want to see my scalp anymore and I have to say. Mission accomplished. My &amp;#34;new hair&amp;#34; is still growing and it is at that fly away stage but I think I will keep it up and see what happens. I haven&#x27;t had any adverse reactions although everyone is different and reacts different to medications. I&#x27;m half way through my second bottle.</li>
    <li> So far not a big result, but it did say it could take about 5 weeks to see results. I will give it time, however, I REALY don&#x27;t see how this is considered 4 months worth of product.</li>
    <li> My scalp was sore all the time.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I have only been using it for a week but it is not stiff and sticky like the liquid, is easy to use, and it makes my hair easy to comb through after using it and it makes my hair fluffy and look thicker than the liquid.  The liquid was so stiff in my hair and hard to comb and made  my hair flat.  The foam  is awesome and I love how my hair looks so thicker and fluffier.  Wonderful and much better than the liquid even if it doesn&#x27;t grow any hair and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> WAITING TO SEE IF IT WILL WORK !!</li>
    <li> Just plain doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Sorry but this product burnt my scalp and I could not use it.  I think it would have worked but my scalp was crusting and bleeding. Stopped using after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Slow results but I see a difference .I love it.</li>
    <li> Product delivered as expected. Used Rogaine for a while now. But this is the second batch of foam I ordered. Prior to that I used the liquid purchased at Walmart. It appears to be doing some good. Will try this batch for the next couple of months and see how it goes.</li>
    <li> Great product , very easy to apply . Do leave a mess compared with the liquid form . I always use gloves ( nitrile gloves ) to apply this product.</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE HEADACHE after 3 days of use!&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
    <li> I have a head full of new growth within 3 months. and I have horrible PCOS! So this will work for you PCOS ladies. You just have to give it time to work and be consistent with it.</li>
    <li> I always remember my ex-husband using Rogaine years ago and I used to laugh at how vane he was, lol, to want to grow hair back. Well, I find myself now using Rogaine. I am using it on my eyebrows (my salon hairdresser had recommended it since I am getting older and my eyebrows were thinning). Although it&#x27;s not recommended for contact that close to the eyes I have been very, very careful to use limited amounts and that none of it &#x27;leaks&#x27; down. I love the foam application, it makes it simple to apply. As others have mentioned it has minoxidil which does have it&#x27;s side effects, so carefully consider before using. I have started to see some growth in areas of my brows where no hair had been coming in for years now. I think this is great and will most likely not be using this for the full 4 month supply. I will update this again as I use it longer some time next month to see if it continues to work as well as I think it will.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply in foam.  Just massage it into the scalp.  It is less messy than liquid form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been noticing several hairs falling off since reaching 45 and started to get worried about thinning hair.  The result is inconclusive.  Don&#x27;t have any noticeable improvement in my case.  3.5 stars.</li>
    <li> Rogaine foam starts working after two or three months use, but the most noticeable results are after four to five months of continuous use. The foam is easy to apply to the scalp with minimal fuss. This product has helped some, but the results weren&#x27;t as good as I had hoped. Perhaps it will continue to get better over a longer treatment period. The only quibble I have with this product is it tends to cause a mild scalp itch.</li>
    <li> Women&#x27;s Rogaine has recently been touted as the new Latisse for hair: promising thicker, more luxurious locks.  Beauty magazines have been pushing it so hard that I finally decided to give it a try. Now, the reality is made pretty explicit by Rogaine. This product is for women with hereditary hair loss. Period. There are images on the side of the box that the consumer is asked to consult. If one&#x27;s hair is thinning in the middle a bit (but not drastically), this product may be effective. However, do know that the box states that those more substantial hair-loss will not benefit from this product. So, I&#x27;m not certain if all the new media hype is an off-label suggestion ... or if Allure simply \\&quot;had it wrong.\\&quot; Still, I gave it a try. Though I have seen no increase in thickness/volume, the box clearly reads that it can take up to a half a year to visually note any results. Therefore, I will use both containers and report back if I spy any increased thickness/volume. (Likewise, I will inquire with my dermatologist about the \\&quot;beautifying\\&quot; aspect of this product, which some are swearing by, and then update the review with her expert opinion).    Additional notes:  It may benefit the consumer to know that while 2% Minoxidil can fail the consumer, 5% has a slightly higher degree of efficacy. (This is a 5% solution). So those who are genuinely seeing hair-loss (NOT as a result of pregnancy or alopecia) may find better results with this particular product.    Rogaine does have a systemic effect. Therefore, any women with a history of heart-disease should refrain from trying/using this product. Likewise, any person who experiences chest pains, fainting, or rapid heart beat should discontinued using this and seek a physician. Do know that nearly the entire back panel is dedicated to cautions/warnings. To both keep yourself safe and avoid disappointment, please read every detail of that panel.</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair in the very front.  I put this on in the morning after styling my hair.  It comes out like a mousse.  So I put very small dabs over top of scalp then gently rub in.  It takes about 30 min&#x27;s to dry then I comb it and my style lasts all day.  My hair is noticeably thicker now.  Of course wish I didn&#x27;t need this, but thankful it works for me.</li>
    <li> does exactly what it say it will do</li>
    <li> My wife wanted to give this a try. She said it went on smoothly and has a mild but not unpleasant scent. No results are available yet because it takes 3 to 6 weeks to see any. I have less than 30 days to write a review. If and when any results are seen this review will be updated.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s effective, even though I keep using it everyday,but there is still no more hairs so far.</li>
    <li> At last a foam for women like the men&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Can feel it on my scalp , but can not tell yet if it is working.....only have been using for a month....was a great buy though compared to the store</li>
    <li> Seems to be working after 3 months of use. Dulls the hair, though. I personally don&#x27;t like a mousse application. Smells a lot like rubbing alcohol, and dries out my nails and cuticles if I don&#x27;t wash my hands really well after massaging in.</li>
    <li> I wanted so badly to try the Women&#x27;s Rogaine Foam Hair Regrowth Treatment. With thinning hair that runs in the family on both the male and female side, I was sure it would work. Unfortunately, I ended up with a tender and red scalp. I have a sensitive scalp and this was a huge disappointment. I&#x27;m not completely sure if it&#x27;s from the Rogaine but did discontinue it and am waiting for it to clear up. I&#x27;m going to wait a bit and have another go with it to see if it really is the problem. If I&#x27;m able to use it on my second go, I&#x27;ll come back and edit my review with updated results.</li>
    <li> works very well and it didn&#x27;t take very long to work</li>
    <li> it comes down to foam or liquid, right...which is better?&lt;br /&gt;Rogaine is a proven product. Ok, it does not work for everyone and yes, it takes months to see results.&lt;br /&gt;But if you are going to try one, which to use, foam or liquid?&lt;br /&gt;I am still a bit torn on that. Each has it pluses and minuses. I think the liquid is easier to apply evenly..but the foam is less messy.&lt;br /&gt;Either is a commitment.</li>
    <li> Since this product takes 60-90 days to show any results, and it&#x27;s been less than 30, I&#x27;ll give my observations to date. 1) When you apply this, you&#x27;ll quickly find if you have any cuts or scrapes on the application area. Man does it sting - but only for a few seconds. 2) It&#x27;s easy to forget to apply it. Keep it by the bedside or somewhere obvious so you remember! 3) Read the instructions. &amp;#34;one cap full&amp;#34; is the dose. 4) Be careful not to let the blob of foam fall out of your hand or roll down your back!  Sounds silly, but it happened to me twice.  Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s is identical, except for the higher dosage.</li>
    <li> Can you use Rogaine foam 5 percent and Rogaine 2 percent together .. Making it 7 percent</li>
    <li> Just received it and have used it twice. Definitely make sure your hands are dry and cold if not the mousse melts and is harder to put on directly to the scalp.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really give this a chance to work because, to me, it made my hair look and feel dirty.  I could stand this for a while, but to have dirty looking hair for the rest of my life wasn&#x27;t worth the extra hair growth (in my opinion).</li>
    <li> I like it, use it y days a week.  I think that it has done some good and I have more hair in some areas, in others I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s possible to se regrowth.  I don&#x27;t see near as much hair on my brush.  I believe it&#x27;s helping, I&#x27;ll continue to use it.  The only down side to this is that it makes my hair stiff, so I use it just before bed and always have to wash my hair in the am to style.</li>
    <li> This stuff works and is easy to use.  I apply several tiny &amp;#34;squirts&amp;#34; along my center part and the crown of my head and them work them into my scalp with the back of a soup spoon.  It feels gummy for a few minutes but after it dries you can&#x27;t tell anything&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After six months use (I&#x27;m on my second two-pack) my hair is so thick that I can hardly see my part.  It was a wide hairless strip last winter. Getting old has so many challenges - I&#x27;m thrilled that going bald isn&#x27;t one of them anymore.</li>
    <li> Been using for several months.</li>
    <li> Re-order.  Happy with product.</li>
    <li> having real success with hair regrowth so glad to have hair back isn, hard to use daily</li>
    <li> so far working great for me</li>
    <li> Buy Men&#x27;s Rogaine and use it once a day. It is so much cheaper that way. Ingredients are identical!  Don&#x27;t be ripped off!</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few months it works . You gotta put it on how they say to to see the results .</li>
    <li> I love it. It is working. So glad they have Rogaine for women and I only have to do it once a day.</li>
    <li> so far, after two plus months, no results. very disappointed</li>
    <li> I have not used this product although I would love to as I have very depressing hair loss probably due to menopause or just age.  My reasons for not using this product are huge fears of hurting or possible death to my pet cat.  I have read numerous reviews on the severe toxicity to cats and the extremely painful death that can result from minimal contact with this product.  From what I have read it does not take much to be fatal to pet kitties and mine sleeps on my pillow next to my head so this product is definitely out for me.  I just wanted pet owners to be aware or maybe someone has discovered a full proof way to keep your cat from harm.</li>
    <li> Great value! Great Results you won&#x27;t regret it if you use as directed</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I have been using the men&#x27;s foam and got great results from it all over the top of my head as well as (shhhh...don&#x27;t tell the manufacturers) my eyebrows and eyelashes. Men&#x27;s foam also did not irritate my skin and I have very sensitive skin. So I was excited when I saw the women&#x27;s, especially since it is only a once a day application. This product has not worked for me. I am losing hair I gained using the men&#x27;s plus it must have more alcohol in it because it is irritating my skin. I have a whole can that I will not be using since I have ordered the men&#x27;s foam again. Don&#x27;t know if I can return the unused portion but will investigate that because this was a huge waste of money and HAIR!</li>
    <li> I believe this is working much better than the liquid version that has less medicine in it.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. I purchased it for my mother and it&#x27;s not been a whole month so I&#x27;m not sure long term how it is but she seems happy with it.</li>
    <li> be careful where and how you apply.  I have thin spots at temples.  I apply to that area and suddenly i was growing some dark hair on my face in that area.  So even though easier to target than the liquid, it must still drip and hair that it gets on then rubs on facial skin and rubs off.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but I am in to my fourth month of using it and I can no longer see my scalp through my hair.  I also was out in the sun all day and did not get sunburn on my head which I had done the last time I was out without a hat.  I have to wear hats because of my eyes but I prefer to wear visors and now I can again, and my head is so much cooler.  I wish my Mother would have had access to Rogain when she was alive since she was almost bald.  I love the stuff.</li>
    <li> I works as advertised.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been using several months for hair loss due to thyroid problems. I can feel more new hair coming in. It is said to not work for thyroid hair loss but it does. I have had good comments from people I know so It is really working.</li>
    <li> I would rate this a zero, the bottles I received did not work, there was no pressure and they&lt;br /&gt;would not dispense the foam.  They were broken and not usable, I had to throw them&lt;br /&gt;away.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really give it a full review yet as have only been using for about four weeks.  Is a little messy though, and is easier to apply directly to scalp as appossed to fingers and then to scalp as directed. You can apply after washing hair and before styling, just need to wash hands after.  I find my hair does need washing more often when using.</li>
    <li> Foam product is a lot easier to use than the liquid form. Also only have to apply this product once/day instead of twice/day.</li>
    <li> First off thank goodness my hair is white. Because this stuff made my brush and combs white. I&#x27;d hate to think what it would do to dark hair. Second. Near impossible to get on my scalp the foam is a real pain.to me. Third. And the worst my hair really started falling out a lot. Some find it great...I&#x27;m just not one if them</li>
    <li> It has not been 4 months since I started using it but I really like it so far.</li>
    <li> It seems to be working, it is slow but hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast as it falls out. I am going to keep trying</li>
    <li> Rogaine caused headaches after awhile. This product is not for me.</li>
    <li> used the 2xdaily for years until this new one . love it. cant say anything has grown but don&#x27;t see any more thinning. easier to use and just 1 x daily is better. foam easier to deal with.</li>
    <li> This foam works well within about 2 months, slightly faster than other hair regrowth products for women that have a lower dose of Minoxidil. I like that it&#x27;s enough to use it just once a day (others you had to do it twice) and the foam is easy to apply and not sticky. I have problem spots in front, but the rest of my hair is pretty long so in the past I would always quit on these products because they would make the rest of my hair feel gross and sticky. This version doesn&#x27;t have this issue, and I already see results in my problem areas.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Says it&#x27;s takes 2 months to see results.</li>
    <li> Just started with it.  Will wait and see.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m seeing some changes after about 3 weeks of regular usage, with new hairs coming in.  One caution is that this product causes even permanent hair color to fade.  We&#x27;ll see how it goes in the next few months.</li>
    <li> So far it has worked fine. Have not noticed any new hair growth but it takes time.</li>
    <li> it only foamed twice now it does not work anymore i would to send it back</li>
    <li> Helps me keep my hair growing when I lose hair every 2 years because of hormone problems. So I use this to make shore I don&#x27;t go bald. It takes lots of time to re growth hair so give it a year.</li>
    <li> Update: If you have any hair don&#x27;t bother buying the foam.  You&#x27;ll never get it onto your scalp.  I can&#x27;t imagine what they were thinking making a foam for women.  I wish I could return it.  Lots of wasted time and frustration trying to get this product on to my scalp.  Original review: I know Rogaine works well for me because I&#x27;ve been using the serum for a while with good results.  I tried the foam because the serum causes me to itch,  plus I can only use it at bedtime because it makes my hair greasy and un-stylable.  I like that the foam does not irritate and actually gives more volume and lift at the roots but I&#x27;m having a really hard time applying it.  I do actually have hair,  and the product sticks to my hair instead of my scalp.  I need to find a way to get the air out of it and turn it into a liquid so I can get it onto my scalp.</li>
    <li> lets see just started</li>
    <li> I have hereditary thinning hair. I&#x27;ve been using the product about 4 months and I now have about 1 inch of new growth where there was none! It&#x27;s especially noticeable at the front of my hairline. I have to use a little gel to keep them in line with my other hair. You do have to keep using this product forever or your hair will start to fall out again and you must have a hereditary problem or this will not work for you. I am very pleased with my results so far!</li>
    <li> my wife loves this product.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping. Thank You.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. Quick ship!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 1 month. I see no change in hair growth yet; therefore, I can&#x27;t submit an accurate rating at this time.</li>
    <li> The Rogaine works good, just give it time! Takes about 3-4 months before it shows. And really affordable compared to other brands.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery will see what results after 3 months</li>
    <li> I am so happy I started using this product. I have baby fine/thin hair &amp; started  wearing wigs  11 yrs ago because my hair was thinning so much. I&#x27;ve been using Women&#x27;s Rogaine Foam for a little over a month and the growth is very noticeable.  The hair that is growing in is thicker than the hair that was originally there.  I still wear wigs but i&#x27;m hoping soon I won&#x27;t have to.  I feel like this is a miracle product.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to the availability of the 5% Rogaine product for women however, I find the foam format almost impossible to work with.  I am  trying to work better with it by keeping a dish in the freezer to squirt the foam onto (it melts too fast).  The dropper applicator that comes with the 2% product was perfect.  Very disappointed...I will likely  try to get a refund for this product.</li>
    <li> Prefer the liquid.  The foam is too hard to distribute evenly.  Haven&#x27;t use it long enough to know if it works or not</li>
    <li> used on 93 old woman may have helped....but not used long....</li>
    <li> Not going to waste any more money on such an expensive product.</li>
    <li> Purchased for wife and it is working. Slow, but working. Will keep buying.</li>
    <li> arrived opened not even plastic wrapped ..</li>
    <li> Have not seen any results yet.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working.  Can&#x27;t really tell yet since it&#x27;s only been about two weeks.</li>
    <li> It gave me chest pains.  Seriously.  Not a common side effect, I realize, but if it happens to you...&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice.  I had been using the 2% solution for four years with no ill effect and now can no longer use the 2% either.  Using the 5% created a sensitivity to minoxidil.  I&#x27;m so sorry I ever tried the 5%.&lt;br /&gt;The foam comes out fast and it&#x27;s hard to measure.  If you try it I suggest you start with LESS than the suggested dose just to be on the safe side.</li>
    <li> Working great!  Ready to order more!</li>
    <li> After reading reviews for this product I decided to try the foam.  I had been using the liquid type that you apply with a dropper with success, but it was a little drippy and you have to apply twice a day.  I was very disappointed with the foam.  It is very hard to get the foam on your scalp and not your hair.  I feel a lot of the product is wasted because it sits in your hair.  I also feel I lost months of progress I was making with the liquid.  I just bought the liquid again and don&#x27;t know why I thought it was so messy.  I just tip my head back a little when applying to my scalp and it doesn&#x27;t drip onto my forehead.  At least with the liquid you KNOW it is getting on your scalp.  Hopefully, I will get some of the re-growth back that I lost while using the foam.</li>
    <li> When using it hair felt thick, missed one day hair would come out in chunks .. Stopped using it and starting using  Jamaican black Castro oil - that works!</li>
    <li> I am still working with this product, I&#x27;mrating it on easev of use, iI notice if you  a rinse color for your hair, the dye do not o last as long, so I&#x27;m thinking the wet product strips the color. I&#x27;m not impressed with the growth yet, and I&#x27;ve been using it since Christmas weekend once daily. I&#x27;ll finish out the double form cans and see if I will give it more time.</li>
    <li> FINALLY SOMETHING THAT WORKS</li>
    <li> I consider myself extremely finicky, critical of any product. I did my research regarding this product/company. Purchased the foam against popular recominadtion, glad I did!   First, I&#x27;m Caucasian, red, naturally curly hair, fair skin. Second, I&#x27;m 42 years old and had thin hair due to age and heredity. Pathology helps assist in product choice. I urge anyone to consider the same. That being said, foam based products work well with my specific type of hair and scalp.   I used this product as directed and have been impressed with the results. Given my genetic makeup, I can afford to not wash my hair daily, but rather every two to three days which in my opinion works well with my natural and essential oils in my scalp and hair. Also, I used a dry oil in between washes. Again, naturally curly hair tends to be dry and frizzy.   In short, I&#x27;m 100% satisfied and for the price, it&#x27;s well worth the results!</li>
    <li> My hair is starting top grow in I think I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff &amp; will use it forever. My hair is so much more full after using this for a few months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to rate this product as I never tried it but that&#x27;s because when I read the box I realized it&#x27;s for women only with thinning hair on the top!  I thought it might proactively prevent the receding hairline that I&#x27;ve watched develop with my sibling as they&#x27;ve aged (I&#x27;m the youngest at 57)!  As with vitamins, I understand that Amazon cannot take the product back for a refund so I called manufacturer who much to my surprise, advised me that the product hasn&#x27;t been tested on hairline growth so it may not be safe or effective and then they gave me a full refund!  Long story short, in my opinion, Johnson &amp; Johnson deserve 5-stars in customer service!</li>
    <li> I had heard that Rogaine really works so I was excited to try it on my thinning hair. I used it as directed every night for 3 Weeks. I started having chest pains and racing heart during that time. After 2 appointments to the cardiologist with an ekg and ecocardiogram, I realized it was a side effect of the Rogaine. So glad I realized it was from the Rogaine and stopped right away,  my chest pain and racing heart stopped too. It does have these effects listed on the package but really didon&#x27;t not think it would cause it. Nervous to see what my medical bills will be. Be careful of the side effects.</li>
    <li> I know what your thinking looking at the ratings for this product. I was afraid too, purchasing this was a hassle not knowing what to expect. I decided I would give it a try and purchase it. It&#x27;s been about about a month owing this product and I do have the 4th month supply. The first month has passed and I can see an improvement already. I know when I am combing my hair I have a sense of more hair. So far this product has worked. I am so glad I purchased it and you should too.  The negative reviews I do feel as of maybe the didn&#x27;t read the instructions right and follow the procedures. You will see improvement just a little in one month.</li>
    <li> I developed rapid heartbeat when taking Rogaine, so stopped taking it.</li>
    <li> purchased for someone else</li>
    <li> I have only been using this 2 months, but am seeing hair growth. I tried the older rogaine (in purple package) several years ago and my scalp became red and itchy, I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore, due to sensitive skin. When I saw an add for this foam, I decided to give it another try. I have not experienced any discomfort and am starting to see quite a bit of hair growth. Very fine hairs so far, but the package does warn to use for 3-4 months before seeing results, so I&#x27;m happy. I apply it at night before bed and then wash my hair in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that I also started taking biotin (which I have taken before) and Mynoxidrin at the same time, so some of the good results may be from those products.</li>
    <li> Very good. It work fine</li>
    <li> I have had very good results with this product.  With the auto-ship it is averaging about $10 a month.  Not bad.  I have more hair in the areas that were quite thin before.  Only drawback I have had is that when my hair was colored the root area took the color differently.  But I did not wash my hair that day.  So we shall see what happens next coloring.</li>
    <li> I do like this Foam product.  It&#x27;s not like the first time they came out with foam.  This is not sticky and tacky, it dries quickly and is easy to comb through. I also like only having to use it once a day.</li>
    <li> I have been losing my hair for about 20 years at a fairly steady rate. I have exactly the kind of hair loss that the package indicates- hereditary and in the same spots. I used this once daily according to the package instructions- half cap-full of foam rubbed into the scalp. I had no problems with melting or running or anything. I kept using it for 6 months as the instructions say it can take that long to work, but not to use it longer than 6 months if it hasn&#x27;t started working, and I was hoping it would kick in. End result: I lost about 30 to 40 percent of the hair I had left in that 6 month period. No new growth period. I never liked looking in the mirror but now doing that or touching my hair at all makes me want to cry. Before Rogaine foam I had a part. It was a side part, because the hair down the center of my head was too thin, but it was a part. A line with hair on both sides. Now there is no place on the top of my head I can part my hair that does not have at least a 1-inch mostly bald spot on either side. I can do a Donald Trump just above my ear side of my head part and look like a loser with a comb-over, but even then there are still the bald patches at the front of my hairline that have no hair left to cover them. Before Rogaine I could put my hair up in a ponytail. Now If I put my hair up I&#x27;m just exposing the giant bald patches on the sides of my head. At least I&#x27;m also fat, ugly and friendless so being bald as well doesn&#x27;t have a tremendous impact on the quality of my life.</li>
    <li> Have been using Rogaine since I received it and am hoping for results. Almost time to order some more as I do plan on continue using it for results.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see results.  I&#x27;ll keep using it for a few more months.</li>
    <li> Using the foam once a day is a lot easier than the liquid twice a day. It works very well for me, and the price was very good for the product.</li>
    <li> Used product for four months . Very little change to my hair. In my opinion this product is to expensive for the little result you receive. Not happy !</li>
    <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years</li>
    <li> Use it every day - almost time to re order but not yet!</li>
    <li> So far its working I can see alot growth already ive only been using this product for three weeks ...im happy with the outcome so far ...</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s working after 4 months but maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much. Will give it 2 more months to decide if it&#x27;s worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> To early in treatment to see any difference.</li>
    <li> Foam has a tendecy to stick to your hair rather than your scalp</li>
    <li> I was so excited to see they finally made it in a foam for woman. Here&#x27;s to good results.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell if my hair is growing in, but I know this product works and I am glad to see it is available in a 5% strength.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my thinning hair.  After paying for it and reading the instructions/fine print, it is not intended for thinning hair - ONLY thinning hair on top of the head and along a hair part line.  It would have been helpful for me to have had that information spelled out prior to me wasting $38 on a product that had no chance of being helpful.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I&#x27;ve used the 2% solution for years and it worked ok but this 5% solution has me sprouting hair like crazy! It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> Nice to only have to do it once a day :)</li>
    <li> I think it works but It takes months</li>
    <li> I have hereditary hair loss, which is notoriously hard to treat.  I tried the women&#x27;s Rogaine several years ago and was not impressed.  However, I had high hopes for the new 5% formula.  I did find the foam easier to apply than the traditional liquid, but that&#x27;s about it.  The only difference this product seemed to make in regards to my hair was to dry my scalp out for a bit--and that&#x27;s after six months of use.</li>
    <li> Well , I think it&#x27;s working lol I thought it wasn&#x27;t  made for black gals hair but it ain&#x27;t bad ...</li>
    <li> Honestly I didn&#x27;t noticed much of a difference. I have some &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; hairs in 2 small spots that refused to grow more than an inch long, so I figured I would see if this would help promote the hair growth there. I used it exactly as it said and I never really noticed a difference. It may only work for those who are losing/have lost hair, instead of stubborn baby hairs that refuse to grow!</li>
    <li> Be patient it really works. Follow directions. And the price is right from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but my receding hairline is no more and lots of regrowth after the first 2 months!</li>
    <li> Just arrived.  Used it twice in the passed couple of days.  I hope its getting to scalp or where it needs to be to help grow hair.  I felt like the solution was more exact on my scalp.  So, we shall see if I get results in next few months.</li>
    <li> After 4 month, I saw beginning of growth..now, at 6months-- see lots of one inch new growth...</li>
    <li> theyt don&#x27;t tell you about the effects if you are on blood pressure meds bad product</li>
    <li> I notice good result as of now</li>
    <li> The foam gets all over the hair even though parted. It is sticky and mats the hair down. Maybe it will grow hair but women don&#x27;t shampoo our hair as often as men. So I&#x27;m stuck with icky hair. I should have gotten some brand as a liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Bazinga won&#x27;t refund!</li>
    <li> Dried out my hair and didn&#x27;t help regain my hair. I don&#x27;t recommend this product!</li>
    <li> works, while you are using it. When you stop, hair will&lt;br /&gt;go back to the same condition as before. As I found out, it&#x27;s better to massage scalp and drink Biotin</li>
    <li> I used it once at night on the day I received it, I was so excited. Then I went to bed. I woke up 3 hours later because I was having difficulty breathing. I looked in the mirror and my tongue was so swollen I couldn&#x27;t  close my mouth! I immediately took an antihistamine and it took almost 8 hours for the swelling to go down. When I googled Rogaine, the medical sites mentioned the adverse reaction of swollen mouth and TONGUE. The only &amp;#34;rare&amp;#34; (swelling) reaction to Rogaine mentioned in their packaging is swollen hands or feet. I could have choked on my own tongue!</li>
    <li> Like this stuff.  Almost stopped using it at first because a lot of my hair started coming out, and it was hard to get the foam onto my scalp and not just on my hair.  Discovered that the accelerated hair loss was normal during the first 2 weeks because the foam speeds up the growing process, and after the first week or so, I now hardly lose any hair.  Also discovered little tricks to get the foam onto my scalp.  I wash my hair (or at least get it wet in the shower) and towel dry it very well before applying the foam.  It goes on much easier for me when my hair is a little damp (contrary to the directions which say to put on dry hair).  I put a little bit on the tips of fingers on both hands, and make a little path with the backs of my fingers while my hair is hanging down and then rub it in.  Tried the &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; Rogaine first which did grow hair well, but it made my hair greasy and look thinner than when I started.  The foam is not greasy and I only need to use it once a day.  So foam is the way to go for me.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> patience is going to work just need to keep putting it on~ For me yes I feel it is working just not overnite,which is okay,it is a lovely product I was surprised really of how well it does work, it is fine for me,stay with the product,I feel you can obtain positive results!</li>
    <li> To messey.  Hair was wet consistently.  Do not use.  Waiting for return information.</li>
    <li> This product really scared me.  Within seconds of applying to my scalp, I had a terrible taste in my mouth.  If it travels that quickly to my mouth I really don&#x27;t want this stuff in my brain.</li>
    <li> Did not like it because I notice it strip my hair and the texture change. Maybe not good for African Americans</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and the purchase process was easy. I would but again. I put 3 stars because I have only had to product for 3 weeks not enough time for results. But everything else was fine!</li>
    <li> SEEMS TO BE WORKING SOME WHAT. ONLY USED FOR 10WEEKS. NEED TO USE FOR 6 MONTHS TOTAL. EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT. HOWEVER THE PRICE WAS GREAT COMPARED TO THE STORES.</li>
    <li> Thank you got it fast. I hope it works!!</li>
    <li> A little bother to use. Waiting to see results</li>
    <li> I did not like the foam at all.  To me it is easier to use the liquid with a dropper.  With the foam I never felt like I was getting it onto my scalp but instead smearing it on my hair near the scalp.</li>
    <li> seems to be working, I&#x27;ve been using it for oh most 2 months, little baby hairs to coming back so we will see!</li>
    <li> leaves my hair looking fuller smells nice</li>
    <li> My hair stopped falling out the day after I started using it and has become quite a bit thicker in the three months since I began. Because my hair is thicker than before, I actually have more difficulty applying it now - what a great problem to have!  It&#x27;s well worth the once-a-day effort to use the foam.  And because it&#x27;s foam, it is easily applied and controlled - it doesn&#x27;t drip.</li>
    <li> had bad experience using</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. thanks</li>
    <li> Was bald at my temples......and after 30 days new hair was showing, it also improved my hairline.....now I am also working on towards my crown......Did not have any allergic reactions.  Was losing my hair due to medication I am taking.  Doctor recommended this and I was surprised as when I read about i,t it said it would not work for where I was losing my hair.....It did and I continue to use it almost daily.....&lt;br /&gt;I buy the I cans at once as it seems to be a better value.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for three months now and what first stated happening is it appeared that my hair started coming out even more. However, after reading much  literature  on the product which said that&#x27;s what happens before your hair starts to grow back in. I see little progress and satisfy  or convince  that it&#x27;s really working and I am going to give this product a year. My doctor said it going to take a year for the product to really work.  So for now the verdict is out</li>
    <li> Too messy!  So far, can tell no difference.  Will finish bottle and see if it works.</li>
    <li> great to use only once a day instead of twice.  like the fact that it is 5%  instead of 2%.  once in the morning and ur finished for the day.  foam is easier because it doesn&#x27;t run off the scalp before completely rubbing it all in.  been using for quite some time.  i see a little peach fuzz in top of my head.  all other hair growth treatments i have use contain minoxidil, so why not jut buy it straight out.</li>
    <li> I like the new foam better than the liquid.  This stuff works!</li>
    <li> I have always had an enormous amount of hair, but it definitely thinned after menopause.  I had the opportunity to try this to see if it would make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;There are 4 things that I really like about this product that differentiate it from other brands: 5% solution instead of two; no heavy smell; once daily application; foam is less messy and easy to apply.  I will update this review after I have had more time to see the results, but of all of the minoxidyl products you can choose, to me this is the easiest to use</li>
    <li> Thick foam is easy to apply and dissipates quickly. Sleep with a towel over the pillow, there is a little residual oil.</li>
    <li> This was so much easier to use than the liquid.  I am able to remember to use it at night better than the drippy one twice a day.  I will buy this again.  I already see results in a month and a half.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the results!  I started using the product around the first of the year.  I almost didn&#x27;t reorder after 4 months supply ran out because I didn&#x27;t think it was working.  I went ahead and reordered and a month later (after 5 months of regular use) I suddenly noticed all this new growth around my hairline!  It was almost as if it happened overnight!  Even my husband commented that my hair was looking thicker.  I was thrilled.  I love the foam product.  There&#x27;s no dripping or mess.  It also seems to plump up the hair just like a mousse product does.  I wish I had taken a before picture!  Glad I stuck with it.  I was getting pretty worried about the thinning of my hair.  Now if I can just talk hubby into using Rogaine himself!</li>
    <li> This is a 4-month supply and it&#x27;s only been 30 days (and I didn&#x27;t start using it right away so it&#x27;s actually been less than 30 days of usage for me)...so I can&#x27;t really write much of a review yet. However, since it&#x27;s a Vine product, I have to write something. So here I am!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably worth mentioning that though this is &amp;#34;Women&#x27;s Rogaine&amp;#34;, I am not, in fact, a woman. When this product showed up on my Vine list, I saw &amp;#34;Rogaine&amp;#34; and I thought hey, I&#x27;ve been meaning to try that! Then I saw &amp;#34;Women&#x27;s Rogaine&amp;#34; and thought, oh well. But I decided to check on the differences between Men&#x27;s Rogaine and Women&#x27;s Rogaine. I will now list the differences here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yep, there is literally no difference in the formula. So why do they market the same formula as two different products? I have no idea. But I went ahead and ordered it. Here&#x27;s hoping that it works! I will report back as I work through the 4-month supply.</li>
    <li> NOTE:  Review will be updated in two months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After more than 3 weeks of use, I haven&#x27;t noticed any new hair growth but this is definitely not enough time to properly review this product. My hair is naturally thinning a bit due to age but hair loss doesn&#x27;t run in my family so it may not have the desired effect per the instructions. However, I am giving this three stars because it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle to use unless you wash your hair every day and if you are older (which is most women with thinning hair), washing it every day is the last thing you want to do, and if you stop using this product your hair loss will return and you will likely find your hair thinned to the same degree it was before you started using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who don&#x27;t wash their hair everyday, the instructions clearly note that this product works best on a &amp;#34;clean scalp&amp;#34;. I use a very light product in my hair and found that on day two of use with dry hair, my hair was a bit more difficult to work with. Also trying to work a foamy mousse into my hair was a bit challenging (leave yourself extra time on this days). I did not like how my hair felt afterwards and throughout the day. I ultimately started washing my hair every day and using a leave-in conditioner to keep it from getting dry from too much styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall here is what I found on the plus side:&lt;br /&gt;- very faint, light and pleasant scent, package says it&#x27;s unscented&lt;br /&gt;- easy application IF you wash your hair every day, only requires once a day application&lt;br /&gt;- works well with hereditary hair loss (menopausal women may not find this product useful)&lt;br /&gt;- product is a foamy substance not liquid making it much easier to work into the scalp&lt;br /&gt;- best results are for women with thinning at the top of the crown&lt;br /&gt;- works best for women with hair loss due to hereditary conditions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand:&lt;br /&gt;- should be used on a clean scalp which means you should wash your hair every day so may be wise to invest in a leave-in conditioner too so your hair doesn&#x27;t dry out&lt;br /&gt;- hair loss will return if you stop using the product (in the instructions)&lt;br /&gt;- if your thinning is on the sides, you may not find success with this product (again, per the instructions)&lt;br /&gt;- if hair loss is naturally due to aging, product may not work as well&lt;br /&gt;- will leave your hair feeling like you have a ton of product worked into it if you use on dry, unshampooed hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stayed Tuned!ay so may be wise to invest in a leave-in conditioner too so your hair doesn&#x27;t dry out&lt;br /&gt;- hair loss will return if you stop using the product (in the instructions)&lt;br /&gt;- if your thinning is on the sides, you may not find success with this product (again, per the instructions)&lt;br /&gt;- if hair loss is naturally due to aging, product may not work as well&lt;br /&gt;- will leave your hair feeling like you have a ton of product worked into it if you use on dry, unshampooed hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stayed Tuned!</li>
    <li> I cannot attest to the efficacy of this product yet since it takes at least several months for it to work and my review needed to be completed within 30 days. I think that I may not be a candidate for this product since I did not notice increased hair growth...yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can attest that the product does not have an unpleasant smell (odorless), and that I dislike the daily application and then later (or the next morning) the daily shampooing. I have just finished a year of shampooing every other day after a lifetime of shampooing every day &amp; it has not been easy to tolerate going about with semi-oily hair.  I can attest that shampooing every day with this product may thwart this year of \\&quot;scalp training\\&quot; so it is challenging for me to forge ahead not knowing if the product will work prior to using it. Although the product states that it will work only on specific types of hair loss, I found it difficult to assess if my own hair loss was this type.</li>
    <li> Easy to use--no smell (which is good).  Haven&#x27;t seen a reduction of hair loss yet, but it has only been 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> Added a small amount of new growth around the hairline.  id rather have a big bushy head of hair but this stopped the hair loss and added a little o im pretty satisfied.</li>
    <li> ***½ Minoxidil - called Rogaine - basically does not regrow hair, but only slows or stops hair loss since it inception in Hungary, as it was described already in 1980s in Europe.  Knowing that allows to see that the statement in the &amp;#34;Directions&amp;#34; above is not logical and its understating aspect is misleading.  It says: &amp;#34;Continued use is necessary to increase and keep your hair regrowth or hair loss will begin again&amp;#34;.  Well, regrowth is not opposite to loss.  Opposite to regrowth is no regrowth, i.e. retention or loss.  Opposite to loss is no loss, i.e. retention.  If Rogaine was for regrowth, it would be unnecessary for those interested in only retention what they have.  It must be against loss in order to secure retention.  It is not said that when Rogaine is discontinued, the hair loss will return to a normal rate within 30 to 60 days and the hair retained due to its use will be lost as well, as if it was never used.  In other words, Rogaine use is a commitment for life.  Nevertheless, it works and, like nothing else.</li>
    <li> The big deal with this Rogaine is two-fold - that it&#x27;s a foam and less runny than the liquid, and the big news, that it&#x27;s a 5 percent solution. For eons, women were warned they&#x27;d grow two heads (with or without hair?) and drop dead if they used anything stronger than the 2 percent solution that was in the product. Apparently the PTB changed their minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several dreadful surgeries a few years ago, half my hair fell out of my head. Yes, it did grow back, but my hair isn&#x27;t as it was pre-surgery (just to let you know, surgeries that use anesthetic may very well cause a massive, allegedly temporary hair loss two months after the procedure.) You could say my hair record is spotty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always avoided Rogaine not because it&#x27;s a committment, but more because if you stop using it, you can go from Rapunzel to Mr. Clean overnight (or so they say.) It&#x27;s the same reason I don&#x27;t want eyebrow tattoos or other fake stuff. I like my beauty natural; makeup is about as far as I&#x27;m willing to go for fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this for a month, it&#x27;s easy to apply. I see nothing on my part, but the truth is that my hair loss at this point is minimal, so that a mild improvement over such a short span of time could easily go unnoticed. I&#x27;ll update this if the hair growth is more substantial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, I&#x27;d suggest ingesting biotin and pre-natal vitamins to up your chances. Both did wonders to restore my hair after the surgeries and resulting hair loss; they certainly are great for making your hair and nails grow FAST!</li>
    <li> Soooo much better than the liquid form. So easy to use and only 1X a day. I love the new foam.</li>
    <li> This product was a waste of my money. one of the foam cans felt like it was empty. The other can the foam never came out. I just deposited both cans in the trash....never will I buy this avian</li>
    <li> Since we bought this nothing has change so I can&#x27;t truly rate this product.</li>
    <li> Not able t use because of side effects.  I have low blood pressure ad after several days of use I became dizzy upon arising in the AM until I stopped use.  Amazon was generous in that product non-refundable however credit given  Yeah Amazon!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do a lot for me. I also don&#x27;t like the fact that you have to keep using it in order to maintain any new hair growth that it gives you. I won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
    <li> Used this product for a couple of weeks and felt there was some improvement in my hairline.  But, the hairs were very few and far between.  They were also just as fine and fragile as existing hairs - before using Romaine.  Since, I&#x27;ve learned about Biotin which is said to be very effective.  Switched to Biotin to see if it makes a REAL difference.</li>
    <li> grew hair on forehead but not on scalp, was really disappointed it didnt work. Used it for almost 8 months with no hair growth on scalp</li>
    <li> First time I have tried this product. Too soon to give a resounding review.</li>
    <li> Only used it once and threw it out - it made my hair stiff and sticky even when applied only to the roots.</li>
    <li> Grew my hair like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. From bald to 3 1/2 in 3mos. That what I call werk! Love this product. Will definitely be re-ordering soon.</li>
    <li> Rogaine works well, but you have to take it for a very long time to see results..and you cant ever really stop.. I also take it with  [[ASIN:B00XJ3GPJA Finoxidrin - Powerful Hair Nutrient Supplement]] and my hair has never looked better! Adding the mynoxidrin made my hair grow much faster. I may even stop using the rogaine soon.</li>
    <li> Not what I wanted to get but the product is what was described.</li>
    <li> I recently started this.  It is way too early to make comments.  It is nice and easy to apply.  After 4 - 6 months, I will be ready to comment.</li>
    <li> Beware if you have high blood pressure or heart issues. It took me 6 days of using it to realize that it was the Rogaine that was giving me chest pains and raising my blood pressure.  It took 2 or 3 days of not using it for my chest pains to go away and pressure to go down.</li>
    <li> Hereditary hair loss is no fun (especially for women) and I was heartbroken when I found out I had it years ago. It is incredibly common though! You just don&#x27;t notice it so much on other ladies, because it&#x27;s actually not so terrible to handle.&lt;br /&gt;Rogaine is fantastic for re-growing hair and also keeping the strands you still have ;)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the twice daily liquid solution for years, but this foam is much better and gentler on the scalp too. I put it on in the evening, so only my hubby gets to enjoy the greasy look - no fussing around with Rogaine in the mornings any more!</li>
    <li> Been using for almost 6 months. After approx 3 weeks to a month hair felt thicker. Did not see little hairs sprouting or anything but also did not seem to lose hair. That is why it felt thicker I quess. Top of my head was quite thin. Been thinning since I was 20 and now am 52. I had thick hair as a child. I did notice after a few months that I had a more solid hairline. Now at almost 6 months I am really happy. My hair feels so muck thicker. I had a almost balding patch near the back of my head and this has filled in nicely. Not the thickest hair but I am happy with it so far. It feels like a miracle for me. No adverse reactions. I use it faithfully every night and wash my hair in the morning. The foam itself gives hair a thicker feeling also. I use coconut oil in my hair occasionally if it gets dry. I also take iron and hair vitamins. I believe Rogaine is the only product that actually works to keep the hair follicles that are still alive. Will continue to use forever if no adverse affects.&lt;br /&gt;Update Nov 8 2015&lt;br /&gt; Still working well and my hair is even thicker. Ten months in. My hairdresser noticed and was amazed. My hair feels different to wash even. My head is warmer in the cold too. Will continue to update.&lt;br /&gt;Update Aug27,2016&lt;br /&gt;Hair is still getting thicker. Feels almost normal. I don&#x27;t really think about it anymore. Love,love,love Rogaine!</li>
    <li> Takes a little while, but my hair is much thicker on the top. I&#x27;m happy to know it works for  me!</li>
    <li> The 1st foam product I tried - Foligaina 2% for women.  It worked fine but the foam was too wet would separate quickly and dripped on my forehead.  I tried Rogaine 5% foam for women - it was too dry and hard to get into the scalp area.  I solved this problem with a few drops of water mixed in the cap.  I used both solutions with a Q-tip as an applicator and the cap as a reservoir.  Both products worked but it was easier to add water to Rogaine and no dripping.  I was concerned about the increase to 5% but have not had any ill effects I only use this product once or twice a week for lightly thinning hair around my temples, crown and eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any difference but will continue to use it. If there is any improvement I will update my review.</li>
    <li> Works!!!!!!  Yeah, I have actually seen baby regrowth in all areas where my hair in last 1- 1 1/2 years had truly thinned!!!  I was devastated, and because my whole body in last 2 yrs had Bern subjected to both cancer, and a botched back surgery. And followed with PICC LINE being installed into my vein-heart for three months to kill 3 massive infections going into spine from drain, I truly believe lost hair due to trauma, yes ladies, TRAUMA IS A KILLER for luscious hair.  But I digress, apologies, ROGAINE works, and for me, wasn&#x27;t 4 months until noticed, literally 2-3 weeks, baby regrowth, chin up, truly if you are of androgenic alopecia reasons, and not anything else, then rogaine will work</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.</li>
    <li> not sure if the product works after 3 weeks...My dermatologyst said my case might need the to use the man one. He told me after I bought the woman stuff he recommended me but this amazon company was great.</li>
    <li> I  have not used this product, but I did read the information about who should not use it.  I qualified to be a user only to read, in the fine print brochure which comes in the box, that it will not regrow hair loss that is due to HYPOTHYROIDISM.  I would have saved my money had I known that.  It is not returnable so I&#x27;ll have to try and talk my brother into using the womens&#x27; formula.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Rogaine user for years. This foam is messy and you end up getting more on your hair than your scalp. I&#x27;m sure it will work but when I&#x27;m done with this I will go back to the original liquid form.</li>
    <li> I used Rogaine for Women a few years ago to thicken the hair growth at the front of my scalp and it worked fairly well but was too messy. This new formula is a foam and it&#x27;s neat and easy to use. You just massage a cap full&#x27;s worth (I squirt it directly onto my hand) into your scalp  once and day and wash your (gloveless) hands afterward. It goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t show, and is odorless. I expect it to work as well for me as the drippy kind did.  I&#x27;ll report back in a few months.</li>
    <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to see good results. I have thinning hair and as a woman, it is embarassing. I have noticed around my hairline near my face, hair is coming in quickly but on top at the crown, I haven&#x27;t noticed mush difference yet. This has no scent which I was glad for. Maybe a few more weeks will garner more results.</li>
    <li> I really thought I&#x27;d like this. I&#x27;ve been using the liquid version of Rogaine and I do like that product. So I thought this might be a step up - maybe more convenient. I was wrong. While the Rogaine itself seems to be working, I don&#x27;t like this foam at all. Most of it gets stuck in my hair and makes it stiff. I don&#x27;t like it all over my hands. Give me the liquid version.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the formulation that&#x27;s dispensed with an eyedropper with success and wanted to try this foam version. At this early stage I&#x27;ll address the ease of use and personal preference with using Rogaine. It does take a couple to a few few months to see growth changes and you must continue the treatment  to maintain the effects or you&#x27;ll be back to where you were before using Rogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially it does seem the foam is easier to manage, stays put and doesn&#x27;t drip. But for me I&#x27;m leaning toward the eyedropper to get to my scalp easily and gently dispense the fluid treatment. Yes it tends to run and can get drippy if not careful, but I&#x27;ve learned to manage it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still adjusting to using the foam which isn&#x27;t as easy applying to my scalp through my naturally curly hair. The jury is still out on BOTH my preference and the product effectiveness. I need the months required to evaluate it with actual hair growth.</li>
    <li> I have alopecia on the back of my head.  My hair stylist found the spot.  She said I needed to see my doctor in case it was related to some illness.  My doctor ruled out illness, and sent me to a dermatologist, who gave me the diagnosis and a prescription for a steroid gel.  The gel didn&#x27;t help, so I decided to try liquid Rogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liquid Rogaine comes with a dropper that is marked so the proper dosage is dispensed.  However, the product left my hair feeling slightly gummy, and had to be applied twice per day.  I did not last a month with it.  Except for measuring the proper amount, it was difficult to work with, and made my hair a mess, so I stopped using it after a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly before the Rogaine Foam appeared in my Vine selections, I was having a conversation with a male co-worker about how we both feel more concerned about appearance than we did in our youth.  He said he was using Rogaine Foam, and really liked it.  He had the same issues with the liquid.  He encouraged me to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now I have.  I like the foam.  It doesn&#x27;t drip unless your hands are too warm.  The packaging suggests running cool water over your hands if they are warm, because warmth melts the foam.  The liquid would sometimes run down my neck.  It was difficult to get it in the right spot.  I can squirt the foam on my palm, and smack it down in the right spot, then massage it in.  It dries quickly and leaves very little residue.  Though my hair is fine, there is not enough residue to affect appearance or feel.  In that respect, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, dispensing the correct amount is difficult.  The directions call for half a cap full.  The cap isn&#x27;t marked, and it&#x27;s hard to get the product out of it.  The first time I tried it, I got a whole cap full, and you can&#x27;t put it back.  Then there&#x27;s the matter of getting the product out of the cap.  The directions say to put the dispensed product on a saucer.  So, you&#x27;re supposed to try to squirt half a cap full onto a saucer so you can pick it up with your fingers to put it on your scalp.  This is awkward even if you&#x27;re not holding a mirror in one hand so you can see the back of your head.  I put a guesstimate squirt right on my palm and apply it.  Why bother dirtying a saucer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the can automatically dispensed the correct amount, this would be a no-brainer five star product.  But even with that issue, this is very good.  By the way, there is no difference between Rogaine for men and women.  They just have different labels.  I recommend you try this.  If you&#x27;re already using Rogaine Foam, shop for price regardless of your sex.try to squirt half a cap full onto a saucer so you can pick it up with your fingers to put it on your scalp.

    <li> I wish people would post reviews on their success or not with the product.  That would be extremely more helpful than a lot of personal information or product packaging comments.  When I read reviews, I want to know does it work or not?</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. In fact my hair loss is getting worse. I have been using it for 3 months and don&#x27;t see a difference at all.</li>
    <li> Though there has not been enough time passed to see new hair growth, I am feeling very positive about this product.  Easy to use foam, pleasant scent, and non-greasy.  Women&#x27;s Rogaine Foam is a product I will continue to use for as long as possible.</li>
    <li> I cannot say whether the formula worked for me. All I can say is this. If you are sensitive to strong, chemical smells, don&#x27;t even bother. This smelled like wicked hair mousse with potent artificial lemons infused.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looked thicker and fuller immediately because of the tears welling up in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Just can&#x27;t get past it.&lt;br /&gt;Certainly can&#x27;t plaster it on my head every day.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to stop using this product.  I will try to continue until I have used it up, but it will be hard.  It&#x27;s very difficult to apply unless you are actually bald.  It&#x27;s been a little under two months (seems like forever) since I started using this and my hair has been falling out in an unprecedented way.  I want to go back to the liquid method &amp; I will asap.  That actually worked.</li>
    <li> Product reviews are to rate the actual effectiveness of the product. Shouldn&#x27;t get a low rating because someone didn&#x27;t read the info correctly. It clearly states it&#x27;s for &amp;#34;hereditary hair loss&amp;#34; which, obviously, hypothyroidism is a health condition &amp; not &amp;#34;hereditary hair loss&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have thinning of hair due to chemo many years back and after seven weeks I have noticed a difference in thickness.  I am happy I tried this product.</li>
    <li> good product and service</li>
    <li> Great price and it works great.</li>
    <li> If they had minus ratings available, this company would get a -10! Don&#x27;t buy this unless your have a history of hair loss in your family. That is ABSOLUTELY THE ONLY THING it MIGHT work for. And, your money is not refundable with this company. Also, you can just go to Rite Aid. There was a Rite Aid sticker on the side of the box! They had tried to remove it, but were unsuccssful. I will never do business with this company again, and I am surprised that a company like Amazon would have any dealings with them either.</li>
    <li> I understand that everyone is unique, and what works for me might not work for you, but here is my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My father had a gorgeous head of thick, full hair all his life. However, as she aged, my mother&#x27;s hair became thin. One of my two sisters has thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, but I&#x27;ve always had a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;But for the past few years or so I&#x27;ve noticed it decreasing in volume. For me, it is more towards the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;I joke that if it continues I&#x27;ll look like St. Francis of Assisi, thank goodness I already love animals!&lt;br /&gt;Since my problem area doesn&#x27;t seem to be the more common hair part area, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work. The product description indicates that hair loss should be where the hair is parted, not the &#x27;monk&#x27; area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also indicates success with hereditary loss, and that one IS me.&lt;br /&gt;So I tried it.&lt;br /&gt; At first I used it exactly as directed, but I felt like not enough product was reaching the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;so I increased the amount of foam.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I did that, I had some slight itching, so I went back to the recommended amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a lot of time and patience but, at least for me, it works. I&#x27;ve noticed fine little  hairs coming in.&lt;br /&gt;The foam, in my opinion, is messy. Personally I&#x27;d prefer a dropper, but the dropper Rogaine is a lower percent of minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing. ..make sure that it&#x27;s dry before bed, otherwise it will be on the pillow.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
    <li> I have been using 2% minoxidil, the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; way as a liquid applied with a dropper, for over a decade now, and it has been extremely helpful in stopping my hereditary hair loss and growing back a modest amount of hair. Photographs of my head from ten years ago versus today are quite evident, which is why I have continued to use both name brand and generic minoxidil products for over a decade. I remember a few years ago when the foam treatment came out, and I was hesitant to try it being so used to using a dropper twice daily.  When I had the chance to try out a four-month supply, I figured it was time to see if there was any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are pros and cons, I believe, to the foam hair regrowth treatment as opposed to the liquid/dropper. On the plus side, the foam need only be applied once per day, which is fantastic. Since you are not supposed to get your hair wet for four hours prior to use, I apply it at night before bed and then I wash my hair in the shower the next morning and go about my day. That&#x27;s a big change from my former routine when I had to shower, dry my hair, apply the liquid with a dropper and then comb my hair periodically for the next hour so it would look right. And then use the dropper again at night. After a month of using the foam exclusively, I am impressed with the amount of time I save using this only once per day.  Another pro is the application itself, once you get used to it.  The liquid, of course, would run, and there&#x27;s nothing worse than a thin trickle of the stuff running down the back of your neck. The foam is not perfect, and like the liquid will get in your hair, but after some practice, it is a bit easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main con is somewhat similar, however. While the actual application is easier with the foam, after some practice, I can&#x27;t help but feel that I&#x27;m not getting quite as much product on my scalp as I did with the liquid. Using it twice daily, and rubbing the liquid into my scalp, I felt like I was really getting significant benefit. Using the foam once a day, I worry more about how much sticks in my hair as opposed to my scalp. It&#x27;s not an exact science, of course, and I&#x27;m sure the 5% solution (as opposed to two 2% applications) accounts for this. The foam also feels a little odd at first, as opposed to the liquid which is essentially the same as putting water in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it takes about three months to see serious change, and since I have been using minoxidil for ten-plus years, I am primarily on the lookout for things to get worse rather than better.  I have now been using the foam exclusively for a full month, and as of right now, there has been no change which is a good sign.  If this keeps up, I doubt I will end up going back to the liquid/dropper. Even though the foam feels a bit odd and makes me feel like I&#x27;m not getting as much on my scalp, the amazing benefit of using it only once per day is enough to get me to switch for good. Rogaine, of course, is a trusted brand and it&#x27;s the one I have primarily used over the years.</li>
    <li> This 5% minoxidil foam only has to be applied once a day rather than twice as day with the 2% formulas. The foam is also easier to apply to the thinning area as it does not run like the liquid does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dose is equivalent to half a capful and using more or applying it more than once a day will not make it more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes several months for it to induce even a moderate increase in downy hair and then several more months for normal hair to appear. It is not effective for everyone. If it is effective, continued use is necessary to maintain the additional hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest taking photographs before beginning treatment to provide a reference to determine whether or not it is working.</li>
    <li> so for so good. would&#x27;ve rated it 5 stars but it takes forever to work.</li>
    <li> Gave me headaches and caused my face to swell up</li>
    <li> Designed for women experiencing hair loss, this foam is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t have an extremely awful smell, and is effective in many cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having gone through a semi-significant hair loss due to a medical intervention, I decided to try the regrowth treatment, even though the hair loss was not genetic. It did seem to have an impact, although I was only able to use the test product for a little over 4 weeks. I would purchase and continue to use this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ragaine for Women for 4 months now.  I didn&#x27;t see results until this month so remember that it can take at least 3 months before you notice a difference.  Don&#x27;t give up and don&#x27;t ever stop using it.  This product is worth every penny.  I&#x27;m 40 and had been losing my hair for about 8-10 years now.  My Mom looks almost bald so I knew this was coming.  I&#x27;d pay more if it meant I didn&#x27;t look bald.</li>
    <li> My hair loss is genetic and really nothing I could do about it except try Rogaine. Because I know my hair grows slow, it would be months before I could notice a difference.About 5 months after first using it, I finally notice my thin balding areas are improving. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, so results of course will vary. Today my mom commented my hair looks so much fuller now, about 5 months after first application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foam was easy enough for me to apply. I didn&#x27;t like the drip type, so I chose foam application. I apply a small amount in the problem areas and massage it into my scalp daily.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working or not. It will be 4 weeks since I started using this product and I have noticed that my hair loss has slowed down. I haven&#x27;t noticed any regrowth of new hair, but I will be patient and wait the 3 to 6 months that the product states may be needed for new follicles to sprout.&lt;br /&gt;I apply the product in the evening before bedtime and my hair feels very &amp;#34;coarse&amp;#34; in the morning. There is definitely a buildup and this sometimes makes my hair difficult to style. I also use a keratin no-frizz serum in the morning and it helps to make my hair easier to style.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving this product only 2 stars is because I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels after the product dries and the difficulty I have achieving a presentable hairstyle in the morning. However, if I start to notice regrowth, I will revisit this review and amend it.</li>
    <li> I’d wanted the women’s Rogaine available in foam like the men’s thinking it would eliminate the problem of it running down my forehead, the back of my neck, and behind my ear.  So when they finally did offer it in foam I was very excited and anxious to try it.  Oh well, nice try Rogaine people but back to liquid for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is, yes, foam does reduce the problem of it running but the bad news is it’s more difficult, at least in my case, to get the majority of the product actually onto the scalp.  I have really thick hair (compared to the average person) except for one area near the front of my hair line where I was developing a bald spot.  With the liquid Rogaine I could simply “part” my hair in that area and apply it with the dropper.  It got right to the scalp and thus down to the roots and hair started growing in that area again.  But sometimes some of it would run down my forehead or behind my ear.  If I wasn’t careful to clean it up properly “peach fuzz” would start growing in those areas.  So I thought the foam would be the answer but most of it actually ends up on my hair instead on my scalp.  I try to work or massage it into my scalp but I’m pretty sure most of the product isn’t getting where it needs to go.  I’ve come to the conclusion that the “sweet spot” for this product might actually be in a gel form.  That way it won’t run like the liquid but will still get to the targeted area(s) properly and not spread out over the hair like the foam does.  (Are you listening Rogaine people?)  Until then I will return to the liquid just as soon as I use up this foam.  I just hope my bald spot doesn’t try to return in the meantime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn’t run like the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;“Dosage” is only once a day as oppose to the liquid which is twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Harder to get to the targeted area.&lt;br /&gt;It still might run if the foam “deflates” before it’s had a chance to soak into thescalp.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn’t seem as effective as the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;Stick with the liquid until the Rogaine people figure out how to put this in a gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps you and good luck.</li>
    <li> Rogaine is great.  Works very well! However I&#x27;m on the fence about this foam version, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as it should , and also, there was a little remaining in each can but it wouldn&#x27;t come out, I think I will stick to the liquid next time</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great that you only have to use it one time per day.  Remember, it takes at least 90 days to see growth. I does help to regrow your hair.</li>
    <li> My hair had thinned considerably for years…I have been to doctors and was told nothing to do about it.  I purchased this product and 3 months later i am enjoying my new look.  I feel and look so much better.  This is so worth the money.</li>
    <li> I tried to ues this and had several issues. First, my scalp burned and I had serious drying of the skin with itching, soreness and embarrassing flaking. My hairdresser was amazed at how quickly this happened since I have never had a problem like this no matter what processing or products we used. I also had heart palpatations and leg swelling, enough that my primary care doctor ordered several tests to be sure my heart was okay. Please note, this is NOT a beauty product.  It is a MEDICATION. So use it with care and watch your body for signs of intolerance!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it and won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell if it will meet my hair growth needs but this foam version is much better than the liquid version. It&#x27;s easier to manage, stays where you put it and it&#x27;s only needed once a day. The liquid has to be applied twice daily. After 3 months, I have notice some new growth around my hairline but time will tell if this will meet my needs.</li>
    <li> This product is difficult to apply. You might think that because it&#x27;s a mousse you just have to work it into your hair. Wrong. You have to part your hair several times to insure that it goes onto your scalp.  Also, it is a 4-month supply but there is really no accurate way to measure it.  They say to use half a capful but it&#x27;s really hard to determine how much that is.  I definitely think that you could use too much and then run out way before the 4 months are over.  You cannot return it. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have NOT had enough time to review this product.  I have post-menopausal &#x27;typical&#x27; female hair thinning and loss of growing new hair. I am 67 yrs. old  My dermatologist suggested the Women&#x27;s Rogaine AND Finasteride 1 mg per day. I know it may take up to six months to see any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I cannot give a review of the product until sufficient time has elapsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps!  Will check back in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, you might consider checking labels on shampoos/conditioners for sulfites.  The &#x27;current&#x27; medical thought is to NOT use products which contain sulfites; such as, Nioxin.</li>
    <li> Havent noticed any changes yet. But still holding on to hope cause it is a 4 month dose.. So I&#x27;ll come back!</li>
    <li> I am really surprised that this worked for me. I am a 34 YO AA female with relaxed hair who suffered from post pregnancy shedding and alopecia from too tight hair styles as well. Even though the directions state not to use for these conditions I was so desperate that I tried it anyway. Lo and behold my hair is growing back! I really wish I would have taken a before picture to make a comparison. I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 2 months and it took about 6 weeks for me to really notice a change. I can&#x27;t see through to my scalp on my temple and side areas anymore after years of thinning in those areas.  I must add that I also began taking Biotin 5000 Mcg as a supplement around the same time as I started using this product so I keep in mind that it may be a combination of the two things that had given me this result. The only reason I gave the product 4 stars instead of five is because now that the hair is back I have to use this product for life to maintain the results. Otherwise, great product that you should give a try if you still haven&#x27;t found any other way to regrow your hair.</li>
    <li> Although I was excited to have a product that I would only have to apply once per day, this product is challenge&#x3D;ing to apply.  The foam puffs up so more needs to be used than necessary in order for it to reach the scalp.  I much prefer the eye dropper method with the liquid formula.  Hopefully, Rogaine can adjust their product to provide a liquid at 5% that can be applied without the mess.</li>
    <li> It is too soon to tell if this works.  I can say I have not had any problems such as itchiness, losing hair and breakouts.  Also, there is no offensive odor.  I will update my review in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Thought the foam would be easy to work with...NOT.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell if I will get the results I&#x27;m hoping for but the product came promptly and was as described.</li>
    <li> This is really working for me, you have to use every day and be patient it took about 2 months to start showing..it does work !!!!</li>
    <li> Wow!  This really works! I used it on my hairline at the temples and it worked.  So glad I tried it.  Very simple to use and there is no problem styling my hair after.  It just disappears and it only takes a minute.</li>
    <li> Suppose to take 3-6 months to show any results.  Nothing as yet, been taking it 3 months, hope it Shows something soon!</li>
    <li> Found that it caused weight gain and puffiness.  I am very diligent with my diet and didnt change my diet any.  I would like a refund if possible</li>
    <li> I started Rogaine about 3 months ago and my hair is coming back....ALTHOUGH now I realize why I am suffering with a red and itchy neck.  It stArted after about 3 weeks I stArted itching all over during the night...it was happening occasionally.  I stopped using my facial and neck cream but periodically had the all over itching problem. The last week or so my neck was burning, severely itching and hurting.  I did not think it was the Rogaine because my scalp was fine.  Now I am positive it was the source of problem. My tongue feels strange...neck worse.  I am stopping right now and hoping it will be out of my system soon!  Goodbye new hair...very disappointed but I have no choice of course.  Will invest in a few wigs.</li>
    <li> I have not seen much new hair yet, but this foam gives my hair body and my hair feels fuller. I have tried lots of different products, but for a full feel and easier styling I would give it 5 stars</li>
    <li> received as promised. to early for results. will come back</li>
    <li> Seams to be working will let you know more in a few months.  Carrol Turner</li>
    <li> Did not see any difference!!  Rogaine &#x3D; No Gain</li>
    <li> Meh, couldn&#x27;t use it long enough to see if it works. It makes my hair sticky and dry, like most mouse with alcohol.</li>
    <li> I find this product superior to Rogaine regular in the fact that I only have to remembler to use it once a day vs the twice of day of the original. It works the same in keeping my hair from thinning like it was when I started using hair regrowth in the past.</li>
    <li> I barely notice I am using the product. And it is definitely working. No mess...I am happy.</li>
    <li> Best product for hair loss, but will leave your scalp dry.</li>
    <li> Great product, but the foam is much more difficult to apply than the liquid.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.  I don&#x27;t know why the company switched to a mousse form .  The liquid was so easy to use and could easily be applied to the scalp.  The mousse is extremely messy and half of the amount that I use ends up on my hair instead of my scalp.  It appears that the 5% liquid formula has been discontinued and the older liquid formula can now be purchased only as a 2% solution.  I&#x27;m amazed by all of the positive comments because I really expected to see a one star average when I got into this site.  I would not encourage anyone to use this very messy formula!</li>
    <li> A history of female pattern hair thinning in my family but personally I always had a full head of hair...that is until stress of various mild to  extreme levels caused my hair to thin falling out all over - not patches like alopecia.  Finally not enough hair to make a decent pony tail. Self confidence fell to new levels of low.  Then minor surgery to fix a broken foot, hair falls out.  Hair grows back about 1.5 inches, then some other stress episode and again the hair falls out.  Finally there is stress over the appearance of thin hair and the need to look good in my job as a sales rep.  What an awful cycle!  I finally bought a bunch of wigs, which are hot and itchy, but look great.  That helps the confidence part, but I really wanted my &amp;#34;own&amp;#34; hair back.  Since I am prone to high stress levels for one reason or another, will likely have this &amp;#34;cycle&amp;#34; going indefinitely.  Gotta get control somehow.  For women, our hair is our &amp;#34;crowning glory&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;So why try Rogaine for women?  I watched reviews with interest and skepticism . Waited several years fearing side effects. Finally decided it was worth a try... started using the higher concentration for women April, 2015.  Now it&#x27;s late August, 2015 and I no longer have handfuls of hair in the shower drain and lots of shorter hairs coming in all over that give my remaining hair some volume and lift.  Looks nice!  I don&#x27;t have to use it every day either, every other day just a small amount is fine and even every third day only after the dormant hair stops falling and you see new hair growth- - this system works fine for me.  Keeping my wigs for &amp;#34;instant style&amp;#34;  but I am looking forward to seeing how my own hair looks after another 4 months!  No side effects that I can see and a little (foam)  goes a long way.  Suggest also taking a supplement of biotin which helps reinforce the new growth.  Try to eat a healthy diet and get some kind of exercise to help with any stress levels that contributeto the problem.  Lock your wallet in the car and walk the mall if you have allergies like me!  I write this review to offer some hope to every woman reading and having the same problem.  It make not work for everyone, but it has definitely provided some results in the 4 months I have used it.  Hope this is helpful and I will try to offer a new review as time hopefully provides lasting results.</li>
    <li> Got this for my significant other that was worried about thinning hair.  She has been using the rogaine for a month and hasn&#x27;t yet noticed a difference.  Bear in mind that the product instructions say that it may take 3 to 6 months to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The use and application was actually very nice. The foam is not greasy so that after rubbing it into your scalp, you don&#x27;t notice that it&#x27;s there. You can use hair products on top of it.  Another plus is that the foam doesn&#x27;t smell. It&#x27;s hard t o tell it&#x27;s there after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of reasons I am reviewing the product after only 30 days (instead of the 3 months that first results should show up) is that I am an Amazon Vine reviewer. I received the product to review and must provide an initial review within 30 days.  I will strive to update this review over the future months.</li>
    <li> I had an allergic reaction so I had to stop suing the product - I cannot say it does not work, just not for me.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law has been using 2% minoxidil with some degree of success. Though it still leaves something to be desired. She is excited to see if this 5% minoxidil would give her the improvement she was hoping for. It seems to be show promising results after 3 weeks into the treatment. She begins to feel the itchy scalp. So far it hasn&#x27;t caused any adverse effects or allergic reactions on her.    This once a day, foam based formula is easy to use. Just apply a capful to the hair loss areas and massage into scalp gently. This pack contains 4 months of supply. However, it usually takes 3-6 months to see the full results. I&#x27;ll update this accordingly.</li>
    <li> I am a 42 year old African American women using Rogaine Foam 5%.  I have always had beautiful thick hair, but my hair never stopped shedding after I gave birth to my son.  He&#x27;s now almost 4 years old. Imagine the devastation!!  All the women in my family have beautiful, thick hair so I didn&#x27;t think my hair loss was due to genetics.  To ensure my hair loss wasn&#x27;t a result of a medical condition, I was tested by my PCP and dermatologist.  Thankfully, all tests came back negative for any illnesses contributing to the hair loss.  Since I have an extremely stressful job, I am only left to think that my hair loss might be due to stress and maybe age.  With so much hair loss, I became depressed and self-conscious.  After seeing a Rogaine commercial, I decided to give it a try.  At that point, I had nothing to lose.  After 3 days of use, I saw a very drastic change in the hair shedding!  In 3 days, I went from having about 20-30 strands of hair in my comb, to only 3 - 5 strands of hair.  Not to mention, my hair seems thicker!  I see less hair in the shower, less hair on the bathroom countertop and it is actually growing.  Within a month, my hair has grown at least an inch!  I also take 10,000 mcg of biotin, a multi-vitamin, Vitamins D, B Complex and E to promote hair growth.  For those of you who are wondering whether this product works for African American women with relaxed hair, well it does!  The foam is weightless and non-greasy.  Ladies, it will not affect your hair style.</li>
    <li> I had too many side effects: nagging headache and itchy, scratchy dry eyes. The headache diminished when I cut the dosage in half, but my eyes continued to be bloodshot, and painfully dry.  It&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> I have only been using minoxidil for a little over a month, so have not yet seen hair regrowth. But I started out with a serum that came with a dropper, and had to be used twice a day. I had trouble remembering to use it twice a day. So when I saw this formula was just once a day, I jumped to changing. I am going to go back to the company with the serum instead, and have to try to improve my habits to twice a day. Their claim in creating the foam is that it is am improvement because too many women claimed the serum took too long to dry. I never had a problem with that, and with the dropper, had an easy time making sure the product got to my scalp, where it needed to be. The foam does in fact dry quickly. Unfortunately, it is not drying on my scalp where it needs to be because it is getting mostly stuck on my hair itself. This is making my hair stiff, dry, and difficult to style while I am skeptical that enough of the product is getting to the follicles to do its job. If Rogaine wants me back as a customer (because, according to the instructions, if you want to keep the hair the product helps you get back, you must be a customer for life), they will have an option that is a once per day serum.</li>
    <li> I have been using minoxidil for hereditary thin hair with satisfactory results since my dermatologist suggested it about ten years ago, mostly the girlie 2% variety in the pink boxes. My hair certainly isn&#x27;t thick by any means, but with the minoxidil (usually the brand X rather than Rogaine, on account of cost, and again on my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation) it at least covers the scalp OK. I&#x27;ve always had some minor itchiness, but nothing so serious as to be too annoying. The liquid seemed a little hard to control at first, but it didn&#x27;t take long to figure out that a terry headband would keep it from wandering down my forehead where it doesn&#x27;t belong, and if I apply it before flossing and brushing morning and night, it&#x27;s easy to remember and dries by the time I&#x27;m finished, so I don&#x27;t find it inconvenient to use. But recently it has been more difficult to find my usual 2%, so I&#x27;ve experimented with the 5% foam, first the men&#x27;s variety, and now this thanks to a super introductory special at my grocery store. Naturally I wouldn&#x27;t mind if the 5% created extra thickness, and once rather than twice per day appeals to my lazy side, so I really wanted to like this swell new stuff.    It hasn&#x27;t been long enough yet to comment on growth and thickness results, but from a convenience and ease of use standpoint, I am not happy and will try to stick with it a while longer but am beginning to have my doubts. I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t complain about having enough hair to get in the way, but unlike the liquid dropper that slides easily under the hair, the foam is much more difficult to get down to the scalp where it belongs because my fingers are fatter than the width of a part and entirely too much of the foam seems to get stuck in the hair. Some kind of an applicator would help, maybe? And that might help with the measurement as well. I mean to use half a cap as instructed, but when you&#x27;re not actually able to dispense it into the cap, that&#x27;s a little hard to tell for those of us who aren&#x27;t spatially gifted. With all the parting and cold water on the hands and washing up after, an easy process has become quite a major production, along with extra concerns about failure to follow all the instructions as strictly as they&#x27;re written, much as I&#x27;ve tried. And one more thing, I am not feeling confident about how well the new container will travel; at the very least, it&#x27;s larger and will take up more space.    So bottom line, if I can hang in there long enough to see improvement, this new version may be worth the extra effort (and possibly money? Haven&#x27;t done the math on that yet), but so far my inclination is that less trouble twice per day is preferable to more trouble once. If I can continue to find it, I suspect I&#x27;ll be back to my old 2% solution soon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this has worked for my wife. We can&#x27;t see any change, yet!!!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel stiff....I used the foam Women&#x27;s Rogaine.  Bummer.  Time will tell if it works.</li>
    <li> Will not use it again.</li>
    <li> Got this for the wife. Seems to work and Amazon has made it relatively affordable to try compared to purchasing from a drugstore such as CVS, etc.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> This product seems to be working so far.  I will definitely keep using.</li>
    <li> Great results!  The down side is you have to use it forever or it stops working .... not sure about that!</li>
</ol>
