      <li>(better: FREE) shipping</li>
      <li>so far its working great</li>
      <li>a week, I had more zits that I was comfortable with, but they came and went really quickly</li>
      <li>Product is effective, and a good replacement for other brands.</li>
      <li>I transitioned from Proactive Acne Control Solution to Dr. Song, and I am very satisfied so far.</li>
      <li>Goes on clear, very effective and dries fast.</li>
      <li>later, I tried a sort of proact*ve knockoff, after hearing good things from my family.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Great fast acting product.</li>
      <li>I received order quickly.</li>
      <li>Feels good and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.</li>
      <li>it was my first bp ever!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if product would work, but so far it has worked well.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;d lightly buff dead skin off in the morning and be good.</li>
      <li>I think it keeps the product fresh longer.</li>
      <li>in my early 20&#x27;s now, and my skin is generally pretty good, cleared up a LOT from my teen years.</li>
      <li>Not after awhile using it, first day.</li>
      <li>Acne.org was able to control my pre-Accutane acne (it was pretty severe back then), and this can&#x27;t even handle the couple pimples</li>
      <li>The seller responded promptly and stated I should try the higher percentage.</li>
      <li>I have a mineral liquid makeup I love which is the only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t break me out, so I used that</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>they stay red fooooorrrevvveerrrrrr, but I was pretty sure I was out options at that</li>
      <li>A higher concentration like 10% of Benzoyl Peroxide dries out my skin</li>
      <li>/&gt;Obviously everyone is different and not everything will work, and I wouldn&#x27;t call this a miracle fix, but my skin is much better than it was before...</li>
      <li>However, I will try the higher percentage and see where that gets me.</li>
      <li>Okay.&lt;br /&gt;I tried benzoyl peroxide before, the first time given to me by my doctor.</li>
      <li>I think $5 for the smallest bottle with shipping is more reasonable and on scale with generic brands.  </li>
      <li>My skin problem is somewhat better but not completely gone.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use this product as long as it works well with my regimen. :)</li>
      <li>It was like ungodly high percentage, but more importantly it was white as snow white&#x27;s skin.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and leaves no white residue.</li>
      <li>Highly  recommend !</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>This product is very efective and gentle.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine the skin can breathe very well through that.  </li>
      <li>At less than a third of the price, the Dr Song product is much better value, and unlike Neutrogena&#x27;s cream, it&#x27;s colorless and applies easily.</li>
      <li>To me it works better than other brands, and I have used a lot of brands including proactiv.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t let the attractive price and minimal ingredients (which imply a less comodogenic product) fool you</li>
      <li>now I&#x27;m using it for my scars just a experimental thing to see if it can peel my light facial scars which seem to be working.</li>
      <li>I tried salicylic acid, only to find out that i&#x27;d mildly allergic.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>High quality product; convenient size.  </li>
      <li>I was previously using prescription kind of benzoyl peroxide, and this product works just the same!</li>
      <li>Then it would be my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; acne preventative.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your existing pimples go away any faster, and it doesn&#x27;t prevent new ones from coming in.</li>
      <li>Noticing a Huge difference  after using this only a short time.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is all because of this cream or not (experimenting with a few things) but my face is more clear than ever before.</li>
      <li>I used quite a generous amount, and I was sure it would be enough for my face case, since at that point I was only getting one or two tiny pimples a day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d used Acne.org for years, and this product is far inferior.</li>
      <li>Meaning, Tea Tree, Aspirin and whatever you have that contains even natural salicylic acid..ended terribly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 24 years old, male, and have been struggling with acne since I started high school.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure about a lot of the reviews on this product, but rest assured this is one of the genuine ones.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Right now, my skin is remarkably clear even though I only use the treatment once a day and not a ton of it even then.</li>
      <li>I purchase the 2 oz size which is super small.</li>
      <li>Then next nite same thing even dead skin peel ain&#x27;t hurt or anything I actually was happy the dark mark peel off!!!!!</li>
      <li>I have been using it for about 10 days and it really cleared up my acne and my pores are less visible.</li>

<li> Price is a little high in my opinion.</li>
<li> Long story short.</li>
<li> not horribly dry, just slight dry enough</li>
<li> I use a finger-length twice daily, and my blemishes are minimal.</li>
<li> and I was dumb enough to try and pop it , which really swell it up.</li>
<li> My skin isn&#x27;t as dry</li>
<li> This will dry your skin out with continuous use with no moisturizer.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m not a teenager, so it&#x27;s not normal and it&#x27;s embarrassing.  </li>
<li> And if you&#x27;ve had a bad history with benzoyl peroxide before, to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a...10% solution.</li>
<li> I gave this four stars only because I wanted all my bumps to disappear in a few days and that did not happen.  </li>
<li> After reading about acne.org&#x27;s regimen I began getting curious.</li>
<li> it got smaller everyday..</li>
<li> The product&#x27;s consistency is thick and waxy, and it doesn&#x27;t spread nearly as well as Acne.org.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I will be looking to see if can purchase product somewhere other than Amazon to see if can receive product quicker</li>
<li> It should be noted that the dispenser is &amp;#34;pop open&amp;#34; instead of pump, however, less product is wasted.  </li>
<li> Either way, I wasted money on this product.</li>
<li> But i&#x27;m pale, so if I get ANY spots...</li>
<li> No strong smell, flakes, or etc...  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if I should use it for awhile then cycle off to give my skin a break, but I&#x27;ll figure it out.</li>
<li> It also, took awhile to receive the product after purchasing and I am  not sure if, that was because of the company&#x27;s shipping procedure or the post office.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve probably wanted to try it for years now, but it was expensive enough</li>
<li> Feels like there are very small micro beads that vanish after a few seconds.</li>
<li> Well, this product basically made my existing pimples take forever to heal, and the worst part was - new acne was still coming in at the same rate!</li>
<li> , I would tell people to definitely at least try the 2.5% benzoyl peroxide, if nothing else is working.</li>
<li> I needed it down asap!!!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and my pimples have not gotten worse.</li>
<li> ended up getting a chemical burn, like a terrible terrible sunburn on my face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This works well for keeping acne at bay. I use it as part of my daily skin care regimen. To me it works better than other brands, and I have used a lot of brands including proactiv. Doesn&#x27;t leave a build up on your face, so you can use it day or night as necessary and under makeup if you wear it during the day as well. It&#x27;s transparent on skin and not sticky. Feels like there are very small micro beads that vanish after a few seconds. A little goes a long way. I will continue to use this product as long as it works well with my regimen. :)</li>
    <li> It works but definitely is drying my skin.. Don&#x27;t forget to use moisturizer with it!</li>
    <li> comparable to clinique acne solutions moisturizing lotion</li>
    <li> I received order quickly. I transitioned from Proactive Acne Control Solution to Dr. Song, and I am very satisfied so far.</li>
    <li> Good product. Good price. Arrived promptly. I reccomend it.</li>
    <li> Price is a little high in my opinion. $9 after shipping for the smallest bottle but i like it. I think $5 for the smallest bottle with shipping is more reasonable and on scale with generic brands.  Goes on clear, very effective and dries fast. No strong smell, flakes, or etc...  This is not a moisturizing lotion. This will dry your skin out with continuous use with no moisturizer. So be sure to get a light moisturizer to use when needed.</li>
    <li> no noticeable improvements , consistency of water...</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I was previously using prescription kind of benzoyl peroxide, and this product works just the same! Would highly recommend it! My skin has cleared up within a week :)</li>
    <li> High quality product; convenient size.  It should be noted that the dispenser is &amp;#34;pop open&amp;#34; instead of pump, however, less product is wasted.  Product is effective, and a good replacement for other brands.</li>
    <li> Great fast acting product. I seen results within 2-3 days of using this product. This is one of my new best friends in the cosmetic industry. #hewon</li>
    <li> products arrived on time, also very happy with product.</li>
    <li> Okay.&lt;br /&gt;I tried benzoyl peroxide before, the first time given to me by my doctor. It was like ungodly high percentage, but more importantly it was white as snow white&#x27;s skin. And there was no way I was going to wear it into school. So I didn&#x27;t end up using it.&lt;br /&gt;Then later, I tried a sort of proact*ve knockoff, after hearing good things from my family.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up getting a chemical burn, like a terrible terrible sunburn on my face. Not after awhile using it, first day. It was...just...auuuugh.&lt;br /&gt;So I tried salicylic acid, only to find out that i&#x27;d mildly allergic. Meaning, Tea Tree, Aspirin and whatever you have that contains even natural salicylic acid..ended terribly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s now, and my skin is generally pretty good, cleared up a LOT from my teen years. But i&#x27;m pale, so if I get ANY spots...they stay red fooooorrrevvveerrrrrr, but I was pretty sure I was out options at that point.&lt;br /&gt;But...After reading about acne.org&#x27;s regimen I began getting curious. I&#x27;ve probably wanted to try it for years now, but it was expensive enough I just...didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I remember thinking, &#x27;it is only a matter of time until a cheaper clone shows up..&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;So, here we are. I ordered a 2.oz bottle of this..and only this. I didn&#x27;t get the cleanser or moisturizer, only the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;For a week, I had more zits that I was comfortable with, but they came and went really quickly so I bit my lip and just tried to tolerate it. Then it started clearing up, but my skin got dryish. not horribly dry, just slight dry enough i&#x27;d lightly buff dead skin off in the morning and be good. I have a mineral liquid makeup I love which is the only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t break me out, so I used that once or twice when my skin was drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now it is the end of July, and I got this at the beginning of July.&lt;br /&gt;Right now, my skin is remarkably clear even though I only use the treatment once a day and not a ton of it even then. My skin isn&#x27;t as dry anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I would tell people to definitely at least try the 2.5% benzoyl peroxide, if nothing else is working. And if you&#x27;ve had a bad history with benzoyl peroxide before, to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a...10% solution. And maybe, like I did, take a leap of faith and try this product.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously everyone is different and not everything will work, and I wouldn&#x27;t call this a miracle fix, but my skin is much better than it was before...it has basically improved what I thought had already been improvement.</li>
    <li> As a many-year user of Neutrogena On-The-Spot 2.5% BP cream, discovering Dr Song was a revelation. At less than a third of the price, the Dr Song product is much better value, and unlike Neutrogena&#x27;s cream, it&#x27;s colorless and applies easily. Buying from them has always been a breeze. I&#x27;m a convert!</li>
    <li> Cleared up my acne in a month with the occasional pimple. Cheap and effective with a great drying time. This product is great for a replacement of Acne.org&#x27;s regimen product.</li>
    <li> Long story short. I have a cyst on my face and I was dumb enough to try and pop it , which really swell it up. I needed it down asap!!! I&#x27;ve try, toothpaste which help but not the way I wanted it to look. So I try Dr song bp ..it was my first bp ever! I dab it on day one and let it stay on over nite. It strunk I was like ooookkkk! Then next nite same thing even dead skin peel ain&#x27;t hurt or anything I actually was happy the dark mark peel off!!!!! So i kept doing that to the point where I knew it was drying it up every day..it got smaller everyday..now I&#x27;m using it for my scars just a experimental thing to see if it can peel my light facial scars which seem to be working. I like this product and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Worked great for spot treatment! Excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> Very good product and comparable to the name brand. I only wish this item had cheaper (better: FREE) shipping Then it would be my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; acne preventative.</li>
    <li> I give this product 4 stars. I purchase the 2 oz size which is super small. I wasn&#x27;t sure if product would work, but so far it has worked well. It also, took awhile to receive the product after purchasing and I am  not sure if, that was because of the company&#x27;s shipping procedure or the post office.I will be looking to see if can purchase product somewhere other than Amazon to see if can receive product quicker</li>
    <li> This product is very efective and gentle. I have been using it for about 10 days and it really cleared up my acne and my pores are less visible. I tried every OTC products but this lotion is the best so far. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and my pimples have not gotten worse. My skin problem is somewhat better but not completely gone. A higher concentration like 10% of Benzoyl Peroxide dries out my skin so I chose 2.5% so that I can layer it on as I wish.  I have to say though, that when I used it twice a day my skin started to look cracked.  I don&#x27;t have a ton of bumps but my face always looks like I have heat rash and I&#x27;m not a teenager, so it&#x27;s not normal and it&#x27;s embarrassing.  This product helps keep the bumps to a minimum.  I&#x27;m not sure if I should use it for awhile then cycle off to give my skin a break, but I&#x27;ll figure it out. I gave this four stars only because I wanted all my bumps to disappear in a few days and that did not happen.  I use this under my moisturizer. It is not greasy. It goes on smooth and leaves no white residue. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is all because of this cream or not (experimenting with a few things) but my face is more clear than ever before. Feels good and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face. Definitely a keeper!!</li>
    <li> Thank you i have receive my item so far its working great however I wish it came in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> Nice product - but don&#x27;t see the Exp. Date. Support say - 18 months.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help my acne at all! The seller responded promptly and stated I should try the higher percentage. Either way, I wasted money on this product. However, I will try the higher percentage and see where that gets me.</li>
    <li> Noticing a Huge difference  after using this only a short time.  Highly  recommend !</li>
    <li> This is a great substitute for the Treatment step of the Acne.org regimen. I know some dislike the pump bottle, but I personally like it--I think it keeps the product fresh longer. My solution for travel was to buy both the 8 oz pump bottle, and then the smaller 2 oz squeeze tube. I&#x27;ll refill the latter as necessary, and I won&#x27;t bleach everything in my travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;As far as product efficacy, it&#x27;s great. I use a finger-length twice daily, and my blemishes are minimal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about a lot of the reviews on this product, but rest assured this is one of the genuine ones. I&#x27;m 24 years old, male, and have been struggling with acne since I started high school. I&#x27;d used Acne.org for years, and this product is far inferior. Acne.org was able to control my pre-Accutane acne (it was pretty severe back then), and this can&#x27;t even handle the couple pimples I get post-Accutane. The product&#x27;s consistency is thick and waxy, and it doesn&#x27;t spread nearly as well as Acne.org. After putting it on, the skin feels somewhat stifled - I can&#x27;t imagine the skin can breathe very well through that.  The way I used Dr. Song&#x27;s BP was: I put it on at night, after cleansing, without any moisturizer afterwards. In the mornings I would cleanse it off and put on moisturizer. I used quite a generous amount, and I was sure it would be enough for my face case, since at that point I was only getting one or two tiny pimples a day. Well, this product basically made my existing pimples take forever to heal, and the worst part was - new acne was still coming in at the same rate! I stuck with it though, because I thought it just took a while to kick in, but after six months of this I decided enough was enough.  Don&#x27;t let the attractive price and minimal ingredients (which imply a less comodogenic product) fool you - there&#x27;s just something in this formula that doesn&#x27;t work. It doesn&#x27;t make your existing pimples go away any faster, and it doesn&#x27;t prevent new ones from coming in.</li>
