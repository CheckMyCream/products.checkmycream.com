<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product at a great price.  Love the scent and works really well as a massage oil - very relaxing and sensual.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful massage oil.  It smells divine and the feeling of the oil is so velvety and comforting!  The beautiful thing is that its natural and can be used on face and wherever and won&#x27;t make you feel like you have chemicals all over you.  I recommend this!  I would give it 6 stars if I could!</li>
    <li> Gave my girlfriend an allergic reaction and basically killed the mood. I think I will return it. Watch out for allergic reactions</li>
    <li> I rub this on my wife&#x27;s back prior to sleep.  She loves it.  After a few month of using it, her skin is noticeably softer too.</li>
    <li> Smells good, does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I wanted to find a less feminine scented massage oil for my fiance &amp; I to use, this is perfect.  It&#x27;s a very comforting and relaxing scent and the oil feels great on your skin.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I use this both for massage and for skin care.  It&#x27;s workable, never sticky. I find it to be very soothing to the senses in all ways.</li>
    <li> Please w/ the product and purchase.</li>
    <li> I really am enjoying this massage oil. My husband &amp; I use it on each other&#x27;s back and shoulders as we tense up in those areas. It is soothing, relaxing, and puts the mind at ease. Plus, it was such a reasonable price. Fast delivery too. What a great deal, will be purchasing more once I run out.</li>
    <li> Very nice odor, it&#x27;s also great for just moisturizing the skin.</li>
    <li> Initially I bought oil that was too dry to use as massage oil - but this oil lasts long enough to get through the massage and it smells really nice! You only have to use a few drops therefore the bottle will most likely last a long time because of it. Worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> We love this as a massage oil - smells great and nice texture.</li>
    <li> Really nice oil for massages, and smells lovely.</li>
    <li> This massage oil is amazing. Best oil Ive used yet. the scent is absolutely relaxing too. A little goes a long way. Oil is much better than lotion for massaging.</li>
    <li> Loving this brand! Very good quality and value. Scent is subtle and relaxing. Oil has a great consistency for massage.</li>
    <li> I really like that it absorbs into your skin. On the other hand, it shouldnt be used for massaging, it absorbs too fast into your skin. wonderful for moisturizing, even though i cant use it as a massaging oil, i use it to benefit my skin :)</li>
    <li> nice product. the lucky person that got a massage from me complemented in how nice it feel and how good smell.</li>
    <li> While it smells good to start with, it turns sour and makes sheets and clothes smell like old oil. So would need to shower before wearing clothing or go to bed. Do not recommend. Have not found a replacement yet...</li>
    <li> The product is good.  I just prefer a non-greasy cream.</li>
    <li> This is less moisturizing then many other oils and the scent is medicinal.  It may be a good massage oil, however, and I was using it as a general after shower moisturizing oil.</li>
    <li> This has been very useful for giving back massages. The smell is pleasant, but not femine which is nice for my husband!</li>
    <li> This is great, my boyfriend and I use this for massages all the time. We have had it for 5 months now, and barely used a quarter of it, it goes a long way!!! It also has a nice, gently scent to it, not too strong that you can smell it all day.</li>
    <li> I liked it while it lasted.  I bought it in January 2014 and I use to take it to my masseuse so she could use it on me whenever I got massages.  A few months later and it didn&#x27;t smell any longer.</li>
    <li> I just received this is the mail and it worked great. My girlfriend and I use it to give each other massages. I will be buying more of it when we run out.</li>
    <li> Smells great, easy application... I love it and highly recommend this brand. For the price it is well worth it!</li>
    <li> Arrived to my place completely destroyed, the parcel soaked with oil... But as the delivery guy said, it smells good!</li>
    <li> Great price for quality message oil.  Love the lavender scent.</li>
    <li> it smells good. i use it to massage my boyfriend&#x27;s back. and he likes it too. i took it with me when i went out for travel, too.</li>
    <li> Both I and my girlfriend were put off by the overwhelming scent of pine in this massage oil; not even 5 minutes in, she had me switch back to an unscented lotion because the pine scent was just too powerful. Since the description only mentioned Lavender, Chamomile, Patchouli, Grape Seed, Apricot, and Almond Oils, we both mistakenly assumed that the overall scent of the mixture would be primarily composed of those particular oils; as it turned out, however, all of those scents were completely drowned out by the pine scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will attest that this massage oil is perfectly reasonable by all other measures, however: it was thick enough to handle while still providing adequate lubrication, and the rate of absorption was neither too fast for massaging nor too slow to leave on afterwards.</li>
    <li> Not quite sure about the consistency in terms of using for my massages I give, I haven&#x27;t determined yet if it is right for me. However it does smell really good, and clients happy with it.  No complaints</li>
    <li> nice for massage - doesn&#x27;t sink into the skin too quickly, but doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling slimy, either.  The scent is a bit &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; but my husband liked that it wasn&#x27;t flowery</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with massaging my knee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell strongly of pine but it mellows after a while. The oil is very smooth. I used more than the recommended three to five drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find the scent too overwhelming you could dilute it with additional carrier oil. I used almond oil when I used it on my dog. Worked wonderfully for her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product as a massage oil, but alert people to the strong scent.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and have been satisfied with how long it is lasting me. I have not really noticed much difference in my skin but I just wanted an affordable massage oil.</li>
    <li> I really liked the smell, gave it to my &amp;#34;man friend&amp;#34; and he said it was great too. Not too girl, not too manly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went on smoothly and made the massage much better!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! It smells really good as well  Great buy for messages and definitely well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Overall does the trick but we found you need to use more than the directions indicate (they say 3 drops is all you need, that seems very skimpy to us). The oil feels good and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling gross as long as you moderate the quantity used. Same goes for staining fabrics, the only stain we&#x27;ve acquired was from when it was leaning up against fabric and there was oil on the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent ranges anywhere from pine to eucalyptus-esque and is relatively minor. My boyfriend is fine with the scent and likes how it&#x27;s not too feminine.</li>
    <li> Nice oil for massage make you feel relax and happy. I want to buy one but the shipping it a bit high so I decide to bought two because I will pay shipping anyway.</li>
    <li> Good price for the good smell and warming sensation. Really good for massage. Ladies love it, and I love it too!</li>
    <li> Not sure how well the oil actually works, but i could smell it from the other room. (not in a good way) Gave my girlfriend a massage and even a hot shower couldn&#x27;t get the sticky smell off of her. It&#x27;s a great value with how big the bottle is, but the smell is terrible. Shop around and get something better.</li>
    <li> i have used this product before &amp; am very satisfied with it, not too oily or absorbent. This makes for a great massge</li>
    <li> Looking for a quality product and found it. Nice spell and texture. Would recommend it for professional or personal use.</li>
    <li> I use this as daily moisturizer, and its awesome.  My skin has really recovered from dryness.  I also use this in my scalp to moisturize my balding spot and my hair is thicker after two months of daily use.  Love this stuff and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Great quality massage oil! Spreads easily and warms as used on skin. Improves massage experience. Nice scent, but I added a few drops of bergamot essential oil because it&#x27;s my favorite scent. It blended very well with this massage oil&#x27;s light fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Very good value for excellent price.</li>
    <li> All I had was some crappy Trojan brand oil. Now this is the real deal. The smell and feel of this oil is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have severely dry skin and have tried everything... This massage oil is not at all greasy and goes on smooth with a very light fresh fragrance that is delightful. Next time I&#x27;ll get two!</li>
    <li> There is a pretty strong scent to this oil that&#x27;s not quite pleasing -- but that&#x27;s only for me.  Others may like it, I particular wish I had purchased another bottle.</li>
    <li> This massage oil is great. It is smooth and not greasy. It applies easily and works into the skin very weel.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Great value!! We are very pleased with this product. I would recommend it to anyone!! Smells great!!! Thank you.</li>
    <li> very pleasant smell and it feels great!</li>
    <li> NIce scent not overpowering; does absorb into skin somewhat but still useful for massage. Good value.</li>
    <li> Very watery quality. Spells like pine needles. Not a soothing smell in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I thinking that it would just be your average oil but its defiantly. if you are looking to relax or to set the mood for a romantic evening. This is the oil for you. Its Cheap and works better then you could ever imagine. It smells great and it also sets in to your skin well. so your not slimy after the message. I dont know when I will need more but when I do I am going to get some more of this stuff. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I loved everything about this product. The smell, the way it feels, very moisturizing, and it does help you relax!</li>
    <li> This was my second purchase of Now Foods massage oils and I love every product I have tried of theirs. This is a high quality oil and so nice to give a massage with as well as receive. Now Foods is now my favorite kind of oils. Buy it and love it!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I never got to use this on the girl I wanted to use it on... lol</li>
    <li> It says Comforting Massage Oil. I do not know what was so comforting. It STINKS.&lt;br /&gt;It will not come out of the bedding nor the clothing. The smell seems to get worse each&lt;br /&gt;time we wash the bedding. We have used ammonia, simple green, and stain remover.&lt;br /&gt;NOTHING WORKED to get out the smell.</li>
    <li> The Comforting Massage Oil was delivered quickly and exactly as advertised.  The fragrance is lightly scented and does not leave an oily feel to the skin.  It washes off easily and enhances the overall massage experience.</li>
    <li> This is the best of their massage oils. The scent is light but herbal. My male clients like it because it adds a nice aromatherapy aspect but it isn&#x27;t sweet.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells very nice.  It leans towards a feminine smell (some guys may not be comfortable with the scent) but is acceptable for all imo.  Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> We have used this for our winter massaging before baths for kids. This has a nice smell and leaves them moisturized better then a lotion.</li>
    <li> I get massage&#x27;s regularly for back issues. I bought this for my massage therapist to use because she was using junk. This stuff smells good but is too greasy and does not soak in. I like the Now Foods Jojaba oil better.</li>
    <li> This stuff is alright, but I won&#x27;t be ordering again. Bath and body works lavender massage oil has that nice relaxation aroma that you just can&#x27;t beat. This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell appealing at all but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> good oil but leaves skin and client very oily. i would recommend a oil product that leaves client less oily after session.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant on what massage oil to buy. But this stuff is great. It feels really good, works really well, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
    <li> wonderful, pleasant warm scent too</li>
    <li> Bought this to add to a valentines day basket I was making for my BF. We&#x27;ve had a lot of massages with this and still basically have all of it left. Great quality and value!! :)</li>
    <li> great massage!  good parfum! /I like the fragrance and it&#x27;s easy to wash out at the end of massage! great!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the smell of this stuff. I would love to use it, but I never get massages :&#x27;(...forever alone</li>
    <li> We have tried numerous cocoa butters, oils, and lotions and this is by far the best product we have used yet. Silky. Does not leave a significant oily feeling. Pleasant sent.</li>
    <li> it was really great not greasy at all rubbed in well made a good night great wife loved it as well</li>
    <li> Very nice quality item and feel!&lt;br /&gt;Great product and scent... happy to have treated my loved ones with&lt;br /&gt;this product.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again... thanks,</li>
    <li> This is a great oil for massages where the person doesn&#x27;t want a scent and wants something natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does not appear to stain linens. You only need a little though or the client will slide out the door.</li>
    <li> Yeah, the title about says it.  A massage with this stuff is best done outside, maybe on your patio or something because the smell is a bit too strong and will linger indoors even with central air on.  However, if you don&#x27;t mind the strong smell (not a bad smell, just too intense) then you will appreciate this great oil.  Makes for a very comforting massage when warmed up in the microwave for 30 second or so (not in this bottom, put it in a glass container).  I may have to try some other Now Foods oils because the quality IS there, the smell is just too intense on this one for me.</li>
    <li> Lid was busted and oil all over order</li>
    <li> got this for a &amp;#34;friend&amp;#34; that loved massages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had plans to go out after testing this baby out but ended up absolutely relaxed into what I now call &amp;#34;oblivion sleep&amp;#34;. It should say, &amp;#34;warning! make no other plans after use.&amp;#34; Woke up feeling pretty good.</li>
    <li> A massage oil should glide easily and feel silky. This feels thick and prohibits your hands from moving easily on the skin. Bare hands would be better than this. Didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> We don&#x27;t like this. It&#x27;s got far too much extracts in it, and the smell is almost overpowering. It&#x27;s also stickier than plain almond oil, and left us anything but comforted.</li>
    <li> Having a lot of fun with this</li>
    <li> The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming which is nice. My boyfriend was in a very bad motorcycle accident and this oil is wonderful on his dry skin when I am rubbing him down due to all his extreme back and leg pain. Caution it is oil use sparingly.</li>
    <li> I put this on right after a shower and it keeps my skin feeling soft all day. Smells good, absorbs quickly, not greasy.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to using this oil but the smell reminds me of cleaning bathrooms, an activity I do not find relaxing. It doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender AT ALL. Maybe my bottle was just a fluke since no one else has mentioned this. I hope so, can&#x27;t imagine anyone wanting to smell like Pine Sol.</li>
    <li> This oil smells great, moisturizes well, and is perfect for massages. The bottle is enough to last for a few months at least. A little goes a long way! It works really perfectly on sensitive skin as well. My boyfriend often has trouble with scented lotions, but this didn&#x27;t bother his skin at all.</li>
    <li> It burns. Not a good feeling.</li>
    <li> This arrived on time and packaged very securely.  It was more than I was expecting.  I am very happy with this item and I will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> This is great massage oil. The smell is great and it really leaves the skin soft and smelling great. The odor is not overwhelming, and it definitely has a calming effect. I will certainly be purchasing this again. A must have for me!</li>
    <li> I have been using this body oil for years. It smells amazing because the scent is soft and calming and not too strong. It is made of all natural essential oils which does wonders for my skin. I recommend this oil for pregnant women as well as a belly moisturizer to prevent itchiness, dryness and stretch marks. It helps to preserve your skin&#x27;s elasticity. I use it several times a day to keep moisturized.</li>
    <li> The smell of the oil wasn&#x27;t great</li>
    <li> For those of you wondering how it smells (because I was)- I would almost compare it to a eucalyptus/rosemary combination. It is strong, but it is a relaxing scent. If you are sensitive to smells, don&#x27;t buy it. I happen to love the scent though. The consistancy is perfect for massage oil. I gave it four stars instead of five because it is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to pour the oil from the lid without making a huge mess. We have to lay down a towel before using this oil. Also, for those pasty-white-exzema-prone people like myself, it is sensitive skin approved- no break-outs! :)</li>
    <li> A-little goes along way with this massage oil. I think this is the best I&#x27;ve used over all the years I&#x27;ve been using massage oils. The sent is very calm and makes you feel very relaxed. I think this is a must for those who want a nice, fresh massage.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It is great for massage feels good and smells good.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I wanted a massage oil for someone with very oily skin. Was originally looking at the Now Foods sweet almond oil but after some research I found out that an oil with a grapeseed base would be a better choice. So I found this. Was worried about the scent as there were mixed reviews. The scent is pleasant, not too strong but strong enough to be enjoyable. It also isn&#x27;t a flowery smell so it&#x27;s great for guys.&lt;br /&gt;I was also happy to see that it was not a heavy oil and does not leave one with leave that &#x27;slicked down&#x27; feeling you can get after a massage. It&#x27;s light yet goes a long way. It&#x27;s a great product. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for massaging my wifes back. It works well and will wipe off with a towel. Your hands don&#x27;t tired as quickly with this oil.</li>
    <li> Great sense and is very relaxing. Only thing would be it&#x27;s too oily so it kinda drip all over, but it adds the fun too</li>
    <li> This oil smells great and works really nice for massages. I will buy other scents to try them out. Quality product.</li>
