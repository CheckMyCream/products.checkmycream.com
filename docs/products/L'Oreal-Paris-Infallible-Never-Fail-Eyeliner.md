      <li>Good price &amp; nice colors.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this eyeliner!</li>
      <li>I was delighted to find the Navy color on Amazon :).</li>
      <li>I seem to develop acute allergic conjunctivitis with this color and the purple one.</li>
      <li>Still, they are better than most.</li>
      <li>I love the way these infallible eye liners go on easily and stay in place.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s REALLY infallible, it looks good all day.</li>
      <li>They go on easily.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t someone invent a smear free eye pencil?</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly, stays put all day.</li>
      <li>gosh, the things people do to make a quick buck.</li>
      <li>I have light blue eyes, and I love the Navy color on my eyes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner pencil for several years and love the way it &amp;#34;never fails&amp;#34; to apply smoothly and lasts so much longer than powders.  </li>

      <li>Thanks, Raccoonx5</li>
      <li>I was surprised by the ease of application and the staying power for a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>, you could see that the tip was damaged, and the &amp;#34;smude part&amp;#34; was also&lt;br /&gt;bent and flopping.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth sending it back.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used 4 of them.</li>
      <li>Goes on easily and only bleeds a little into lines under my eyes.</li>
      <li>I even used eye shadow base on my lids to get the best stay power possible.</li>
      <li>Less than 2 hours later it was all smeared, smudged, creeping into fine lines and tiny bits flaked off beneath my eyes.  </li>

    <li> Hated it.  Wore it twice and threw it in the trash.  Easy enough to apply and gave me a decently thin line, the kind of look that I was after for everyday casual, under my bottom lashes.  Less than 2 hours later it was all smeared, smudged, creeping into fine lines and tiny bits flaked off beneath my eyes.  Looked like I had been crying or rubbing my eyes, neither of which had happened.  Tried again the next day, just to see if it was a fluke and confirm the results; same thing happened.  The weather was not humid, it was not raining, no logical reason or explanation for it...just a crappy product and waste of money.</li>
    <li> I was considering getting permanent eyeliner because no matter what I do, my eyeliner tends to fade or smear or wear off by the end of a day. I decided to try this because the packaging said it was smudge-resistent and lasts for 16 hours. I realize it&#x27;s what companies do when marketing or advertising, they promise the product is the best, and sometimes it&#x27;s not, but in this case, it really is. I am very impressed. At this point, I have stopped considering permanent eyeliner, as long as L&#x27;Oreal keeps making Infallible eyeliners. I have bought them in almost every color and each one is great.</li>
    <li> The tip is too rounded to make a thin line.&lt;br /&gt;Mine arrived without it being inside a cardboard package. It was loose, inside the envelope.&lt;br /&gt;When I went to use it, you could see that the tip was damaged, and the &amp;#34;smude part&amp;#34; was also&lt;br /&gt;bent and flopping.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth sending it back. I am not buying make-up from anyone that is not AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;Why would anyone take the eyeliner out of its packaging, and send it to you as if it were a #2 pencil?&lt;br /&gt;It could be contaminated since it is wide open.&lt;br /&gt;My gosh, the things people do to make a quick buck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner pencil for several years and love the way it &amp;#34;never fails&amp;#34; to apply smoothly and lasts so much longer than powders.  I was delighted to find the Navy color on Amazon :).</li>
    <li> Matches my outfits perfectly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this eyeliner for years and buy it for a great price with Subscribe and Save on Amazon. It goes on smoothly and the navy shade is subtle, softer and warmer than black. Furthermore, it doesn&#x27;t run or smudge once it&#x27;s on.</li>
    <li> Goes on easily and only bleeds a little into lines under my eyes.</li>
    <li> They go on easily.  They&#x27;re not real easy to smudge though.  Still, they are better than most.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to this product - must be the crushed beetles they use for pigment. I seem to develop acute allergic conjunctivitis with this color and the purple one. Too bad );</li>
    <li> Just like all the rest who claim to be smear proof. NOT! I even used eye shadow base on my lids to get the best stay power possible. Can&#x27;t someone invent a smear free eye pencil? If anyone knows of one that ACTUALLY stays put, let me know. Thanks, Raccoonx5</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this product. I usually use Lancome, so I was expecting it to be not as good. I was surprised by the ease of application and the staying power for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Best eye liner I have ever used.  Goes on smoothly, stays put all day.</li>
    <li> Buy this eyeliner all the time. Good price &amp; nice colors.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this eyeliner! It&#x27;s REALLY infallible, it looks good all day. I keep buying this eyeliner as soon as I finish one. So far, I&#x27;ve used 4 of them. I have light blue eyes, and I love the Navy color on my eyes. I&#x27;m a happy customer, will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product and service.</li>
    <li> Serious smudging.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this based on reviewers&#x27; positive reviews.  Within 30 minutes, a shadow of the line appears in my eye crease.  Junk!</li>
    <li> I buy this in bulk online so I&#x27;ll always have it! Stays on great, and comes with a smudger AND a sharpener. Luv this navy color with my brown eyes!</li>
    <li> I love the way these infallible eye liners go on easily and stay in place. I have on in about every color!</li>
