<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am 60 and decided to try it based on reviews. I give the product 5 stars. It reduced puffiness and dark circles within a few days and is continuing still. It gently moisturizes too. Very pleased! It took years off.</li>
    <li> I have been using it twice a day, everyday or every time I remember or have time. I enjoy using this eye gel at night because it&#x27;s very cooling and it feels very nice under your eyes. My skin always absorbs the gel very quickly and I love that it&#x27;s not greasy or have a weird smell. The gel helps with fine lines, wrinkles, puffiness and dark circles. I use it for my dark circles but it&#x27;s always a bonus if it can gel with more than just dark circles, right? Yalmeh Glory Eye Bright Gel contains all natural ingredients, no toxic chemicals or cancer causing additives, no mineral oil, sulfates or alcohol, propylene glycol or paraben. This eye gel is 100% natural and 75% organic and it&#x27;s also cruelty free. A little goes a long way. I have been using this twice a day and I still have a lot of product left. After all this is a very good eye gel, it works and it does everything it claims to do. It is also very affordable</li>
    <li> Really nice product, only need a little for nice results</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this eye cream based on the many positive reviews I have read, but found this product to be just average. It is definitely not a miracle eye cream as raved by many of the other reviewers. I didn&#x27;t see any immediate results, but since I have only used it daily a little over one week, I am still waiting to hopefully see some results with long-term use. So far, no improvements with my dark under eye circles or bags (the reasons I bought this cream). The scent is mild and pleasant. The gel is a bit on the watery side, but goes on well. The skin around my eyes does feel soft after application, but since I did not purchase this cream for hydration, I expected more from it. Again, don&#x27;t expect any instant results or miracles with this product.</li>
    <li> Just starting using it. Not sure yet.</li>
    <li> My under eyes are really enjoying this product the dark circles are lessening and it is looking smoother overall .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about half-way through this tube and wanted to wait to comment on it.  However, I must say that I am very pleased with it so far and will probably order again.  It is a very light gel, spreads smoothly over the eye area and feels very cool when applied.  I can detect a slight improvement in the skin surface.  A scaly area off to the side has improved greatly.  It absorbs quickly and has no sticky residual effect.</li>
    <li> No difference noticed at all. Diappointed</li>
    <li> Cream works better for me</li>
    <li> Been  using it two weeks and unable to see any difference.</li>
    <li> Great eye gel.  It has helped some with my dark circles.  I have only been using it for a couple of weeks, so far so good.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for meâ€¦</li>
    <li> This eye cream is nice and cold when you put it on your skin. I liked that it didn&#x27;t try to creep into my eyes like some eye creams tend to do. I was sent this and they eye gel to try out and I did prefer the gel more I think it all comes down to preference. This product worked very well at getting rid of dark circles which is my main concern.</li>
    <li> Used this for about two weeks now.  Dark circles are fading...skin is softer and the wrinkles are less noticible. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m supposed to, but I&#x27;m using it on my eye lids.  It has softened the crepiness and makeup goes on smoother.  I&#x27;m hoping for more improvement with continued use, but will recommend it even this soon.</li>
    <li> As soon as you open the bottle you can smell the refreshing scent of cucumbers! I love applying this in the morning after I do my regular cleanse. It applies smooth and silky with no greasy residue! I love how fast it absorbs, and doesn&#x27;t interfere if I decide to wear make-up that day. That&#x27;s a big bonus! I did notice a difference in my eyes after about a month of use. The biggest change for me personally was the puffiness and a slight difference with the bags under my eyes. I believe with continuous use my results will only get better!</li>
    <li> Just ordered my second tube.  It does help plump up to cover lines.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works for me.</li>
    <li> This is one of the top products for under eye bags and dark circles. I gave one tube to each of my best friends, and we all love it.. will be buying more soon..</li>
    <li> This stuff works, I&#x27;m on the computer and lose track of time late in the night and I would get bags under my eyes. Been using this for a couple of days and it works great. Don&#x27;t be scared by the small packaging being worth the money.. You take small dabs of this stuff, so it actually lasts a long time</li>
    <li> Contrary to ANY common sense, I normally have this weird avoidance to eye creams and treatments. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the fear of getting stuff in my contacts. Or the denial of getting older and having to deal with crows feet and fine lines around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, honestly, it would behoove a perpetual insomniac to actually use an eye product. Because, you know, those giant circles under my eyes are not really becoming regardless of any fine lines or wrinkles. I have made it my mission to try new stuff and I decided to take the plunge with a gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know when people say something is the &amp;#34;whole package?&amp;#34; I really feel like this product hits the nail on the head with this. And it has changed my whole perception on the eye game. The 15 ml tube is gorgeous and it easy to hold and work with. I actually really like that it comes in a tube instead of the prototypical pot. It makes the application MUCH easier for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing about this product that really blew me away was the fact that upon opening the tube, I was greeted with a fresh cucumber scent. I really like and am intrigued by plant based, natural cosmetics. I just have an affinity to them. And this just smelt so fresh, clean, and and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was like treating my eyes to a little spa vacation! The smell is reminiscent of slipping on a soft robe and just laying back and putting a couple cool cucumbers on your eyes while sipping lemon water. It&#x27;s a great smell association for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is very thick and hearty- you don&#x27;t need much at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One little squeeze, dab about 3 times around the bottom of each eye, blend- and you&#x27;ll immediately feel a wonderful, cooling sensation. The gel absorbs very quickly and you&#x27;re eyes are left feeling plumped and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I wasn&#x27;t born yesterday and I am fully aware that it&#x27;s going to take a lot more than a little bit of eye gel to get rid of my dark circles. Such is life. Although it&#x27;sa bit early in my usage to say that the gel is making a long term difference in regards to my bags, fine lines, and wrinkles- there is something I noticed right off the bat. And I can say that I did look a little more bright eyed as soon as it absorbed. That&#x27;s a pretty good start for a product in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel is TREMENDOUS under primers, foundations, and make up. It creates a really soft, awesome palette under your eyes to apply whatever make up you choose. I&#x27;ve tried it a couple different ways- with just primer, with primer and cover up, with just foundation, and with just setting powders. And every single product that I have used in congruence with Yalmeh works amazingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to create a soft base for around your eyes that works extremely well with make up. It doesn&#x27;t have that greasy under eye cream/gel that makes setting mascaras and liners difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And honestly, that&#x27;s what impressed me the most. So, I&#x27;ve been debating using it along with primer on my whole face. But, I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it&#x27;s changed the whole eye cream/gel game for me and has made me incredibly more open minded to working such products into my beauty routine. I felt comfortable and safe using the all natural ingredients around my eyes. And I absolutely love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yalmeh Glory Eye Bright Gel is a winner for me and I feel really lucky that I got to try it. I feel like I found a new little treasure!</li>
    <li> I received this eye gel and since using this product my eyes look less tired and my under eye circles are less apparent. The Yalmeh Glory Eye Bright Gel reduces puffiness, brightens dark circles making them less visible and tighten the skin, getting rid of crows feet. It contains plant stem cells and Matrixyl 3000 and hyaluronic acid for superior anti aging effects. I immediately noticed that this eye gel reduced the puffiness around my eyes and within a couple of weeks my dark circles were diminishing! I love that you are able to feel the gel working on your eyes as indicated by the light cooling sensation felt upon applying this around the eyes. The gel is thick and goes on smooth and evenly and it smells like cucumbers which is so refreshing! I love that this is a pure product made with no fillers or glutens and is vegan friendly and best of all that it is cruelty free. This is really an amazing product!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff! Made my tired looking eyes look more alive in just 3 days, really works well.</li>
    <li> Great eye gel. Arrived on time and was packed very well. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Put a little on under the eye.  Let dry.  Use concealer.  Have literally been asked if I&#x27;ve had injections.  HIGHLY recommend for under eye hallowness.</li>
    <li> I gave it two weeks &amp; it worked for me - will buy again!</li>
    <li> I like this product quite a lot - still have dark circles, but it is a nice gentle cream and may make a bigger difference over time.  Have been using their eye moisture cream for several months, and really love that!</li>
    <li> Cool feeling on the eye and the dark circles start to disappear !</li>
    <li> I do not understand why this product is so highly recommended.  It does not work.  If I could return it I would.</li>
    <li> incredible it does the job I have very aggressive rosacea and putting anything on my face is a scary moment but this stuff did not cause any flare ups and my eyes look so much better the bags have diminished nd the tiredness look is gone im ordering more of their products today</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I&#x27;m a nursing student, and I&#x27;m always up late doing some sort of studying. I&#x27;m not too extatic about the product as it hasn&#x27;t done much to lighten the puffiness under my eyes. I guess I can&#x27;t have too many expectations; the combination of adequate sleep would probably do wonders as well. I do feel a cooling affect upon applying the product, and it definitely tightens the skin it&#x27;s applied to. 3 more semesters of sleepless nights.</li>
    <li> I noticed no difference in eye brightening or intensity of dark circles. I ended up using this as a face cream just to use it up.</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive skin, but this gel does not irritates my eyes at all. Since I&#x27;m using it only for a few weeks, its too soon commenting on how efficient is reducing my wrinkles. But it does feels good. Thank you Yalmeh.</li>
    <li> Excellent under eye treatment.  Has a very light smell....like cucumber...very pleasent and not overwhelming.  You will notice improvement&lt;br /&gt;under the eye 30min to 1hr after application and last all day.  Sometimes I will add a little more late afternoon.  Great product at a great price!</li>

    <li> She likes it. And thats what counts. I as a man would like more product for the money. This thing is tiny.</li>
    <li> I have tried other Yalmeh products in the past and have been very happy with the results that I got. Needless to say, I had high hopes when I started using this eye gel. I was and still am very impressed with how well it works for my sensitive undereye area, as it really reduces the puffiness under my eyes that I am perpetually plagued with, when I wake up in the morning. It is also working so well as far as hydrating my eye area goes! This product and brand always delivers the results that I am hoping to get from skin care products. Love this brand and product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. Iâ€™m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end userâ€™s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I have to give a big shout out to Yalmeh for sending me this Glory Eye Bright Gel to review.  It has become my favorite day time eye cream of the moment.  It just feels so refreshing when you put it on, especially early in the morning when your still feeling tired and your eyes are still in the process of waking up.  The Glory Eye Bright Gel is really hydrating and really light weight so it just melts into the skin around your eyes.  It also really helps with all that puffiness that I always have under my eyes in the morning.  I naturally have dark circles around my eyes so I don&#x27;t really benefit from the eye brightening capabilities of this eye cream but I can see how it would work great for those people that have dark circles from things like not getting enough sleep.  All that and it has also made the fine lines around my eyes less noticeable!!</li>
    <li> So far the puffs under my eyes have gone down a little, and the dark lines under the puffs are a little lighter.  It has only been a few weeks that I am using the cream.  I will keep using it for awhile longer, hoping to see more of an improvement.</li>
    <li> Yalmeh offers a great line of products that I have had the chance to review. The Yalmeh Glory Eye Bright Gel is not an exception. I like that because it&#x27;s a gel it gets absorbed into the skin quickly. I have used it on occasions after putting in my contacts and haven&#x27;t had a sensitivity issue. I have noticed that when I put it on and apply my makeup after, it gives my makeup a flawless effect. I love it&#x27;s crisp cucumber like scent. I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or greasy residue. The tube was much smaller than I expected but a little does go a long way so it is definitely a good buy for the price. I have been using it for a couple weeks and have noticed a slight difference. I will definitely continue to use it at least until I finish the tube and if the difference is more noticeable then I will definitely purchase this eye brightening gel.</li>
    <li> I read in a review for another product about  Yalmeh Glory  Eye  Bright Gel.  I saw the reviewer really  loved the product.  I think I like to try Yalmeh eye gel and see if that can help my dark circle.</li>
    <li> I was very anxious to try this product. The benefits of it are extensive. It is supposed to reduce the appearance of dark circles, puffiness, dryness and sagging around the eyes and increases softness, firms and plumps the skin around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some bags, puffiness, and dark circles around my eyes so I was hoping to use it and see some results! I started using it the day that I got it and used it every day. Within a week, I definitely saw some improvement in the look of the bags and darkness under my eyes! It is definitely a product that I would continue to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read through the ingredient list and found that overall, the ingredients were all natural ingredients that I could understand and read! I was happy with that! The cream itself was a great consistency and applied easily. It also had a very nice light scent. Nothing overly noticable but pleasant and not chemically smelling! Overall, very happy!</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Yalmeh products. The Yalmeh Glory Eye Bright Gel is not exception. I only use this once a day at night before I go to bed, but it is still an important part of my facial routine. I only have to use a very small amount which I really love because it will last a very long time. One of my favorite aspects is that it is made with plant stem cells which are proven to build skin up, rejuvenate and heal it, and also pamper the skin. It has no toxins or additives which makes it the perfect choice of age treatment for the eyes because there is nothing in it to harm the skin or the eye itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about a month now along with a couple other creams and this one has done wonders for my eyes. They look and feel hydrated and the skin is firmer. The skin around my eyes is no longer paper thin and the lines that were starting to form from worry and lack of sleep are basically gone. It has a refreshing cucumber scent that is not very strong and it feels like it tightens and firms my eye region quickly and it absorbs even faster. This is over all a great cream and I plan to use it for years to come to diminish the signs of aging and stave them off as well.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t born with airbrushed skin so all my flaws show. Beauty items help conceal my unpleasant features and accentuate my most glorious features. Each product needs help of another to be at it&#x27;s best. So how can your concealer cover up spots and dark circles too? With the help of Yalmeh Glory Eye Bright Gel, your concealer can easily mask under your eyes. This is because the Yalmeh eye gel does it&#x27;s job removing the darkness under your eyes, that&#x27;s it&#x27;s job. It does such a good job in fact that the concealer can be left behind in my experience. I only used the concealer to hide my horrible under eye dark circles. The Yalmeh leaves your skin soft and bright just as it should be. Let&#x27;s face it, I will always be a worn thin mom but I do not need to look that way! http://www.frugalmomandwife.com/2014/11/yalmeh-glory-eye-bright-gel-brightening.html</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male who needed some cosmetic treatment for the dark circles under my eyes. I started using this once in the morning and once at night and actor a week I started noticing a difference. 20 bucks might sound a little steep for this little tube but it is definitely worth it. I just had to put up with the funny looks my wife would give me when I put it on at night. Haha</li>
    <li> VERY NICE EYE CREAM, MAKES MY EYES BRIGHTER, WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I was sent the Glory Eye Bright Gel by Yalmeh to review a couple days ago and wanted to tell you what I think of it! It comes in a pretty blue tube inside a cute cardboard box. When I saw that it was a gel I was expecting a really thick consistency but it has a almost watery jelly feel to it. It soaks into my skin very nicely and I think it really does tighten up the skin! Itâ€™s nice and moisturizing as well which is a plus!&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I only took a chance on this gel because it had \\&quot;Yalmeh\\&quot; on the label, any I&#x27;d bought previously were mostly empty tubes or jars, certainly not enough product to determine if it was effective over time, 4-7 applications at most. I&#x27;ve gotten 43 applications out of this tube and it&#x27;s not quite empty yet. I&#x27;m pretty clumsy and wasteful, so somebody with more experience and finesse could probably get twice as many uses&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ve been using the \\&quot;Yalmeh\\&quot; eye cream for months anyway, but I do like this gel as well! It does seem to tighten up all around my eyes more. It dries pretty quick, and it leaves more of a gloss than I prefer, but I just put a dab of the cream on it and all blends easily! I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s advisable or not, but I&#x27;ve had no ill effects or reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway , shortly after I bought the first tube I ordered 2 more, so....</li>
    <li> Feels soothing but haven&#x27;t seen a difference in dark circles and it&#x27;s been weeks.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed too, but is suited better for people with oily/combo skin versus people with dry skin. but a great product other wise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this item for review***</li>
    <li> Very  good gel Love it works perfectly on dark circles I would love to use it longer to se if it works on my crowfeet and yes I do recomend this gel to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love the Yelmeh products, so I decided to review this gel in return for a review. This Glory Eye Gel is very small. It won&#x27;t last a month, but I love it. It is made with natural products and it actually works. My dark circles have greatly diminished.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in the area around my eye.  The Yalmeh Glory Eye Bright Gel gently calms, soothes, and smoothes your skin around the eyes. It naturally reduces puffiness and brightens dark circles, all while tightening the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved that this product is such great quality, but at an affordable price. The ingredients in this eye brightener help improve the tone and texture around your eyes. Within days of using this, I could tell a huge difference in the way my eye&#x27;s skin looked.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! I saw a difference within a few days and I have to say I just love this eye serum. It&#x27;s more of a gel and feels wonderful going on. I have spent way more money on the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; hotsy totsy stuff and they do not compare to the results I&#x27;ve gotten with this product. Thank you for producing something that works so beautifully and is truly affordable.</li>
    <li> My skin looks younger and smoother, also applied some of the product to my upper lip area and the vertical lines are nearly gone</li>
    <li> Yalmeh sells some great skincare products and this one is no exception.  It may come in a small container, but it really packs a punch when it comes to helping those unsightly bags under your eyes and firming them up!  This takes care of wrinkles, fine lines, dark spots and bags as well as many other problems.  It is specifically formulated for your eyes, and it only takes a very tiny amount to spread on.  You will notice a difference in just a few days, it really does lighten up and tone the area around your eyes.  Made from all-natural ingredients and has no toxic chemicals or cancer causing additives.  There is NO mineral oil, sulfates or alcohol that will dry your skin out in this product.  Yalmeh is a cruelty-free company, never testing on animals and is safe and works :)  75% organic and 100% natural, you know you are getting a great product that is safe to use around your eyes, a very sensitive spot on your face and one that you don&#x27;t want chemicals around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, Yalmeh offers a money-back guarantee - and I am sure you won&#x27;t want to send it back once you have tried it :)  Very small bottle only .5 fl oz so it will fit easily into the pocket of a purse or bag.  Use it wherever you want - no greasy residue, just results!  I received a complimentary product to test :)</li>
    <li> Great product! I have dark circles and wrinkles under my eyes - probably because I&#x27;m a parent, but when I wake up in the morning, my eyes don&#x27;t feel heavy or swollen.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for over a week and I am noticing that my dark circles are getting lighter.  The only thing is that I use this gel and on top of it, I put on eye cream.  My skin drinks up the gel in a few seconds and it feels dry. I don&#x27;t mind putting two different things under my eyes since the product has helped my bags, wrinkles and dark circles.  I have also purchased this for my mom to use!</li>
    <li> Received excellent tips from seller on how to apply &amp; time it takes to start working.</li>
    <li> Its a good product.  Noticeably lightens under eye area.  One tube lasts a long time you only have to use a small amount.</li>
    <li> I think everyone responds differently to products. I didn&#x27;t really notice my skin responded to this gel. I will try another product from the company. I DO like the quality (not a lot of junky ingredients) ...and I really liked the price point!</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any change. I&#x27;ll try it one more month. Maybe I need a miracle. Peg</li>
    <li> nothing noticeable but cant hurt....</li>
    <li> It is worthless.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> It did noting for me and its too small for how much you pay</li>
    <li> Plain cream with no results as claimed</li>
    <li> I have been using an oil of olay product along with this. I actually prefer this over it. It just feels good going on. You can feel it tightening up the skin a bit. The smell is fine just a slight cucumber odor. A slight reduction is the blackness under my eyes. If you are expecting a miracle with one of these creams I doubt you will find it but it does help. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> The Yalmeh eye gel came to me in great timing!  I was excited to receive it quickly!  I am still using the cream gel everyday. I love how it goes on easily and makes under my eyes soft all day long!</li>
    <li> I Love it, It&#x27;s helpful.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week now. I generally put it on right before I put on my makeup. I have found that my main problem area is right under my eyes. I tend to have fine lines and more than anything, those horrid dark circles. Since I have been using it under my eyes, I have significantly noticed that my dark circles have diminished. I was also really impressed with how quickly it absorbs into the skin, as well as how quickly it begins to work. It didn&#x27;t take days or hours to work either which was what I was most impressed with. After only a few minutes, I had noticed a difference. No more dark circles, and no more puffiness. Even after a week I am starting to notice my fine lines starting to fade, so I am interested to see if I can get them to go away completely. I will say though it definitely is a product that has become part of my daily skin routine, and I am glad that I decided to give this product a try. If your looking for a product to give you that quick fix to get rid of dark circles and puffiness in the morning, I would really recommend this product. It may even help your face in other area&#x27;s as well.</li>
    <li> Great product. Cannot comment on long term results yet but this product gives me an immediate reduction in under eye swelling.  I mean immediate within seconds of applying. A claim made by many creams but this is only the second one of many that actually did anything meaningful and this one did more than the second one which was Roc retinol eye cream.  Tried many others with zero results.  It does not eliminate swelling but reduces it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 3 weeks but it&#x27;s starting to work on my allergy black eyes. I will purchase more.</li>
    <li> I put this on at night and found it dries sticky. I was surprised to wake up and actually look more &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34;, despite my family making sure I get as little sleep as possible. It really does eliminate my dark circles (which aren&#x27;t very dark, but noticeable). I stopped using my under eye concealer because it&#x27;s no longer necessary. I also like the smell, it&#x27;s very botanical and spa-like. My husband is starting to use it too. I&#x27;m purchasing my second tube.</li>
    <li> Great eye brighter  smells really good smooth going on</li>
    <li> This eye gel is OK. I followed the instructions, but it&#x27;s still stingy sometimes. A gel that stings cannot be good for your skin. My skin does feel fresh after applying this gel. Luckily I&#x27;ve found a better eye cream on Amazon that I&#x27;m much happier with (Foxbrim).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to be fair in rating. So, I have all year allergies and this product didn&#x27;t help me at all. It seemed to add to my bags</li>
</ol>
