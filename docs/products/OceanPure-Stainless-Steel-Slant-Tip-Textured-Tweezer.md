      <li>With her spare/junk cheap tweezers it would take up to 15 minutes to remove splinters.</li>
      <li>These tweezers are easy to use, easy to hold, and have a good sharp point.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure Jack Bauer has the same set of tweezers in his pockets in case some terrorists want to square up.&lt;br /&gt;These do a good job of grabbing those pesky ingrown hairs and not slipping.  </li>

      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Good, but not great tweezers.</li>
      <li>I have been able to tweeze anything I have attempted, no matter how small.</li>
      <li>I might never get to the primping and preening levels some guys do, but If more guys knew this, I think (A) women would get better gifts, (B) men would think women’s grooming tools in the same way they think of hardware store tool: pliers, drivers and files — and stop dismissing expensive cosmetics (C) some men would take more time to groom or at least appreciate what their SOs are dealing with.</li>
      <li>They certainly are sturdy enough to feel and look at.</li>
      <li>I was surprised how well it worked.</li>
      <li>Hubs got for his ear hairs, getting old is...hairy.  </li>
      <li>sure Jack Bauer has killed a few terrorists with these as well.</li>

<li> After a few weeks of use, I have found that this tweezers are very sharp.</li>

<li> I got this for my toolkit to avoid having to either live with painful splinters while finishing working on something or stopping work to go to the bathroom and dig around for the SO’s tweezers.</li>
<li> it is quite common for the tweezers to &amp;#34;slip off&amp;#34;</li>
<li> I have had to resist the urge to go tweeze crazy.</li>
<li> so I tried to compare how well these worked by removing some of those ugly stray hairs.</li>

    <li> excellent quality. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Hubs got for his ear hairs, getting old is...hairy.  He loves them.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. High quality.</li>
    <li> This works too well. I can puck away at small hard to get facial hair.</li>
    <li> Bought these for a friend after she saw mine.  We love them.  Great at gripping and easy to hold.  Decent price.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are easy to use, easy to hold, and have a good sharp point. Perfect for my eyebrow maintenance.</li>
    <li> Love the case, very good tweezer. I was surprised how well it worked. I never had a name brand tweezer before.</li>
    <li> I got this for my toolkit to avoid having to either live with painful splinters while finishing working on something or stopping work to go to the bathroom and dig around for the SO’s tweezers. I have already used them to dig out a few metal splinters in seconds. I thought all tweezers where the same. “Why does she buy $25 tweezers instead of $2 tweezers?” I used to think. Now I know better. With her spare/junk cheap tweezers it would take up to 15 minutes to remove splinters. With these it takes no more time that in would to find the splinter, and carefully grab it and pull it out in one attempt.&lt;br /&gt;I got curious so I tried to compare how well these worked by removing some of those ugly stray hairs. I removed a few stray extra long hairs from my arms and legs to see if there was a difference between her old ones and these. Yup! The old fugly tweezers took multiple attempts to grab and pull a few hairs out making it frustrating to line them up and try, try again. These tweezers took one attempt each time I lined then up properly. I might never get to the primping and preening levels some guys do, but If more guys knew this, I think (A) women would get better gifts, (B) men would think women’s grooming tools in the same way they think of hardware store tool: pliers, drivers and files — and stop dismissing expensive cosmetics (C) some men would take more time to groom or at least appreciate what their SOs are dealing with. She did notice &amp; appreciate the lack of the fugly stray hair: so I might just make this an occasional part of my morning routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure Jack Bauer has the same set of tweezers in his pockets in case some terrorists want to square up.&lt;br /&gt;These do a good job of grabbing those pesky ingrown hairs and not slipping.  Solid build and feel, definitely a great tweezer compared to some cheapos.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure Jack Bauer has killed a few terrorists with these as well.</li>
    <li> They are tweezers.  Not too much to say.  Work well.  Sharp, slant tip.  Have a nice little storage bag.  Reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get the job done so well. I&#x27;ve had many different brands with the ability to pluck from the tip but it&#x27;s been a challenge with this one. I&#x27;m not impressed nor satisfied with these tweezers because I&#x27;ve had way better and for cheaper. I&#x27;ve had good luck with Studio 35 &amp; Revlon.</li>
    <li> Best pair I have of tweezers that i have  ever had .  I do not even use my old ones any more.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks of use, I have found that this tweezers are very sharp. I have been able to tweeze anything I have attempted, no matter how small. I have had to resist the urge to go tweeze crazy.</li>
    <li> Good, but not great tweezers. I wanted to love them but they&#x27;re just good. I&#x27;ve yet to find the tweezer that can grasp and hold every tiny hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I need it to do. It grips all the hairs perfectly and is very durable not flimsy at all. Great price too!</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Grips well, and has an angled edge for precision eyebrow plucking. Yay!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other tweezers that have better gripping characteristics.  When I&#x27;m pulling out facial hair it is quite common for the tweezers to &amp;#34;slip off&amp;#34; the hair before final extraction.  Sometimes it takes two or three tries to do what should only take one attempt.  They certainly are sturdy enough to feel and look at.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are so easy to handle and use. The slant is just right for me. They meet my needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have had better but this is easy to grip.</li>
    <li> Best tweezer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
