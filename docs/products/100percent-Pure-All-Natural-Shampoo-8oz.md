      <li>I love this company.</li>
      <li>It does seem to make my scalp healthier and leaves my hair shiney and more manageable.</li>
      <li>Love eveything about this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; products on the market.</li>
      <li>much better than stuff you buy at the drug store.</li>
      <li>This shampoo does not lather too much, which is supposed to be a good thing because it means it&#x27;s not stripping your hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been researching shampoo and no-poo for about 1 year now and this was one of most clean shampoos</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I kept it because as I stated earlier, I think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>The smell is strong but it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of this company.</li>
      <li>Cleans well and has a nice scent, but dries out my scalp too much.</li>
      <li>Nice smell and cleans and rinses very well.</li>
      <li>She also didn&#x27;t feel that Selsun Blue was very effective.</li>
      <li>And my head feels so clean.</li>
      <li>My hair still feels clean and my itchy scalp has not been a problem in the year or so that I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
      <li>My hair is squeaky clean along with my scalp</li>
      <li>It smells  pretty good, the shampoo is a little like a hospital scrub brush before surgery, but that does not linger and the conditioner smells good.  </li>
      <li>The downside it&#x27;s very runny and always end up using more than needed.</li>
      <li>Sure enough, when I opened the envelope the tube of shampoo had a crack along the top and there was shampoo all over inside the envelope.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair healthy, thick, beautiful and workable with pure ingredients to boot!</li>
      <li>Its an ok shampoo, but as far as working, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try.  </li>
      <li>It offers plenty lather which most do not.</li>
      <li>I got this because I have issues with dandruff and itchy scalp and anted something natural and safe for colored-treated hair.</li>
      <li>I have tried a couple other (kelp &amp; mint, honey &amp; virgin coconut) 100% Pure shampoos and I love this one the most.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am 100% Pure!</li>
      <li>Very nice product  and no more itchy scalp.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more expensive than the Mineral Mfusion and the smell is not as nice, but for being natural and safe for colored hair, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>It may seem watery at first but the trick is to shake the tube then rub it between your hands to form a lather.</li>
      <li>The only shampoo that stops and eliminates dryness and itchy scalp and hairs become more vibrant and hydrated.</li>
      <li>For someone like me with dry scalp, this shampoo is very drying and causes more scalp issues than is solves.</li>
      <li>100% Pure is real quality</li>
      <li>This shampoo works very well for my daughter.</li>
      <li>i already have to really work at swatting my hair to get any dandruff to fall, whereas it use to coat my shoulders like a Santa Display at the mall.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t appear to have much build up either</li>
      <li>really like it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>Much better than straight neem oil, and not harsh like traditional dandruff shampoos.</li>
      <li>Ok shampoo but definitely not worth the money.  </li>
      <li>I have purchase many 100% Pure products in the past.</li>
      <li>#34;I&#x27;ve tried everything for years, but now this one product here fixed me completely in like 2 days!!&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I also like that it still lathers and cleans, as not all natural shampoos do.</li>
      <li>this has nothing to do with natural i used 2 time</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t desirable but works well on sensitive scalps.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>My scalp is less and less dry after each use and the cooling sensation is light and refreshing when you use it.</li>
      <li>and so far delivers what it promises.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo makes my hair really soft and the ends no longer get</li>
      <li>Its a little more watery than I expected</li>
      <li>and I cannot do &#x27;no poo&#x27; or more natural options when caring for my hair, but I do like to avoid harsh chemicals in every other aspect of our household.</li>
      <li>I find my hair now produces less oils, as this product effectively removes the bad stuff without robbing my hair of all of it&#x27;s natural, healthy oils.  </li>
      <li>Really helps with itchy scalp/dandruff and cleans your hair without stripping it dry.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend, who is always quick to let me know if some lotion or hair product I use smells bad has not made any comment, so it must be ok.  </li>
      <li>I usually wash every other day, and use an additional leave in conditioner for the ends from purology and my hair is soft, smooth, and the dandruff is on</li>

    <li> Cleans well and has a nice scent, but dries out my scalp too much.</li>
    <li> Love eveything about this. Smells wonderful, too.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair healthy, thick, beautiful and workable with pure ingredients to boot! I absolutely LOVE it and haven&#x27;t found anything better!</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple other (kelp &amp; mint, honey &amp; virgin coconut) 100% Pure shampoos and I love this one the most. We have hard water and I cannot do &#x27;no poo&#x27; or more natural options when caring for my hair, but I do like to avoid harsh chemicals in every other aspect of our household. This is an effective cleanser, keeps my scalp hydrated and healthy, and my hair looks nice and shiny. I pair this with the honey &amp; virgin coconut restorative conditioner and my hair looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> Really helps with itchy scalp/dandruff and cleans your hair without stripping it dry. It may seem watery at first but the trick is to shake the tube then rub it between your hands to form a lather. One of the best organic shampoos I ever used and I would buy this again and again if it were cheaper. 100% Pure is real quality I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> this has nothing to do with natural i used 2 time i had itching, irritation terrible</li>
    <li> This is a lot less harsh than any shampoo I&#x27;ve used. And my head feels so clean. The slight minty feel from the neem also helps with that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been researching shampoo and no-poo for about 1 year now and this was one of most clean shampoos I could fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I alternate this with Terressentials Sultry Spice Mud Wash and in between I use a baking soda no-poo with a Braggs ACV conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never looked or felt stronger or healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% Pure!</li>
    <li> I have been using both the shampoo and the conditioner for a little over a week and it has already improved any dandruff by 80%.  I usually wash every other day, and use an additional leave in conditioner for the ends from purology and my hair is soft, smooth, and the dandruff is on it&#x27;s way out.  I also use a hair masque once per week in additional to this regimen.  My hair is color treated, and I have had no issues with my color treated hair.  It smells  pretty good, the shampoo is a little like a hospital scrub brush before surgery, but that does not linger and the conditioner smells good.  My boyfriend, who is always quick to let me know if some lotion or hair product I use smells bad has not made any comment, so it must be ok.  I will update this review if any issues arise or if the dandruff comes back.  Definitely worth a try.  Much better than straight neem oil, and not harsh like traditional dandruff shampoos. i already have to really work at swatting my hair to get any dandruff to fall, whereas it use to coat my shoulders like a Santa Display at the mall.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does not lather too much, which is supposed to be a good thing because it means it&#x27;s not stripping your hair. I love it! My hair still feels clean and my itchy scalp has not been a problem in the year or so that I&#x27;ve been using it. I wash every other day, and I tend to concentrate the shampoo strictly at my scalp. It still removes any product when it rinses down the hair shaft. Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> Very nice product  and no more itchy scalp.  Hair seems healthier than ever.</li>
    <li> Nothing to write home about.  Ok shampoo but definitely not worth the money.  Lots of other natural shampoos that cost half the price.</li>
    <li> If I thought I could return this I would</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair. I wash my hair once a week and it clears all the product buildup from hair. The smell is strong but it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of this company. I bought this item specifically because it is for helping with dry, irritated scalp and I can happily say it has helped. My scalp is less and less dry after each use and the cooling sensation is light and refreshing when you use it. Its a little more watery than I expected but I don&#x27;t mind it. I will buy it again and will recommend it to anyone. I am slowly stocking up on these products for my make up bag and shower. I love this company.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a couple months and I really like it. It does seem to make my scalp healthier and leaves my hair shiney and more manageable. My only complaint was the packaging they used to ship it to me. Instead of putting it in a box, they used a yellow envelope. I knew this was a bad choice when I received the envelope and it had black tire tracks across the envelope. Sure enough, when I opened the envelope the tube of shampoo had a crack along the top and there was shampoo all over inside the envelope. Luckily, only about 1/4 of the shampoo was lost. I opted not to return it because I was anxious to try the shampoo. I&#x27;m glad I kept it because as I stated earlier, I think it&#x27;s a great product. I just wish they would ship it in a box.</li>
    <li> Its an ok shampoo, but as far as working, it didn&#x27;t. Flaky scalp as ever. Getting so tired of being let down by other alleged amazon reviewers that say about anything: &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve tried everything for years, but now this one product here fixed me completely in like 2 days!!&amp;#34; Ughh.</li>
    <li> I have a skin condition that I can&#x27;t use regular shampoos. I&#x27;ve tried many &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; products on the market. This one is by far the best for me. I&#x27;ve used this product for the past 6 months. It offers plenty lather which most do not. Nice smell and cleans and rinses very well.</li>
    <li> I got this because I have issues with dandruff and itchy scalp and anted something natural and safe for colored-treated hair. I was using Mineral Fusion Dandruff shampoo, but noticed it was causing my air color to wash away. It works for me, nothing miraculous and my dandruff isn&#x27;t cured so I have to keep using it. It&#x27;s more expensive than the Mineral Mfusion and the smell is not as nice, but for being natural and safe for colored hair, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> The only shampoo that stops and eliminates dryness and itchy scalp and hairs become more vibrant and hydrated. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t desirable but works well on sensitive scalps.  It doesn&#x27;t appear to have much build up either and so far delivers what it promises.  The downside it&#x27;s very runny and always end up using more than needed.</li>
    <li> great product. much better than stuff you buy at the drug store.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from their store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it. I swim a lot and found other shampoos destroy my ends. This shampoo makes my hair really soft and the ends no longer get knotted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! My hair is squeaky clean along with my scalp I recommend this shampoo to every one</li>
    <li> This shampoo works very well for my daughter. She has used Selsun Blue in the past but hated the way that it smelled and was worried about the chemicals that give it the vivid blue color. She also didn&#x27;t feel that Selsun Blue was very effective. I have purchase many 100% Pure products in the past. She tried it and loves it. It works well without putting chemicals all over your scalp.</li>
    <li> Love all 100% products!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has truly shifted the overall health of my scalp and hair.  I find my hair now produces less oils, as this product effectively removes the bad stuff without robbing my hair of all of it&#x27;s natural, healthy oils.  I also like that it still lathers and cleans, as not all natural shampoos do.</li>
    <li> For someone like me with dry scalp, this shampoo is very drying and causes more scalp issues than is solves.</li>
    <li> Makes the hair look and feel so good</li>
    <li> My hair and scalp likes this product.  I have fine hair.  This does not weigh it down like other shampoos.</li>
