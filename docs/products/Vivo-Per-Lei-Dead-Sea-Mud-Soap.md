      <li>This is an amazing deal and an amazing cleanser.</li>
      <li>Nice.</li>
      <li>BUT... it&#x27;s SO affordable, comparatively, and it is a nice soap, so I&#x27;m OK with it.</li>
      <li>Great product - much cheaper than the mall!</li>
      <li>So I bought 12 more bars.</li>
      <li>I am sure this is not a legit product.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>but this makes my skin more softer</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>i have had better mud soap ...</li>
      <li>The product is great and shipping was really fast.</li>
      <li>I feel that I cannot go without it :)</li>
      <li>Here is your product review so you can easily copy and paste it:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>is too strong for me.</li>
      <li>Received quickly now to try it out, by the way the scent is like a grape vinery of which I love grapes</li>
      <li>Smells good and so soft on the skin!</li>
      <li>As soon as I unwrapped it I got hit with the perfume odor, I don&#x27;t like strong perfumes in my cleansing products, a light fresh scent is ok</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin soft, and smells  good.  </li>
      <li>I love this soap and it really works!</li>
      <li>Makes me feel squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>I loved this company&#x27;s facial peel and was excited to try the sea mud soap as well, I was hoping it would be comparable to Erno Laszlo&#x27;s sea mud soap</li>
      <li>then skip this soap and just spend the extra money to get the good stuff.</li>
      <li>It lathers more than anything I&#x27;ve ever used and has a very calming effect on my skin.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and have been using for a while and really love it.</li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like the smell, but now I love it as it makes my skin so soft.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>So I bought this at one of the mall kiosks, got completely ripped off! !!!</li>
      <li>Very expense</li>
      <li>I have combination skin that is very and prone and love this, if cleans my face and doesn&#x27;t leave it dry like a normal soap would.</li>
      <li>love this soap, make my dry skin  feel so soft!</li>
      <li>I use it on my face to clean prior to face wash.  </li>
      <li>I cut mine in half and pressed the two pieces together to make it more soap-shaped and easier to use.</li>
      <li>This is probably OK as a soap, but we had to throw it out because we both disliked the smell so much.</li>
      <li>I have never used Dead Sea Mud Soap before, and I don&#x27;t know why I ordered this soap except that I am always looking for a good non-drying facial soap.  </li>
      <li>And one more thing -- the shape is very odd for a soap.</li>
      <li>I recommend this to anyone with stubborn acne, uneven skin tone or anyone looking for a great skin regimen that isn&#x27;t harsh and drying.</li>
      <li>Very soft mill, perfumey soap.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin very soft.</li>
      <li>Had to get over the fact that it makes everything black at first (i.e. washcloth), but it washes right off.  </li>
      <li>Very good package, but every soap were a little smaller compare to other 3 pack I had bougth thru Amazon and the price is almost the same.</li>
      <li>I  called it &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34;, but my husband described it as &amp;#34;like Concord grape skins that have been left to get musty.&amp;#34; It stank up the bathroom first, then was permeating the whole back end of the house.</li>
      <li>other sea mud soaps, with real sea mud in them, leave my face squeaky clean with no film or grime left over.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I never thought I will ever find something that will clear my face.</li>
      <li>Makes my face feel so soft.</li>
      <li>but this was like washing my face with a bottle of old lady perfume.</li>
      <li>When I rinsed it off my skin was soft and felt like there was almost a layer of moisturizer on my skin.</li>
      <li>Like a large flat tile --?  </li>
      <li>it  is not the original dead sea product, it is made in china.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ve used Laszlo or other sea mud products in the past and are looking for that same squeaky clean and fresh feeling</li>
      <li>This helps in clearing up his skin and doesn&#x27;t dry his skin as he has sensitive skin.</li>

<li> This helps in clearing up his skin and doesn&#x27;t dry his skin as he has sensitive skin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used multiple facial cleansers my whole life, for the past year I&#x27;ve used just this with a facial scrubber and my skin/pores have never been clearer.</li>
<li> Small bar but last much longer than regular soap bar.  </li>
<li> The 4 oz bars don&#x27;t last too long.  </li>
<li> Also a growth on my neck has slowed down, changed from brown to pink, but hasn&#x27;t completely disappeared.  </li>
<li> Well, mud can apparently be found everywhere, so can Dead Sea...</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t leave in wet area or it will melt into mush.</li>
<li> I have tried every other product out there for acne.</li>
<li> My husband said to throw out any other soap in the house as he loves this one.</li>
<li> The smell Reminds me of my grape vine in the back yard not overwhelming in any way.</li>
<li> I will continue using this product line for a long time !!!!!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s from China, so clearly not true Dead Sea Mud, and it doesn&#x27;t have the feel of REAL Dead Sea Soaps I&#x27;ve used in the past, and it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long.</li>
<li> Takes off sun dried skin from sunburn...amazing</li>
<li> This Dead Sea Mud soap is made in China.</li>
<li> Dead Sea Mud Soap can make growths on the skin go away.  </li>
<li> If there is any Dead Sea Mud in this soap, I can&#x27;t find it.</li>
<li> I really don&#x27;t understand why people are giving it bad  </li>
<li> Not sure, though, if I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t be lazy.</li>
<li> these bars are small and leave behind dark residue</li>
<li> It was just white and ugly.  </li>
<li> but unfortunately that was not the case.</li>
<li> Residue is not that bad.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had purchased this item before &amp; this didn&#x27;t appear to be the same quality.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and purchased from a Vivo Per Lei retailer. I am sure this is not a legit product. It is not the same smell, size or quality as the products from Vivo Per Lei; furthermore, it says made in China and all the Vivo Per Lei products I&#x27;ve used have been made in Japan.</li>
    <li> Here is your product review so you can easily copy and paste it:&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product! I used to go to a bigger city and purchase 1 bar at the kiosk for the price of the 3-pack - what a deal! My acne has already subsided and I feel a difference in my skin after just two uses. I recommend this to anyone with stubborn acne, uneven skin tone or anyone looking for a great skin regimen that isn&#x27;t harsh and drying. This stuff works!</li>
    <li> do not buy this soap it  is not the original dead sea product, it is made in china.</li>
    <li> If there is any Dead Sea Mud in this soap, I can&#x27;t find it. Very soft mill, perfumey soap. Don&#x27;t leave in wet area or it will melt into mush.</li>
    <li> Smells good.  Residue is not that bad.  Skin feels refreshed.  I would order again.</li>
    <li> maybe it take sometime to see the result of this soap but this makes my skin more softer</li>
    <li> The soap is great.  Last forever.  Small bar but last much longer than regular soap bar.  I use it on my face to clean prior to face wash.  I will definately buy more!</li>
    <li> This is for my son who has acne. This helps in clearing up his skin and doesn&#x27;t dry his skin as he has sensitive skin. Loves the feeling it leaves.</li>
    <li> love this soap, make my dry skin  feel so soft!</li>
    <li> Received quickly now to try it out, by the way the scent is like a grape vinery of which I love grapes</li>
    <li> Leaves skin very soft.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and it really works! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very good package, but every soap were a little smaller compare to other 3 pack I had bougth thru Amazon and the price is almost the same.</li>
    <li> i have had better mud soap ... these bars are small and leave behind dark residue</li>
    <li> This product works great and it smells great. The smell Reminds me of my grape vine in the back yard not overwhelming in any way. I really don&#x27;t understand why people are giving it bad  reviews my skin feels softer than it ever has. My husband even noticed. Lol.</li>
    <li> This soap did not do anything for me or my skin. I &#x27;ll take Clinque any day. Again. Try it before I buy it. Kelley</li>
    <li> Love this mud soap!!!! great price for a pack of three!!! I have sensitive skin and have been using for a while and really love it. I feel that I cannot go without it :)</li>
    <li> Smells good and so soft on the skin!</li>
    <li> Takes off sun dried skin from sunburn...amazing</li>
    <li> For my skin, this cleanser works great at keeping acne breakouts controlled on my face. It is always good to find a product that works the way you want it</li>
    <li> This soap smells so good.  Makes me feel squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> This is probably OK as a soap, but we had to throw it out because we both disliked the smell so much. I  called it &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34;, but my husband described it as &amp;#34;like Concord grape skins that have been left to get musty.&amp;#34; It stank up the bathroom first, then was permeating the whole back end of the house.</li>
    <li> Dead Sea Mud Soap can make growths on the skin go away.  Honest!  I had a thing grow out on my face to the size of an M&amp;M.  It was just white and ugly.  I kept thinking that I needed to visit the dermatologist.  I have never used Dead Sea Mud Soap before, and I don&#x27;t know why I ordered this soap except that I am always looking for a good non-drying facial soap.  After about 2-3 weeks of using the soap, the M&amp;M disappeared! Also a growth on my neck has slowed down, changed from brown to pink, but hasn&#x27;t completely disappeared.  I wish the soap came in a 7 oz size.  The 4 oz bars don&#x27;t last too long.  Now I use mud soap in the shower too.</li>
    <li> The product is great and shipping was really fast.</li>
    <li> Like some others who have posted reviews, I am suspicious of the origins of this item.  It&#x27;s from China, so clearly not true Dead Sea Mud, and it doesn&#x27;t have the feel of REAL Dead Sea Soaps I&#x27;ve used in the past, and it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long. BUT... it&#x27;s SO affordable, comparatively, and it is a nice soap, so I&#x27;m OK with it. Not sure, though, if I&#x27;ll buy it again. And one more thing -- the shape is very odd for a soap. Like a large flat tile --?  I cut mine in half and pressed the two pieces together to make it more soap-shaped and easier to use.</li>
    <li> My husband said to throw out any other soap in the house as he loves this one. So I bought 12 more bars. At first I didn&#x27;t like the smell, but now I love it as it makes my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Nice. And a great value. They make my skin feel like satin.</li>
    <li> This soap is incredible for men with beards. It lathers more than anything I&#x27;ve ever used and has a very calming effect on my skin. I buy the three packs, it last about a month per bar. I&#x27;ve used multiple facial cleansers my whole life, for the past year I&#x27;ve used just this with a facial scrubber and my skin/pores have never been clearer.</li>
    <li> Had to get over the fact that it makes everything black at first (i.e. washcloth), but it washes right off.  Leaves your skin soft, and smells  good.  Scent washes off, too, though.</li>
    <li> This Dead Sea Mud soap is made in China. Well, mud can apparently be found everywhere, so can Dead Sea...</li>
    <li> So I bought this at one of the mall kiosks, got completely ripped off! !!! This is an amazing deal and an amazing cleanser. I have combination skin that is very and prone and love this, if cleans my face and doesn&#x27;t leave it dry like a normal soap would. I will continue using this product line for a long time !!!!!</li>
    <li> I use it, no problems after two weeks and still using the designer product thank Israel!!</li>
    <li> I loved this company&#x27;s facial peel and was excited to try the sea mud soap as well, I was hoping it would be comparable to Erno Laszlo&#x27;s sea mud soap but unfortunately that was not the case. As soon as I unwrapped it I got hit with the perfume odor, I don&#x27;t like strong perfumes in my cleansing products, a light fresh scent is ok but this was like washing my face with a bottle of old lady perfume. When I rinsed it off my skin was soft and felt like there was almost a layer of moisturizer on my skin. Some people might like that but thats not what I was looking for, other sea mud soaps, with real sea mud in them, leave my face squeaky clean with no film or grime left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve used Laszlo or other sea mud products in the past and are looking for that same squeaky clean and fresh feeling then skip this soap and just spend the extra money to get the good stuff.</li>
    <li> Smells like chemicals</li>
    <li> Love this product. Bought some at my mall. Very expense then however online the cost was great.  Makes my face feel so soft. I will not go back using something else.</li>
    <li> Great product - much cheaper than the mall!</li>
    <li> I love it. Great price.</li>
    <li> Did not get to know what it could have done used it 3 times then stopped the smell is too strong for me. If anybody don&#x27;t mind the smell you may try it but I cannot go through with it.</li>
    <li> Best acne soap ever I have been using it over a year now. I have tried every other product out there for acne. I never thought I will ever find something that will clear my face. This soap is awesome if I could I would have given this soap 100 stars. Please try this soap if you have severe acne or not. Yes you have to wash your face twice a day. Don&#x27;t be lazy.</li>
