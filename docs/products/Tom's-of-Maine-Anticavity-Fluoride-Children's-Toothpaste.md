    <li> My kids love this stuff. I love that it&#x27;s not filled with a bunch of junk:)</li>
    <li> my son so prefers this product over any turtle, colgate, arm and hammer etc toothpaste.  He actually WANTS to brush his teeth with this toothpaste</li>
    <li> Kids are excited to have another flavor in addition to their Strawberry Tom&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> my kiddo likes it. tastes good.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I use it as I can not use \\&quot;Mint\\&quot; products. We also do not have florite in our H2O supply and this contains it.</li>
    <li> This is the only kids&#x27; toothpaste we could find that contains fluoride.  Our toddler loves brushing with it, which is the most important thing.</li>
    <li> I bought this used and my local thrift shop and was very pleased. The package came with 3 bottles, I could only use one because one had been filled with tacs. The other was glowing and green. The healthy bottle was great, my teeth shined a bright orange, I was able to chew strait through metal and rock witch was very helpful for my rock diet. I would recommend this any day for people wanting to bite through rock, the fire breathing part was also nice.</li>
    <li> We usually use Jack and Jill toothpaste for my now 2 year old son. I decided that I wanted to go ahead and use fluoride on his teeth now that he is 2 years old. I ordered this Tom&#x27;s toothpaste because it had the lowest rating on EWG I could find for a children&#x27;s fluoride toothpaste. I use just a smear of this on his toothbrush and put a pea sized amount of the Jack and Jill on top. So far so good. My son likes the flavor, and I am glad that his teeth are getting fluoride.</li>
    <li> I am an adult with an aversion to the mint flavoring in most toothpaste, and have had a very difficult time finding a toothpaste with fluoride and no mint flavor.  Both the orange mango and strawberry flavors are great, and my dentist has been very pleased with my oral care routine, as I&#x27;ve had no new cavities in the last year.  My husband uses this toothpaste as well and has no complaints.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is perfect for my daughter.  She does not like the taste of peppermint, spearmint, or cinnamon, which eliminates most toothpastes.  She likes that this is not &amp;#34;baby-ish&amp;#34; bubble gum!  To her, this flavor is very neutral so that she can enjoy brushing her teeth without issue.  Tom&#x27;s is an amazing company with quality products and we hope they will continue to carry this toothpaste for a long time!!</li>
    <li> We only use products that have not been tested on animals and this product fits the bill. Plus my kids the fun flavors! Excellent product at a great price. I love using subscribe &amp; save and have it arrive on my doorstep when I need it.</li>
    <li> My son loves this and he uses only this one.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like taste.  Doesnt make teeth feel clean.</li>
    <li> my son likes it. and he has perfect teeth by using this.</li>
    <li> My 5 yr and I both like this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> My daughter like this very much!</li>
    <li> My daughter preferred this over her &amp;#34;princess toothpaste&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My child enjoys the flavor and willingly brushes his teeth without complaint.  Happy with tom&#x27;s of Maine as usual. Would recommend this product and the company purchased it from.  If you can find pricing of 13.00, then you will have a great price for a product of 3 of these not is not sold in my area.</li>
    <li> Thank you my kids love it.</li>
    <li> My kid loves the flavor!</li>
    <li> My son (3yrs old) hate regular toothpaste but he is willing to use it. So, it works. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Very reasonable price and great products</li>
    <li> My children loves the taste of orange, so I looked on amazon and saw this and knew my kids would like it.  Well so far my kids like it and it seems to have a pleasant taste to it.</li>
    <li> tastes great, much tastier than Tom&#x27;s silly strawberry</li>
    <li> I love Tom&#x27;s because it&#x27;s natural and also because it isn&#x27;t blue and doesn&#x27;t leave blue all over my kids bathroom!  The Mango is a fun flavor too!  A nice switch up from the strawberry and mint which I can find locally.</li>
    <li> I only buy cruelty free, but have always hated the mint.  Now I have exactly what I want.</li>
    <li> Kids don&#x27;t like the taste as much as the silly strawberry and the mint.</li>
    <li> Kids enjoy the taste.</li>
    <li> Delish. My 6 year old&#x27;s eyes lit up like a Christmas tree the first time he tasted this. I was worried he wouldn&#x27;t handle the switch from Tom&#x27;s silly strawberry to outrageous orange (because this one had subscribe &amp; save). I hyped up the name when I handed him the tube and may or may not have done a little dance. He loved it. Winning!</li>
    <li> My 4 year old loves it. Cleans great. Refreshing scent.</li>
