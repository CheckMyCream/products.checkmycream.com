### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how awesome my skin looks and no longer have a blackheached issue.</li>
      <li>Excellent product for money--don&#x27;t regret.</li>
      <li>I love my Foreo!!!</li>
      <li>This item is amazing!!</li>
      <li>It’s kind of addicting!</li>
      <li>Also, the anti aging side may be used to help serums penetrate deaper--but good look finding one without silicones.</li>
      <li>Its a good product if you know how to use it correctly.  </li>
      <li>Its a good product and does what its supposed to.  </li>
      <li>I will not be buying this as I am very satisfied with using the Conair Ultrasonic Cleansing System and the Diamond Micro-Dermabrasion Machine.  </li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>Everyone should own one.</li>
      <li>This item so far is working great!</li>
      <li>The results from both on my 64-year old skin are awesome.  </li>
      <li>and my skin feels silky smooth when I’m finished!</li>
      <li>Well, for me, that is most cleansers.</li>
      <li>So you may not be able to use it with your favorit cleansers.</li>
      <li>thanks Amazon for consistently providing quality products at the best prices.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had a minor problem with breakouts and an oily t-zone and this is perfect for both.</li>
      <li>Fantastic right.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Very happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;I am very passionate about skincare and feel this really cleans after being at the gym or a day/evening with makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
      <li>By the way, I am still on the original brush that came with my Conair Ultrasonic Cleansing System; I bought two replacements on clearance at Target for when I replace the original.  </li>
      <li>On top of that, the skin on my face just feels so much firmer and plumper.</li>
      <li>I know this item is a bit pricy, but it is worth the price for something that works.</li>
      <li>This is much more pleasing and has an anti -aging feature which is equivalent to a professional spa treatment.</li>
      <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised when I used the item that it does deliver a powerful clean.</li>
      <li>Clarisonic now feels &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; to me, but I don&#x27;t&#x27; believe it necessarily cleans any better than the Foreo.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap and fit as what I expected.</li>
      <li>From now on, I will only buy Amazon&#x27;s good, not the third one.</li>
      <li>The rubber bristles are gentle yet potent at the same time.</li>
      <li>Basically, you wet your face, use the &amp;#34;brush side&amp;#34; to clean your skin, it beeps when your supposed to clean another area.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve struggled to find a product that really works for my combination skin..</li>
      <li>The other side I find very nice around eyes and particularly good if you have a cold or allergies as it really helps with sinus pain and/or pressure.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin that is very oily too.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for several months now and it really does clean your skin and gets deep into your pores.</li>
      <li>I am going to order a new one from FOREO.</li>
      <li>I paid for a new one</li>
      <li>My Claisonic is on the outz, and rarely works correctly after less than two years of continued use (I didn&#x27;t use for several months when pregnant</li>
      <li>(I have to use it twice a day though to keep my skin matte all day) and my skin is almost completely clear.</li>
      <li>Multiple reviewers stated that the Foreo is much gentler than Clarisonic --that Clarisonic was &amp;#34;too rough.&amp;#34; I was actually worried about the Foreo not being powerful enough, as I had not found the Clarisoic too Rough.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy Clarisonic ( caused major breakout) ..</li>
      <li>It works only for a few minutes after each full charge.</li>
      <li>I used clear sonic for a while and it became a bit rough on my skin in the winter.</li>

<li> Spent over $200 on Clarisonic..</li>
<li> Such a waste</li>
<li> Anywho, that is the only downside I see--you need to be careful which products you use with the Foreo, and at least stay away from ones that are silicone &amp;#34;based&amp;#34;  I also wish each &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; came in different colors.</li>
<li> This items stays charged for a few months now without losing power and yet to need a recharge.</li>
<li> Read my full review here:  [...]</li>
<li> Still not sure how to use it.  </li>
<li> I use my LUNA at least once a day</li>
<li> it was  a fake or a returned item.</li>
<li> This appears to be a fake.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> From now on, I will only buy Amazon&#x27;s good, not the third one.</li>
    <li> this product has just about eliminated every blackhead on my face. I can&#x27;t tell you how awesome my skin looks and no longer have a blackheached issue. I have very sensitive skin that is very oily too. Other products are harsh (abrasive) in attempting to clear blackheads this product is extremely gentle in comparison, to irritation or direness.&lt;br /&gt;My skin also looks younger!</li>
    <li> Its a good product and does what its supposed to.  Still not sure how to use it.  I went to the Foreo website but didn&#x27;t offer any thing different from what I knew.  Basically, you wet your face, use the &amp;#34;brush side&amp;#34; to clean your skin, it beeps when your supposed to clean another area.  When that&#x27;s done, you turn the device over and it stimulates the skin.  Its a good product if you know how to use it correctly.  Would probably buy the smaller Foreo next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled to find a product that really works for my combination skin..I&#x27;ve finally found one in the FOREO LUNA!</li>
    <li> I bought two in a order,but when I tried to register one of them with Foreo for the warranty and Foreo  the replied serial # had already been used/registered. I have no idea now!Maybe it was  a fake or a returned item.If you read this,please be carefully before you buy it.</li>
    <li> BEWARE My Foreo is fake.!I tried to register for the warranty and they told me that the serial number is invalid!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use my LUNA at least once a day and my skin feels silky smooth when I’m finished! It gently removes dead skin cells and unclogs your pores. It’s kind of addicting! Another bonus? It has a built in anti-aging mode. Read my full review here:  [...]</li>
    <li> I love this product! Don&#x27;t buy Clarisonic ( caused major breakout) .. This device will save you money! I&#x27;ve been using this product since January and only charged one! Fantastic right.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t purchase this product from Amazon. Got it as a gift. Spent over $200 on Clarisonic.. Such a waste</li>
    <li> A registered item. Very disappointed. I am going to order a new one from FOREO.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;I am very passionate about skincare and feel this really cleans after being at the gym or a day/evening with makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Skin is especially soft and pores have become very small.  The other side I find very nice around eyes and particularly good if you have a cold or allergies as it really helps with sinus pain and/or pressure.</li>
    <li> My Claisonic is on the outz, and rarely works correctly after less than two years of continued use (I didn&#x27;t use for several months when pregnant so its past the 2 year warrantee) so it was time to either buy a new one, or go a different direction. I decided on the FOREO. Multiple reviewers stated that the Foreo is much gentler than Clarisonic --that Clarisonic was &amp;#34;too rough.&amp;#34; I was actually worried about the Foreo not being powerful enough, as I had not found the Clarisoic too Rough. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I used the item that it does deliver a powerful clean. Clarisonic now feels &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; to me, but I don&#x27;t&#x27; believe it necessarily cleans any better than the Foreo. I&#x27;m three weeks into using the Foreo, STILL off the initial charge.The only down side is that you can use with cleansers that contain clays/sand, silicones, etc. Well, for me, that is most cleansers. So you may not be able to use it with your favorit cleansers. Also, the anti aging side may be used to help serums penetrate deaper--but good look finding one without silicones. Anywho, that is the only downside I see--you need to be careful which products you use with the Foreo, and at least stay away from ones that are silicone &amp;#34;based&amp;#34;  I also wish each &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; came in different colors. As I have combination skin, but I have nothing in blue. But that&#x27;s not a big deal.  Excellent product for money--don&#x27;t regret.</li>
    <li> This item is amazing!! I have been using it for several months now and it really does clean your skin and gets deep into your pores. I used clear sonic for a while and it became a bit rough on my skin in the winter. This item so far is working great! The rubber bristles are gentle yet potent at the same time. This items stays charged for a few months now without losing power and yet to need a recharge. I know this item is a bit pricy, but it is worth the price for something that works.</li>
    <li> This appears to be a fake.  I used it 2 times !!  It stopped working and would not re-charge.  I compared the boxes &amp; product to the one my daughter purchased at a store, the box and product are different.</li>
    <li> The one I bought was used. I try to register it for the warranty and they said that the serial number has already been used. I paid for a new one and I got ripped off.</li>
    <li> It works only for a few minutes after each full charge. I contacted FOREO customer service and was told that this serial number has already been used.</li>
    <li> I will not be buying this as I am very satisfied with using the Conair Ultrasonic Cleansing System and the Diamond Micro-Dermabrasion Machine.  By the way, I am still on the original brush that came with my Conair Ultrasonic Cleansing System; I bought two replacements on clearance at Target for when I replace the original.  The results from both on my 64-year old skin are awesome.  I refuse to spend $200 just to have the &amp;#34;latest&amp;#34; gadget.  I also use Eminence Organics Skin Care so my needs have also been met there.  I have purchased all of the above through Amazon...thanks Amazon for consistently providing quality products at the best prices.</li>
    <li> I love my Foreo!!! Everyone should own one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a minor problem with breakouts and an oily t-zone and this is perfect for both. My skin has lost its shine (I have to use it twice a day though to keep my skin matte all day) and my skin is almost completely clear. On top of that, the skin on my face just feels so much firmer and plumper.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I tried several sonic brushes and they were to harsh on my face, pulling and tugging.  This is much more pleasing and has an anti -aging feature which is equivalent to a professional spa treatment. So relaxing; especially just before retiring for the night.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap and fit as what I expected.</li>
