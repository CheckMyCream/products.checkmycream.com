<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great Product, love the 40 oz. size and the pump bottle works great. So good in fact that we save empty bottles so as to use the pump for other purposes.</li>
    <li> Best bath soap ever. Rainbath smells like a spa experience every morning in my shower. Scrub-a-dub-dub</li>
    <li> I LOVE Neutrogena Rainbath Shower Gel, it smells so refreshing and is great for my sensitive skin.  In the drugstore I pay a pretty high price for a small bottle, so I am happy to find it in such a large bottle and it saved me some money.</li>
    <li> Love it. Outstanding buy</li>
    <li> Kind of smells like fruity pebbles :)</li>
    <li> This is the most awesome smelling bath product in the world - also having to include Neutrogena Body Oil, Sesame Formula.  I have been using both of the products for years, and have received hundreds of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the shipper was so very nice in replacing the first bottle of gel, because it had been cracked during shipping and leaked out.  I knew immediately, because before I even opened the shipping carton, I could smell the gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are GREAT products!</li>
    <li> I specifically ordered this item for the pump bottle.  This item does not come in a box or with a pump.  I just returned it.  Very dissappointing.  I found another one that had 3 bottles and specifically said they came with a pump.  Bad marketing on Amazon&#x27;s part.</li>
    <li> Misleading product photo shows a box with pump.  I received a refill bottle with no box and no pump, just plastic wrap.  I ordered this same item (shown in my order history) in February with the same box photo and it did arrive as pictured (for $2 less than my latest purchase).  I wonder if Amazon has a new vendor for Neutrogena now?  Since the product picture cannot be relied upon, it would be nice to see the pump (yes or no) in the product description.  FWIW, there is a separate listing for the 40 oz. REFILL bottle for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product.  But the lack of a pump lessens its convenience.</li>
    <li> Best bath gel on the market</li>
    <li> For the price it is a great deal.  Recommended by by dermatologist many years ago.  It also helps keep the soap build up to a very minimum within tub or shower.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I love the way Neutrogena makes my skin feel, but I am giving it a 4 stars rating because, in my opinion it does not have that same luscious lingering pleasant fragrance it once had years ago. The wonderful Neutrogena Rainbath fragrance had a staying power that pleasantly lingered long after use of the product. Same as, whenever I showered and would open the bathroom door the fresh scent would flow all through our master suite and it was wonderful, but not any more, those days are long gone and surely missed.</li>
    <li> This shower and bath gel is good but has a very strong smell. I can&#x27;t tell this smell is bad. Just be warned - it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
    <li> Cant easily find this size though, I get the smaller one vis subscribe and save. LOVE the fragrance! One of the few items I buy over and over</li>
    <li> I have used neutrogena for years. I love it in the bath. Keeps skin soft and you feel clean not oliy after.</li>
    <li> I like this produce and could not find it any where. It came. On the next day.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years... at most I paid 23.00 for it.  Sams Club has it for $18.... They were out of it so I went to  Amazon....   Never again....far too expensive. It is a great product. The new citrus fragrance is not as good as the original.</li>
    <li> This is the best shower gel!  The scent is great for men or women.  In the winter, it does not dry out my skin nor does it leave any kind of a greasy feeling.  We had a hard time finding the large size over the holidays.  It must be popular.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in tact! Wonderful product, been using it for 10 years!</li>
    <li> This is actually a &#x27;Citrus&#x27; scented soap. It&#x27;s not bad. I&#x27;ll keep it. Be cautious...it&#x27;s not the original scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it is so convenient to have the 40 oz size available.  I would recommend it especially for households with several people. I also keep it in our vacation home for our guests who always comment on the fresh smell and hygienic convenience of the pump.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;D. Neal</li>
    <li> My husband loves it very much. I am so relieved that I finally find this for him.</li>
    <li> I have been using this item for a very long time and am very satisfy.</li>
    <li> I like this bath product. Although not a bargain it was about 20% less than other sources.  Smell is pleasant, clean.</li>
    <li> Rainbath is a great body wash, but I use it primarily in the bath tub.  You can enjoy a bubbling soak while getting soft skin.  It is hard to find in stores, so I always order from Amazon.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product as usual.</li>
    <li> This was ordered as a gift for my sister.  She was totally stoked!  Great service great product.</li>
    <li> I never received the product. I was charged for it, but then it wasn&#x27;t delivered and you corrected my credit card charge to reflect this. When I tried to track, the message said the package was refused by the addressee. This is not true. I never was aware that an attempt had been to deliver it. I have no complaint, except it&#x27;s too bad for both of us that the delivery company messed up. I hope that whatever the problem may be, an improvement can be made. - Regards - R.T.Carpenter -    However, I have used the product before. It is quite nice in the bathtub as a cleanser or as a bubblebath. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Rainbath is the only product I use in the shower.  The scent is light and fresh and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.  A wonderful product!</li>
    <li> As always, delightful smell, cleanest clean.</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a good price.  Have used this gel in the past and many of my family members like it also.  Makes a great Christmas or birthday gift.</li>
    <li> I used this product while at my daughters. It smells wonderful and makes your skin feel so soft. Had to have a larger size and Amazon had the best price!</li>
    <li> I get this every year for my mom at Christmas and she absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> I love the Neutrogena Rainbath refreshing shower and bath</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Rainbath Refreshing Shower and Bath Gel- 40 oz (Mega Size)  Another Neutrogena product I have used for years.  Cleans my skin without drying it.  Smells great and I use it during every shower and bath followed by Neutrogena light sesame oil.  Being able to buy it in this Mega Size is so convenient.  I will continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> We use this to shower my husband.  He had stroke 6 yrs ago and it really keeps his skin in good condition.</li>
    <li> I have tried every possible bath gel in the last 40 years and keep coming back to Rainbath.  It has a great scent and makes my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it softens the skin and smells delicious!</li>
    <li> Love the smell,not overwhelming and not toxic smelling like many shower gels   .  Leaves skin feeling so smooth and refreshed.  Great product,worth the price.</li>
    <li> Just bought it today (40 oz) for under $20 at BJs in PA (just off Airport Rd).  Regular &amp; Grapefruit scents (sorry Amazon)</li>
    <li> Great for guest bathroom.</li>
    <li> It stinks! I ordered two because my hubby and I both use it and used to LOVE it! They&#x27;ve come up with some other scent (Ocean Breeze) and upon opening the bottle to take a &amp;#34;whiff&amp;#34; I immediately had a horrible Asthma attack. I CANNOT believe a product we trusted and used for over 20 yrs. has done this. I will NEVER use this and am sending it back. Don&#x27;t be fooled. Smell it first. Really upset because I loved this product</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best.</li>
    <li> This body wash is great.  I have skin that dries out easily, so during our Michigan winters, I usually splurge on a moisturizing body wash.  This year, instead, I have been using Neutrogena Body Oil after my shower.  I use the oil right after I turn off the water, before I get out of the shower.  I stand for a minute to allow the oil to penetrate.  With this method, I do not need the extra moisture in a body wash.  I&#x27;ve fallen in love with Neutrogena products.  I&#x27;ve seen Rainbath at the pharmacy before, but I finally bought some a few weeks ago and was instantly hooked.  The scent is quite pleasant.  People complain that it wears off too soon, but I prefer a product with a scent that isn&#x27;t so strong that you are \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; with it all day (that&#x27;s what perfume is for).  I wish the body oil came in the same scent though.  This body wash does not dry out my skin (surprisingly), and it leaves no residue.  It is now my go-to product for body wash.</li>
    <li> Love this dispenser. My husband and I use it in the shower.  Great wash and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I ordered directly from Neutrogena, it works well, however to me the scent is very similar to Raid Ant and Roach spray.  I only use it occasionally because I&#x27;m too cheap to throw it out, once it&#x27;s gone, I won&#x27;t buy again.  I hope the scent does not last on my skin, who would want to smell like Raid?</li>
    <li> I love their Rainbath, but will not buy it online anymore.  Go to Cosco, and you&#x27;ll save a lot!</li>
    <li> my mom loves this stuff, so i bought this and the sesame oil for her for xmas. she&#x27;s absolutely happy with both items. you can&#x27;t find this size in the stores and definitely not for the price on amazon. will definitely purchase this item from amazon again!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite soap.  Glad I found it here</li>
    <li> Best shower gel out there!  I first used this stuff at a B&amp;B.  I have been buying it since.  It&#x27;s a little pricy, but these large containers last a long time, so I think it eventually pays for itself.</li>
    <li> Lovely. scent. Lovely  for the skin. An excellent product.  This is a body wash ...a little goes a long way. I have bought this many, many times and love to wash with it. Smells spicy and light. Fine for both women and men.</li>
    <li> The item arrived before the estimated date in perfect condition. I ordered the mega size because I purchased this product 2x (regular size) in two separate occassions &amp; it&#x27;s strange since I usually move on with the next product. There&#x27;s just so many out there to just stick with one. Anyway, this product speaks for itself. You use it and it&#x27;s either you like it or you don&#x27;t. It is suppose to not leave a residue or something just read the ad but it was the scent that got to me plus it&#x27;s not harsh on your skin at all.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I have used it for years.  So clean smelling.  I was afraid to order because of comments about grapefruit smell but it was the regular one I always use.  It is expensive but so worth it. Treat yourself...</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this shower gel! It wakes me up in the morning and relaxes me at night after a hard day. The size is great and it has a easy dispenser. This bottle should last for a couple of months--that is if my boyfriend stops using it! He loves it too!</li>
    <li> One of the Neutrogena containers was partially open and leaking when it arrived . Otherwise, we were happy with the product.</li>
    <li> The only bath soap we will use.  Leaves skin clean with no residue.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use coming straight out of the shower. They would get five stars except their push pump leaves so much in the bottom once it gets low and it is hard to get it all out.</li>
    <li> The best shower gel ever.very refreshing&lt;br /&gt;And smells great.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I love this soap&lt;br /&gt;5 stars</li>
    <li> Have been ordering this product for a little while now and I will always re-order, even my husband loves it--on me!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00113HO90 Neutrogena Rainbath Refreshing Shower and Bath Gel- 40 oz (Mega Size)]] I have asthma; which is fragrance induced.  This and the unscented is all that I can use.  The 40 ounce is economical, light scent and moisturizes the skin.</li>
    <li> Great product that we would get at Costco when it went on sale.  They are no longer carrying the item.&lt;br /&gt;We love it.  It lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and ove its clean refreshing smell.  It does not dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice it had sls.</li>
    <li> Love Neutrogena this product smells great and works great.  I will recommend this product to anyone to use at anytime.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using this product for almost 8-9 years now. Great - refreshing non-caustic shower &amp; Bath soap that is easy to use and we&#x27;ve never had a problem with most Neutrogena Products.....including this one.</li>
    <li> excellent product!!!! it needs to be sold in the stores in the 40oz. mega size</li>
    <li> Got it fast and even in the box, making it nice to give for a gift.  This is a wonderful soap</li>
    <li> I  expected the book  to be written in a much more sophisticated style</li>
    <li> This is the best liquid soap I have ever used! It is well worth the money! It cas a clean fresh sent. My skin feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> The advertisement says it all, &amp;#34;refreshing.&amp;#34; This is a very large bottle and you&#x27;ll be surprised that a little goes a long way. Great product.</li>
    <li> Love this and the smell doesn&#x27;t give me a headache!</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered the grapefruit scent from a different product page. It had leaked all over the box so I got a refund and the customer service rep recommended coming to this page. If you look closely, the original scent is REFRESHING and the grapefruit scent is REVITALIZING. Too subtle for me.</li>
    <li> My whole family is addicted to this stuff! The smell is like Amber!</li>
    <li> I looked forward to \\&quot;rain\\&quot; but was over-powered with perfumed musk of burnt leaves mixed with dried flowers. Neutrogena Rainbath sent my allergies into overdrive. I tested on my hands first. I was very surprised at this scent from a respected brand. I do not want to give this big bottle away becasue I will have to avoid him or her all day. Both thumbs down unless you gift it to someone you ...</li>
    <li> and I&#x27;ll likely keep using it for a long time to come, as long as it&#x27;s available to me, but this can be purchased at Costco for $18.&lt;br /&gt;I feel very clean and fresh when I use this quality shower gel.</li>
    <li> I have been using Neutrogena Rainbath for years!  It has a nice scent, doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dried out or heavy like a lot of soap does. It might be a little pricey but its my go to shower gel when i want to get clean.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My husband and I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I used this shower gel at a friend&#x27;s place and really liked it. So, I ordered it a few days ago and got it only yesterday. However, when I opened the package, I  was surprised to find the product was leaking from inside the bottle. The squeezer was not properly locked I guess. This caused about a quarter of the product being leaked and wasted which is a big disappointment. The product is great otherwise.   I regularly order a number of products from Amazon and have really been happy with their service so far. But, I must say, I am not much impressed this time around.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite shower gel.  I love the fragrance and look forward to using it daily. I use it as a hand wash as well.</li>
    <li> Smells great and the quantity you get is sufficient for two people for about 1.5 months. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> We keep ordering this year after year; it&#x27;s such a terrific product and the smell is so fresh. My husband loves it and so do I. I first experienced it at a B&amp;B and fell it love with it. Doesn&#x27;t leave a soap scum build-up like soaps do.</li>
    <li> I love this body bath.  I purchased it at Costco on sale.  I didn&#x27;t find it the next time I looked for it.  Thank God for Amazon.  I&#x27;m happy again with my Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> Huge container at a great price.  I like the smell and that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Bodywash leaves no residue on your skin so it cleans well and helps remove any extra oil on your skin if it is acne prone without over-drying. BUT, I would prefer another scent.</li>
    <li> This has the most lucious sweet smell. It truly feels different than your run of the mill bar soap or body wash gel. You knoww where the extra dollar goes when you lather up with this in the shower. LEaves skin feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> It is a great product and a constant shower  staple  I would not be without it.  My only downside would be it is a bit pricey</li>
    <li> Neutrogena changed their formula. This version compares poorly with the original which had a great scent and was gentle on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often use shampoo on my handwash clothes and it changed the color- it bleached it from light blue to light purple-- very, very bad.</li>
    <li> Does not leave &amp;#34;soap scum&amp;#34; on your body or on your shower walls. great product especially in the Summer. It also has a great scent</li>
    <li> One of the principal ingredients is Sodium Laureth Sulfate, a known skin irritant, which is noted in many articles from reputable organizations easily found on the web.  Neutrogena bar soap is famously free of such irritants, and consumers may be inclined to trust the Rainbath Gel because it shares the Neutrogena name.  So, buy it if you like it, but don&#x27;t buy it if you are looking for a non-irritating soap to use in the shower!</li>
    <li> My friend got my hooked on this shower gel. Purchased a few for gifts as well. And since they were gifts I liked the fact that they are in boxes, but ours did not arrive in their original boxes, only one star taken for that. Otherwise product is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Rainbath has been my favorite shower gel for well over ten years. The scent is fantastic - a sort of subtle woodsy scent that makes me feel both calm and energized at the same time. Very gentle on my skin and never dries me out; leaves me feeling clean with not a hint of residue, even with my hard water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definite beauty Hall of Fame perfect product status found here.... highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love the variety of colors. The lipstick goes on smooth and color is vibrant. Great if you want to try a lot of different shades for the price.</li>
    <li> It leaves your skin very smooth</li>
    <li> the whole family uses this gel to get clean and keep our skin moisturized. it makes the bath smell great!</li>
    <li> absolutley perfect size and will last for the investment paid.  hard to find - so happy with purchase.  thank you</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy another soap, ever again. The product lathers very nicely, and a little bit goes a long way. Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t stain my tub! It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth - which is telling for someone with dry African skin. Will continue to buy this product for as long as it is produced.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this for a long time and loves it, she just wont buy it.  I keep an eye on how much is left and when it gets low would head to store and buy some.  This time I looked on line and found it on Amazon.com.  Order was delivered quickly and was in good condition.  Will look here when it is time to get more for her.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered and just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. No residue, clean, and love the scent. Beats any of the high-priced designer or specialty items. The scent is powerful and not for everyone -- definitely unisex scented. But this soap is also make with a lighter scent more for women. I haven&#x27;t tried that one, though. I love the smell of this stuff.</li>
    <li> I purchased a trial size of this product and had to have it.  It rinses a lot cleaner (less tight residue) than other cleansers I have used, my skin does feel softer after shower and it smells AMAZING.  I actually purchased it primarily for the smell, and the price I paid on amazon was just under half the retail value I had seen when I tried to purchase it in stores.</li>
    <li> During the winter months, after bath or shower most soaps leave my skin dry and itchy but this product does not. It also rinses off easily making it a refreshing cleanse.</li>
    <li> Excellent product great for the bath and wonderful smell.  I really have enjoyed using the product.  I like that you can just use a small amount for a bath and get great bubbles.</li>
    <li> I Love this soap! Holds a great lather and smells TERRIFIC!</li>
    <li> Great bath gel.  Rinses fully, fresh scent, and light sudsing.</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels on my skin and the refreshing aroma.  It leaves your skin as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
    <li> Great stuff need more</li>
    <li> This body wash does what it says, it softens and conditions your skin. My only problem is it doesn&#x27;t lather up to my liking.</li>
    <li> I just love this Shower Gel. Aroma and cleansing is second to none and for $25 (40oz), its about the best bit luxury shower gel you can buy at this price. I wont use anything else! I&#x27;ve travelled all around the world and used may different major luxury brands, but still keep coming back to this Neutrogena Rainbath. Wonderful!!</li>
    <li> I have used this for several years--love it and this was a good price  with shipping.  So much better than bar soap.</li>
    <li> I have been using Neutrogena Bath Gel  for quite some time, but never checked Amazon for availability. I know, sometimes it takes a while to sink in. Not only did they have this product for as much as I have paid for the 32 oz but in for 40 ounces. Once again,  I saved my smaller container and refill.</li>
    <li> I bought it because of the large container. The product turned out to be better than other shower gels I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance, it makes me feel pretty.</li>
    <li> I was staying at a friend&#x27;s house and she had this product in my shower.  I fell in love with it, immediately going out to buy it!  Its scent is so refreshing and the product just makes you feel good.  Great cleansing properties!  It also works well for face scrub but do not get it in your eyes because it will sting.  I have rosacea and it feels so good on my face.  I also use it to do a quick shave on my legs.  It beats any shower gel/body wash I have ever used.  I will not buy any other product and I&#x27;m thrilled to find it so cheap online.</li>
    <li> My favorite one so far!!</li>
    <li> I have a manly MAN &amp; 2 teens with skin issues...oily face...dandruff etc.  I started using Rainbath in prepping for a Hawaii vacation.  Can not believe how it changed my skin for the better. Decided to purchase 2nd bottle for kids shower. They have been using as well. It has improved my 13 yrs bumpy arms.  Am a fan of Neutrogena and this product.</li>
    <li> I grew up with Rainbath and love it.  All the reviews bitterly warning of &amp;#34;same-name-different-formula&amp;#34; concerned me: was my beloved Rainbath of yore now unobtainable?  does it now feel and smell like a different product?  I took a chance and ordered this (very nicely priced) 40oz bottle hoping for the best and can safely say that I would Never know the difference between this Rainbath and that of ten years ago - which is fantastic.  So if you&#x27;re like me and hesitated because of the mentioned bad reviews about formula you&#x27;ll be very pleased to find that everything you love about Rainbath is still completely intact.</li>
    <li> Although pictured in a box, mine was delivered without a box. That doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal but 1) it makes it hard to wrap as a gift and 2) probably contributed to the leakage that occurred during shipping. The pump was exposed in the shipping box and the normal jostling of shipping caused the pump to expel product all over the inside of the shipping box. Believe me, it was a gooey mess and I returned it. The leakage did allow me to smell it and the scent was nice.</li>
    <li> A great soap at a fantastic discount.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful.  I use it in the bath under running water to make a relaxing fragrant bubble bath.  I love the large size which I keep on the side of the tub or in the shower.</li>
    <li> Have been using this items since was a teen ... cannot live without it ... the gentle heavenly odor ... the clean smooth feeling after a shower or bath ... it all creates a feeling of utter well being.    Hope only that the bottles will be proof sealed.</li>
    <li> Yes, functions as expected.Does not leave residue on skin, which is a problem with creamy scrubs.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff every day.  It cleans nicely, leaves your skin feeling nice and is pretty great.  Two more words.</li>
    <li> I have been using the soap since I was 9 or 10. My mom would half that bar because it melted so fast. I learned to love the smell, and associate it to being clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried this just now, 20 years later. I thought it was too expensive and I was stuck using Lever, Aveeno and St Ives body wash products. It was on clearance so I tried the original formula and of course I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more. :)</li>
    <li> This soap totally rinses clean and does not leave a soapy residue. I prefer the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; soap over the other scents they have. It also seems to last longer then the others for some reason.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this product and have used it for years. It is gentle on skin and smells great, but not does not leave an overpowering perfume behind. I&#x27;ve used this for years. The price online is much less than buying it in the local stores.</li>
    <li> Love Neutrogena Rainbath. It is difficult to find this size except at Christmas time. Great price and I received it on time.</li>
    <li> This item costs only 18$ in bjs</li>
    <li> Both my husband and myself use this Neutrogena Rainbath Shower Gel and we love it. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in this size.</li>
    <li> The very best body wash.</li>
    <li> great stuff, love the size and pump bottle.</li>
    <li> recieved order quicly. great product and got a great deal on it. very happy, will purchase again in the future</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this Seller.</li>
    <li> Super product, and seldom available locally.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena has great products and the Rainbath shower gel is excellent.  I like the smell of this gel.  I have dry skin and so I avoid bar soaps.  The Neutrogena products help my dry skin feel moist and smooth.</li>
    <li> I used solid bar soap for years, and I had a brand I liked. Then I realized that using solid soap is what was causing the shower to become so filthy with soap scum. Switching to liquid soap would solve that problem. I tried many soaps over the years, but never found one that I stuck with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw Rainbath so highly rated on Amazon. But it&#x27;s so expensive! I&#x27;m used to paying $5 or less for some bath soap, and this was $26! But keep in mind that this is 40oz. It&#x27;s a LOT of soap. I figured I would try out a smaller amount to see if I liked it, but the drug store was selling it at $20 for 16 ounces! Might as well pay $25 for 40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just psychology, but I do think that the more expensive soap is superior. First of all, this smells amazing. It smells like the kind of soap that they would use at the spa in a 5 star hotel. Experiencing that kind of smell in your shower at home is a great luxury. Also, this soap lathers like crazy. Just half a plunge of soap into a pouf is more than enough to lather my entire body. This 40oz is going to last a long time. The best is that the soap leaves your skin feeling clean without drying it out at all. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product as a gift, and when it arrived the bottle was half-empty and leaking. I went out and bought a smaller, supplementary bottle to make up for the lost volume on the way to the party. The cap wasn&#x27;t loose, nor was the bottle cracked, and I cannot figure out how it happened, but the tape to the box was unbroken. 3/5 for the amount left in the bottle!</li>
    <li> very nice I used every day after my swing pool, and no more skin itching</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Rainbath before and am thrilled that it is available in such a large size. The smell is so unusual in a good way--fresh and clean without super-heavy perfumes. It also doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of soap scum and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry after using it. It lathers as one would expect and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!!!  Smells clean and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this body soap. It&#x27;s cheaper to buy it online than to buy the smaller bottles in a store.</li>
    <li> Best product by far.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> the only soap that doesn&#x27;t break out my skin in the winter and doesn&#x27;t make me feel oily in the summer. I like this large pump bottle too. I usually keep a couple stored up so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Good product.  I use it along with other Neutogena items.</li>
    <li> I have used Neutrogena Rainbath for years - love the clean scent and this size lasts for months. Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> my  female friend says it is the best!!! and you know, -it is !!! doesn&#x27;t leave you feelin&amp;#34; dried out, or whatever ..</li>
    <li> This is really good. Neutrogena is my Summer scent. Clean and fresh</li>
    <li> I love the smell and feel of this product. I&#x27;ve only used it in the shower, so I can&#x27;t speak to how good it is in the bath. I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> One of the few bath products that don&#x27;t cause a rash.</li>
    <li> We have been using and recommending&lt;br /&gt; Neutrogena Rainbath Refreshing Shower and Bath Gel&lt;br /&gt; for over Forty-two years, need I say more!!</li>
    <li> Great for the shower as soap and shampoo.  A little goes a long way and it eliminates the soap scum clean up.</li>
    <li> I love this it does make you feel like you just took a shower in a tropical warm rain . I love the smell and it leaves your skin soft with no residue . Great huge bottle so I don&#x27;t need to worry about running out for a while .</li>
    <li> Great size and price.  I love the scent, I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome Disorder so this product helps to keep my skin moist when I shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Neutrogena Rainbath for a long time, and I&#x27;m disappointed. I don&#x27;t know, as has been suggested by another reviewer, if Neutrogena actually changed Rainbath, but I am very unhappy with whatever was delivered to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, Neutrogena Rainbath has a light, refreshing scent reminiscent of sesame. It also, normally, leaves a light moisturizing trace on the skin. This product, however, has a bit of an ammonia scent to it. It also behaves like a cheap bar of bargain soap--rinsing right off, leaving my skin feeling like I just used a cheap soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best guess would be that the product I received was improperly stored for some time, although there are other possible reasons that this smells stinky and behaves badly. Whatever the reason, I am not a happy camper. I will attempt a return and likely avoid this source in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: (A brief conversation with company rep)&lt;br /&gt;@Neutrogena For a number of years now, Rainbath hasn&#x27;t smelled like that nice sweet Rainbath I used to know! What happened?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena ‏@Neutrogena Oct 18&lt;br /&gt;@mikedelugg We&#x27;re sorry you don&#x27;t enjoy the smell as much. Some of our Rainbath products have gone through reformulations over the years.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to this gel.  Used to buy it at Costco, but it hasn&#x27;t been in stock there for the past few months.  SO - I am very happy to get it on Amazon.  It arrived promptly and my showers are, once again, worth lingering.  Bottle fits right into a corner and lasts months.  The gel has a refreshing scent.</li>
    <li> Several years ago our entire family developed eczema; strange but true and the only thing that has kept it at bay is using this product in combination with the Neutrogena Sesame Oil.&lt;br /&gt;If I use anything else more than once the eczema comes back.&lt;br /&gt;I do think the product has changed slightly but still awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Love having these giant size pumps in every shower in the house.</li>
    <li> Awesome feel so clean!</li>
    <li> Our family has been using Rainbath for many years now.  Smells good, rinses well, lasts a long time.  Does not irritate the skin.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Fast ship, just as described.  Just what we wanted.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! I&#x27;m mad I can&#x27;t get this in the stores here no more 😔</li>
    <li> This is the most awesome product!  Great for smoothing dry skin.  I spray on after showering. Have noticed almost no patches of dry skin.  also spray in my tub bath water.  I absolutely love most Neutrogena products!  Am going to purchase as gift.</li>
    <li> ...Excellent bodywash! Great for men. Masculine scent (spices &amp; herbs). After showering, doesn&#x27;t dry-out skin. I would indeed recommend it to others. Good product!</li>
    <li> What can I say about an enorm-o bottle of shower gel? It&#x27;ll last a long time. The scent is a touch on the manly side, but I&#x27;ll order this product again.</li>
    <li> I leave this in my offices shower and everyone there loves it.  Myself included.  We keep buying more of it.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Rainbath is a super product!  It is refreshingly clean, yet it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling the least bit dry.  I ordered it as a Christmas gift for a family member because she really likes it.  The forty ounce mega-size lasts for quite a long time.  I most certainly trust Neutrogena and their Rainbath most certainly proves just &amp;#34;why!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Love the smell great on skin</li>
    <li> This product is worth the money.  All our company loves the product and buys it after they go back to their home. We reorder on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bath person and love bath gel in my Japanese soaking tub because it helps keep soap scum from forming on the sides and it smells good and softens my skin.  Normally I would buy something on sale, but after finding the Neutrogena Rainbath, I&#x27;m addicted to the lovely citrus scent and its superb skin softening ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it does contain sodium laurel sulfate, a skin irritant for some, this product does not irritate my skin.  In fact, as a water fitness instructor, I am in chlorinated pools several times a week and this bath gel helps enormously in reducing the dryness and itch I get from chlorine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it comes in a large 40-oz size with a pump for easy dispensing.  Makes it as inexpensive as the bargain brands with lots more softening and moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it and expect to experience your bit of heaven.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product I was expecting the regular version. Nothing in the title describes that it&#x27;s the grapefruit version. Other than that, it was delivered very promptly and I haven&#x27;t used it yet but am sure that I will like this product since I love the one I originally thought I was ordering.</li>
    <li> Used for a long time and our area was not selling. Finding on Amazon was like a refreshing breath of air. You will love and who doesn&#x27;t love the quality of Neutrogena!</li>
    <li> My husband is hooked on this product. He loves to soak in it after a hard day at work (which is all week long, so this gives him something to look forward to when he gets home). He&#x27;s on his feet most of the time, and this bath gel really helps with his calluses. I first started buying it at Costco for $25 when we had membership, but since then he&#x27;d pay $9 for a 8.5 oz bottle at Vons or Rite-Aid. So, thanks to Amazon, we basically get about 2 bottles more for the money. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I can&#x27;t end a shower without using it.  It reminds me of being on vacation.  Clean, refreshing fragrance.</li>
    <li> product works great!!</li>
    <li> I buy this product every year as a gift.  Amazon had the best price for this product and it was a bigger bottle than the retail stores sell.</li>
    <li> I have been looking all around for this mega sized Rainbath.  It is my favorite shower gel.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Rinses away clean and smells great.  By and far, the best shower gel I&#x27;ve ever used.  (Wouldn&#x27;t pay more than 20-22 dollars for it.) The bottle was huge(40 oz) and lasted FOREVER.</li>
    <li> This is excellent soap.  My wife loves it.  I find it easy to use and it gets me clean.</li>
    <li> It is always nice to get something you like extra. We love this soap and that is more to use.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite bath and shower soap.  Suds up great and has a great fragrance,  Really like the larger sized bottle.</li>
    <li> I received the Green and i ordered the Amber color one. I don&#x27;t care for the green, and I know that I like the Amber one.</li>
    <li> This leaves my skin feeling clean. I&#x27;m a guy, and it&#x27;s hard to find high quality body wash that has a scent I can deal with. This hits the spot, and the large pump size lasts for a long time and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for many years due to sensitive skin. Works well all year long to maintain the proper pH in your skin, preventing dry and itching skin.</li>
    <li> Love this, our Dermatologist recommended this! Lasts a long time too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this rainbath about 25 years ago, and the smoothness and fragrance are still the same...simply perfect !!!</li>
    <li> The price is getting ridiculous; therefore, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The 40-oz bottles have been disappearing from shelves and the price has gone up  Glad to find it on Amazon and at such Bargain pricing.  Free shipping too!!  I love Prime!  The product is top-notch.  It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin or leave any residue.  Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I like the smell of this so much plus the shape of the bottle. Ascetics and scent are a weakness I guess.</li>
    <li> Always will continue to buy my rainbath as long as Neutrogena doesnt water it down or mess with the original fragrance and so far they have not. I have been using this product for almost 24 years, and I still am in love.</li>
    <li> Been using it every day for a couple years to shower.  Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> Looks like it comes with a pump; it doesn&#x27;t come with a pump.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and won&#x27;t use anything else. Love the fragrance and how it leaves my skin soft.</li>
    <li> been using rainbath for year (about 20 i&#x27;d say) and it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found for shower that doesn&#x27;t make you feel you have to lather on lotion after, smells great (not to &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;) and very gentle on sensitive skin.  5 squirts does most of a normal sized body (and one more for the lower legs and feet) so it lasts a long time.  you&#x27;re gonna love it so get the &amp;#34;giant economy size&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff, too bad Costco stopped carrying it.</li>
    <li> I like having this in the shower rather than a bar of soap.  It&#x27;s clean and you get no scummy residue.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s more costly than soap (hence, the four stars) but a little goes a long way.  I really like it as I do most Neutrogena products.</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena Rainbath and the online price and larger size is great</li>
    <li> A must have. Crazy how it&#x27;s not available in stores.</li>
    <li> I received this item yesterday and used it in the shower that night.  First time in ages, I have not had itchy skin after showering. Really a great product. Great packaging. No need to slather on body lotion after showering.</li>
    <li> We have been Neutrogena \\&quot;rainbath\\&quot; consumers for years. I started to order it online via Amazon Sept. 8th 2010 and I received the right product (the dark, honey colored soap). Then I ordered the same exact product again on Jan. 19th 2011 and they sent me the \\&quot;grapefruit\\&quot; soap, which is lighter and smells totally different but it&#x27;s in the same packaging. I am not happy about this and I will not order this product again until the information is clearly marked so we know what we are ordering. The product info needs clarification.</li>
    <li> Good bath gel but found find cheaper elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used in the shower- I no longer have dry skin and it is very easy to rinse.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and great price. I won&#x27;t use anything else and this price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> By far one of my favorite shower gel!&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and it comes in a giant bottle which means you do not have to buy a new bottle any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;If you like a soft citrus-y smell that&#x27;s slightly sweet, this is the shower gel you&#x27;d want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shopping! :&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena Rainbath and have used it for years.  What I didn&#x27;t like was the price.  I paid $40 for the 40oz. on Amazon (I had priced smaller bottles in my local drugstores:  CVS, Walgreens, etc) and deemed it fair as it was the &amp;#34;Mega Size.&amp;#34;  A week later I found the same sized bottle in my wholesale club (Bj&#x27;s) for $13.</li>
    <li> Received in a timely manner.  My friend loved it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but HATE the HIGH PRICE!</li>
    <li> Yes, I noticed more than a few reviews grieving the loss of the old with what&#x27;s apparently new scent and new general ingredients formulations, but this product is new to me, so I have no comparisons of past glories. I love the fresh, not exactly \\&quot;feminine\\&quot; and not exactly \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; scent. It lathers just the right amount, washes off easily, does not leave my skin dry, and also does not leave an uncomfortable residue. It presents with a glowing natural amber color and a classic sleek container design to enhance bathroom decor. I&#x27;ve long been a Neutrogena fan, and I&#x27;m happy to add Rainbath shower (and bath) gel to my list of faves.</li>
    <li> A generous amount of my favorite soap.  I will use this big one to refill several smaller containers.</li>
    <li> I have used Rainbath for many years.  I am delighted to be able to get it in the big bottles again.  The seller has it priced right and I am very glad they do.  Now I can enjoy it and feel I have a reputable seller so I can get it again for a fair deal. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The fragrance of this product (I have had this before) is just perfect.  My allergy laden spouse is not put off by this fragrance.  Love the size for the shower.  Good product that I would recommend for others.</li>
    <li> Order this product twice. Once for myself and I absolutely love the smell, the brand, and the way it makes me feel (clean). Then my daughter kept using my bottle, so I ordered her one too. This is a life-long product for me and shipped fast from seller.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena is the only bath gel that does not cause me skin irritation.  Even after 8 years.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and I&#x27;m so glad it comes in these big bottles!  It&#x27;s been a staple of my morning routine for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many bath products in my life.  No matter what, Rainbath will always be my favorite little luxury.  I suffer from both allergies and extremely sensitive skin that tends to be a bit dry.  Rainbath contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (unfortunately), so it isn&#x27;t organic,  but otherwise it is kind to my skin and doesn&#x27;t give me a migraine with heavy perfumes.    I would describe Rainbath as a unisex product.  Some women complain that it is too masculine, but I&#x27;m the type of girl who loves oriental and woodsy scents.  Rainbath is golden-brown in color, with the light consistency of gel.  It has the most gorgeous herbal scent.  It makes me think about being in the Maine woods, with the scent of trees and rain.  It is just very natural and earthy.  I feel like a sexy hippie when I shower...meow!    Rainbath is simply lovely.  It can also double as a facial cleanser, too.</li>
    <li> Love the aroma of this product. I a pinch I even use it for shampoo and it does the job nicely</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to use any other gel in the shower.</li>
    <li> greatest stuff in the world and also makes the best gift for the hard to buy person. best bargain here too.</li>
    <li> I normall get this product at Costco. I think it was really expensive. The next time I go to Costo, I will do a price check.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;The Waxman</li>
    <li> Best Soap EvAr!! I will not use anything else on my skin.</li>
    <li> Product came earlier than expected and as expected. Very nice lather.</li>
    <li> My wife has a real problem with most bath soaps, both bar and liquid types, causing dry skin. She swears by Rainbath and will not use other products, if at all possible. She even has a small bottle of Rainbath for traveling.</li>
    <li> I love this bath and shower gel.  It&#x27;s so refreshing.  It&#x27;s worth saving your pennies to purchase.  The mega size is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Im so happy i was able to order the 40 oz from amazon for so cheap! the little 250 mL alone is $9 and this big one was $20. Such a nice refreshing clean smell.</li>
    <li> costco runs out of these....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and buy it in the large bottles from Amazon. It&#x27;s a very nice soap that doesn&#x27;t smell flowery, fruity, or like menthol. It&#x27;s a unique scent, very pleasant and manly.</li>
    <li> Best shower wash ever.  Period.</li>
    <li> I have been using Kiss My face and Alba Botanca bath &amp; shower gels for several years, but searching for those items led me to the product link for this enormous and well-priced offering from Neutrogena.  Remembering how much I loved their bar soap as a teenager and then this Rain Bath in my early twenties, I jumped at the opportunity to go back in time (decades) to an old favorite.  Used the first time this morning and was delighted at the consistency of the product I remembered - fresh scent and plentiful lather from just about a 1/2 teaspoon of product squirted onto my shower scrungy.  Even with three of us showering almost every day, this should last.  Great value for a great product.</li>
    <li> Three stars because of the high price</li>
    <li> Great price, large bottle, and I like the feel.</li>
    <li> I went to a friend&#x27;s house to visit and loved the smell in his appartment.  I asked him what that smell was and he was unsure.  He had just taken a shower and did not particularly notice that the smell of his soap had permeated the entire appartment.  After a little investigating, we came to the conclusion that it was the Neutrogena Rainbath Soap.  I absolutely ADORE this smell when I shower.  I am hooked on it now.  It also leaves my skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Fabulous  stuff at an amazing price!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful refreshing perfect in every way bath and shower gel. Be sure to order the refreshing  it is the best</li>
    <li> Remember the days when the only soap for the bath or shower came in a bar? Well, I certainly do. Around 1990, I switched to using Ivory Dishwashing Liquid in the shower. It&#x27;s a long story. Actually, the Ivory worked quite well and kept the shower free of soap scum much better. It was gentle on the skin and did an excellent job of cleansing. My only complaint was that it was harder to rinse off the body than other types of soap. About that time a few liquid soaps began appearing and I gradually shifted over to a variety of different brands, usually the one that was on sale as they were all somewhat expensive. My fianc&amp;eacute;e found me in this state and introduced me to \\&quot;Neutrogena Rainbath\\&quot; shower and bath gel. I immediately adapted to it and our joint usage added a little efficiency to the household.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Neutrogena Rainbath\\&quot; is an excellent product. It cleanses as well as any shower liquid I&#x27;ve used and has a pleasant and refreshing smell. My fianc&amp;eacute;e claims it leaves her skin in better condition, but I can&#x27;t really tell. I like it because it washes off clean fairly easily and leaves a pleasant light fragrance. On occasion, my fianc&amp;eacute;e uses it to shave her legs, but she usually prefers to use a specialized gel. We generally prefer to buy it in the 40-ounce bottle, which lasts a long time and fits neatly on a little shelf in our shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson</li>
    <li> Love this stuff; smells so good, lasts long time, and easy on skin. Neutral pH makes it gentle for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Love the delicious aroma of Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I enjoy the refreshing scent.</li>
    <li> I have used many brands of shower products throughout the years, but this one gets 5 *&#x27;s, it makes you feel clean while keeping the moisture in. I noticed the difference with the first use....I highly recommend this product and will continue to use it myself!</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied with this shower gel.  The large size will last for a long time, and I love the scent.  It&#x27;s very natural and relaxing.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a new soap and I was attracted to this by the great ratings and reviews this bath gel had. I took a shower after my work out and even with my scrub, it didn&#x27;t clean well. I still felt dirty and my skin felt weird and it didn&#x27;t remove the residue that my deodorant had left on my under arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this would clean really well for the people who aren&#x27;t that active and don&#x27;t play sports or work out much. For every day people, I think this bat gel is great but it&#x27;s not for the daily active/sports person.</li>
    <li> This is my husbands favorite bath gel.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Smells great and lathers up real well. Worth the $$$,</li>
    <li> I really like the Neutrogena rain bath. The seller sends the product very fast and was willing to help with any questions. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> tons of bubbles that last when used on a louffa</li>
    <li> Great fragrance and always great quality from Neutrogena with a great price from Amazon--what&#x27;s not to love? I just wish they&#x27;d bring back the Neutrogena lotion and dry-oil spray in the same fragrance.</li>
    <li> This Neutrogena Rainbath is wonderful. I love the fragrance. And it really makes my skin soft and it doesn&#x27;t dry mu skin out either. The pump works great and the size will last for a good while. I will not go back to soap that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> What is not to like?  I loved this product.  I bought this item for a gift and decided to keep it once I smelled it.  I will buy it again - maybe gift the next one.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this for Christmas and I thought it would be a great side gift -- she loves this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the fresh ORIGINAL Neutrogena fragrance. I also LOVE this MEGA 40 oz. size! This ultra-lathering gel makes it perfect for shower or for a relaxing bubble bath! I  use 3 pumps into the tub under the running water. I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough~ Would definitely recommend to friends &amp; family!</li>
    <li> When I  broke my arm I used this very day to shower with one arm and it worked out great in that it did not dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> I use nothing on my skin but neurtrogena rainbath, this was an exceptional bargain price. I Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I first bout a small bottle at WalMart for about 7 dollars and loved it, the smell of this stuff is remarkable. I was happy to see that you could get it in such large sizes! It lathers extremely well, and will leave you smelling good all day/night. I don&#x27;t notice any moisturizing benefits, but it doesn&#x27;t dry me out at all. Id like if they had squeeze tubes for travel/gym bag.</li>
    <li> Better deal than what you buy in stores. Bigger bottle for a lower price than it is sold for at Nordstrom rack.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great. However it arrived without a pump, in a bag not a box. The top wasn’t sealed.</li>
    <li> I found this product many years ago and I have always loved it. It&#x27;s very refreshing, and, I have come to trust Neutrogena and all of its products</li>
    <li> I have used Neugrogena Bath and Shower Gel since the early 1970&#x27;s and find it very refreshing.  I have&lt;br /&gt;tried other bath gels and find them unacceptable.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the size. It made my skin pretty smooth, and just a little bit is enough to make a lot of foam. Price wise Costco was cheaper.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite shower gel. It was the first time I ever purchased it online. It came in a fairly timely manner and had the consistent quality you expect from this particular product.</li>
    <li> This is always good.  I like to get the big size so I don&#x27;t have to look for it again for a while.  I bought two to last me for a while.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have sensitve skin and it is the only one that not only will not make me break out, but it doesn&#x27;t leave a gross sticky or film like feel on my skin. This preticular seller had it at the best price that I have ever seen it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, lightly scented</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, smells so yummy. It also doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> My family of hubby and young men love this body wash.  The scent is fine for men and women; its kind of a warm and relaxing fragrance.  It is less expensive at Costco but we quit them and opted for Amazon Prime instead.</li>
    <li> have been using this for years. but thisprce saved me cash. and love thisbig size. will always use this and buy frm amazon .com</li>
    <li> Love this body wash. This mega size has really lasted a good amount of time for the dollar spent. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Smells like a refreshing rain shower, somewhat medicinal but I like that.</li>
    <li> I have been using Neutrogena Rainbath refreshIng shower &amp; bath gel for years &amp; was so glad to find it on Amazon! It explains itself!  Believe me, I Will order this product from Amazon again when I run out! It is truly refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DorIs Fletcher&lt;br /&gt;182 Colt Ridge&lt;br /&gt;Spencer, West Virgenia  dorisfletcher09@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  It is both mild and economical. I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s available in the large size, which saves on packaging reorders.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT - The smell, the feel, if you have never tried it you are in for a surprise!  NOT JUST FOR BABIES.</li>
    <li> The SMELL is SO REFRESHING.  This is a wonderful high end product.  I love bathing with this stuff.  I keep buying it and love it still.</li>
    <li> I love the product but it&#x27;s a shame that it&#x27;s considerably more to buy it online through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I&#x27;ll have to pay sales tax but even with prime shipping, Amazon is more on this product.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Rainbath Refreshing Shower and Bath Gel- 40 oz (Mega Size)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great after you take a shower using this stuff and the 40 oz size is great!</li>
    <li> HUGE HUGE HUGE BOTTLE OF SHOWER AND BATH GEL -&lt;br /&gt;I COULDN&#x27;T BELIEVE THE QUALITY I GOT FOR MY MONEY  -&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and love, love, love it!  I would highly recommend the product.  It is non drying, lathers well and smells great!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> About a year ago, I decided to purchase Neutrogena green tea and pear shower gel and fell in love with it. I was always afraid of trying this product, so for years I used Dove, Careers, and other like products. I always thought Neutrogena shower and bath gels would leave your skin dry; however, the entire opposite happened. My skin is clean, hydrated, and smells great. Now, all I use is Neutrogena. I even converted my sister and her family to Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products. I love using it in the shower on one of those cheesecloth kind of balls. It&#x27;s so cleansing and refreshing.</li>
    <li> The best ever.  A good shampoo too!</li>
    <li> This item has a great price and a great smell.  Leaves you feeling and smelling fresh and revitalized.</li>
    <li> My son loves this product as do I. Good for your skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product in an extra large size for a great deal.... I definitely will be reordering this item regularly from H&amp;B Amazon!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have been using this forever!  I love the clean smell, keeps my skin really soft and it is priced fairly.  You don&#x27;t even need lotion your skin is so moist.</li>
    <li> While I love Neutrogena Rainbath, the item I ordered and that is pictured with my order history is NOT what I received. I ordered the item pictured with the box and pump. My received item had no box, and no pump, only the container with a pop-up cap in shrink wrapped plastic. Seems I was shipped the REFILL, not the item I ordered. And, it leaked inside the plastic so it was a very messy item to receive and clean up. For this size bottle, a pump is absolutely necessary for practical use. I give a poor rating for the misleading photo on this product.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Gentle on skin. Cleans quickly and very, very refreshing.</li>
    <li> I love this bath gel for my showers. It is a great product and I&#x27;ll buy more if this ever runs out.</li>
    <li> Product arrived with in a two day. This is great product for great price. We love it and keep freshness for longer..</li>
    <li> Hubby loves the clean, medicine-y smell of this product. That&#x27;s exactly what I don&#x27;t like about it. It is too drying for women, in my opinion, but great for guys.</li>
    <li> never have to worry about drying skin out, product has pleasant fragrance, mild enough for facial skin as well !</li>
    <li> My husband, daughter and myself love this product because it saves us lots of money and smells fantastic.  It feels great on your skin too.</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time for a bath lover like me! Fragrance is fresh and clean. Makes for a great bubblebath or shower gel.</li>
    <li> I have used this product off and on for years and just ordered my second bottle from Amazon.  I love the feel and the scent is refreshing.  Will continue to order.</li>
    <li> My favorite body wash.  This is cost saving</li>
    <li> Very good product I have used before and really like it a lot.</li>
    <li> My husband uses only this product and it is wonderful. No waste. The Neutrogena bar soap would always dissipate in the tray and a lot was wasted.</li>
    <li> very satifyed with product and deliver</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite body wash since I was young.  I hope they never quit making it.  It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find the 40 oz mega sizes, though, so I am worried.  I love the clean smell, the way it easily rinses off, and the fact that it&#x27;s lightweight.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good condition  Has been very helpful with daily bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> The product was just what I thought what I was getting.  Happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena and this is one of my shower go-to&#x27;s. Great size will last a month or two depending on how much you use and it&#x27;s got a great &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; sent. 5-star shower gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why only 4-stars?&lt;br /&gt;The first week I had this, the pump literally cracked off where it comes up out of the bottle and turns into the nozzle. The horizontal part where the soap comes out just snapped off. Now I have to press on the broken straw part that comes out for about 30 more ounces! I&#x27;ve never had that happen and it won&#x27;t keep me from buying again. I did want to mention it in case other people have the same problem.</li>
    <li> Best musk clean smell ever...Love it...leaves my skin soft and smelling good.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this, lathers up nicely and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using Neutrogena Rainbath Refreshing Shower &amp; Bath Gel for over 25 years. Before online ordering, it was possible to only get this &amp;#34;Mega Size&amp;#34; Rainbath once a year - around the holidays. I was so pleased to see it available online year-round &amp; since my husband &amp; I use it, as do all our guests, we go through one of these in about 4-5 months. It still has that spicy, perky smell that it always has had, and leaves my skin soft, smooth &amp; hydrated. Every so often, I will try a new shower gel from another company, but inevitably I return to Rainbath because it&#x27;s very soothing and I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to it, which isn&#x27;t true with other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that many reviewers complain that there isn&#x27;t a pump included with this item. Please be very careful that you are ordering the 40 oz size &amp; NOT the &amp;#34;refill&amp;#34;. The refill doesn&#x27;t come with a pump. I&#x27;ve also seen other reviewers say this isn&#x27;t the &amp;#34;same Rainbath&amp;#34; they&#x27;ve had before. Neutrogena hasn&#x27;t changed the formula on this one - they did rename it &amp;#34;Refreshing&amp;#34;, &amp; that is the only change they&#x27;ve made (it used to be called &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34;). It is still the same excellent product it has always been. I was extremely pleased with Amazon&#x27;s careful packaging. My Rainbath arrived in its carton, inside a larger box, well-packed. There were no leaks and honestly, it was so beautifully kept that I could have given it as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t another body wash out there that is as great on my skin. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap ever. Like how it feels,  how it smells.  Never thought I would care about soap, but this stuff is great.</li>
    <li> Searched for 40 oz Neutrogena Rainbath, pear &amp; green tea which is an excellent product.  Ordered 6 bottles and then found they were all regular Rainbath.  Found out this item cannot be returned even though they are all unused and in the original boxes.  I would not have ordered this item which cost over $162. if I knew that it could not be returned for refund.</li>
    <li> Great product and smells good.  These make good presents also!</li>
    <li> Thank you for your quick delivery.  Love the price and the quality is as expected.  Kudos!</li>
    <li> We have been using it for past 5 years no and love the smell as effect</li>
    <li> My wife of 50 years has used Neutrogena for more years than I can remember. We purchased through Amazon because the price was right (better than our local chain drug store). An excellent product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Its the best especially for women who have sensitive skin.this is like the best soap ever doesnt stay on ur skin</li>
    <li> Another one of my favorite things!  I love it.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing like Neutrogena Rainbath Refreshing Shower and Bath Gel.  It does the best job getting my skin clean and condidtioned!  The larger sizes are not easy to buy at local stores, but Amazon always has them available.  When I order, I always buy a couple of 40 oz bottles, to allow for free shipping.</li>
    <li> This is a great product ,great scent as I still remember from many years ago. However the packing needs to be improved upon as it came with the cap loosened and leaked slightly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the formula is still the original that I am use to; however, I have yet to have any problems with my skin.  I have used other soaps in the past and always return to Neutrogena because it doesn&#x27;t make my dry skin any worse.  I would definitely recommend this soap for anyone who has any type of dry skin problem.</li>
    <li> Simply the cleanest smelling, and easiest on your skin shower gel on the market today. Even among Neutragena&#x27;s other fragrances in gel, this cannot be beat. Good price also.</li>
    <li> Truly love this stuff and figure it is ok to pamper oneself a couple times a year. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> An old reliable product, smells and feels great.</li>
    <li> like some customers mentioned, i am not sure if this stuff was good once in the past. i feel like washing myself in a bunch of acid. i dont this it deserves its high ratings</li>
    <li> I love rainbath! I have used it for years, and will continue. I love the scent it&#x27;s very fresh smelling and my skin feels so soft after washing with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and its more gentle on your skin. It&#x27;s also economical to buy the product in a larger quanity.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Smells so good and leaves skin soft.  I use this in the Winter because the air is so dry.  It is moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Back in 2009, Neutrogena changed the scent and color of original Rainbath, making it darker, and the fragrance less sophisticated. For months, Neutrogena denied making any changes, but offered overcompensatingly liberal refunds (they sent me a check for $20 and another $40 of coupons for a $15 product). Eventually they did admit they&#x27;d changed the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new product was still tolerable - and better than the alternatives. Since the body wash still cleaned well while leaving my skin soft and the scent didn&#x27;t offend, I decided to stick with it. Recently I brought home a new 40 ouncer, and in the shower these past several days, I noticed some new changes, none for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t lather well. I use Neutrogena as shampoo and body wash, as I have for nearly 20 years. Suddenly with this new bottle, I noticed my hands dragging roughly across my hair. The gel wasn&#x27;t lathering, and it didn&#x27;t have the slippery quality that it used to have. As I continued to bathe, I noticed that the product didn&#x27;t lather well, and required more scrubbing to create what lather it did create. I had to use more to get enough lather, more than twice as much as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It dries out my skin. My skin looks and feels dry, scaly and rough after about a week of this bottle&#x27;s Rainbaths. My skin is getting worse each day. I considered the possibility that my municipal water had changed, and/or my skin had changed. But a different shower gel (Every Man Jack) leaves my skin soft, and it lathers easily - tried it again yesterday. Then I remembered I had some of an old bottle of Neutrogena Rainbath in a travel bag. So I tried it this evening, and the old stuff lathers easily and leaves my skin soft. I&#x27;m sure gonna miss it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done enough testing. Given Neutrogena&#x27;s previous tinkering with the product, I have no doubts that they&#x27;ve done it again, creating a cheap shadow of a previously high quality body wash while treating their loyal customers like fools. There are surprisingly few well priced and appealing shower gels out there. But if I have to, I&#x27;ll bathe with Suave. Looks like my Neutrogena days are truly over.</li>
    <li> I was recommended to use this by a friend and she&#x27;s now my best friend for recommending it.  Makes me and the whole house smell wonderful!</li>
    <li> Thanks  everything expected. Quickly sent and everything was well done. Your an excellent vendor and all should feel good with you!</li>
    <li> Its very good.Arrived in perfect condition .......Just like i imagined ..Great product ..love this shower gel,, i would recommend to every one</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and love it&#x27;s scent and fresh feeling after showering.  My only complaint is that they no longer have the lotion, oil, etc. in the original scent.</li>
    <li> Fantastic  product, great buy for the $. Much cheaper than at retail stores</li>
    <li> This Shower and Bath Gel, has been the one and only cleanser I have used since I was 16. (A long time ago)  It will leave your skin so clean, soft and silky!  No residue, no fuss, and I just love the fragrance. I bought the smaller size in the beginning, but now since I use it daily, I always order the Mega 40 oz. size.  I have never been disappointed with Neutragena Rainbath.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  Feels good, has a nice light aroma, does the job, and is extremely easy to use because of its size and design.  I just ordered some more.</li>
    <li> Seriously the best soap ever, might be a little pricy, but it goes a LONG way. Great for shaving too!</li>
    <li> Will not use anything else but rainbath!!</li>
    <li> This product works just fine.  It&#x27;s not life changing, but it&#x27;s good.  It lathers well.  You&#x27;ll need a washcloth or puff or something to scrub it into, but otherwise it works really well.</li>
    <li> This gel smells great and is easy on the skin.  I love the pump bottle too because it&#x27;s convenient in the shower.</li>
    <li> First used at The Hilton and liked it so much because it helped my dry skin. It left my skin so soft and silky feeling without that added sticky feeling.It has a pleasant fresh clean scent. It helped also since I have allergies and I was able to use this product. I was unable to find this product locally but was able to find at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Not nearly the fine the quality I recall this product being. Seems more like dish soap on the skin than the gentle lovely Neutrogena bubble bath I have many, many fond memories of. Not sure what to make of it.</li>
    <li> What can you say about soap?  It cleans.</li>
    <li> Process was excellent.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately both of the bottles had leaked and so it was a mess and the bottles were 3/4 full.  Disappointing!</li>
    <li> Be careful when you order this, I got a green one instead. And because it&#x27;s such a burned to return it, I just kept it. But it&#x27;s nor fair that they would send to you what they feel like, or have in stock.</li>
    <li> The fragrance of this shower gel is very refreshing.  It has become my preferred shower soap, and buying it in the larger size saves lots of mony.</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena Rain bath and Shower Gel was Perfect.  I need to purchase another Mega 40 oz. size.</li>
    <li> Great stuff leaves you nice and clean and is not too perfumey!</li>
    <li> I bought as a gift.  Great value.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully lightly scented and rich lather.  I&#x27;ve used this for 2 years now with only seasonably dry skin.  Love it!</li>
    <li> The Rainbath is so nice versus dripping soap bars in my bathrooms.  It goes a long way too and takes care of the most sensitive types of skin.</li>
    <li> I hope that I can always find this product!</li>
    <li> This soap is so phantastic I even go through the trouble of bringing it from the US to Switzerland and pay import taxes at the customs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried some of the other Neutrogena shower gels and while they&#x27;re pleasant enough, they smell like everything else.  But THIS is the version you want if you&#x27;re looking for a unique scent.  It&#x27;s earthy aroma has gotten me plenty of compliments from people.  Think sandalwood/frankincense range of pleasing earthy scents.  I won&#x27;t buy any other kind.  Not to mention the 40-ouncer lasts me about 6 months.</li>
    <li> When they say mega, they mean it. He won&#x27;t be needing body wash for quite some time. This stuff is hard for us to get right now, so I figured no harm in getting a little more than he asked for. Ummmm, a lot more maybe. But this one is his favorite and it smells pleasant without being feminine.</li>
    <li> The blue color Moisture rich one is much better.</li>
    <li> Finally a soap my husband and I can agree on!! Smells great, nice quality!! Great price!!</li>
    <li> I love alone and buy body wash probably once a year with this bad boy. I have SUPER sensitive skin and this has never aggravated it and I shower at least 2 times a day</li>
    <li> Good product. Fast Ship. Great Price. Thanks !</li>
    <li> I have been using Neutrogena Rainbath for as long as I can remember.  There is no leftover residue and your skin is left feeling soft and supple.  I would not use any other shower gel.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the feeling of your skin after washing with this soap.</li>
    <li> I tried this shower gel while staying at a friends house for a few days and I fell in love and had to get my own. Its a little pricey but its smells amazing and a little goes a long way. You will not regret this purchase. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Not only do I love the fragrance and cleaning ability of this gel, the 40 oz size is awesome.  I had no idea it came in this size and the price was economical.  I will definitely be buying this one again, once I empty the one I just got</li>
    <li> Have used this for years.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Scent is not the most desirable</li>
    <li> I Love this body soap. Best price I have ever seen!</li>
    <li> Has a sweet and refreshing, but not overpowering scent. Thick consistency which soaps up good on a loofah, a little goes a long way. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have been using this for years without any problems.</li>
    <li> There was still plenty left in the bottle (40oz is a big bottle) but I opened the box to find a gloppy mess of bath gel.</li>
    <li> There was no pump top as indicated in the picture.  Also the screw/pop-up cap had loosened and product leaked out into the protective plastic bag.</li>
    <li> Love this product, the price and the super fast delivery!</li>
    <li> It lists all the ingredients on its label as the real Rainbath; but it smells different, has a different viscosity, lighter color, and you do not get the same results and feel as after washing with real Neutrogena Rainbath (that I usually buy at Wal-Mart in 16 oz size).</li>
    <li> always use does not leave your bathroom with soap scum on the shower walls great stuff</li>
    <li> I like buying big stuff and not having to replace it as often. I use this on my face and body and it doesn&#x27;t leave it dry and tight or with a residue feeling. It has a fresh smell that doesn&#x27;t feel specific to a male or female.</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena Rainbath but I ordered the shower gel with the pump and reveived a refill without the pump. If I did not have another pump availbale - I would have rewturned the item.</li>
    <li> Arrived today leaking throught box and all over floor.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased for my aunt who resides in a nursing home.  She said that the delivery was as expected.  She rated the package protection as excellent and that the box size and packaging was about right.  The mega size Neutrogena Rainbath Refreshing Shower and Bath Gel was not difficult to open.  She was happy to receive this item.</li>
    <li> wife loves this stuff she smells great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always seen this in Target and was always wondering what it&#x27;s like. So yesterday, I went shopping in Sams Club and found this for $17.99 and I was like &#x27;hey, why not give it a try&#x27;. So that night, I used it in the shower and I fell in love. It has a nice waterfall/outdoor scent, which can pass for perfume, haha. But anyways, the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and a little goes a LONG way and it lathers up to my likings. After I got out of the shower, my skin instantly felt smooth and refreshed and the lovely scent lingered on. When this runs out (which will be no time soon) I will definitely buy this again! I highly recommend this to women AND men!</li>
    <li> When each of my three children were born , the hospital sent us home with a supply of this bath gel. I love the smell and it is gentle on the whole families skin. Our family seems to have sensitive skin so this is a perfect fit!</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena Rainbath products. This is a great product at a great price per ounce. Very moisturizing, refreshing, and nice scent.</li>
    <li> Love the product. I have sensitive and able to use it. Lightly scented</li>
    <li> Love the product and this larger size allows me to refill the small bottles in the bathroom. Vendor is wonderful !</li>
    <li> love it, my husband and I both use it, last a long time</li>
    <li> I really like this shower gel.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars was the price.  I no sooner bought this and I noticed it was available at two of the big membership clubs I also shop at.  It was about $8-$9 less than what I paid here.</li>
    <li> Terrific shower and bath gel.  It smells masculine, works well for both shower and bath.  Good product for the price.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it has a light scent that works all year round. The Rainbath scent reminds me of a subtle sandalwood, with a woodsy undertone. Very pleasing, I think, to both men and women. Since it does not linger in any discernible way, it won&#x27;t conflict in any way with other fragrance that is applied later or scented body lotions. I wish they made this in a shampoo.</li>
    <li> Warning. Can be addicting!!! I received this as a gift one year and now I can&#x27;t live without it!  It has a unique subtle scent and is cleansing but not drying. I love it</li>
    <li> I like it. like the smell of the original version and this shower and bath jel keeps me clean. been using this product for one year</li>
    <li> I have used Neutrogena for over 30 years, and it has withstood the test of time.  My skin has remained youthful, soft and silky. The only reason I ordered it is because I could not find the 40oz locally.  Routinely all I can find are the smaller size.  I also think the different scent are a p;lus, but the original scent remains my  favorite.</li>
    <li> Love this giant bottle. My go-to shower gel. Classic and clean.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I got the mega 40 oz size and it is well MEGA.  It takes up a fair bit of space and if you have a smaller bathroom, siphon off some into a smaller pump bottle and just refill it.  Smells amazing, decent lather, does not dry your skin and the price was excellent.  Five stars.</li>
    <li> Um...what has happened to my beloved soap? I have faithfully&amp;,loyally used rainbath. I used some yesterday and I swear my skin is all itchy and dried out. I also had to use triple the amount to get it to even lather!! Feels really dry not smooth like it used too. I do believe they&#x27;ve changed the formula! Its so sad. After 20years..I am going to have to switch. Luckily, the body oil is still the same!! I use many of the products and will continue to do so: Just no more rainbath sadly. I don&#x27;t even want to use the rest it&#x27;s so bad.</li>
    <li> My wife is very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I got this shower wash because of the great reviews. I was not disappointed it has a very clean scent, A+ product!</li>
    <li> I live in an arid state and dry skin use to be a problem ~ BUT ~ not after finding this wonderful Rainbath ~ Love it</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband, he loves this.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product for my sensitive skin!</li>
