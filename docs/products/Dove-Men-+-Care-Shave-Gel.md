      <li>It does have a good scent and works like it is supposed too.</li>
      <li>A good price as well.</li>
      <li>for just this shave gel, it took a fair amount of encouragement to get my husband to try it.  </li>
      <li>and I found this to be a good alternative.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for my smooth face.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, good stuff.</li>
      <li>but this is good if iever need shaving creme and got no gel around</li>
      <li>It smells good</li>
      <li>But I got him to try it (by not buying any more of the Fusion!)</li>
      <li>This works great, it helped prevent the rash that he had and made it so that he was smooth again.</li>
      <li>I received this product with no protective packaging and it appears that the pressure (air) leaked out of the item because it does not work and Amazon will not allow me to return it because it is supposedly hazardous.  </li>
      <li>I also tried it on my legs and liked the moisturizing quality.</li>

      <li>The gel is really nice.</li>

      <li>Shave Gel has a pleasant light scent, applies nicely and lives up to the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; label.</li>
      <li>While I like the feeling of the shaving brush, the Dove gel went on easily and gave a good shave.  </li>
      <li>The gel comes out of the bottle as a gel and then very easily foams up.</li>
      <li>Both razors were very easy to move while using this gel.  </li>
      <li>It leaves a pleasant clean smell, but no discernible \\&quot;perfume\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It provides a very smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This has a very light scent that is basically neutral.  </li>
      <li>Smooth shave, fewer in-grown hairs, clean feeling skin, good scent without being very strong, cap well-designed so as not to make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>Buying more today.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also switched to mostly using a safety razor, and this product seems more designed for the mach3/etc style</li>
      <li>a foam.&lt;br /&gt;It works OK</li>
      <li>Remington costs more.  </li>
      <li>The better one in my opinion?  </li>
      <li>and I have more than</li>
      <li>If this keeps up I will be using the blade more often.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, he recommends this product, along with most all of the Dove Men products.</li>
      <li>it seems like gel works better then foam on my skin</li>
      <li>They are his favorite products to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Up to this point, I&#x27;ve been satisfied with Dove&#x27;s line of &#x27;men care&#x27; products.  </li>
      <li>anyway so this seem safe.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
      <li>and my complexion has improved, but I am still dealing with more razor bumps than I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The gel smells good and is good for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Gillette is better for me.</li>
      <li>Any more I won&#x27;t buy.</li>
      <li>The delivery system could be better though.</li>
      <li>great product fast delivery</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Edge Gel for sensitive skin for years while using disposable cartridges and been happy with it.  </li>
      <li>First of all the shave gel is pretty good - I have been using this for over a month now and pretty happy with the product.  </li>
      <li>He also says that shaving has become more comfortable as well.  </li>
      <li>I use other Dove men&#x27;s products and they are all excellent, so I decided to try the shaving cream.</li>
      <li>It also dispenses easily and the nozzle doesn&#x27;t get clogged.  </li>
      <li>It makes it really easy for the razor to glide.  </li>
      <li>Feels good going on and does a nice job of lubing up my face for either the standard razor or the electric Norelco SensoTouch shaver in the shower.  </li>
      <li>When he tried this Shave Gel, he was so happy that he not only didn&#x27;t have a reaction, but he said it has a very clean smell as well.</li>
      <li>Plus for the Dove is that it also has a mild scent, though slightly more noticeable than the Remington.  </li>
      <li>The scent is thankfully light and not offensively and irritatingly strong like some brands.</li>
      <li>My skin feels so smooth like how it would be at the age of 5</li>
      <li>Overall, this is a great shaving gel.</li>
      <li>This shaving cream is so smooth and creamy and does help to limit my shaving bumps.</li>
      <li>I find that in general they work well, offer a good value, and don&#x27;t have obnoxious smells.  </li>
      <li>and I had to apply more gel/foam to finish the first pass.  </li>
      <li>it is mild and smooth shaving gel.</li>
      <li>The Aveeno shave cream is by far a much better product!</li>
      <li>He liked the scent, and it didn&#x27;t irritate his sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Protects my skin from razor burns, keeps it cool and</li>
      <li>Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shave Soap, 2.5-Ounce Boxes ]] with an old-fashioned [[ASIN:B001ET7EFA Van Der Hagen Natural Boar Shave Brushes ]] for shaving,</li>
      <li>The Hydrate has a nice mild mature scent that is not at all overpowering.  </li>
      <li>Another plus for the Remington is that it has a mild scent.  </li>
      <li>The bottle itself is very nice looking, larger at the bottom, smaller at the top (helps with tipping over?</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a large bottle, and will probably last a long time, smell (or lack thereof) is good, and for those of you using standard 3-4+ bladed razors and enjoy gel/creams this is a very good bet.</li>
      <li>I got this for my teenage son, because he has very sensitive skin, and there&#x27;s not too many products out there that he can use without having some kind of reaction to.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny, and it works well with my vibrating razors since it&#x27;s a gel and not a foam.</li>
      <li>But I want to fresh mint flavor.</li>
      <li>But it wins with packaging.  </li>
      <li>Dove made this better by formulating it somehow to be more foamy and less dense.  </li>
      <li>My experience after 3 shaves is positive - much better than the old shaving cream and/or soap.</li>
      <li>I should start this review by saving my preference for shaving products is generally with more of a shaving oil/lotion/soap and not a gel/cream.  </li>
      <li>Goes on nicely and stays foamy for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sensitive skin runs in our family and we must use products that moisturize without strong smells and chemicals.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>This gives a nice smooth shave and unlike the Gillette&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
      <li>I ordered him the Dove Men+Care Sensitive + Shave Gel that was available.  </li>
      <li>Its what happens after you shave with this product that&#x27;s better than regular shaving cream,; my skin feels nicer and softer.</li>
      <li>Although, I always like the way he smells after using the various Dove products, too! :)</li>
      <li>Leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>It does the job, but probably won&#x27;t end up being his first choice at the store.</li>
      <li>Once the face is completely shaven, the outcome is comfort and smooth skin with no irritation.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the first shaving cream I have ever used where my wife actually commented on how smooth my face felt to her. It provides a very smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often find that \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; shave products have a chemical smell to them.  This has a very light scent that is basically neutral.  I am sensitive to some fragrances, but this one does not give me issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had smoother shaves with less irritation. Worth every penny, and it works well with my vibrating razors since it&#x27;s a gel and not a foam.</li>
    <li> First of all the shave gel is pretty good - I have been using this for over a month now and pretty happy with the product.  Protects my skin from razor burns, keeps it cool and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue I have is with the dispenser bottle - either I get too much or too little.  They should really improve the bottle dispenser design.</li>
    <li> When it was delivered, the cap was open and the box was filled with gel snd cream,  and other items were ruined too.</li>
    <li> The product has a terrible odor. Difficult to describe - a stale odor like a linen closet which has been closed for several years.</li>
    <li> The gel is really nice. I do not know what to say other than that. Just a bit creates a lot of foam and leaves the skin feeling nice. All in all it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I have a regular type beard and don&#x27;t use a blade as much as a electric shaver. the shaving cream finally ran out and I was ordering other dove products  anyway so this seem safe. My experience after 3 shaves is positive - much better than the old shaving cream and/or soap. If this keeps up I will be using the blade more often.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the Dove line of products for Men.  I find that in general they work well, offer a good value, and don&#x27;t have obnoxious smells.  This shaving cream falls in line in all three regards.  I&#x27;m generally not fond of foam-type shaving products, instead preferring to use a cake and badger brush, but I got this on a whim just to make things more convenient.  It works well and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy or dried out like some other products.  It leaves a pleasant clean smell, but no discernible \\&quot;perfume\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My principal complaint with this particular product is that the bottle is skinny, so it tends to fall over easily when reaching for it in the medicine chest.  It also tips over when sitting on the sink.  The other complaint (and this is shared by all foam-type shaving products) is that it drools foam out of the nozzle after you use it, so that you always have a gummy residue under the cap if you don&#x27;t rinse it off before putting it away.  On the plus side, the bottom does not rust like some shaving cream&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and Dove Men+ Care Sensitive Shave Gel does wonders for me as a college guy !</li>
    <li> I always have a problem with cutting up my neck while shaving. I believe this gel cuts down on the cutting and irritation. The bottle doesn&#x27;t dispense the gel that well. I think I might have gotten a bad bottle. A good price as well.</li>
    <li> Got it for a extremely low price when amazon was having a deal so i went up and got it i mean to try something out for a few bucks who wouldnt it does a decent job on my sensitive skin. it seems like gel works better then foam on my skin but this is good if iever need shaving creme and got no gel around&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Dan</li>
    <li> Perfect for my smooth face. This stuff is also more natural than half of the organic products my girlfriend uses.</li>
    <li> I gave up on shaving gels a few years ago because i did not like how sticky they were on both my face  and the razor.  I bought this one because I as buying the whole DOVE set.  Dove made this better by formulating it somehow to be more foamy and less dense.  It still sticks slightly to the razor but not enough to concern me.  The scent is very subtle and nice and my skin truly feels softer and with much less razor burn.  Its what happens after you shave with this product that&#x27;s better than regular shaving cream,; my skin feels nicer and softer.</li>
    <li> I dont know if it was shaken during transit but it did not come out as a gel, there is no smell and it spreads on really thin. It was shipped poorly in a thin envolope in sub freezing temps so maybe that messed it up. I will stick with Edge for now.</li>
    <li> Like this product very well.  It smells good, it goes on nicely and helps my razor glide effortlessly.  Leaves my face shining!</li>
    <li> Being as hairy as a bear,I have a constant 5 o&#x27;clock shadow on my face. This product is very good to use. It soften the beard and skin,smells manly and latters well. I use alot of men&#x27;s dove products.You may check all my reviews on men&#x27;s dove products.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream I have found so far.&lt;br /&gt;Works better than Aveeno for me.  Much less irritating and no razor burn or bumps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s wrong, but the product BARELY will come out of the can.  It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s not pressurized.  I generally like Dove products, and I waited until my second can arrived to post this.  I thought perhaps I got one defective can, but my second can was actually worse than the first.  I&#x27;m cancelling my subscription.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> This gel after shaving has a smell of sulfuric water or a hair removing cream smell. After shaving there was an irritation on a face. Very much it isn&#x27;t happy. Gillette is better for me. Any more I won&#x27;t buy. I threw out in a garbage can.</li>
    <li> I received this product with no protective packaging and it appears that the pressure (air) leaked out of the item because it does not work and Amazon will not allow me to return it because it is supposedly hazardous.  Will not purchase these types of items again from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Up to this point, I&#x27;ve been satisfied with Dove&#x27;s line of &#x27;men care&#x27; products.  However, this is a dud.  While I didn&#x27;t buy it through Amazon, I purchase a number of shaving products through this site so I thought I&#x27;d leave a review.  I&#x27;ve used Edge Gel for sensitive skin for years while using disposable cartridges and been happy with it.  I recently began using a safety razor and I&#x27;m still looking for the &#x27;perfect&#x27; gel, cream, or soap, so I tried this product.  Once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel/foam comes about a bit slow, and like I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers mention, it never really stops after the first use, so you&#x27;re always cleaning it up.  The biggest issue I have is that I had not even finished one pass with a safety razor and the thick foam had fizzled out and I had to apply more gel/foam to finish the first pass.  My beard usually only requires two passes, but after two with this product, there was still work to do.  Plus, by the end of the day, it looked like I had done a crappy job shaving.  Dove seems to have missed the mark with this product.</li>
    <li> I really avoid shaving since I would always get ingrown hair and would get red and ughhh bad skin..&lt;br /&gt;SO I always used an electric something to cut the hairs....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new job pretty much forces me to shave everyday so that&#x27;s what I have to do.&lt;br /&gt;Since I was buying the Dove Men+Care Sensitive line of the shampoo, face wash, lotion..&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking, why not try this out?&lt;br /&gt;So I bought it at Wal-Mart when I bought some blades... I&#x27;ve had the same blade for several years and I thought, it was time to get new ones. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing didn&#x27;t break me out, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and a little bit does a lot. I don&#x27;t remember the others since I don&#x27;t shave really until recently, so I don&#x27;t know much about these things. But I just press the thing one time, it shoots a bunch out and that&#x27;s all I need. Just a little press and I have more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have ingrown hair and I don&#x27;t have bumps or pimples or aggravated skin by using this like I would with other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ll continue using it as it works great for me, especially since, I do have to shave every single day, which kinda sucks.. I hated the way I looked when I shave, but after doing it for a little bit, I don&#x27;t look too bad. lol</li>
    <li> Bought this for hubby. He has baby face skin. He really likes it. Buying more today.</li>
    <li> It has the same dry feeling you get when you shave with cheap bar soap. Don&#x27;t waste your time .</li>
    <li> great product fast delivery</li>
    <li> I like this shave gel.  It makes it really easy for the razor to glide.  I tried it with both an electric Norelco 8891xl razor and with Merkur adjustable DE razor.  Both razors were very easy to move while using this gel.  I like that it has no scent.  It also dispenses easily and the nozzle doesn&#x27;t get clogged.  Overall, this is a great shaving gel.</li>
    <li> I use other Dove men&#x27;s products and they are all excellent, so I decided to try the shaving cream. I must say that Dove hasn&#x27;t let me down yet. This shaving cream is so smooth and creamy and does help to limit my shaving bumps. The reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 is because I have just started to use it</li>
    <li> Dove Men+Care Sensitive + Shave Gel has a pleasant light scent, applies nicely and lives up to the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; label. I find that I have less redness after using this than I have when I use a regular gel, which is exactly what I was hoping for. The Dove Men+Care line of products has all pretty much met my needs (aside from the body wash, which I&#x27;m not a huge fan of). This shave gel is no different, it&#x27;s a quality product that I can recommend.</li>
    <li> My husband has a problem, when he shaves, his face breaks out in a rash really bad.  So, what I did was I ordered him the Dove Men+Care Sensitive + Shave Gel that was available.  This works great, it helped prevent the rash that he had and made it so that he was smooth again.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the Dove Men line! They are his favorite products to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is his opinion, not mine. Although, I always like the way he smells after using the various Dove products, too! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was foamier than expected, but went on smooth and left his skin feeling smooth. It provided a close shave. Its smell wasn&#x27;t overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, he recommends this product, along with most all of the Dove Men products.</li>
    <li> Have tried both the Sensitive and the Hydrate shave gels.  They both work great.  Feels good going on and does a nice job of lubing up my face for either the standard razor or the electric Norelco SensoTouch shaver in the shower.  I prefer the Hydrate over the Sensitive which although is supposed to be \\&quot;scent neutral\\&quot; actually has a bit of an odd smell.  The Hydrate has a nice mild mature scent that is not at all overpowering.  My only gripe is that they are a little pricey for the amount you get.  Otherwise, good stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been testing this gel for a few weeks now, and it really makes a difference in terms of skin irritation. I feel less pain, and there is almost no cuts now. So in terms of basic functionality it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it has a very strange scent. I cannot call it bad (or good for that matter), but it gets time to get used to. Other than this, I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Pros: Smooth shave, fewer in-grown hairs, clean feeling skin, good scent without being very strong, cap well-designed so as not to make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: too many \\&quot;+\\&quot; symbols in the name(seriously, nothing else wrong with this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use [[ASIN:B001A3DNY6 Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shave Soap, 2.5-Ounce Boxes ]] with an old-fashioned [[ASIN:B001ET7EFA Van Der Hagen Natural Boar Shave Brushes ]] for shaving, and I found this to be a good alternative.  While I like the feeling of the shaving brush, the Dove gel went on easily and gave a good shave.  The cap accumulated a bit of buildup like most shaving gels do, but it was much less than what I usually get from something like [[ASIN:B0032ANCUU Edge Shave Gel, Sensitive Skin, 7-Ounce Cans]].  I personally prefer the brush &amp; soap for cost-effectiveness and the old-timey feel, but this would be my first choice otherwise.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Doesn&#x27;t lather too well, doesn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;manly\\&quot;.  Might be the worst shaving cream I&#x27;ve used, I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Sensitive skin runs in our family and we must use products that moisturize without strong smells and chemicals. This product lathers up more than I expected and leads to long, smooth strokes. Once the face is completely shaven, the outcome is comfort and smooth skin with no irritation. Definitely leaves a kissable face and, thank goodness, without chemical smells.  I can smell the chemical cologned scent of regular shaving creams throughout the house when they are used, and they just seem to linger.  Thank goodness for this shaving cream so I don&#x27;t have to smell those anymore.</li>
    <li> I got this for my teenage son, because he has very sensitive skin, and there&#x27;s not too many products out there that he can use without having some kind of reaction to. When he tried this Shave Gel, he was so happy that he not only didn&#x27;t have a reaction, but he said it has a very clean smell as well. We didn&#x27;t realize that Dove had so many different products out there designed just for men, but after trying a few, he is so glad that there are so many Dove products that are not only designed for men, but for men with sensitive skin as well. This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> it is mild and smooth shaving gel. But I want to fresh mint flavor. Need to get green label bottle.</li>
    <li> I should start this review by saving my preference for shaving products is generally with more of a shaving oil/lotion/soap and not a gel/cream.  I&#x27;ve also switched to mostly using a safety razor, and this product seems more designed for the mach3/etc style razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial impression was that it was nearly scentless.  Normally shaving cream has a very distinctive smell, but if this had any smell at all it is very subtle, to me this is very nice.  The bottle itself is very nice looking, larger at the bottom, smaller at the top (helps with tipping over? or maybe just general holding on to it -- as it also has slightly recessed areas on it).  Gel comes out quickly and nearly instantly starts expanding.  Goes on nicely and stays foamy for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the downsides is that combined with whatever it seems to thin out and lose it&#x27;s foam.  And without water (at least with a safety razor) it can cause the razor to have more drag (and more irritation).  I did get a little bit more bleeding than normal, but it might just be because I haven&#x27;t got used to it, or simply I didn&#x27;t get enough water on with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a large bottle, and will probably last a long time, smell (or lack thereof) is good, and for those of you using standard 3-4+ bladed razors and enjoy gel/creams this is a very good bet.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in this product.  I thought since it was made by Dove it would be a quality product.  Not so.  It is too thin in its texture to be good for sensitive skin.  The Aveeno shave cream is by far a much better product!</li>
    <li> It is no as creamy as I was expecting it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like a combination of a cream and a foam.&lt;br /&gt;It works OK but it is not great.</li>
    <li> The gel smells good and is good for sensitive skin. The delivery system could be better though. It&#x27;s unreliable; often times I find myself twisting and turning the can while holding the button trying to get it to eject SOMETHING. Very often it dribbles out very slowly and gets frustrating to use when you&#x27;re half done with shaving.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best canned cream I&#x27;ve ever used. My shaves are closer than ever, and my five-blade razor glides with ease across my face once I&#x27;ve let the lather sit for a minute. The only peculiar thing about the gel is the smell. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s supposed to be scented but if you have a sensitive nose you may notice it. I think it smells like a mix between play-dough and cardboard...</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving gel I have ever used! I would use the Gillette sensitive shave gel but is would still irritate my skin. I decided to try this one and I&#x27;m very satisfied! My skin feels so smooth like how it would be at the age of 5 lol . Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I asked my husband to try this DOVE shaving gel (in place of his usual favorite shaving gel, [[ASIN:B002UUT44Q Nivea for Men Q10 Energy Shaving Gel, 7-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]].  He likes Dove&#x27;s soaps and shampoos, so I thought he might also like Dove&#x27;s shaving gel ... and he did.  He said it provided similar results of providing a clean-shaven, moisturized face as the Nivea Q10.  I also tried it on my legs and liked the moisturizing quality.</li>
    <li> This gives a nice smooth shave and unlike the Gillette&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used in the past the container doesn&#x27;t stop working after a few uses.</li>
    <li> Worst shave Gel I have ever used! makes my face bleed and burn</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have trouble keeping away razor burn and bumps having to shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago my Aveeno Gel started to seem less effective at dealing with my issues, so I switched back to Gillette Fusion ProGlide.  After a couple of weeks using the ProGlide I remembered why I switched, because my skin went crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that I would give this a try and so far my skin irritation is down considerably and my complexion has improved, but I am still dealing with more razor bumps than I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I am just cursed!</li>
    <li> My husband is 30, and he has thick, quick-growing hair.  His facial hair is no exception.  He also has sensitive skin.  He&#x27;s been using the Dove Men+Care line of hair/body wash for several months now, and really likes it.  I&#x27;ve also noticed changes too, like his hair is smoother and he no longer gets dry patches of skin on his hands and elbows or any other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw Vine offered this same line in facial care products for men, I jumped on all four products for sensitive skin for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of them have been no exception to the excellence of the Dove for Men product line.  He&#x27;s been getting less razor burn, he has had less breakouts, and he hasn&#x27;t had any sort of negative reaction to any of the facial care products from Dove.  He also says that shaving has become more comfortable as well.  I&#x27;m not sure how well he notices his skin, but I notice.  I&#x27;ve noticed his skin looking clearer and brighter, and I think they&#x27;ve done great things for his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a little difficult getting him to use facial care products at all, as he&#x27;s definitely not the \\&quot;metrosexual\\&quot; type, but I think the decrease in razor burn and the other benefits he&#x27;s seeing has convinced him that maybe a decent skincare regimen wouldn&#x27;t be the worst thing in the world.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for just this shave gel, it took a fair amount of encouragement to get my husband to try it.  He has clung to his Gilette Fusion shave gel for years, and he&#x27;s not always open to change.  But I got him to try it (by not buying any more of the Fusion!) and he actually found that after several uses, he likes it better.  I will be buying this shave gel for him in the future!</li>
    <li> The expected. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Awesome shaving gel. Leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth. Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> Extremely pleasant on the skin. It is designed for sensitive skin and delivers on the promise. The gel comes out of the bottle as a gel and then very easily foams up. It provides a close shave. The scent is thankfully light and not offensively and irritatingly strong like some brands. And the packaging itself is quite neat if I might add. We would buy this product in future.</li>
    <li> The better one in my opinion?  [[ASIN:B00B1D9O6Q Remington, King of Shaves, Alphagel, Aloe Enhanced, Sensitive Shave Gel 5 Oz. (Pack of 4)]].  In comparing the two I noticed a few differences in scent, lather, and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington costs more.  But it wins with packaging.  The packaging is smaller, but it&#x27;s a plastic tube, so if you leave the tube in the shower it won&#x27;t leave a rust ring.  The Dove can leaves that metallic ring after a it gets wet.  Another plus for the Remington is that it has a mild scent.  Plus for the Dove is that it also has a mild scent, though slightly more noticeable than the Remington.  The final factor is in lather and the Dove slightly edges the Remington.  Slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they made this in a plastic tube I would be very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington owned by Spectrum brands.  Dove owned by Unilever.  Take your pick of the lesser of the two evils, but my vote for the lesser evil is Spectrum.  But that&#x27;s always subject to change!  But as I understand, the Remington shave gel might not be made much longer.</li>
    <li> I have course black facial hair but somewhat sensitive skin.  I usually use Nivea Shave Gel for sensitive skin and love it, but thought I would give this a shot.  It works very well as well and is cheaper than Nivea.  I am going to stick with this product now.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband to try. He liked the scent, and it didn&#x27;t irritate his sensitive skin. He has a fairly heavy beard, and this allowed a smooth shave. However, he likes a lot of lather and didn&#x27;t feel that it lathered as well as other products he has tried. It does the job, but probably won&#x27;t end up being his first choice at the store.</li>
    <li> Lathers really great gives you a real nice smooth shave!</li>
    <li> This product works like most other shave gels I&#x27;ve tried. It does a great job of helping the razor glide over your face and give you a nice smooth shave. It does have a good scent and works like it is supposed too. It is a little pricey though as there are others that work just as great and cost less.</li>
    <li> I recently gave my husband the Dove Men Shave Gel, along with 3 other Dove Men shave products.  While he really liked the post-shave products, he was not thrilled with this shave gel.  Compared to his normal Gillette shave gel, he said this product is \\&quot;not as slippery\\&quot; and \\&quot;not as protective\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s acceptable, but he will purchase his normal product over this one.</li>
