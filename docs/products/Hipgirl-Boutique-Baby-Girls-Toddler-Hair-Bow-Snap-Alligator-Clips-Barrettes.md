    <li> These are great. I wish they were a little less expensive (I bought them for $15.99), since my daughter has already lost some and will continue to lose more (she is under 2). They stay in her fine hair pretty well, but she can pull them out when she wants.</li>
    <li> Love these hair clips. Great for accessorizing pony tails or pulling back stray locks of hair. The color range makes it very easy to match to any outfit.</li>
    <li> Not durable, ribbon comes off immediately.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I&#x27;d hoped! Great, inexpensive, cute clips. I really love them because they aren&#x27;t super girly, but they keep my daughter&#x27;s hair from her eyes.</li>
    <li> I love these! I bought them for my one year old daughter, who has longer hair that is thin so it is always flopping in her face. These actually stay in and don&#x27;t move, unless she rips them off course. They are adult sized, but I love that they come in pairs of two in a wide variety of colors and shades! No gray though...</li>
    <li> Hipgirl Boutique Girls 40pc (20X2pc) 2&amp;#34; Ribbon: These keep our two year old&#x27;s hair out of her face! She is growing more independent now and combing her hair in the morning can sometimes be an ordeal. What&#x27;s great is there are so many colors that I pick four-five of them and let her pick what color she wants to wear so she feels like she is in control. So easy to use to! I like that there are so many of them they can match whatever outfit she has on. Plus if she loses one (which she often does), there are so many left over she has many more to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the ribbons started coming off one, but it&#x27;s still a metal clip underneath so it&#x27;s not a big deal. I just use that one for home use.</li>
    <li> Cute on my 14 months old baby...love al d colors</li>
    <li> These batters are very nice in super colors.  They hold tight and look great in the hair.  I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love the colors. A few of the ribbons at the smaller tip have slipped off from the snap, but were easy to glue back into place.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble finding clips that would stay in place for my 2yr old who has very fine hair. These work very well.</li>
    <li> Every color you can want. Kids love them. The ribbons stay on and the clips are sturdy.</li>
    <li> I liked these more than I thought for the price.  The ribbon is of good quality and is firmly attached to the clips.  They are a good size too, not too big or too small.  A month later they&#x27;re still holding up!  The ribbon hasn&#x27;t come unglued and that&#x27;s with being clipped and unclipped MULTIPLE times a day.</li>
    <li> Awesome clips, please make more colors!</li>
    <li> Happy with this purchase.</li>

    <li> These are very cute and good size, but each one I have used unravels when I remove them from my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Clips and more clips. Good range of colors and done in pairs.</li>

    <li> Great for toddler girls.&lt;br /&gt;I have twin daughters and they are.very happy using them.</li>
    <li> Bought these snap clips for my 4-year old niece and she loved it. The clips are tight and the assortment of colors looks really nice on her.</li>
    <li> I love these!  So cute. And they are prettier than the goody brand.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 5 and I&#x27;ve been putting accessories of all types in her hair nearly everyday day since she was a newborn. I love these ribbon clips. They are sturdy and hold her hair in place, they are a nice size so they grab a good amount of hair and they are high quality. They even came in a quality box that I&#x27;ve kept them in. I&#x27;m really going to try hard not to lose any of them!</li>
