    <li> Love these products. My kids now think I&#x27;m a salon and are coming over just to use the Gelish products. This base and top coat are the perfect pair to ensure a long lasting protective coat. The base coat prevents my nails from turning color or ruining the finish of the natural nail. The top coat is high quality and I use my hands for filing and no scratches. Keeps the shine until you take it off.</li>
    <li> Daughter purchased for her nail salon; works perfectly.</li>
    <li> YAY! NICE FULL SIZE BOTTLE OF BASE AND TOP COATS. GOES ON SMOOTH AS THE GELISH POLISH DOES. I&#x27;M A HAPPY GAL!</li>
    <li> As always, i love the base and the top coat!</li>
    <li> Love the gelish base and top coat. Have been using Gelish products for more than a year and am more than pleased with their line.</li>
    <li> I love this brand. It&#x27;s great because you don&#x27;t need to shake them like shellac. It&#x27;s a good price for both products.</li>
    <li> I have been officially converted. Nail polish lasts a day, not even a whole day. The last time I painted my nails it was at night before going to bed. The next morning at work I had a chip before 10AM. My nails are soft and peeling and I needed something stronger. I love nail polish that feels thick and strong. When using this gel polish stay away from your cuticles and use the Top it Off VERY sparingly. Otherwise it will pool in your cuticle areas and leave a ridge. Overall my manicure is smooth and glossy. I even banged my hand when I put it back in the light on the second coat (of Light Elegant color) and didn&#x27;t even get gouges. I&#x27;m delighted with this product! Thank you Gelish for making a professional product available to me.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, professional quality.  I use it on my clients as well as myself and my nails last a long time.  I&#x27;m a nail tech and I always have on french.  My french manicure lasted 2 weeks, my clients always asked for their nails done like my when they see my nails.  Great product and delivery was quick.</li>
    <li> I use this gel with a UV light and it cures just great. Paired with my favorite gel color, this gel lasts for at least 3 weeks without showing any signs of chipping or peeling! Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Bought the kit to attempt to save some money by avoiding the nail salon and the Asian ladies. Love this!!!</li>
    <li> I had a hard time getting an even surface on my nail because the brush in the top it off was difficult to glide on the nail.  It just wasnt the same as you&#x27;d be use to like with normal nail polish.  I had to re-do a few nails because sometimes the top it off gel will become kind of clumpy in certain spots on the nail.</li>
    <li> Its keeps on peeling and written it arrived it came in ibd packing not sure if its authentic hellish have been using per instruction and have not been able to get magnicure to last longer them 2 days without peeling</li>
    <li> Gelish brand is by far better than other gel polish brands (IBD etc..)  Very good results when used with Gelish brand polishes.</li>
    <li> I Love it!  Very fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I just did my nails at home for the very first time and these products worked well.  Follow instructions and make sure to use thin coats!</li>
    <li> I would not use this product again . I have been doing my nails using a different product for over a year and no problems. I thought I would try it as it said it last longer.  Well it did but it also took my natural nail off along with it. When I took the cotton off my nail beds were raw and what ever nail I had left just peeled off.</li>
    <li> I love this set. I think it&#x27;s great and get your money&#x27;s worth. One of the better deals for the necessary top and base coats</li>
    <li> For a &amp;#34;do it at home&amp;#34; product, this Gelish product works very well.  I was needing a way to keep up my nails at home, between appointments, and this one works better than I imagined they would.  The larger size helps to keep me going even though I live an hour from town.  It applies easily, with the LED lights it cures so quickly, and it lasts very well.  These products came quickly and were very well packaged.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Same as the nail salon or beauty supply store. I had an issue with one of the bottles and it was replaced promptly. These are full size bottles. They will last me a very long time.</li>
    <li> Great item. Thank you. This brand is very durable and shiny for a long lasting manicure. You will love it!</li>
    <li> I have used Sally Hansen, IBD, and some other brand and Gelish base and top coats work the best. I use IBD color polishes. They are thinner but I don&#x27;t mind applying more coats for the price.</li>
    <li> Works very well with my gelish nail colors and light. The top coat makes my nails look like I spent a lot of money at a salon to get them done.</li>
    <li> Tried many brands and Gelish foundation is the best! I use it with many different brands of gel polish color and it by far has the best staying power. I also prefer Gelish top coat too! It&#x27;s the shiniest and doesnt yellow on white. (as fast as the other brands when the clients tan or are out in the sun a lot)</li>
    <li> These work great. Got them on time. Thanks for the great job.</li>
    <li> like just peels to quick</li>
    <li> I just got done using this product &amp; my nails look fabulous. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product. It&#x27; s so much cheaper than Sally&#x27;s &amp; you get way more. The shipping was so fast. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome base and top coat!</li>
    <li> I love this set!!! Best gel base and topcoat I have tired yet!!! Last up to 2 weeks with no chips!!! I will never use any other brand!!</li>
    <li> Well worth the money because when purchased at a local beauty supply store you don&#x27;t even get half of what you can  purchase online on Amazon.  The product line is very easy to use and gives you a great gel manicure.  I have a collection of a few different products and this one is one of my favorites.  But make sure you have all of the products needed otherwise you end up with yucky sticky nails.</li>
