      <li>I open the cap and it is full of product.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t break me out, doesn&#x27;t make my skin super dry, really</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine, haven&#x27;t noticed any changes good or bad in my skin.</li>
      <li>.. I can&#x27;t live w/</li>
      <li>live in Minnesota</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>On the plus side, the scent is pleasant and it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>

      <li>She has sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I actually prefer it to the more pricey ones, because it&#x27;s not as harsh.</li>
      <li>It is the only one that I&#x27;ve found that completely agrees with my skin!  </li>
      <li>This facial wash left my face feeling smooth and almost all the black heads on my nose are gone.</li>

      <li>I have normal skin...not overly oily, not too dry.  </li>
      <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have delicate skin that dries easily, but wouldn&#x27;t consider myself allergy-prone.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think people realize how many companies test on animals at least a little bit.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My daughter swears by this.  She has sensitive skin and she loves this.  Provides the moisturizing without making her skin too oily (she is in her teens).  To be honest, this is the only product she will use..</li>
    <li> The smell is weird but I think it works alright.</li>
    <li> I rally like the results, but my bottle when stored upright leaked EVERYWHERE. I open the cap and it is full of product. So don&#x27;t put it on its cap. Lay it on the side or cap up if you can wedge it between something. I even hit the cap in the counter to make sure it is shut tight, but sure enough in the morning soap was everywhere.</li>
    <li> Almost my favorite face cleanser now.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this at the drugstore and really liked it. It cleans well without stripping the natural moisture. Great price!</li>
    <li> Still my favorite face wash! I&#x27;m not nervous to use it on my sensitive skin and the smell is growing on me. It keeps my skin feeling soft and gets off most of my makeup at night (using a toner afterward will get everything else off)! About to purchase my third bottle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this wash three times but so far I really like it. I don&#x27;t notice much of a smell either. It&#x27;s gentle and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I&#x27;m very acne prone and I have very severe eczema and this doesn&#x27;t hurt/burn/irritate me at all. In fact, my face feels really calm afterwards. However, I do not just use the soap alone (as you&#x27;re not really supposed to). I pat my face dry and follow it with Simple&#x27;s Toner and then moisturizer. But even before applying the last 2 I still feel like my skin is soft. As for Unilever testing on animals, the company made a statement in which they stated that the majority of their products are not tested on animals but they are working to eliminate all testing. I don&#x27;t think people realize how many companies test on animals at least a little bit. You wouldn&#x27;t be able to use practically anything. Anyway, I read that some people are calling BS on this because it irritated their skin. But if you read the ingredients it does contain products from plant sources so it would make sense that some people would have allergies against them. Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this facial wash.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine, haven&#x27;t noticed any changes good or bad in my skin. I don&#x27;t have any allergies or skin issues so I am kind of neutral on this product. It cleans well..</li>
    <li> I do like this face wash as just that, a gentle face wash. It isn&#x27;t going to remove all your makeup if that&#x27;s what you are looking for. It provides a gentle clean and leaves my face feeling soft and not oily at all. I love it as an overall cleanser, but it does nothing along the lines of acne or blemishes.</li>
    <li> This face wash is perfect for sensitive skin and easy to order on Amazon so you never run out!! I will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> there was some problem on delivery but product itself fit to me&lt;br /&gt;the reason I keep this order is that I had tried before and feel so good&lt;br /&gt;I wish more careful of packaging and delivery that&#x27;s all</li>
    <li> this product is so under rated my skin is sensitive and it does a wonderful job an a little product goes a long way</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin and it gets all the gunk of my face. I use the whole Simple skincare line and I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this simple cleanser.  Very gentle on my skin!  It&#x27;s my new favorite!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something gentle for my skin and moisturizing. This was recommended to me and I just love it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and I can see an improvement in my skin. It is not dry and flaky any more. My skin is soft and doesn&#x27;t have that tight dry feeling. It doesn&#x27;t make your face greasy either, it balances the Ph of your skin. I recommend this too you even if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. You should always use gentle products on tender face skin... believe me your skin will thank you!</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst face washes i have ever used. I have normal to dry skin and while it moisturizes fairly well it does a terrible job cleaning. It leaves my face feeling oily and the small bit of acne i had when i started using it only got worse. Will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> Great product--cleans without drying my skin--I am 70 years old.</li>
    <li> Cleans my oily skin very well and smells nice, too. I use a little bit at a time with tepid water. I never scrub and I only wash for about ten seconds. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I have oily, acne prone skin and this did not over-hydrate me to the point of breakouts. I also don&#x27;t have any clogged pores. It&#x27;s the most gentle cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used and the least expensive. I actually prefer it to the more pricey ones, because it&#x27;s not as harsh. There&#x27;s no nasty fragrance, either.</li>
    <li> Came across this product for the first time while living in England and became obsessed. I have very sensitive skin and this product cleans really well without irritating</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t break me out, doesn&#x27;t make my skin super dry, really affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using for months, no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Minnesota (super dry right now in the winter) but am from/often visit the gulf coast (extremely humid), and it works great in both climates.</li>
    <li> This facial wash left my face feeling smooth and almost all the black heads on my nose are gone. Unfortunately , this has left the skin on my nose, under my eyes, and chin feel like I have just revived a sun burn, I live in NY and its the middle of winter. It has been so painful and the only thing that managed to relieve it was some Aloe Vera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had sensitive skin my entire life. I grew up having to try multiple lotions, and soaps that do not irritate my skin since I have bad case eczema and rosacea. This probably one of the worst products I have tried. I would not recommend this to anyone with skin problems.</li>
    <li> Great product! All natural and after using it twice a day for about a month it makes your face glow. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year and haven&#x27;t stopped loving it!</li>
    <li> Great as a pre shave prep for men. I like how it softens my beard before I shave. Also having few chemicals helps to minimize skin irritation</li>
    <li> I use this with a Clarisonic and get great results. Face feels clean w/o being stripped of all moisture. Warning - if you store this on a shower floor, open it slightly before packing ... water seems to collect inside the lid and you want the excess water to drip out before it shares space with your clothes.</li>
    <li> I just brought this product today...after reading all the positive reviews on different websites...excited to go home and try it I cleaned my face of my makeup I had on today. So I put the face wash on my clarisonic and I washed my face...my skin felt regular nothing surprising or different. About 10 minutes later I noticed a bump on my chin it felt like a mosquito bite and it was very itchy...I just put some tea tree oil on it...15 minutes later, bumps are all around my chin and itchy it looked like I broke out in hives on my chin..it is very itchy and red...I had hopes for this product but it was just a disappointment..I have never had a problem with any other face wash...I will be returning this product...I am trying to calm my skin as I type this...this is horrible. NEVER AGAIN!!!</li>
    <li> Have not tried out yet but its bugger than i imagined</li>
    <li> I have tried every facewash under the sun...in every price range.  I have normal skin...not overly oily, not too dry.  This facewash is great for every day use.  Removes makeup well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  It is the only one that I&#x27;ve found that completely agrees with my skin!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works well as a face wash but doesn&#x27;t work as a makeup remover</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin year-round, as well as the occasional breakout around my chin. I had been using a cheap drugstore brand of face wash and thought that I would try this to see if it helped. I use Simple&#x27;s Replenishing Rich Moisturizer on a daily basis and really love it. But after one use, this Moisturizing Facial Wash made my already dry skin even drier, to the point where the skin on my nose and chin started to flake. This might work for people who don&#x27;t have issues with very dry skin, but it definitely did not work for me. On the plus side, the scent is pleasant and it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wash for almost a year, and I don&#x27;t see myself switching anytime soon. It washes off my makeup without having to use anything else with it. Happy user.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it works well on my sensitive skin, leaves no residue, soaps up nicely and rinses cleanly.</li>
    <li> Love this product, love how my skins feels and dont need to use alot to wash your face</li>
    <li> I love this face wash, it&#x27;s gentle on my skin and doesn&#x27;t break me out.  I have dealt with cystic acne in the past and this helps to prevent it.  I always used expensive dept store face wash until now.. I can&#x27;t live w/out this product which I use with my clarisonic.</li>
    <li> This is my third tube of the stuff.  Unscented, leaves my dry, sensitive skin feeling clean and moisturized...really nice.</li>
    <li> Sucksssss. Do not buy. Yes, it moisturizes but also makes your face break out with small itchy bumps and redness after a few uses. I bought this at kroger and returned it after a week</li>
    <li> The Simple Facial Wash is overall pretty good, I use it mostly for gentle cleaning and moisturizing. It&#x27;s not really for acne, pimples, or blackheads, and contains none of the standard acne fighting ingredients (salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, etc). It has a really delicate smell and forms only a small lather, but a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have delicate skin that dries easily, but wouldn&#x27;t consider myself allergy-prone. I pair this cleanser with a light, SPF moisturizer during the day to prevent over drying. Currently my favorite daily moisturizer is the [[ASIN:B009RNUH7M Simple Moisturizer SPF15]] from this brand.</li>
    <li> Does not irritate my super sensitive skin and does not break the bank.  Perfect.</li>
</ol>
