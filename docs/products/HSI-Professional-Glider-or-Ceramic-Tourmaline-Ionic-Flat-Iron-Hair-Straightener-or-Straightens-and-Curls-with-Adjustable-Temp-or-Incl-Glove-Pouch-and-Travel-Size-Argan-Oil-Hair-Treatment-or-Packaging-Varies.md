<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very quick to heat up. Works great.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!! Better than an ultra CHI.</li>
    <li> Straightener snags the hair. Not worth $60</li>
    <li> I have very dry thick, long, wavy hair. I love this flat iron, it&#x27;s small but packs a punch. It left my hair looking shiny and healthy. I was also able to do my hair in under an hour and it usually take me up to 2 hours!! I just ordered a second one for my sister. This is a fantastic product and won&#x27;t break the bank! Not to mention the service was excellent, I received my flat iron way before the estimated delivery date.</li>
    <li> Flat iron is easy to use. Heats up quickly and stays hot throughout use. Easy grip and cord is on a swivel which allows for twisting of the iron without the cord getting in the way. I love to use this iron to curl my hair. Able to straighten and curl my hair at the same time. Also the oil (Argan) leaves hair feeling soft and healthy. Usually I put the oil in (just a dime size) throughout my hair before flat ironing or curling. It helps to prevent burning and drying and hair. It also helps to hold the curl longer. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I usually do not write product reviews, but I had to tell people about the HSI Professional Flat Iron. I have brought and tried so many flat irons in my time, but this one is THE BEST! Most of the flat irons out there will leave your hair smelling like its burnt. I am a African American female who has thick wavy hair. This flat iron, with the argon oil makes my hair straight and shiny, and it looks and feels amazing. If you are in the market for a good flat iron that is reasonably priced, you can not go wrong with this one. I highly reccommand it.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, more wavy then curly hair and I have been looking for a good flat iron. Usually it takes about 2 hrs to straighten my hair but this really only took about 30-45 min.Which is a major improvement for me. The oil is amazing and it leaves your hair looking nice and shiny.</li>
    <li> This unit is packaged nicely, and is well made. It&#x27;s color is black and ridged to avoid slipping from your grip. It has a power light, a temperature control dial, a swivel cord (to avoid tangle), and the plug has a circuit breaker. The smooth ceramic plates heat quickly, and straighten as they should. A very good product at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Would recommend to anyone! Great service!</li>
    <li> I have many flat irons but wanted a 1&amp;#34; one with high heat. I bought this one because the description sounded just like what I wanted. It has more than met my expectations. I can style my hair as well as straighten my hair with this flat iron and it does it fast. It heats up very fast and does not pull my hair. I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> excellent iron for the price, it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. It&#x27;&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great at getting the kinks out, quick touch ups, and leaves the hair silky smooth. Multiple heat settings makes it great for almost any hair type.</li>
    <li> Very well made, I really like the glove it comes with and the oil! Lightweight easy to handle, packaging very nice...fast delivery time...very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I purchased this to replace my chi iron that had broke and this is better quailty than the chi iron! And fast shipping even over the holidays!</li>
    <li> this is one of the best flat irons I have ever used better than my CHI I highly recommend it and what a great price you just cant go wrong here ! And I buy on amazon ALOT several times per month I highly recommend buying all of your styling products through blue novelties on amazon.com these guys are 5 stars for a reason they are seriously excellent customer service and everything I have ordered has been above my expectations they have wowed me once again w/ their fast friendly and affordable services</li>
    <li> Nice flat iron. Left my hair straight and silky. The temp dial is a real plus!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! Nice pouch and oil included as well. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I love my iron. Heats up quickly and does it all.</li>
    <li> My aunt absolutely loved her HSI Proffesional straightener! She wanted a long skinny one like her hairstylist used but at a good price because her hair is often dry. I did some research and chose this one because of price, the oil, and the reviews! I am glad I did! When she uses it, her hair is ramrod straight and looks really shiny and healthy! Love it! It&#x27;s very similar to professional salon products and does a great job.</li>
    <li> I ordered this iron, and it didn&#x27;t get hot enough. When I went to go through the proceedures of return, I was asked if I would like to try a new one. They had no problems sending me a second one to try. The second iron did not work as it did not get hot enough either. I have returned both, and it&#x27;s been over a month and I havent yet received my money back.  This product is not worth the time or money.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend actually did a search for the best flat iron out there, and this one is the top sellers and best price. This flat iron does not make me miss my last flat iron which was 2x more expensive. It leaves my hair soft, silky, and shinny!  It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my hair smell as though something&#x27;s burning. I would definitely recommend this to any girl. The reviews helped a lot as well in selecting this iron. Thank you HSI!!!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a flat iron for a while now and I came across this one. I decided to give it a shot and I am SO relieved with the results! I have really curly, frizzy hair. When I first used it, it turned my hair into the hair that I have always dreamed of, stright, non frizzy hair. I have had several other straighteners and havent seen anything close to the results as this one! I am soo thrilled that I decided to buy this strightner. It is worth you money and you won&#x27;t regret buying it. 👍</li>
    <li> This flat iron is incredible for the money.Far better than my Chi.My hair is so soft and shiny aftervamd this works amazing for curling as well.The free sample of argon oil is AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> Heats quickly, curls and straightens well.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to change the heat setting very easily.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loved it. I highly recommend this great flat iron.</li>
    <li> The HSI PROFESSIONAL flat iron has gone above and beyond any expectations that I had of this product.  After going through many flat irons including a CHI flat iron, I was a little reluctant to buy the HSI PROFESSIONAL because of the  low price but I am so glad that I did. I have never been able to get my hair as straight as I wanted to until I used the HSI PROFESSTIONAL.  Using some of the argon oil that comes with it my hair has never been straighter or more shinier.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a flat iron at a very reasonable price and hair that looks like a professional did it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Shipped super quick. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This was the flat iron my daughter wanted and she is happy with the results she gets. If she is happy I am happy :) and she&#x27;s had no problems so 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Very professional looking including the packaging. High quality at a good price. Very pleased with purchased.</li>
    <li> Heats fast, easy to handle with long cord. Have used a flat iron for years and this is definitely one of the best. Fast shipping and easy transaction.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter as a birthday present. She absolutely loves it and says it is much better than a previous brand she had tried.</li>
    <li> I am a first time user of a flat iron and I am extremely impressed at the ease of use and how well it works with no distruction  of my frail hair. Shipping was fast, packaging well done. Would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it and I love it too. They make great Christmas gifts</li>
    <li> The product is very good, arrived sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> I LOVE MY NEW STRAIGHTNER! ITS ALL IN MY HANDS OF WHAT HAIRSTYLE I WILL BE DOING FOR THE DAY, EASY AND SIMPLE FLIP, CURL, OR STRAIGHTEN ALL DONE WITH THIS AMAZING 1 TOOL. NOT TO MENTION IT WAS DELIVERED EARLIER THAN EXPECTED! ☆☆☆☆☆ ;)</li>
    <li> Like the fact that it can be used on both 110volts and 220 volts.  Prevents need for an adapter overseas.</li>
    <li> Great product and received as expected. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron last Christmas for my daughter who uses it daily.  We liked it so well I&#x27;m ordering one for my niece this Christmas. It is made well and preforms well.  Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> The flat iron is great but sometimes doesn&#x27;t heat like I want to and it pulls my hair. I mean i love the iron the price was great but i was expecting not to pull my hair,</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend as a secret Santa present. She has used it several times and is not crazy about it. She said it pulls her hair if she&#x27;s not careful with it. She rated it &amp;#34;just ok&amp;#34;... Good for the price point, but definitely not the best out there</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I have been using another quite expensive flat iron,but this one puts it to shame. My hair is thick and very long. Eliminates all the frizz and looks shiny and healthy without damaging my hair. I&#x27;m extremely happy my wonderful husband found this and bought it for me!</li>
    <li> this product is so nice... i was amazed when i tried it, my hair is so very smooth especially when i used the argan oil it helps alot... 100% i recommend this product...</li>
    <li> This flat iron DOES NOT PULL OUT YOUR HAIR like others. It leaves for a very slick and clean finish. I also don&#x27;t feel like I am burning my hair off. It stays straight for days:)</li>
    <li> Reall good quality product!  I have very thick asian hair, no problems with straightening my thick hair, you have the high heat option on this flat iron, not like the poor quality ones in the dimestore...</li>
    <li> Update! I&#x27;ve used the hair iron everyday since purchase and it&#x27;s definitely a 5 star product!     Original review:    I&#x27;m giving this a 4 star so far, since it&#x27;s still a new product to me. I suspect over time, it will be a 5 star product. I&#x27;ve used it several times and it works great. Really, you can&#x27;t beat the price. I was a bit nervous at first, thinking it couldn&#x27;t possibly be good if it&#x27;s so cheap, but most of the reviews speak highly, so I took a chance. And it paid off! This is now my go-to flattening iron. If you need a back-up, or a new one (as was the case for me) this is the iron to get!</li>
    <li> This is a very good iron. Whether I want my hair with curls or straight I always get the results I want. The glove is really handy. The only reason I am not giving this iron a 5 star rating is because I think it takes a little for it to get hot. Other than that it works great and I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Great price; great product!</li>
    <li> This straightener is not too expensive and works great, a hair dresser used it on me and told me they were the best brand.</li>
    <li> This flatiron works better than expected. Heats up in about a minute. You can feel the quality when you hold it. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice Iron, works well. I have very thick hair so it takes a little longer to do than with my old stand by that is much wider. Overall I would purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product...use it daily....as good as any high dollar flat iron !!</li>
    <li> Love how hot this device gets. I can easily straighten or curl my hair in no time.</li>
    <li> Product is not working properly. I highly disappointed after I purchase this product. Totally unsatisfied  with this product and purchase.</li>
    <li> Great service, came on time in original wrapper. Perfect!</li>
    <li> This a christmas gift.  It was delivered in a timely manner and packed well.  This item is sturdy and it works as well as my old chi if not better. My daughter-n-law says THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Great product! This iron gets hotter very quickly and does an amazing job. I will also continue with this brand/company. Shipped fast!!!</li>
    <li> this is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever tried. It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair leaves it nice soft and stays in for several days. Loving the way my hair is looking using it!</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron, especially for traveling abroad.  I took it to Spain for a trip and it worked perfectly (just needed to use a plug adapter).  I liked it so well that I replaced my daily flat iron with this one and have been using for the last 3 months.  Works well, doesn&#x27;t make my hand hot during use like other irons.  I was pleasantly surprised, especially at the price.</li>
    <li> This works amazingly well heats up fast</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times so far, but I like it! My fine hair is straightened, and not damaged in the process.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron for my daughter&#x27;s Birthday and she absolutely loves it! We had her Birthday party at a Restaurant and our server, who was a very pretty curly redhead even commented that it was the one she uses, and loves, and said that &amp;#34;if it can straighten this (pointing to her hair) it can straighten anything&amp;#34;! My daughter has used it several times already and agrees, it&#x27;s the best she&#x27;s ever used. So, we&#x27;re pretty happy!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is awesome!!! It glides right through my hair &amp; takes out ALL of the frizz!</li>
    <li> Great item works great love it :)</li>
    <li> Fast  shipping works very goodI would buy again</li>
    <li> Works well.  Leaves my hair shiny.  I have not used the glove, but always have the iron on low setting, maybe that&#x27;s why.  I would give it 5 stars but I am still learning how to use it.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is exactly as advertised prompt service and delivery,would buy one again.</li>
    <li> I went through two Chi straighteners that lasted less than a year before researching it and finding this HSI straightener!  I bought my first HSI straightener over 3 years ago for less than half the price of the Chi, and it is still going strong plus works even better than the Chi!  Straightens hair very fast and makes beautiful curls too!  Just bought another one while they were on sale so I will have it on hand if needed!  Thanks for the great straightener!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 2 weeks now, works great so far. There is a pretty bright indicator light that turns from red to green when it&#x27;s heated and ready, which only take about a minute. The heat is controlled by a round dial, which I have turned to the halfway point and it is plenty hot. The plug is a little beefier than the last hot iron I had, it actually has those little yellow/red buttons on it. Good flat iron for the value.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  It doesn&#x27;t burn your hair and the oil included makes your hair so soft!  Love it!</li>
    <li> - receieved items a little late, it was okay because it was only 1-2 days at the latest.&lt;br /&gt;- flat iron works well.&lt;br /&gt;- the item(s) I got were in extremely good condition, nothing wrong with it thus far.&lt;br /&gt;- this flat iron works extremely well on my hair (my hair is thick and wavy/curly), just a couple times over and it&#x27;s just how I like my hair to be styled, works really well in curling my hair and flipping my hair as well&lt;br /&gt;- works just as well as my old flat iron, which was a Paul Mitchell brand&lt;br /&gt;- you should try it :)</li>
    <li> Had a gold not hot flat iron for 7 years. Did the job well but I needed an upgrade once it started giving trouble. I must say I love this, every bit of it. Been using it for a while and it does the job perfectly. Worth every penny indeed. You can straighten and flip your hair at the end. Also love the little pouch it comes with. Simple not wonderful.</li>
    <li> Everything about this product is great. This is one of the best flat irons I have ever used. It is much heavier duty than the Chi models. The price is phenomenal and it is so well made. It shipped out super quick and we are extremely happy about our new HSI flat iron. I know I will never buy another brand again. Thank You HSI.</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loved the flat irons. She has very thick, very tightly curled hair and this straightened her hair like she went to Julia Dominican Hair Salon! It doesn&#x27;t smoke up the house like her cheap crappy flat irons either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought many flat irons, this one is by far the best!! I won&#x27;t buy another brand again, not even for a gift.</li>
    <li> Excellent upgrade to an already excellent product! Still have the old one but upgraded for the holidays. Highly recommend this flattener for all hair types. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Love the hot iron but didn&#x27;t get the oil that said came with it</li>
    <li> The product was purchased for my wife.  I can vouch that she is using it everyday and is working out great for her.  We received the product earlier than we expected it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product and we would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Does just what I want it to.. straighten my hair. Heats up fast. The bonus HSI argan oil sample was nice too.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is AMAZING! My hair is so thick and curly that others usually don&#x27;t hold their heat, but this one never looses heat. It&#x27;s also small and compact for easy storage. Mine came with a very nice travel/storage case to keep it organized! Absolutely recommend this flat iron to anyone looking for one at a great price!</li>
    <li> Great straightener! Left my dry and frizzy hair feeling soft and smooth. Great price also. Would definitely order again in the future.</li>
    <li> Wonderful sturdy iron! Works just as well, if not better than my iron that costs more than 3x the HSI iron!! I travel and am constantly on the go and the convenient travel bag is aesthetically on point as well. I can make curls and waves, as well as precision straight styles with this iron. Heats up incredibly fast.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. It&#x27;s exactly how I imagined it to work. My hair looks great every time I use it. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I Love this flat iron!  It heats up fast and the plates glide over your hair smoothly. (My old flatiron always tore some strands out.) The temp adjust is great, I can use it on my thick hair and my daughters fine hair.  My hair is very thick, the high setting made it stick straight in one pass. This is an awesome iron for the price!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love the HSI professional hair straightening iron it does a great job and I like the fact that you can change the heat settings I also like the fact that it heats up almost instantly. I also have tried the oil and it doesn&#x27;t take much it make my hair soft and very manageable. I just wish I had this a long time ago. I will be trying more products from this brand.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy my flat iron purchase they are awesome and the great gifts.  I most definitely would recommend these high end flat irons for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron!  Does a great job straightening my curly hair  :)</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! It&#x27;s the perfect width and works great for straightening and curling my hair. It heats up really quickly and makes it easy to use</li>
    <li> Great gift for my daughter. Read all the comments and compared to other flat irons and this seems to be the best value. If it works as well as others have commented I am certain she will love it.</li>
    <li> Great quality product for good price. I like the long legnth of the cord. Shipping was fast and it was packaged well.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing what usually takes me 45 minutes to do only took 9 minutes!  Better than both cei. I was promised if I did review I would receive smaller hsi just like I bought and never received.  Guess so the review would help them out. I do love this iron but not happy being lied to.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair sleek and smooth.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing. I have naturally curly hair and it leaves my hair soft, smooth, and straight. Awesome product! Worth every penny! Loved so much that I ordered a second one.</li>
    <li> I would give it 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t have to keep hitting the reset button on the plug to make it turn on.</li>
    <li> This the first time using HSI flat iron. Have used many others in the past some more expensive. I used it for the first time Christmas day. I have very curly type 3 hair. My hair was very smooth and I only had to do one pass to get my hair straight. I also love the Argan oil that came with it. My new favorite flat iron.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a xmas gift and she LOVED it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She used to  use an walmart conair straightener, and for the past 10 years or so, she always complained about her hair not been able to be straightened. She even thought it was the hairdresser&#x27;s fault for weakening the tip of her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time she used the HSI, she went like &#x27;WOW, this straightener is SOOOOOOO AWESOME, my hair has never been this straight before, WOW!!!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> came without oil and does NOT keep hair straight. I slept on it and it was curlier than it dried out of the shower</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and works great! Perfect item.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product. I was surprised how well it works for such a good price! I will be purchasing this brand from now on.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice iron, especially for the price.  It&#x27;s definitely comparable to other professional products with a higher price tag.  I have thick hair which is sometimes hard to work with, but this has been working really well for me.</li>
    <li> Great flattiron. Fast shipping. Heats up fast. Love the pouch, glove and travel oil. Replaced my Chi flatiron with this one. Great price. Would have given 5 stars if it had auto shut off, although my Chi didn&#x27;t have that feature either so I am used to turning off.</li>
    <li> Worth the money for sure. It&#x27;s a good flat iron, it heats up quickly and the temperature is actually consistent (unlike many other brands), more importantly, the customer service is crazy good. Mine started acting kinda weird after 1 week of daily use (yeah yeah, I know, I use it too often) but I simple contacted them through Amazon they IMMEDIATELY sent me a new one. So rad. The argan oil they send with it is great, I&#x27;ll probably buy more. Also, it comes with a sweet little travel bag that is actually heat resistant, not that it matters since the thing cools down so quickly. No more burn marks on my vanity table!</li>
    <li> Heats up so quick! 15 min i am ready, super soft and shiny&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT! Great price as well!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. I bought this for my 13 yr old daughter to replace a Chi straightener. She was skeptical, but after using this iron, she was no less than excited. She says the iron straightens hair very easily and she finds it handy that she has more options for styling her hair with the HSI iron. I would not hesitate to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> I have finally found the perfect hair straightener! I have very coarse, naturally curly hair and it is long. I air dry my hair and then straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;The 450 degrees is great. My hair does not get burned from it! This is the silkiest my hair has ever been.</li>
    <li> Sorry not for me !!!!!!!.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I have used this straightener for about 3 times now ever since i bought it 2 weeks ago and its fabulous! It heats up pretty quickly and straightens in 1 go. I also tried doing curls which comes out pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;Best part is it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair like the cheap straighteners. I had a regular revlon which would cause so much damage to the hair that I had stopped using straighteners altogether. Hands down this is the best that too at a decent price!!&lt;br /&gt;Sample size Argan oil that came with this is brilliant and I sure am gonna order more once i run out of this.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing this doesn&#x27;t have is digital meter to show the temprature like all fancy one&#x27;s but not something i can&#x27;t live without.</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair, not too course. I have had many flat irons in the past and I have to say this is one of THE best one I have used ao far. It also didnt hurt that it was reasonably price. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love it! it&#x27;s the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair is shiny and soft and definitely straight!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now and I absolutely love it. It has cut down on the time that I would normally take to flat iron my hair with my old flat iron. I like the temperature setting very much. I also love the little red bad that I can store it in. The sample argan oil that came with it was excellent. Really love the smell.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new flat iron and stumbled  across this one on amazon.  It had great reviews but i was a little skeptical. I eventually decided to buy it and i must say that i am happy I did! The iron heats up quickly and works great wonders on my thick hair. I also love how soft your hair feels afterwards! The packaging  is so nice! Thank you.  I definitely recommend..</li>
    <li> Great flat iron!  I had one previously.  My visiting daughter loved it, so it went home with her :-).  I found I couldn&#x27;t live without it, so I bought another one for myself.  Easy to use and I find it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.  Thanks for a great product.  It&#x27;s reasonably priced too--bonus!</li>
    <li> I just turned 60 I have natural curly hair (I mean curly) I got my hair cut a couple of months ago the lady used a flat iron on my hair I loved the look. I really thought boy that would be a whole bunch of trouble every day. I decided I was going to buy one for myself for Christmas I got the HSI Professional  1 Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic. I have been experimenting with it for a week I can now get my hair straighten and styled in 10 or 15 min. I have gotten comments on how good it looks and even taken a few years off my looks!!! LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this way before date expected! I love it. It is sleek &amp; served it&#x27;s purpose/</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great for my hair. I have thick wavy hair and it usually takes me a very long time to straighten my hair and it does not stay that way very long. With this flat iron it only took 1 or 2 passes and it stayed straight. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great value for the money. This is an excellent professional quality tool for home or salon use. I highly recommend this item. Good buy. Was so pleased with the results on a friends hair they ordered one also. Great on natural and relaxed hair. Heats up quickly too.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great &amp; heats up super fast! My hair is naturally wavy but the HSI straightens my hair quickly &amp; with ease. I also love how easy it is to use the HSI to flip or curl the ends of my hair. This is a purchase you will not regret!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener and its the best one for the price! The customer service was also awesome. If you want really straight hair in half the time this is the one to get.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter has tried many  many flat irons.....loves this one!  That&#x27;s saying a lot for a 20 year old.  Love it when nana hits a home run.</li>
    <li> The flat iron came very fast and was just as described. I didn&#x27;t even realize it came in a nice case with a small bottle of serum to use before flat ironing which was a bonus. The flat iron works well I am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> it does not get hot at all, I have returned it because it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my mom. She said it is easy to handle, light enough that it doesn&#x27;t hurt her wrist and the glove helps protect her from potential burns. She uses it to produces great curls and good body on her very straight hair. I&#x27;m glad she&#x27;s happy and if you are looking for a good gift, this is it.</li>
    <li> Love  this!  Heats up fast hold heat and smooths my frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I have had mine only a few months and the heating element went haywire. The straightener gets way too hot and burned my hair. Would NOT recommend!!</li>
    <li> I am not very impressed with this straightener. It leaves my hair frizzy looking. For anybody looking for a new straightener I recommend just splurging and getting a CHI!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product!!  It heats up quickly! It makes my hair soft and shiny!  I recommend it to everyone!! It is by far the best deal I have gotten on a high quality straightener!!  Plus you can&#x27;t beat all of the bonus items it comes with!!</li>
    <li> Excellent flat Iron! Exactly as described and more! Speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> I bough this iron with some reserves because I use the chi one for many years, but I have to say that this flat iron is a wonderful tool, it works super, leave my hair nice,straight and shinny it also heats very fast and have good temperature control plus the price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t straighten as well as the CHI straightener I have had, in my opinion, but I guess for half the price I should have expected it. After reading the reviews I was really excited for this straightener, but it disappointed me to be honest. The oil worked well...similar to Moroccan oil that I currently use. The temperature knob is very loose, makes the product seem somewhat cheap-- but maybe mine is just broken?</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this flat iron, as it seems to be of high quality and gets the job done well.  I would recommend this flat iron to others.  It is a basic flat iron that is easy to use and works well in my hair, which is fairly thin.  It also came in a nice case for traveling, along with a glove.  I am pleased with this purchase and seller.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this straightener out, but it was a huge disappointment. It took multiple tries to get it smoother, even then it wasn&#x27;t as straight as it should be, and my hair isn&#x27;t even that curly or thick. Once I finally got it looking decent, it was quick to frizz and get wavy on its own. Definitely not worth the price and am happy I can return it without an issue. My old drugstore straightener was better than this one.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this flat iron. I was skeptical at first but I am super glad I invested in it. I have very short hair and I am very picky when it comes to flat irons. I came across this one and the reviews were great...plus the price was unbeatable. I totally recommend it for those looking for a flat iron and can&#x27;t afford an expensive one. I absolutely LOVE it!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!  My hair was so damaged from using a cheap straightener, and now it is being restored due to the high quality of this iron.  The free sample of argan oil is a great bonus.  If you are looking for a great priced straightener for your dollar you need to look no further.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is FANTASTIC.  The perks that come with it are great: argon oil, storage bag and glove.  I love that I can use it to straighten my thick unruly hair and still have a little curl at the end due to the rounded edges of the barrel.  My hair is shiny and looks very healthy after using.  You won&#x27;t be sorry after purchasing this profession flat iron without the professional cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not good with curling irons, etc., but decided to try this since my hair tends to frizz, esp. when it&#x27;s humid.  It&#x27;s easy to use and worked well using the low setting.  It&#x27;s beautifully packaged and would make a great gift.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t straighten well, and pulls at your hair the whole time. I contacted the company about returning the product several times and they wouldn&#x27;t respond. Crap product, crap company.</li>
    <li> this was for my daughter and she says it is the best she has owned and was much less than her 2nd best</li>
    <li> This product is really great. The flat iron heats up really fast and gets hair straight the first time  this is my go to flat iron and I recommend this for anyone.</li>
    <li> I have had this float iron for several years, and it has done a terrific job. I purchased a second one and it is sling the same great job. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. The heat settings allow you to adjust it to your hair and not burn it up. Just be careful-it can get HOT. It&#x27;s also dual voltage, so being transient, it is very convenient to switch 110/220V. The pouch is a nice accessory for traveling, as well. I was using a cheaper model by Clairol and it&#x27;s just not the same. This HSI professional heats up quickly, and overall, does a nice job on my hair.</li>
    <li> Its a great flat iron and its heavier than most ,but i like that. its works well on my hair and shines after using it. i would recommend this iron to anyone looking for a flat iron that works great and is affordable!!!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron left my hair very soft and smooth when used with the argon oil. Not dry and brittle as with other irons in the past.Very good iron!</li>
    <li> I gave my wife this flat iron for her birthday, and she loves it. Me personally, love how her hair looks, and feels after using it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a good iron! It doesn&#x27;t break your hair like some of the other straighteners do. It makes your hair stay soft and doesn&#x27;t have that burning smell after using it either. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> HSI digital ceramic straightner .  It heats up fast.  It works well. I did notice that it loses a little bit of heat after about 10 passes. I have to gi e it a few seconds to heat back up to the selected tempature. It fits great in my hand . I like it and I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is amazing product.i really like it</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron not known what to expect because all the other flat iron don&#x27;t really work on my hair but when i use the Hsi i was so happy with it and very happy that i purchased it i love it</li>
    <li> Great Flat iron for the price!!!  Love it!! Works just as good as the $250 one I had before.&lt;br /&gt;It came with a sample size of Argan oil which I love too.  I already ordered a larger size of the argan oil with the coupon they sent.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.  Very efficient service.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  I use it almost every day.  It heats up quickly and glides through my hair.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> First of all, the HSI Professional 1 Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener has been one of my favorites so far. I&#x27;ve used many other straightener brands and I have to say that this one has done its job.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other straightener, this one leaves your hair silky without any frizziness. Also, this straightener is easy to handle since it has a rotating cord if you want o curl your hair with it. Another thing that I liked about the straightener is that it gives your hair this extra shine. I have coarse curly hair and this straightener leaves my hair straight, silky, and no burn damage whatsoever. I believe that this straightener is good for all hair types. For instance, my sister also uses this straightener and he has thin straight hair; however, she has not complained about it yet. In fact, she loves it because it curls her hair like any other curly iron or want. Another thing that I love about this straightener is that it has a manageable heating setting for your own preference. Once you plug it in and turn it on, it starts to heat up. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It has a heating setting for your own needs. Fast heating when turned on.The cord rotates/swivels for easy to handle. It is easy to hold and handle. Leaves hair straight and silky. It&#x27;s perfect for all hair types! Does not leave hair frizzy. Also, You can curl your hair with it! It comes with an aargon oil and a heat resisting baggy. Also it comes with a heat resistant glove so you won&#x27;t burn yourself. Very affordable price for an excellent straightener. It comes with an instructional manual on how to use. It has 1 inch width smooth ceramic plates that allows hair to slide with ease! It doesn&#x27;t get your hair stuck nor damage. It does not leave a burnt smell like some other brands do. The straightener has t his curly look which allows your hair to glide easy if you want to curl your hair. it has an ON/OFF power switch. It contains a heat LED indicator light to show when it&#x27;s on. The power cord is about 6-7 feet long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;So far I have no issues with it but I&#x27;ll update this once I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, compared to my Chi, I can say that it&#x27;s almost about the same quality!! I highly recommend this straightener! This should be a 5/5 no buts! Excellent straightener for an excellent affordable price!</li>
    <li> I purchased it for India.  perfectly working. love this product. don&#x27;t think twice. go for it.</li>
    <li> Excellent straightener....Heats up quickly, and I enjoy the multiple heat settings. Heavier than my previous straightener, which I prefer since it seems sturdier. Great price as well. Love it!</li>
    <li> Used these flat irons to see if they truly hold up to what it say it does and after my test run on my hair I am a believer! I would definately recommend these to women of all nationalities.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as promised ....</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron and I&#x27;m extremely happy with how well it does the job. Came with a little bottle of argan oil that really makes my hair shine. My hair glides through the plates and one pass at about 3/4 of max setting works well on my somewhat fine hair. The storage bag is handy and it comes with a glove to protect your hands but so far I haven&#x27;t needed to use it. Overall I think the set is an incredible value.</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all. I really don&#x27;t see where these THOUSANDS of stellar reviews are coming from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick &amp;#34;white girl&amp;#34; hair... and it&#x27;s just not cutting it for me. It barely straightens it after one pass unlike my old iron. I have to go over several times just to get it straight, and it doesn&#x27;t even do a good job of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another complaint is that this iron feels cheap. I really was not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final complaint is how to turn the machine on: it&#x27;s really cheap looking/feeling. It&#x27;s a little lever (ON THE INSIDE OF THE HANDLE) that you switch on, and use a little rotating knob to turn it up or down. Real cheap looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind you, I do not have expensive tastes, but I don&#x27;t want a product that feels so cheap.</li>
    <li> Love! I had a basic CHI and couldn&#x27;t use it for curling my hair too, HSI works fantastically, dual use! Straightener AND curling. When I travel and want to pack less, this definitely has a space in my bag.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the deal offered on Amazon, and my hair stylist said that HSI is a good brand. It received good reviews on line so I purchased it. It arrived on time. I liked that it had the red and green temp indicator light, and it seemed to hold the temp very well. I had read that this might be an issue, but did not find it to be a problem. Upon trying it, I found it to have a good grip. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it is that it wasn&#x27;t as smooth as I had expected when going through my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron that I have ever used on my hair. It straightens my hair in a very timely matter and lasts for days without showering. II highly recommend this flat iron as well as the oil that goes with it.</li>
    <li> Wow! What a wonderful flat iron. Great customer service too! I would recommend this product to anyone. I have extremely curly hair and my hair is slick straight in 15 minutes. If I can have straight hair then you can too.</li>
    <li> Package arrived on time.  Flat iron performs perfectly; heats up quick, curls just the right amount and cools down quickly also.  Like it more than the Chi flat iron that died on me.</li>
    <li> This iron works great! It came in right on time and the packaging was really nice and strong so no damages at all. When I get ready to use it and turn it on it heats up really fast! The glove is a plus but you really don&#x27;t need it enless you are just super clumsy.  The bag is nice to</li>
    <li> Excellent service and product.  It works great!</li>
    <li> So far my daughter loves this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I used the iron for the first time, what a great iron,heats up very fast works great. The quality of the iron is great. I would buy another one in the future. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! Love it!</li>
    <li> Product shipped quickly and was as promised on the post.  More importantly my wife loves the new flatiron</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a flat iron that I had for the last 5 years that just stopped getting hot.  I was initially skeptical due to the low price, as I had paid a lot more for my previous flat iron, but after reading the reviews, I decided to take a chance.  So glad I did--it works perfectly, gets really hot, and straightens my semi curly hair with just one swipe.  Loving this new iron!!</li>
    <li> LOVE!! That&#x27;s all I need to say.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other professional flat iron I have used.  Graet price for a great product.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Easy transaction, delivered on time and great item not expensive for its quality. I had one that cost me doble the price and HSI does the same job and less expensive. Thank you im satisfied with my product.</li>
    <li> Great great flat iron, just like all the reviews said! Don&#x27;t spend a bunch of money when this one is great and way cheaper! My hair is naturally curly and with other flat irons I uses it looked like horse hair. This one, with a little argan oil, made my hair look nice. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have tried many straight irons which purportedly work overseas--Europe in my case.  This one was exceptionally and delightfully different.  There were no buttons to push or tools to use to force a button one way or the other.  IT WORKED!  When I got to France, even my daughter loved using it.  Easy: just plug it in.  Besides, it&#x27;s hot enough and gentle enough on the hair.  Finally, a flat iron which works both at home and overseas.  Although it is heavier than my travel straight iron, it is worth every ounce and penny.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. Great quality only wish it was a bit lighter weight for travel but otherwise great product.</li>
    <li> The flat iron arrived exactly on the day that the shipping estimate showed: it came with a glove and a sample of their Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;I got this as a replacement for my old Remingtons, one that gave out on me and another that left my hair lookin&#x27; kinda weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first day I used only the flat iron because I was in a hurry; I did notice that it didn&#x27;t leave my hair smelling burnt like my other flat irons tended to do.&lt;br /&gt;The next day I applied the Argan Oil before straightening my hair and within a few applications of the flat iron, felt my hair softening.&lt;br /&gt;This package definitely works best with the oil, as im sure they include it as a free sample for that purpose. I used the coupon code they include in the box and already ordered a 4 oz. bottle of the oil because I know the sample will only last me about a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the glove yet because I&#x27;m used to using my bare hands (we&#x27;ve all been burnt before lol) but might give it a try soon.&lt;br /&gt;This HSI is definitely an improvement from my previous set up which often left my hair worse than how I would start. After a few days of using the flat iron/oil on my hair, it feels silky and still retains some of the scent of the oil (no more burnt hair smell! Lol).&lt;br /&gt;It generally takes me about an hour of straightening my hair to get it just right; my hair is not too thick but does need several tries to get straightened. I&#x27;m still experimenting with the ways in which I straighten it until I figure out a ritual that best suits my hair.&lt;br /&gt;If you need to replace your old flat iron, this one does the job pretty good without burning your hair.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair styling tools I own.  I cannot believe how smooth my hair is.  I also ordered and am now using the HSI thermal protector.  I have always had to put some kind of mousse in my hair to help style it, as I have natural curl that will turn frizzy with out product. I experimented and only applied the HSI protector to my hair, I was so excited.  It blow dried smooth and the flat iron gave my hair a nice finish.  I love both products, oh, did I mention the iron has a heat control dial.  This is a quality product, easy to use and handle.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a quality product(s).</li>
    <li> I love it, very pleased with this flat iron. I have very curly hair, so I was very impressed with my results.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend absolutely loves this flat iron! She says it&#x27;s the best one she has ever used. So if she is happy, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> Best flat iron ever! Settings are easy to use grip is great it&#x27;s a great product. Completely satisfied!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas.  Her review - &amp;#34;Best Straightener ever! My hair is so smooth, but still has volume. It heats up quick too. Would recommend!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my HSI straightener for almost 2 years and it works as if it was new. Worth so much more but I&#x27;m happy its only $50. My 17 year old niece used it when she slept over and she fell in love with it. I decided to buy her the straightener for her birthday and she was so happy with her gift. She used it the same day along with the argan oil and loves the way her hair feels. If you&#x27;re looking for a good straightener look no further, u can&#x27;t go wrong with the HSI.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron.  Can travel anywhere with this dual voltage iron.  I&#x27;m so happy, leaves my hair so soft and naturally straight.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Not impressed. It is super heavy and completely fried my hair WITHOUT STRAIGHTENING IT.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time on this product! I have somewhat thick hair length just about to the middle of my back and this flat iron on the highest temp would not stay hot. I don&#x27;t know if the one I got is just defective but it took an hour to straighten my hair and it didn&#x27;t stay that way by the time I finally gave up on it. Also I cringed while running it over my hair as it pulled my hair. By the time I gave up there was enough of my hair on the floor and in the sink that it filled a sandwich size zip lock bag and my head is tender to the touch. I am currently waiting on a return label so I can return it for a full refund. In my book this item does not even get a 1 star. Again it would warm up and then cool off never getting hot. My hair did not burn off it was pulled out!</li>
    <li> Fast heating. Best flat iron I have ever used. Gives body, does not burn hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> Just excellent!!!! I have almost 4 years and the product is in perfect condiction</li>
    <li> Pretty easy and safe to use, doesn&#x27;t take long to warm up. Using it everyday .</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair iron since my Hana orofessioa all hair iron stopped working. The item arrived only 3 days after I ordered and it works great! I really liked Hana hair iron before, so I was buying it repeatedly for last 5-6 years. But I like this HSI hair iron better now. Also, the sample of Argan oil works great.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as stated; everything is pristine and perfect condition!</li>
    <li> Works great. Wonderful product</li>
    <li> I purchased this to my wife and she loved it. It get hot in seconds and it works perfectly. She has tried different brands before and she told me the HSI is the best she ever used.</li>
    <li> This iron results in the smoothest hair!  I am so excited I made this purchase!</li>
    <li> I LOVED IT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This Flat iron is the best ....I use to use a Chi and now I don&#x27;t even touch it.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Hmm. Really wanted to like this. Based on reviews, thought for sure I would. Gave it a month and gave up. Maybe it works great on hair that is already fairly straight. I have wavy hair which I blow dry straight and flat iron. This iron just never got hot enough. It also does not have auto shut off. To be fair, it is not advertised as such, but this is a safety issue for me. Went back to a cheaper Remington and am much happier.</li>
    <li> After my CHI died I was panicked. I have naturally curly hair that just any straightener won&#x27;t work on without causing damage. I found this on line and read the reviews. It had over 10,000 5-star reviews, so I gave it a shot. At such a great price, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up! It&#x27;s been wonderful.</li>
    <li> This iron is worth every penny!!! It s made of high quality materials , heats quickly and arrived sooner than promised. It curls or straightens.  My hair loves it and so do I. I was looking at irons going for 200 and up. Don&#x27;t even think about it. Save your money and get this one!!! It&#x27;s that good</li>
    <li> I got this straightener recently and currently love it! It definitely maintains the quality of a 70+ dollar straightener. The plates heat evenly and has so far not given me any sort of issues whatsoever. In addition, I was very satisfied with the Argan Oil that came with the product. I am a victim of very uncontrollable frizzy hair (hence why I needed the straightener) and this oil has left my hair much softer than it has been in years! Definitely would recommend this product to anyone looking to find a quality straightener without burning a hole in one&#x27;s pocket. :)</li>
    <li> Not a bad flat iron but, I&#x27;ve been using the Herstyler for 6 years so I&#x27;m used to a flat iron heating to a higher temp and quicker. It is adjustable so I&#x27;m hoping this will help in not damaging my hair so much. Not a bad purchase for the money.</li>
    <li> Love the flat iron! Works great and heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> Works great! We love it! Makes your hair feel silky soft.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how amazingly straight this gets my hair with so little effort. My old flat iron but the dust and I decided on this one because of the reviews. I am amazed that I don&#x27;t have to go over the section again and again. This is an outstanding product!!!!</li>
    <li> I have coarse thick hair and somewhat dry. Argan oil helps take care of the dryness but the poofines is still there. Although my hairdresser recommend to use a flat iron, still I was hessitant to get it coz, I am so afraid of getting burn or how am I going to do the back part. I went on you tube to see how it&#x27;s done and it seem easy and the transformation is like night and day. So I went ahead and purchased the $49.00 dollar one. I am so excited to recieved it. I tried it and it was easy and my hair looks great even the next day. It is 101/2 inches long and the heating plate is 4 inches long. The box contains a small sample bottle of argan oil and a glove. For those of you who have dry hair...argan oil is a must! This iron is light and safe to use. It is easy to operate and it works. So what are you waiting for, go buy one for yourself.</li>
    <li> Love that I can control the temperature on this model.&lt;br /&gt;Less damage to my hair.</li>
    <li> I picked this flat iron because it was rated 2015 best flat iron. I really like it a lot. Also it come with some extra things which is always AWESOME!!!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It gets hot and I don&#x27;t have to go to a lot of effort to shape my hair. It is very comfortable to use as it does not pull my hair out like some irons I have used. The barrel is well shaped and the grip is comfortable.  The length of the cord makes it easy to use.  This iron does not have an auto shut off which is the only drawback.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron!! It does exactly as described!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Notice the difference between it and inferior models right away - this one gets the job done! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very good product! heating very fast and doesn&#x27;t hurt hair!</li>
    <li> satisfied with this product, works perfectly on my hair and shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my flat iron from HSI and have been using it daily for years.  When my daughter&#x27;s CHI flat iron died I bought her one of these as a replacement. She was very skeptical before using it but now actually prefers her HSI flat iron to the CHI.</li>
    <li> Used it a few times, so can&#x27;t tell if it has staying power, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Love it gets hot very fast</li>
    <li> Wonderful product especially for the price! Don&#x27;t waste your money on something more expensive this is a wonderful straightener</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this straightener. In the past I&#x27;ve had issues with using them as anything other than to straighten my hair. This however allowed me to curl both long hair and short, shoulder length hair just the same as if I would have used a curling iron. I&#x27;ve definitely recommended it to all my friends!! (Sorry for smiley face in first pic. It&#x27;s a friend&#x27;s kid).</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price!</li>
    <li> This is my second one. The last one I had lasted for 8 years. The quality is great for the price you&#x27;re paying. It&#x27;s definitely worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> I have very kinky and curly hair, this straightens it wonderfully!!</li>
    <li> My hair is very rough and dry and curly. HSI does wonders to my hair. Stays straight and smooth.</li>
    <li> Is not the digital flat iron I thought I was buying but it still works nonetheless. it doesn&#x27;t turn off in the middle of flat ironing like some others and works well on my coarse natural 4c hair.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to a flat iron when a stylist used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair for a special occasion. Order it on Amazon and received it shortly. This iron worked just like the one used by the stylist. The unit heated up quickly and does a good job without burning my hair. The price is a bargain so don&#x27;t hesitate if you are considering the purchase of this unit.</li>
    <li> I really love this flat iron. It works great and I love that I can also curl my hair with it as well. I have very frizzy hair and it smooths everything out and let&#x27;s me do what I want to with my hair and not what my hair wants to do</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Grand-daughter, SHE loves it. She has very long hair and tells me she could not live without it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it has world wide voltage for a planned trip to Europe. I have frizzy hair and have used a Chi for several years now and this worked as good as my Chi for a whole lot less money. No worries about having a bad hair day now on my vacation. Most other flat irons don&#x27;t do anything for me. I highly recommend this flat iron</li>
    <li> This is a review for the HSI Professional Tourmaline Ionic Straightener.  I purchased this specific straightener due to its amazing reviews from several different professional salon/stylist websites, but found the best price offered through this seller on amazon.  I wanted this specific model of HSI because it offers an auto turn off if left on accidentally.  This was a gift for my 20 year old daughter, which has very long hair.  She has used it and loves it.  Says that she appreciated the complimentary Argon oil that was included and that her hair feels MORE HEALTHY since using this straightener.  The ends look better and her hair is shinier and softer after use.  Glad I chose this one to buy for her....she actually facetimed me after using it to tell me she loves it and show me how great her hair looks....and she never facetimes me.  Delivery was faster than expected, too.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Ok, this little iron was quite a surprise to me. I thought I preferred a larger iron plate, but this iron styled my hair so much faster. My hair is medium thick and tends to hold moisture. Sleeping in wet hair, the next morning, looking like a sheep dog, I had my hair smoothed is less than 20 minutes. It heats up quickly and product can be used with it. You simply can&#x27;t miss if u&#x27;re looking for a straight iron. I wasn&#x27;t, personally, but got talked into purchasing it. It&#x27;s amazing such a little thing as an iron can make such a difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using a basic Department store brand flat iron that cost $20 or less for some time.  It works but leaves my hair dry and brittle because of the inconsistent heating on the NOT ceramic plates. I couldn&#x27;t afford a high end flat iron so starting reading some of the reviews and everyone seemed to be quite pleased with the HSI flat iron, so thought I would give it a try.  I love it.  It leaves my hair flat, smooth and very shiny.  Very pleased with my purchase.  When I am ready to purchase a curling iron, I will definitely be getting and HSI curling iron.</li>
    <li> I love this product... while it worked. I used the straightener for about four to five times and then it never turned on again. The company made me pay to ship it back to them for a refund. Buyers beware!</li>
    <li> This flat iron was great. It worked great on both my daughters hair They both have very long thick curly hair and the flat iron left it straight and shiny. I would buy it again.    Anne S.</li>
    <li> Product works very well and arrived early, and in good shape. love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a hair straightener before, so I have little in comparison but this seems to work great, no complaints.</li>
    <li> It does not go all the way down smoothly and my hair always stuck in the edge of the flat iron and it really hurts. If I think this is kind of defective product I have to pay shipping cost to return it to the seller.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised how well this flatiron worked on my hair.  I have thick, course Asian hair and it straightened and also put in a little curl at the bottom where I wanted it. My &amp;#34;hair fixing time&amp;#34; took half the time as it normally did with the other flatiron which was a long, frustrating 10 minutes. Will recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Doesn&#x27;t burn my hair which is huge for me. Would have been a 5 star but there is a slight pinching potential with the design in the hinge. Still love the product but am just a bit more careful.</li>
    <li> I have had my HSI flat iron for about a week and am pleased by its performance. It heats evenly and the oil works fairly well as a heat protestant only. Not so much for moisture or scalp health. I have extra curly fine relaxed and damaged hair. Even though I have cut back on heat drastically I hope that by using a better quality flat iron less often I will be better able to have my press and curls last longer. I love the heat glove included but I wish the fingers were longer, it does stretch though I worry for how long it will last before it rips or gets a hole. I gave 4 stars because the casing is bulky making the width measurement just under 1 1/4 in rather than just the 1in plate. This can make it difficult to smooth the roots. I have had a few snagged hairs from the casing as well. It is rounded to help with a curl but they didn&#x27;t really consider that factor with ribbon curling there should be no physical seams where the plates are. Anyway I had extremely fast delivery and the packaging was new. Don&#x27;t really like the silk case, it is too narrow to comfortably fit the iron and cord. And the silk is already stained with oil from packing it up after use. This is just an impractical design flaw, but does have a fleece lining for the hot tool. The swivel cord takes a few uses to break in but it does move with me fairly well. And it does go up to 410 degrees should I need that for a coarse haired client. All in all I like the iron but am still deciding if I will stick to it.</li>
    <li> Absolute from order to using the product.  Works great and cools down much quicker than my previous one when turned off.</li>
    <li> It is impossible to determine what the heat setting is if it is not either on the highest temp or the lowest.  So use is strictly trial and error.  It is also goe on and off at will</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I was sent a bum straightener because it didn&#x27;t feel like it got to 410 degrees. I could slowly swipe my finger across the plates and wouldn&#x27;t feel panic. I straightened my naturally 3C curly hair and it didn&#x27;t give off a burnt smell but it also didn&#x27;t really lay my hair down. It looked to be more of a blow out than a straightening job. I wouldn&#x27;t buy another or take a trade- just gotta find another straightener.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron around a year ago and I use it almost daily on my long and thick Asian hair. It does a great job of getting out my permakink from putting up my hair in a ponytail to work out. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out despite how much is use it. I do use Argan oil and thermal serum, which probably helps too. It is as good as my CHI and GHD that each broke within a year. It&#x27;s less bulky and easier to travel w than my friend&#x27;s croc (and cheaper too!) I like it quite a bit and I recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> PERFECT STRAIGHTNER &amp;#60;3 I have thick, curly, frizzy hair. AND I LIVE IN TEXAS. I have all the issues with having perfectly straight hair. With a normal straightener, I take over 3 hours to get it sort of straight. It took me 1 and 3/4 of an hour to get my hair pin straight with the HSI. ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> Fell in love with this straightener the first time I used it! It works wonders for wavy, frizzy hair! I would recommend this company to anyone, no matter the hair type. It heats up quick and it glides easily with no pulls. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have only had the time to try it once. I&#x27;m in the habit of being a wash and go girl. It worked perfectly and was very easy.  I was told by my hairdresser to not skimp when buying one of these but didn&#x27;t want to pay the $100 she thought was necessary so I decided to search online.  When I used it the results were as good as my prof hair dresser gets and I&#x27;m not good with this stuff.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair, and frequently like to wear it straight. Normally I just buy a cheap $20-$30 flat iron, but decided I wanted something a little nicer in the hopes that I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep replacing it every year. I can&#x27;t really comment on the iron&#x27;s durability since I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks, but hopefully it will meet my expectations. As far as functionality is concerned, I don&#x27;t think it works any better or worse than any of my other flat irons. It gets the job done, and I like that it heats up so quickly, but I don&#x27;t see a significant difference compared to the less expensive flat irons I&#x27;ve purchased. Again, my main reason for buying this was durability, so we&#x27;ll see how it goes.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and it works great for me.</li>
    <li> I love the flat iron but not the oil that comes with it. I&#x27;ve used the product 4 times so far and the only time my hair looked damaged was after using the heat protectant oil that came with the product. I have since started using virgin coconut oil and now my hair is frizz free, shiny and silky smooth. I&#x27;ve got lot of compliments on my hair. I iron itself is great, lightweight and does what it says. I am not so sure if the iron is tourmaline though. The box only says it&#x27;s ceramic. I am still not sure if I got the right product. I am however keeping it for now. I will continue to use it for some more time and update the review later if it damages my hair. All in all, a good product. I recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron...straightens my hair will well the only down side is it too big for my hands.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly and straightens hair with one pass. Wish I had gotten one ages ago.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with how smooth and shiny my hair looks after using the product.</li>
    <li> I have never used a flat iron before but this one seems to be working well. It is a nice size to handle on short, curly hair. I find it a bit more awkward to use than a heated brush but the results are what I expected.</li>
    <li> Works well. Had to turn the temperature higher than suggested to get a smooth look (my hair is thin). Other than that seems good!</li>
    <li> I have been very impressed with the results. It gets very hot and leaves beautiful, smooth curls. I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Love this iron! It heats up really fast, and I love that the heat is adjustable. So far, it&#x27;s been really reliable. It came with a padded case, so I can put it away in the drawer while it&#x27;s still hot (which is great, because I don&#x27;t want to leave it out on the counter with my kids around). No complaints!</li>
    <li> I love the straightener! I&#x27;ve tried several others only to be disappointed. My hopes were too high because the prices are reasonable for this one but the reviews were great so I tried it – and I was not disappointed! What a great find! I have the care and so I need the adjustable temperature and something that will actually get my hair flat. This straightener is the answer!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, especially for the price!!! I really like how quickly it heats up and that I can iron and curl all in one product. It&#x27;s good to have a one year warranty, hopefully I won&#x27;t need it though.</li>
    <li> Does a great job getting hair straight, but with over time usage it began to dry my hair out, when I only straightened my hair every two weeks. It dried out my sister&#x27;s thin 2c hair the first time I straightened her hair with it. As in it felt like it had no life and no movement and had a bad burnt smell until she washed it a week later. It also made her hair very frizzy, when she typically has perfectly smooth hair.  I am a 3c, 4a (in the crown) natural and have been natural for about 4 years. This is the 3rd flat iron I have used (sedu, and more) since being a natural. The other irons did not leave my hair so dry (they just got old or I gave them away to other new naturals), and I use all the same products.  Very light weight, and the oil that comes with it is nice. However, if you are natural/curly I would advise you use this on the lowest setting possible and use a very good heat protectant because it overheats .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this straightener for about two weeks now, and I LOVE it! I&#x27;m pretty low-maintenance and rarely do anything to my hair but figured I&#x27;d give it a try before work when I got it. It heats up very quickly and I love the glove it comes with so you won&#x27;t burn your hands while straightening. I have decently thick hair that&#x27;s naturally wavy, and frizzes up VERY quickly. This straightener leaves my hair silky and smooth, and does it within 10 minutes. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly couldn&#x27;t of ask for a better flat iron.</li>
    <li> Not as good as others say.  My old babyliss nano was much better.</li>
    <li> I just got mine and I started using it. I am Latina (Dominican to be exact) and I have mixed hair. I loved it and it does not leave my hair thin like other flat irons do. It is easier and I loved how it left my hair! Its a keeper!!!!</li>
    <li> I love my new HSI Professional flat iron. I have very long, thick hair and I was very impressed with this product. It heats up quickly and does an awesome job. The price was incredible for this high end flat iron. My friends have bought this product and they are equally as impressed as I am. Thank you 😊&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, quick heating time, no snag operation, it glides through the hair so easily and after 2 uses my wife noticed a big difference in softness of her hair. Her hair has a nice shine and her old strightner would leave her hair a bit on the frizzy side so she would have to use additional products afterwards but this strightner is one and done no extras needed. She is already raving about it to her friends!</li>
    <li> Love love loveeee this flat iron!!  it leaves my hair like suppperrrr silky smooth especially with the argan oil Sample.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t heat well not what I expected</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time looking at different flat irons since the one I had was dying!  I finally decided to give this one a try.  I was amazed at the quality for the price and how quickly it heated up.  It came with a silky pouch and heat protective glove which were top quality.  Also,  a sample of hair oil which I love and last a long time.  You can&#x27;t go wrong buying this iron and the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used to straighten my natural hair. Left hair silky and shiny.</li>
    <li> This HSI product is certainly professional and the girlfriend loves it !! She says its the best flat iron hair straightener she has used !! Great buy...</li>
    <li> love this. Hair straightner it don&#x27;t pull your hair and takes no time to straighten!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Came MANY extras. Love love love the fact that I can use on my hair and then put on the lowest setting and curl my daughters hair. Highly  recommended</li>
    <li> We are traveling to Europe and I need a dual voltage flat iron.  This iron fills that requirement, plus I like the adjustable temperature control. It comes with a very nice satin bag and &amp;#34;hot glove.&amp;#34; The only drawback I would say is that it is full size and heavier than some, but that probably speaks to its quality, and I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t add too much weight to my suitcase.</li>
    <li> Great product and excelent customer service!</li>
    <li> I have an expensive one at home but that is not a dual voltage, then I bought this for my trip.  I found the quality of the plate is cheap and rough.  It cannot make your hair very smooth and straight.  Performance just OK.  You get what you pay. If don&#x27;t expect too much on this product, it still can give you some help during your trip.</li>
    <li> Best buy on that price..</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife. She&#x27;s quite happy with the product. She has thick, long, wavy and slightly coarse hair and this product works very well for what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> These flatirons are THE BEST! Non snagging and leaves great luster and sheen. As a licensed cosmetologist I have used many and these by far are the best!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works amazingly well, it doesn&#x27;t take forever to heat up and it leaves my hair so straight as if I just left from the salon.  The argon oil sample that comes with it is a great finishing touch to add to my hair and it leaves a great smell with a light shine and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  I am definitely pleased with the purchase of my hsi flat iron especially when my coworkers assume that I am going to my hairdresser every week!</li>
    <li> love it! makes my hair so smooth! worth the money!!!!</li>
    <li> I Love It!!!Trust me its the best flat iron.</li>
    <li> I have been using my new HSI flat iron for a few days and I am in love with it (don&#x27;t tell my fiance😊). It has a great feel to it and is easy to use. Best part: it does a great job!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works really well.  It heats up fast. I like the glove that comes with it to help protect your hand from the heat. This iron can get really hot. I have had other flat irons before but nothing beats this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Use it on my hair as well as my clients.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great! It is the third one I have owned (other brands though) and is far more superior to the others I bought in the past. It heats fast and runs smoothly through my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling dry. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have had..my hair is normally frizzy and this takes care of it.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to warm up and I only have to swipe a section of hair once and it&#x27;s done..Goes very fast.  I highly recommend</li>
    <li> Heats up in seconds. Doesn&#x27;t snag or pull out my hair. And honestly leaves my hair feeling smoother and frizz-free afterward</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good for my hair</li>
    <li> Love this straightener.  Easy to use and handle.  Works great on my hair and doesn&#x27;t damage.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Arrived quickly.  Will continue to use and evaluate</li>
    <li> Great!! Very happy with purchase...use it every day!</li>
    <li> Best hair straightener! Works great for curling your hair too.</li>
    <li> I have had remington and conair flatirons in 2 inch and 1/2 inch respecfully.  I wanted a one inch iron as my hair is now an in between length.  I love this iron.  It&#x27;s the perfect size.  It heats up very quickly and straightens my thick, wavy hair very easily.  It&#x27;s a great value for the price.  The sample of argan oil is the best thing i ever put on my hair.  It really takes 1 drop to make my hair shiny and protected from the heat.  It is not greasy at all. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My old Chi broke, so I decided to try out a different brand (and the sale helped!). This gets up to 410 degrees, so it&#x27;s hot enough to tame my crazy hair. Works perfectly! The travel case included is handy. Totally happy with my purchase. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product. It works very well in North America but the real test for me will be when I travel to Europe next month as that was main reason for the purchase. Hopefully, it will work as well on 220v as it does on 110v but only time will tell.</li>
    <li> A++. Great product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Great product. Wife loves it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a flatiron before but this is EASY &amp; if I can make my difficult to style hair look good, any one can.  Very nicely boxed, shipped, and delivered. the cloth travel bag is handy.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this flat iron it is now our 3rd one purchased and even our oldest one is still working great!  Needed another one for daughter moving away to college.</li>
    <li> This straightener is fantastic - this is the 3rd one I&#x27;ve ordered.  It works really well - with 1/2 the cost of the name brand.</li>
    <li> Does a good job if you go slow. But still can&#x27;t compare to my previous CHI quality and results. But for the price, you can&#x27;t really ask for more.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. Heats fast. Keeps my hair straight &amp; sleek. I have long hair and it does not get caught in any part of the ceramic edges, as other flat irons have done in the past. This is definitely professional quality. With other flat irons I had to keep repeating the process on a strand a few times to get it right. This one does it right on the first pass through. It comes in a sturdy box with instructions, coupon, registration info, 5 ml of HSI ArganOil Leave In Hair Treatment, heat glove and a very pretty silky red travel pouch that lined with a soft lining. I am going to the HSI curling iron next, since the quality of this flat iron was definitely a 5 star!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Worked great in a voltage converter in France. My friend used her non-international straightener in a voltage converter and it burnt out almost immediately, so I&#x27;d say this was definitely a smart purchase.</li>
    <li> Great iron!!!  THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and I love it, great price as well. The sellers are great to work with and very courteous. The flat iron leAves my hair smooth and heats quickly. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Although I haven&#x27;t used it internationally yet, I like this iron so far.  It heats up quickly, is ergonomic and has a great cord.  The only two downsides are the dial is inside between the irons and is not digital so you have to guess what temperature you are on, and it didn&#x27;t come with the adapter plugs as advertised.</li>
    <li> Is a very good item,I like it,I think to buy more stuff from you in the future,near one,thanks,keep it good.</li>
    <li> Works as expected, great shipping speed and packaging from the company as well as a solidly made product at a good price. The other straightener I had was losing heat as i styled my hair, so it was time for a change. This straightener more than met my expectations and feels well-made and built to last. One consideration to keep in mind is that there is no light to indicate whether the straightener is fully heated, so it does take a little guesswork at the beginning. It&#x27;s easy to get used to and doesn&#x27;t detract from the product, as the iron made my hair super straight and was easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this flat iron.  It came quickly.  It was packaged nicely inside of a heavy duty box.  I love the pouch that the iron fits into.  It is easy to use and heats up well.  The bottle of argan oil is an added bonus!</li>
    <li> Comparable to Chi, although thought this one would&#x27;ve worked better. Wish it has a LED power-on indicator.</li>
    <li> My hair has a curly texture that has become difficult to straighten. With my old hair straightener, I would continuously have to go over the same spot see get any difference. Even then it would still show kinks. After seeing how highly reviewed this product was I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did! I can finally have straight hair and the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t look all dried out or fizzy. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Quick shipping! Friendly! Amazing products!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this flat iron.  I have used several different flat irons through out the years, from the most expensive sold in salons to the ones I have purchased at the big box stores.  I could never find one that worked on my fine hair.  I also purchased a CHI Air at the same time I ordered the HSI to compare.  The CHI was great, but it did not compare to the HSI and the price was almost $100.00 less!!  I returned the CHI.  The HSI makes my hair straight and shiny with one pass.  I have never had a flat iron work so well.  It is a great product and a great price.  I love the oil that came with it; I have already ordered a full size bottle.  I am telling everyone how wonderful this flat iron is.</li>
    <li> The best straightener I ever had</li>
    <li> Definitely a great deal for the money!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it.. I love that she loves it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this flat iron!!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this flat iron, being because my first one got submerged in the sink by accident(luckily it wasn&#x27;t plugged in). I love this flat iron so much, it is my life saver, and my single favorite beauty product I own, even over my beautyblender(that&#x27;s saying a lot!).&lt;br /&gt;The design is sleek and professional(obviously), it has very shiny Ceramic + Ionic Tourmaline plates that give your hair the healthiest look it has ever had! The oil that is included is really nice for taming split ends, and frizz.&lt;br /&gt;The iron heats up SUPER fast, I have it set to the highest heat, as it is much quicker on my tight school and work schedule...&lt;br /&gt;There is no lock on it, but it doesn&#x27;t open up too huge so I don&#x27;t feel there is a need for one, yet it still tames and perfectly irons even my craziest bed head!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very nice for Flat Iron Curls (tutorials on that on YouTube, super easy and cute)&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of the style you decide on, it stays ALL DAY for my almost heat resistant hair (or so it feels, ugh).</li>
    <li> This is a great product!! Works great!! Price was great nothing I can say bad about this flat iron!!!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Dial is very easy to adjust, although you have to gauge it with your eye - there are no numbers. The dial is in between the 2 clamps.  It comes with a glove, that I didn&#x27;t need - that&#x27;s to help you close it and hold it tight if you have it very hot.  I use the heat about 80% of the way to the top.  Able to straighten long hair quickly.  Worth it!! I&#x27;ve had it about 1 year now without any issues.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, the best flat iron I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and its the best flat iron i have used another very expensive iron before but this is hands downs the best one i have ever used i might jusdt order another one just in case .</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  Leaves my hair shiny and smooth.  The added bonus travel size Argan oil is a big plus.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it !&lt;br /&gt;great quality for a great price you will definitely not regret buying this.</li>
    <li> Great product. It was delivered before the estimated time and I love it how it make my hair smooth, silky and straight. I love this product and will recommend it to my friends too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and this is what she had to say. &amp;#34;Excellent salon quality hair, heat range is amazing and an affordable price. Has useful add-on like Argan oil and a heat glove. It&#x27;s economical and high quality and simple enough for any user. This model has a swivel cord for easy styling, and a round body shape that makes curls look natural. All in all an amazing product! I LOVE IT!!!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This flat iron surprised me. For the price, I didn&#x27;t expect too much and didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money as my hair is fine and mostly straight with a few areas of waves that bug me. After my first use, I could not believe how soft it left my hair. My old flat iron, which was more expensive than this one, left may hair dried out. I like that I can curl the ends if I want too because it saves me time. I also love the bag it came with and the free oil sample smells awesome. I would definitely recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> Great product took little bit to get hang of it, but works really great on my straight Asian hair that likes to get frizzy. I use tiny little bit of silk protein with it and end with flawless straight shiny hair. Great service!</li>
    <li> I was super excited to get this in the mail. I&#x27;ve had it for about 4 months now. It works well, but not as good as I had hoped. (I&#x27;ve used it about 12 times) This is the first straightener that I bought on my own. (others were gifts). So I did some research and this looked to be the best. I&#x27;m not sure if I am just not using the right setting for my hair or something. I&#x27;m still keeping this straightener because I need one and it still works pretty well! I liked that it came with the Argan oil. That stuff seems to work well. Don&#x27;t use too much though! It&#x27;ll make your hair greasy. Now, my hair is thin, frizzy and wavy so it&#x27;s a pain to straighten. I would recommend this to others. For me it&#x27;s good, just not amazing. But others may have different luck with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/10/17:&lt;br /&gt;I have grown more fond of this hair straightener. It&#x27;s still going strong after 2 years! I see that there have been not so great reviews lately, so maybe the quality has gone down. I have no idea. All I do know is that I love this straightener. I don&#x27;t use it every day. Actually, I use it rarely because I don&#x27;t like to put direct heat on my hair too often. But, I have used it a decent amount and it works pretty well! So, I definitely recommend at least trying it. It isn&#x27;t that much money compared to some of the higher end straighteners. I&#x27;m actually about to buy another one as a Christmas gift!</li>
    <li> Good product! I did my research read reviews than decided to purchase this. I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s a nice flat iron. Works well! Really like this!</li>
    <li> I think it Could be fine for a $40 straightener. But my hair doesn&#x27;t look as shiny as some people used to say. They look more broken. When i use it, it seems that the Plates are really cheap and just make your hair look more dry.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron!  I purchased a &#x27;Nu Me&#x27; flat iron back in 2010 and it finally died.  Really professional grade that you use in the salon.  I was going to purchase the same brand but was put off by the price ($80).  Then I read the reviews on the HSI Professional (with free Argon oil and glove) and couldn&#x27;t not argue with so many excellent reviews .. and the price.. $37-38 or so w/ free shipping?  I I wasn&#x27;t expecting such an excellent product and I was putting my money on the reviews.  Well, let me tell you, it is absolutely better than my Nu Me iron.  Better because of the huge price difference.  The flat irons are identical in qualify, professional grade and oh, my hair!!  I am so pleased with this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good and affordable flat iron for quite some time and after reading very good reviews decided to purchase this HSI Professional 1 Ceramic one. Very glad that I bought it because it not only make my hair straight amd smooth but also helps create beautiful curls. It comes with a pouch, a glove to protect your hand from the heat, and a sample size hair oil which smells wonderful. This is my new favorite flat iron and I would recommend it in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> The Best purchase ever! It is Awesome.  I purchased this straighter as a gift for my wife and she really loved it. It has a wonderful price but the quality makes it worth much more. It is suitable for all kinds of hair because it has different degrees of temperature. The Iron size is very suitable. It is very convenient and isn&#x27;t bulky. It heats up so quickly and also doesn&#x27;t make burning hair smell. My wife’s hair is somehow curly but the HSI Iron made it completely straight. I also loved the package design which makes it a very nice candidate as a gift. I would recommend this product with its Argan oil. A small-size Argan oil was included in the box when I purchased it, and now I want to order it in a bigger size. I smells very good and makes your hair very soft and shiny. It is wonderful. I also want to say I was really surprised about the shipping process. I receive it exactly in two days even though I didn&#x27;t have prime membership. It also comes with a 1 year manufacturer’s warranty, which is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the most amazing flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried chi, Remington, and ghd. I have very thick, wavy/bendy hair. Most flat irons i have used, I have to pass through each section multiple times to get it straight, but this one only requires one pass through to achieve slick, straight, shiny hair. Definitely recommend for everyone. Also it&#x27;s an amazing price.</li>
    <li> Working as mentioned and great results</li>
    <li> Bought my wife this iron she loves it. I don&#x27;t kno anything about women hair products but knocked this one out the park</li>
    <li> Wife and daughter are very please. This was a replacement for a Chico and works just as well..</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this flat iron. It heats up quick and stays hot while using. Most flat irons loose their heat once I start usin them because my hair is so thick and curly. But this one by HSI is awesome! It also came with a very nice travel/storage bag! I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new flat iron!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. It works very well. Does&#x27;t burn my hair; leaves it soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Good product. Works well on hair. Good for straighting or curling hair. Perfect size for shorter or medium length hair. Excellent price. Also loved the extra bonuses!</li>
    <li> My sister really liked it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love thus product!!! Leave my hair silky smooth..soft and straight...dies a wonderful job of curling my hair as well. I would definitely recommend this to someone 😁</li>
    <li> Very nice!! ..love it..!!arrive on time..am so happy .</li>
    <li> For the price, this iron can&#x27;t be beat. I chose this oven a CHI, or other brands I can get wholesale with my professional license. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> It was exactly how I expected it to be, perfact</li>
    <li> HSI makes a great flat iron.  I just started using a flat iron on my hair, and had one from a different brand that I broke.  I was hesitant to purchase a different brand, but the HSI one is even BETTER than my old one!  It works great.  You can set it to different heat settings, and it is super easy to use.  It also ships with some argon oil and a satin travel case.  I would highly recommend purchasing this if you are looking for a flat iron!</li>
    <li> Flat iron is great.  Free sample of oil was great.  Helped to control frizz.  Haven&#x27;t tried the flat iron without the oil so I&#x27;m not sure if I will get a lot of normal static.  (I highlight my hair every 6-8 weeks and it tends to get cry).  I have used a CHI for years but someone recommended this to me based on a previous purchase.  Flat iron works as well as my CHI.  Hope it lasts as long!</li>
    <li> Great product arrived on time shipped the same day I recieved it great Christmas gift for my wife thank you</li>
    <li> Very nice flat iron and was pleasantly surprised when I tried it for the first time.  Easy to use and makes my hair very smooth feeling and looks great!</li>
    <li> The best straighter I&#x27;ve ever used. Seriously id recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. I&#x27;ve used many top name brand ones but really like this one and it&#x27;s about 1/3 of the cost. I like that it came with a pouch to store it in also.</li>
    <li> Love this, the glove and oil that comes with it.  Only wish I would have ordered the 1.5&amp;#34;.  This one is just too small, so takes me a long time to get all hair strands done.</li>
    <li> I was considering  buying a CHI flat iron until I read the reviews on this HSI flat iron and was impressed by how pleased everyone was with it. I couldn&#x27;t agree more. It is easy to handle, has an on-off switch as well as a temperature control switch so you can have it as hot or as warm as you want it.  I had been using a flat iron for travel prior to this and it is amazing how much better this works on my medium length hair. The plates are just the right width for quickly styling my hair. My friend (who owns a CHI flat iron) had told me it wasn&#x27;t necessary to spend a lot of money to get a good flat iron and now I believe her.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what is worse, the fact that I waited almost 2 weeks to get it or that my 5 years old straightener from Conair does a better job. Left my hair static and takes a couple swipes to get hair some what straight. Save your money.</li>
    <li> It heats up and cools down really fast. I have naturally curly hair that&#x27;s fine, but have a lot of it. I need a temp of about 385 degrees in order for my hair to be smooth, and this does the trick.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;m going t o enjoy this!!</li>
    <li> I was honestly a bit disappointed with the flat iron. It didn&#x27;t glide smoothly through my hair and got caught a few times in it. Also the heat glove didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
    <li> Kept it in the box for the most part. after using it about 3-4 times It just dies and didnt want to turn on. Dont even know what had happened. Contacted them and was told that there was nothing they could do cause the time to send it back had past! it worked greatly at first but after a few uses it didnt work at all. No matter what i did i would not turn on. vey unhappy with the product because it just suddently it stopped working. still like is brand new.</li>
    <li> Is a little bit heavier than other flat irons but works really good, my hair looks silky and smooth, love it!</li>
    <li> Was disappointed, it pulls on my hair and I still have to go over the same section of hair a couple times even in the highest temp. I was surprised cause it had great reviews.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  The item stopped working for maybe a month or 2.  It doesn&#x27;t turn on the light indicator or the heat at all.  My guess is there is a problem with the circuit breaker on the plug but it has special screws so you could not unscrew easily.  I would avoid buying this product and be cautious with this brand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but there are no frills about it. There isn&#x27;t even a light to tell you it&#x27;s on. The temperature is a dial, not a display. The glove it comes with isn&#x27;t anything special. I wish I&#x27;d spent a bit more and bought a nicer one</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS FLAT IRON. I had one kind of like it before and it lasted me forever.  Then it finally went out and I never found another one like it.  Coming from a person that puts heat on their hair every blue moon, this flat iron is perfect for me.  My hair is natural,  so I try not to use a lot of heat.  But when I do use the flat iron,  it lasts longer than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve had in the past.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> Great flatiron. My old flatiron was long overdue for an upgrade and this was a great choice. I got the older version, which is fine because the price is great. I&#x27;ve had it for about a week now and have been able to curl and straighten my hair. It makes my hair so shiny and smooth and the curl stays all day without falling out! Great packaging! The little vial of argan oil, heat sleeve and heat glove are nice additions too. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I love all of the products I have purchased, and delivery is great..</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair shiny and smooth. Curls my hair perfectly ! Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and packaging. Everything shipped on time and works very well.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly.  I like the adjustable heat setting.  Swivel cord stays out of the way.  Wish it had an on/off light.</li>
    <li> The shipping was quick, the deal on the flat iron was awesome and the flat iron is awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> Immediately I knew this straightener was quality. It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;scratch&amp;#34; hair, it&#x27;s easy to hold, and heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> Im glad about ,its easy to use and make the work in less time.&lt;br /&gt;Best seller</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I thought it would and the oil it cam e with isn&#x27;t that good either.</li>
    <li> This straightener is awesome. It makes beautiful round curls and is easy to use. Just watch some online tutorials and you&#x27;ll be glam in no time.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what we needed. works great heats up quick. makes quick work of curly hair. Very fast shipping as usual with amazon.</li>
    <li> I was a Chi Flat Iron girl prior to purchasing my HSI.  I have very curly hair.  The first  morning I used my HSI flat iron, I was so impressed with how well it worked with my hair and no frizz.  I&#x27;m now an HSI Flat Iron girl.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever had....so happy with it I ordered one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> very nice and works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this straightener for a week or so but I love it so far. I had a cortex straightener previously (and I was stupid and didn&#x27;t complete the warranty form, so I was out of luck :(), but so far this straightener is living up to my expectations. Straightens my hair well, feels pretty smooth (of course with my protecting products in my hair)... Great results especially since I was without one for 2 weeks and my hair was crazy looking :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this was ordered through a different vendor other than Amazon, I didn&#x27;t receive any tracking information so I wasn&#x27;t sure when it&#x27;d arrive. It took about 6-7 days from when it shipped to arrive.  For the price, it&#x27;s pretty good. Some details I don&#x27;t have and would like is how long it takes to heat up to max heat and it does stink that there is ONLY a 1 year warranty... so lets hope it lives on for awhile! :)</li>
    <li> The flat iron heats very quickly!  The adjustable heat is very useful.  Easy to use with a rotating cord so it doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
    <li> It was a great gift for a friend of mine. She loves it!G</li>
    <li> Received this great product in a timely manner. Thanks for the wonderful experience.</li>
    <li> Great product. Worked as expected. Company was great to order from. Orders arrived earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had so many issues in purchasing this item. Like many others, I was suckered by the huge amount of positive reviews. I purchased it, and first, it won&#x27;t come for multiple weeks. Secondly, the company messed up my address and it was further delayed. If you can, do it through Amazon Prime and not the company. I will say the product is alright. It works more or less, turned up on the highest heat for my non-African American, curly hair. The argan oil was probably my favorite aspect of this product. That should tell you something when the freebie is the best thing about it! I&#x27;ve had it for approximately two months and the thing just crapped out on me, stopped working entirely. So, I&#x27;m returning it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a terrible experience. You could probably save yourself a headache, and twenty bucks and get a different product. This will just give you a headache.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the product</li>
    <li> Did not work at all daughter hated it had to buy her another one. Problem is amazon makes it tough on returns.</li>
    <li> Nice iron for price. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing.  It heats up incredibly fast.  The size works wonderfully; is not bulky and it is easy to use.  I have really thick, coarse, and wavy hair that is difficult to work with.  This flat iron quickly leaves my hair silky and straightened. I love it!  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love my new hair straightener. I iron my hair in no time. It leaves my hair smooth and extremely straight. LOVE ITTTT!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this flat iron. It heats up quickly and leaves her hair shinier and more manageable. The temperature is adjustable. The cord doesn&#x27;t tangle or twist. It also comes with a protective glove. Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> the wife loves it great for very curly and knotted hair great product</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for myself and I had better results with it than any other straightener Ive ever tried. My daughter (13) started using mine so I ordered another for  her and she couldnt be happier with it. This seller also resolved an issue I had with completely professional customer service that went above and beyond my expectations.I dont normally even leave reviews but I had to share this with the rest of the frustrated females out there using sub par hair flat irons. Ladies, this ones the real deal.</li>
    <li> It creates gorgeous curls!</li>
    <li> Great product. Works great, no weird smells and didn&#x27;t snag my hair at all. Fantastic buy.</li>
    <li> I have thick, frizzy hair and this works well. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works really well. It heats up quick and only takes one or two passes to make my curly hair flat! The shipping was fast and came with a heat resistant case. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> I saw many good reviews and heard good things about this product and that is the reason I have made this purchase. But I am not satisfied with this purchase. It is not working as expected. 1st of all some kind of wierd smell is coming when I turn on the power. It smells like something is burning inside like wire burning smell. I tried one time but again same thing happened. So, I immediately stopped using it. I talked to seller and they sent me new piece.</li>
    <li> I love it! when I lost the first one I ordered the exact one to relace it</li>
    <li> It works wonderful! I can straighten and curl my hair!</li>
    <li> amazing! exceeded my expectations! I got argon oil with it, a silk cooling pouch, and a styling glove! This package was amazing! Thank you guys! And the different heat settings as stated are excellent! Definitely would recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife and she told me the item doesn&#x27;t get hot at all.  does not worth the $50 price paid for it.</li>
    <li> Nothing special honestly, doesn&#x27;t work much better than cheaper ones I&#x27;ve had. But I have fairly straight hair so my hair doesn&#x27;t require special straightening.</li>
    <li> Very nice ceramic iron and great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Sedu flat iron for the last 7 years and absolutely loved it.  Always worked great and never lost heat.  When the electrical element finally started getting a little spotty (it would still turn on, I just had to mess with the On button a bit), I decided to see what else was out there after so many years.  I have lots of friends with GHDs who love them, so I read a ton of reviews, watched some cute little teenagers trying to do comparisons for their 10 YouTube followers (I think those are hilarious...poor girls have no idea how to formulate a sentence and flat iron at the same time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I decided that not much had changed over the last 7 years in the technology, but I thought I&#x27;d give the HSI, GHD and Sedu all a fair shot and compare them myself. So I got them all, let my hair air dry (it&#x27;s naturally curly...and not in a pretty way...like in a frizzy, wild, scary way) and then used them all. Unfortunately, the HSI didn&#x27;t even come close to GHD and Sedu, so I didn&#x27;t include it in the running, but if you want to read a comparison of GHD and Sedu, here&#x27;s what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:  GHD $121, Sedu $100 (if I had gotten the black Sedu, it would have been $178, but I actually like this dark purple)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Material: GHD has a rougher feeling exterior, the same as my old Sedu, which would attract dirt and hairspray like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  I can&#x27;t tell you how much time I spent scraping caked on hairspray off of it.  Anyway, the Diamond Sedu has a smoother exterior, which looks like it&#x27;ll be easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Style/Options: Both 1&amp;#34; (Sedu has more curved edges, which I find easier for curling the ends of my hair under); both heat up quickly (GHD was seriously 5 seconds, Sedu was about 30...I can handle either of those times); both have an auto shut-off (Sedu just added that to this Diamond version), Sedu has a temp control where GHD doesn&#x27;t (it&#x27;s supposed to adjust to your hair, which seems to work well)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use: They both straighten really well...one run over a section of my scary curls totally smooths them out. They&#x27;re both SO much better than the cheaper brands I&#x27;ve tried (the HSI got terrific reviews, but there&#x27;s really no comparison to these two). The big difference is that the GHD would catch and pull on my hair a bit...not much, but enough to where I have to think about it.  The Sedu doesn&#x27;t catch at all...super smooth and I can go over any amount of hair that I want to. I also found myself going over the GHD side with the Sedu as I was finishing and styling without even thinking about it...that right there kind of made the final decision for me. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I&#x27;m sticking with the Sedu and returning the GHD.  Both are quality products, but the Sedu edged out the GHD and if it lasts as long as my first one, I&#x27;m happy to pay a bit more than the cheaper straighteners for what I&#x27;m getting.  Hope this review helps someone else who&#x27;s looking to buy!</li>
    <li> This one I purchased as a gift for my wife. She has complained that her hair was always turned curve every morning. I did a lot research looking for a product could solve her problem. :D Amazon reviews, YouTube, some professional websites. Finally I chose this one. It is a perfect product, and yet perfectly priced. She is more than happy to have this flat iron. She tells me she&#x27;s using it every morning, every easy to use, heat up very quick, and she loves the temperature adjusting feature. Her happiness means that all the work I have done for choosing this flat iron was not a waste of time. Especially thanks to the seller and Amazon.com to help me making that happen.</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift ... got no complaints!</li>
    <li> I like this flat iron, but it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shut off and the plates are a little shorter than my old flat iron.</li>
    <li> returning iron- does not glide smoothly thru hair, pulls/and rips especially at the ends, I normally use a titianium plate flat iron and it does not drag or pull at the hair, not sure if it was a fluke or if they all do this</li>
    <li> This review is for the 1\\&quot; inch 3rd edition model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically my wife wanted another CHI flattener to replace the one she busted while in South America (CHI was not dual voltage, as we found the hard way)... After reading all the great reviews for this HSI straightener, we decided to go for it and are glad we did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The wife just loves it...&lt;br /&gt;-The shape of the prongs are well curved, so she can make nice curls with this flattener/Curler.&lt;br /&gt;-DUAL Voltage (110-220 V) so you can use anywhere your travels take you.&lt;br /&gt;-The design is made in such a way that the heating pads DO NOT pull hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Overall great build quality.&lt;br /&gt;-Excellent value (what you get for the price ratio).&lt;br /&gt;-Built-in reset and test button (GFCI) plug built into power connector (see photo attached).&lt;br /&gt;-Long power cord (about 8 feet).&lt;br /&gt;-My wife actually prefers it to her previous CHI unit that was way more expensive, more than twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-None so far.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast. Product heats up quickly and even comes with a nice carrying case. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Works really well! I am completely happy with this flat-iron. I used to use the CHI and I have to admit this HSI beats it hands down! ;)</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my female room mate. While,  I can&#x27;t personally vouch for this product being that I don&#x27;t use any hair products, but she absolutely loved it. Can&#x27;t remember which brand she switched from, it was an expensive one, and she prefers this hsi.</li>
    <li> I have &amp;#34;texture&amp;#34; to my hair, which causes it to be frizzy and coarse at times. I really researched flat irons before purchasing this one and I&#x27;m quite surprised at how smooth my hair turns out with this product. AND it was under $50 - which is great! The smooth oil that came with it really works and makes my hair even smoother. I think the other reviews regarding this iron working for coarse or thick hair are accurate.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Have not had item for a year yet, it is broke. No physical damage caused by me and I rarely use it bc my hair is natural. The -electric box plug-in thingamajig- just broke off into pieces.</li>
    <li> I love this iron! And the oil works great too.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron just wish it was flatter otherwise it works great on my thick,coarse hair.</li>
    <li> Far exceeded my wife&#x27;s expectations! She has very thick, wavy hair and was skeptical about how well this would be able to straighten her hair, but it worked wonderfully well!</li>
    <li> My wife loved this product, she said it&#x27;s of great quality and leaves her hair exactly the way she wants it.</li>
    <li> Works great!! Would buy it again and recommend to others!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron. It&#x27;s my second one I&#x27;ve bought, first one was from 2 years ago. I have dropped it a lot and the plate partially broke off. I use to have a CHI and hated it. I highly recommend this flat iron! Very happy with it</li>
    <li> loved the product. I have purchased 3 of it already as gift.</li>
    <li> It works awesome!!! Thank you !!</li>
    <li> The flat iron is great!! Unfortunately the bottle if argon oil was empty!</li>
    <li> The iron doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would like it to. takes about three to four times over at least to get my hair (naturally just a little wavy) to straighten at its highest setting</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with this product. Although I am not a professional stylist I am able to obtain the same professional look at home.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my wife. She is very happy with the product. Straightening and curling is just awesome and as per our expectation. She used it in India as well. I thought, Step Down Voltage converter might be needed (to convert from 240v to 110v) in India. But no, it is just fine. If the plug is able to take inside US pin, you will not even require adapter.</li>
    <li> I didnt like it that much .. I have to do the same hair part many time and its not that shine and helthy look .. I liked only the oil</li>
    <li> These flat irons are awesome!! They do the same thing the chi flat irons do but these are less expensive! I am enjoying them!!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  Once I saw how it really flattened my hair I threw all of my other flat irons out. I am natural and have not had a perm in over 2 years. I was spending 45.00 at the salon and during the summer as soon as I walked out my hair started to frizz.  Now I can do it myself.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Love this iron ! Much better quality than I was expecting !</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with my purchase of this straightener. I got the 3rd generation which is supposed to have improved heating elements. It seems to heat up quick and does not snag my hair. I have medium wavy hair and after using this product it stays straight until I wash it again. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Most straighteners feel smooth on your hair when you pull them through, but the plates on this straightener pulled on my hair and felt like it was being damaged. The plates were also pretty short. I don&#x27;t think it would work for curling your hair very well, but I didn&#x27;t even attempt that because it felt so awful to just straighten my hair.  I returned it and got something cheaper that works much better.</li>
    <li> This is definitely 5 stars for the price I usually pay a minimum of $70 for a decent straightener.  This one works great.</li>
    <li> did not work well.  i think it must have been defective.  it pulled my hair (causing tearing) and left my hair dull.  return was accepted without any problems.</li>
    <li> I just bought this and I have only used it once so far, but it is far superior to the one that I had previously, which cost twice as much. Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> I have had 2 of these.  The first  one was lower cost and it heated as well as they newer generation.  It fell off the counter and the plate broke.  Very fragile and not a lot to protect edge of you drop.  I ordered the more expensive model and it looked exactly like my first that I had had for a year.  i inquired why the cost was more when the  more expensive model looks identical.  I was told that it gets hotter.  My first model got just as hot as the newer one.</li>
    <li> This is a well built straightener and I expect it to last a few years. However, it does not have floating plates or auto shut off. I&#x27;ve left this thing plugged all day at least twice in the month I&#x27;ve own it. Still a darn good flat iron for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this. Heats up quickly and is very smooth.</li>
    <li> I constantly get email on this product.  I can tell u its a good product and rave how it works on my hair. The best person that can tell u its urself. I tell u love my product. It doesn&#x27;t Ur hair so heavy. Especially the product that&#x27;s included it will make smooth and shiny.  I just know no one will take my product. If u want lasting curls or dress up Ur hair this is it. Believe me I use a lot of flat iron put my curl in once I leave the house it&#x27;s flat. I don&#x27;t have to put hairspray since that weigh Ur hair down.  I like my hair bouncing and carefree.</li>
    <li> I just got this, and I absolutely love it! I have thick, curly, frizzy hair naturally. Every other straightener I have used it takes me at least 40 minutes tob straighten my hair, and at least 2 different products. The first time I used this one, I wanted to see how well it was going to work, but I didn&#x27;t have very much time. It only took me like 25 minutes, and I didn&#x27;t use any products! I was so impressed, and beyond happy! The next time I straightened it I tired the oil sample that came with it, loved that too! This is by far my favorite straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned! Money very well spent in my opinion!</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron purchase and I am very satisfied with the quality and the results on my hair. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this Flat Iron! It heats up very quickly and the digital display shows the temperature of the iron as it is heating. The LED light goes from blue to green once it is fully heated, if you need to adjust the temperature it has easy to reach buttons to do so. I love the way this iron easily irons on the first try and imparts shine to my daughters hair. Her hair is very thick, but I have found that this iron straightens her hair easily and does not leave my daughters hair with a burnt smell as some previous brands I owned did. If you are in the market for new flat iron, give this one a try you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Both the flat iron and Argan Oil work well together. Plus fast shipping!!  It heats up pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the fastest shipping i have ever had!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! It heats up very quickly and makes my hair feels so healthy after using it. I have tried lots of different flat irons in the past and this is definitely one of the best! I also like that I can curl my hair with the same tool. I would definitely recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery! Great product!  Thanks. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Awesome gift!! :) love the long cord and floating plates! Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out constantly! My hair is also curly and it does an amazing job straightening them out! Only takes about 20 mins compared to 1-1.5 hrs! Would definitely recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Very good flat iron. For the price, it is perfect. Love it.</li>
    <li> I use this on both my daughter&#x27;s hair every morning.  It heats up fast and is easy to use.  The only downfall for me is that it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shutoff which scares me a little as we have left it on a handful of times already.  Other than that it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I recieved my flat iron on time with no damages! Tried it out and love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron based on the great reviews. when I finally got mine, I was very disappointed because it was used and had scratches on the plates and splash marks on the handle. the argan oil sample was opened, too. I contacted blue novelties to return my item to them. they apologized and asked if I would like a replacement. I agreed to the replacement item since i really wanted to try this iron, and they shipped a new one through express mail. I finally received my updated flat iron and I am in love with it! the plates are very smooth and glide through my hair with ease. It is very easy to handle too. the argan oil gets absorbed in my hair quickly and makes it very soft. It seems that this iron does not leave my hair damaged or dry. I would recommend this product to everyone. Blue novelties also has great customer services and they want to make sure you are satisfied with their product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Heats up real quick and is super hot!</li>
    <li> Let me start first by saying that the product shipped faster than I could have imagined. Fastest shipping I&#x27;ve EVER received on a package. Period. Now, as for the actual product, I read the reviews before buying but still, I would never have imagined it could work so well. I have very thick (about 4c texture) hair and this thing went through it like a knife through butter. It only took one pass with the iron to get the results I usually see in two or three passes with other irons. I even had a friend try it out and now she&#x27;s totally jealous! I love Love LOVE this product. Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> Works great! Great price.</li>
    <li> It stopped working within a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Sending this product back. I have Latina hair, not too tick, not curly, but a bit wavy. This flat Iron does little to mY hair. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough , it took me forever to straight up a little part of my hair. I did buy this, so I could get away of my 5yr old flat iron, but my older one is much better. Very disappointed .</li>
    <li> Not only was the shipping and arrival of this flat iron come super fast but when I used it for the first time i fell in love immediately. Great product without a doubt. No more waiting minutes before styling your hair when your rushing in the morning this flat iron literally takes 5 seconds if even that before hot and ready to go. The cord is on a 360degree swivel cord which makes it beyond easy and fast to create beautiful curls in seconds. It also includes a sample of Argan oil which is free of harsh smells like some heat protectant products, it actually smells nice. In addition, it also comes with a glove to protect your hand/fingertips from getting burned when styling and a pretty silk sleek pouch to store your flat iron when done. Not to mention I notice the pouch is padded so that it can be stored as soon as turned off and  finished styling.  This flat iron is versatile and can be used on all types of hair and leave your hair with that sleek shiny healthy salon hair. I&#x27;ve used on not only my hair but both of my sisters and we all have different textures from relaxed thick regular hair to natural soft curly hair to relaxed thick dry coarse hair and the results were unbelieveAble I mean bone straight sleek hair full of body  and bounce. By far my favorite flat iron EVER!!! Super affordable and great quality what&#x27;s not to love about it. I&#x27;d definitely buy again over and over again.RECOMMENDED RECOMMENDED RECOMMENDED!!!!  Ps: below I have attached my sister&#x27;s hair who hasn&#x27;t had a relaxed in over 2 months. Her hair type is relaxed thick coarse and dry and just look at the end result ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ</li>
    <li> The iron doesn&#x27;t heat up.to 410 degrees.  I have thick curly hair and need alot of heat to properly straighten my hair.  It also leaves my hair poofy and frizzes back up after 2 hours and it&#x27;s not even humid here.  Extremely disappointed and I&#x27;m waiting to hear back about returning it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON. Flat irons my hair perfectly. Usually I have to run the flat iron over my hair at least twice before it even gets straight, and since I have african american hair, I have to use a lot of products so when I flat iron my hair it leaves this nasty burnt smell. But not with this flat iron. One run i all it takes for my hair to straighten, and it leaves it really soft and just silky. Honestly, for $40 this is worth it, because I have a chi flat iron that I bought for $200 and this works even better. and you can curl with this too</li>
    <li> Very good seller and product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Overall product is ok. I have thick hair so still had to run the flat iron a few times to get it how I wanted it.</li>
    <li> Bought this straightener for my 15 yr old daughter. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this tool! I spent over $159 GSI for mine and I know I will never spend that much again after purchasing this one!! Great product for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the HSI flat iron once. I found it extremely comfortable and easy to use. I sprayed CHI 44 Iron Guard on my hair before using, loved the finished look. The best part was stepping out in Florida&#x27;s 84% humidity yesterday without my hair become frizzy and lifeless.</li>
    <li> What a deal! The flat iron is great! It&#x27;s also dual voltage so it will be perfect to take along with me to Europe! Love the oil AND they give you a heat glove to protect your hand to boot! Great company! I&#x27;d buy from them again in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this product.  Ordering was simple and fast and delivery was much faster then I expected.  I have used the product from the day I received it and I love the quality!</li>
    <li> We have been very please with our purchase. Item was sent in a timely manor and has worked well since. Thanks, Holly</li>
    <li> Now that I have your attention, I can honestly say this is the best flat iron that I have ever owned. I initially purchased this flat iron a couple of months ago, I sent it back before I used it and bought a curling iron instead, because I thought it would be better to use on my short haircut...mistake. I repurchased this flat iron because I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking about it, and I have now packed the curling iron away for good. This flat iron is great and much easier to use on my short hair. I also love the soft, red travel sachet that came with it. Using the flat iron has cut my get ready time on my hair to ten minutes...really. I have a short faux-hawk style haircut and I can get it done in a flash now!</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! I should of got it sooner.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is just as good as the expensive ones sold in the mall. very satisfied. comes with a nice satin case to keep everything together very professional. highly recommended for thick curly hair , mine is hip length hair and it got the job done amazing. the argan oil is the real thing and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Hair keeps slipping or getting caught and snag.  Would like to return</li>
    <li> Excellent iron. It exceed my expectations and also arrive quickly. The package include all the necessary tools. My hair looks awesome like when I visited a  beauty salon.</li>
    <li> This is great flat iron got it for my wife she loves it</li>
    <li> This flat iron is a great tool. At first I was kind of hesitant to keep it because I felt it was not doing it&#x27;s job but after a couple of uses and raising the temp it worked fine</li>
    <li> I bought this iron for my wife and she loves it! It heats up quickly, a plus for her when she is in a hurry getting ready for work. When she uses this iron, her style holds through to the next day, needing only a minimal touch up to make it look freshly styled. My lady loves this iron and when she&#x27;s happy.....I&#x27;m happy! Excellent product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron and I love the price even more!!!!!</li>
    <li> The iron appeared to have already been used. I have semi-wavy hair that is seldom frizzy. This iron makes my hair frizzy and I have to go over the same section several times. I bought the product after reading many positive reviews. Don&#x27;t be fooled like I was!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is the best one that I have ever used.  It is in your best interest to own one of your own.  You will be glad you did and the shipping was lightning fast.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron for my wife as a surprise gift. Her old iron was going out and would not get hot anymore. She has loved her new HSI iron since the day she received it. It heats up extremely fast and leaves her hair silky with no frizz. Great Product!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product and the bonus product that come with it makes it even better.</li>
    <li> It was really wonderful. My hair is straight already, but this leaves it even more smooth and sleek. Good purchase, definitely worth the slightly higher price compared to other hair straighteners. It also doesn&#x27;t have any burning smell and heats up very fast.</li>
    <li> Fast and easy to use for curls and flips</li>
    <li> Great flat iron - I was prepared to spend another $100 plus dollars on a new flat iron - after finding this on Amazon and reading the great reviews I thought I would give it a try - I have been very pleased - heats up quickly seems less damaging to my hair I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Affordable, sleek, works great! I have curly frizzy hair but it&#x27;s fine and this iron does not pull nor snag. Trust these reviews, they are for real.</li>
    <li> works great with my gray and course hair</li>
    <li> This a great product and it exceeded my expectations</li>
    <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought this item. I just thought it would work better than it does. I have fine hair and I don&#x27;t think it does a thing for me. I&#x27;ve tried using it as I&#x27;ve seen on You Tube videos but it just does nothing for me as far as volume, curl, or anything. It will also pull my hair if I don&#x27;t get it exactly right. The oil was nice that was included so I gave it two stars instead of one. May be returning it very soon.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  I am going to buy another one for my son&#x27;s picky girlfriend.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this flat iron.  It was also delivered super fast.  No problems so far.</li>
    <li> Not only did this Flat Iron arrive at my house on a Sunday, it was perfectly as described. Beyond a great deal and the Iron is so great and makes all the dfiference on your hair. I cant even begin to express my LOVE for this flat iron, I woud buy it again in a heartbeat! I have short, bleached hair so a good flat iron is very important so I dont cause any further damage, and this iron is the one!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> I love it and it is easy to use. It straightens my hair easy and gives it a nice shine. I can curl my ends with it and create a different hairstyle. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works well. Great for the price. No problems so far.</li>
    <li> I bought two of this item for my twin 17 year old daughters.  We had this item in the past and it is a great item, it broke when the kids dropped it traveling.  Both girls have long thick hair and this product does a great job for them.  One of the girls uses this at her cheerleading competitions to get the other girls ready and it has held up really well with constant use.  I would highly recommend this for anyone needing a straightener</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife after having one similar demonstrated on her at a local mall but at much more money and pushy sales person. She LOVES IT!! She has very curly hair naturally and with other irons it takes two+ hours to do the same as this one in less than half the time.</li>
    <li> Much better price than a CHI and I can&#x27;t tell the difference. Gives your a smooth shine as well. It also is one of the top 10 straightners in just about every professional website I read.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a Christmas gift for my daughter. I chose it because it has wonderful reviews, and I know she will love it. A great buy with nice extras. Includes a glove and argan oil. Well priced compared to other flat irons.</li>
    <li> Fantastic results!!!  We ordered the flat iron and it shipped flawlessly - we received it in no time at all. Thank you so much for your prompt service.  What a great value we are extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I no longer have to leave the house looking like something the cat dragged in.  My hair looks amazing every time I leave the house.  I would never be without this iron again.</li>
    <li> This flat Iron is really great for the price. It doesn&#x27;t get hot as quickly as the Chi does but once hot, it works great. Good product.</li>
    <li> Outstanding customer service and assistance. Product just as described.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! My daughter has very thick and curly hair. This flat iron worked great! Hardly took any time to straighten  it out! Comes beautifully packed with extras!</li>
    <li> I love my HSI straightening iron. It&#x27;s easy to use and the Argan oil that came with it is an added bonus to an already great product.</li>
    <li> After using only three times, it&#x27;s impossible to know how it will hold up over time, but it works very well so far. I did quite a lot of research before choosing the HSI model, and I am happy that I selected the one I did. Mine was purchased from Blue Novelties. Processing and delivery was super fast. It was in perfect condition and was as exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It really does straighten my hair easily and it lasts for days. I have very fine hair and even though I&#x27;m supposed to use a lower setting on my hair no other hair straightener would keep it straight. This does the job really well.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron for the price! Easy to use and does its job well. Works better than any previous iron I&#x27;ve owned (I think it&#x27;s my 5th). Great seller with excellent communication too!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected and a great price.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. It works amazingly well. I brought it on hype alone, and usually that doesn&#x27;t work out too well, but for this product, it did. It&#x27;s a professional hair straightener for a reason. The items it came with work wonders too. I dont really need the glove since I&#x27;m used to straightening my hairs by now, but I decided to use it just to see how heat-resistant it was, and I was pretty surprised, it is a great beginner item. The sample hair oil is also much appreciated. The straightener itself is just absolutely wonderful though, and I heard that the ceramic damages the hair less, so if that&#x27;s true, that is an excellent added bonus - people that straighten their hair know what a pain it can be to prevent hair damage, so the fact it is less damaging than other straighteners is just absolutely amazing. Great product!</li>
    <li> Works just fine, though has a funny smell (which might go away after more use, kind of like a new car smell).  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Won&#x27;t find a better straighter at this price.  Excellent seller with super fast shipment!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> My hair has always been frizzy, but stick straight, nothing could make it calm down. It wouldn&#x27;t hold a curl despite multiple stylists doing their tricks.....until I tried this straightener. Now my hair can be styled in 10 minutes or less and it stays styled ALL DAY with minimal hairspray. My husband likes the HSI Professional straightener as much as I do, simply because it makes me happy about my hair for the first time in my life! :) I love the temp control setting, too. No need to fry my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is much better than the more expensive model I replaced. It came faster than I thought possible. A great investment.</li>
    <li> Great iron -- heats quickly and straightens well. I also use it to give my hair loose curls -- the swiveling cord makes this very easy. Great flat iron for this price! I would get again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic.  Received super fast.  Exactly what I ordered and works great.  Had a CHI previously, but very happy with this choice.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Daughter had one and niece wanted one since she liked it so much.  Got her on for Christmas!  Received it quick as well.</li>
    <li> Very good flat iron. I love it. Wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it for one day. Price is great for such a great product.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great! Came quickly.  I bought it due to all the great reviews online.  It has been compared to other popular brands, including CHI straighteners.  Girlfriend is very pleased.</li>
    <li> All real HSI products are very professional and deliver professional results. Their flat irons are the best on the market. Smooth sleek results...rare flyaways. The argon oil proceeded as a gift in the kit is also very helpful with keeping flyaways in tact and smoothing the ends of your hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works very well. Has on/off switch and variable temp knob. Most importantly it is multi-voltage so worked fine on a trip to Australia. The travel size Argan oil and smoothing glove was an unexpected bonus.</li>
    <li> Good experience and good product.</li>
    <li> This flat iron did not get hot enough to even slightly flatten my hair. Even after several passes my hair was still very frizzy. There was a dragging/pulling feeling as I ran it over my hair, not the smooth easy glide feeling you typically get from a good quality flat iron. Very disappointing all around. Item was returned and replacement item had the same issues. Perhaps the quality of the item depends upon the seller. All I can figure is there must be some knock offs being offered up here. I just can&#x27;t make sense out of all the positive reviews. Very suspicious.</li>
    <li> After years of thinking that I wasn&#x27;t doing something right, I finally learned that in order to get a good result from flat ironing your hair, you had to have a GOOD flat iron.  I&#x27;m a low maintenance person when it comes to hair styling - I need quick and easy.  I wasn&#x27;t even in the market for a flat iron, but saw the great reviews and great price on this one and decided to buy it.  It did not disappoint!  I immediately put the flat iron that I was using in my travel bag and now use this one everyday. If you are in the market for a flat iron, look no further - this is it!</li>
    <li> I really love this for my hair it makes it so smooth</li>
    <li> Love the product, first time using a flat iron, so easy.  Product does exactly as advertised, I will recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I love this product,especially the argon oil leave in hair treatment. It works perfectly with my thick and long hair. I highly recommend this product. Have not failed me yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time user of a flat iron and have found this iron easy to use. I like being able to adjust the temperature of the iron. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing and easy to use. It makes my hair smoth. The thing that I liked most is the electric safty botton which help to prevent electric shock that happened in some other products</li>
    <li> My daughter has had this straightener for a while now, and I used it for the first time this month.  I told her that I was going to steal it from her because I liked it so much.  Instead of being a family thief, I ordered one a couple of weeks ago and am amazed at the difference between it and the one I had been using for for years.  Cuts my hair prep time down substantially.  Love how smooth it is and how nice it leaves my hair.  Even though I have a travel straightener, I will pack this larger one when traveling because I like how it works and am willing to take up more suitcase space in order to have nicer hair.  Order arrived quickly, and the company immediately sent an email asking about their service.  I give A+ to how well they interact with the customer.</li>
    <li> Great time arrival and great product</li>
    <li> Looks good, heats up quickly and works well. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Works well and is worth the money.</li>
    <li> It looks cheap and used. I don´t recomend it.</li>
    <li> Great product, works as well as those 4x the price.</li>
    <li> I ordered 12/23 received a few days later. Was totally surprised with delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;I used the product for the first time today. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Only negative I have is the settings, they&#x27;re in the middle of the unit. I&#x27;d prefer on the side.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t heat up like it was supposed to.</li>
    <li> A very good product fast and efficiant delivery</li>
    <li> I have very thick long hair! So finding a straightener that works is hard!! But I bought this little one AND IT DOES THE JOB</li>
    <li> It shipped fast. It will be a gift so I hope it works good</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife. She likes this much better than her Chi. The temp control is what she likes the most</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product since it came in a timely manner so u can wrap it up as gift for Christmas</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a flat iron.  While it took a little getting used to I really love it!  My hairdresser told me what features to look for and this one has it all!  Most importantly, the company is terrific to deal with.  I had a some  questions and they were quick to answer and help!</li>
    <li> I debated about this purchase for a while. After using this iron once, I threw my old one out! This iron is terrific -- and works far better than the cheaper (Conair) iron that I owned. It&#x27;s a great value and I recommend it without hesitation.</li>
    <li> They are great! My first iron stopped working and even though it was past the manufacturers return date they still are sending me a new one free of charge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also got here fast!</li>
    <li> Made my hair look very slick and my split ends hardly show.</li>
    <li> Daughter say&#x27;s she really likes it but she actually wants to do her own review after she&#x27;s owned it for a year so she can rate how it holds up over time.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the HSI Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener.  Would recommend to others.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Love this!!!!!! Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had! The price was awesome!!!!!! Would buy from this company again!!!</li>
    <li> So far so good, not disappointed. I like it how my hair does not get stuck on the plates. Heats very quickly and im liking my results.</li>
    <li> My wife has really enjoyed this product.</li>
    <li> This flat Iron shines your hair as you straighten. It gets hot immediately and is ready to use. Great flat iron, definitely recommend purchasing it!</li>
    <li> Good buyer,  good product</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife and she likes it very much.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it! Heats up fast and straightens perfectly. Love the oil that came with it also. Overall excellent product.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener, there is absolutely no question that this is the most luxurious and efficient product offered by amazon. I  use it everyday, because it makes my normally frizzy and curly hair look straight and professional and its so easy to use, taking two minutes to heat up and going  smoothly through hair. With the compliments I get from my friends for having professional celebrity looking hair and the price offered by amazon, I 100% recommend this product to anyone who is fighting the curly and frizzy battle of their morning bedheads.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this flat iron!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this got so many 5-star reviews. I bought the iron because it was double-voltage to use it while traveling. It was delivered right before I left the country, so I didn&#x27;t have time to check how it worked. While it is hot, it feels cheap. The edges of the plates catch and snag my hair, ripping it. It was very unpleasant to use, so it was just dead weight in my suitcase. The seller isn&#x27;t letting me return it once I&#x27;m back in the states, so I&#x27;m stuck with something I won&#x27;t use ever. Buy something else.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron !!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron .. Is amazing .. bought it for my daughter as a birthday gift when off of reviews and product info.. Have not been disappointed! Works wonderfully on very thick hair.. She absolutely loves it and has mentioned several times how quickly she can straighten her hair now with this product! I have already recommended it to several friends!</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use.!</li>
    <li> This was rated very high on Amazon and with good reason!  It&#x27;s the perfect size and you can control the temperature.  I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> This flat iron gets hot enough to do the job that I bought it for.  Even tho my hair is short, it does the job with a slight twist of the iron.  The temp control is a plus too.  It is sleek and professional looking and the electric cord is long enough and does not tangle.  Another plus!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  It&#x27;s the same model that her hair dresser uses at her salon.</li>
    <li> I am really going to saving $$$ versus going to a salon.  WOW!  I have thin, soft curly hair.  Relaxing is too damaging!  I can control the heat setting.  So glad I tried something new.  Will be donating the basket of other hair appliances!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. She has thick, semi-curly hair. She loves this product. It straightens her hair quickly and leaves it soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Great deal!! I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my sister as a less-expensive alternative the the Chi straightener she wanted. After almost a month of use she says she loves it.</li>
    <li> The product came in in perfect condition. I have been very happy with the heat settings. I have thick wavy hair and the iron works great. It head up quickly and the bag helps to keep it from getting damaged whole not in use.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 3rd generation version and am very pleased with my purchase! I have fine hair that is generally straight, but can be &#x27;frizzy&#x27; or have fly-aways. I like the temperature control - I can find the right temperature that gets the job done, but won&#x27;t cause too much damage. My hair does not get stuck in the plates of this straightener like it did my previous one. I can get right up to my scalp to straighten my bangs and am not worried about being burned. I read on some reviews that people were having problems with the part that you hold on to getting too hot - I have not had this problem. I was also very pleased with the seller (Blue Novelties) - fast shipping and arrived in perfect condition. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair is much shinier and healthy looking after all the times it&#x27;s been dyed and flat iron. Also it was shipped and received very quickly. I will definately be ordering the argan oil again.</li>
    <li> Received as expected working better than listed</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how many raving reviews this thing got.  I should have known with the sub-$100 price point this would be a drugstore flat iron at best.  Not digital, you have to go over very small strands over and over and yet it still does not get as smooth as the Croc or Sedu irons.  MAYBE if you have super thin, not wavy/frizzy/curly hair this would work.  But for me and my daughter, a big thumbs down.  I will be going back to the Croc or Sedu.</li>
    <li> Worst !! I got it by seeing very good reviews ,but my hair its thick and wavy didn&#x27;t straight at all and made my hair dull</li>
    <li> Heats up fast with multiple temperatures and straightens my hair nicely. I didn&#x27;t realize how poorly my old straightener was until I have received this one! Love it!</li>
    <li> I broke my third Chi of my life and decided to take a gamble.  Honestly, it&#x27;s not as good as my old Chi.  For some reason, I just don&#x27;t have the control I had with my Chi.  Maybe the hinge is tighter or the heating panels are situated differently on the arms, I don&#x27;t know.  HOWEVER, I do think that for the price, it&#x27;s worth it.  I would definitely buy again over another Chi, because of the price.  But I&#x27;d be lying if I said I didn&#x27;t miss my Chi.  If you&#x27;ve never owned a Chi, or this is your first flat iron purchase, don&#x27;t hesitate in purchasing this one.  Just do it!  It&#x27;s a VERY good product and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. And the price cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> Perfect travel flat iron for the price!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a 2nd straight iron for the RV.  I read several reviews and everyone seemed to love it.  I was looking at a different product and reviews where it was too hot.  This iron works fine, I just have to go slow down the length of the hair.  I prefer a hotter iron.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Gets nice and hot!  Does its job well!</li>
    <li> Ordered it for my wife. She says she loves it. That&#x27;s enough for me. Got it when they said I would in perfect condition. Can&#x27;t expect more than that.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> Great Flat Iron.  Heats up quickly and easy to use. The addition of the glove and travel size Arian oil is a plus.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  The temp control customizes your hair to just the style you want, and my hair was so shiny and full of body when I was done. I would recommend this product to anyone who is considering a flat iron.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different flat irons over the years and this is by far the best one, yielding the best results with my hair. My hair is not curly but it is not straight. It is THICK and difficult to straighten to where it will STAY straight for any length of time. Little did I know that a higher quality iron would actually make such a big difference. I am very happy with the results I get from using this product.  UPDATE ON SELLER: review of the hair iron stays the same, but when the seller says they will send a free argan oil sample when you complete a review of the product do not be fooled -- they have not sent mine despite my emailing and them saying they will look into it. It&#x27;s been 2 months.</li>
    <li> Heats up very quickly! Straightens my thick, corse hair effortlessly! Never pulls my hair out, either! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Never tried any super expensive stuff, but I would imagine this works just as well</li>
    <li> I enjoy this productt, my hair is smooth, shiny and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> it has to be turned up pretty high to work well</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this HSI professional ceramic flat iron.  Leaves my hair straight with a nice glossy sheen.  The Argan oil is a nice bonus.  A first for me using Argan oil but very happy with the results I get after using the flat iron.  Definitely a excellent buy for such a quality styling product.</li>
    <li> Nice job without burning my hair</li>
    <li> great item great price</li>
    <li> Excellent Product👌👌 Bought it after reviewing the Comments. A must have❗️❗️</li>
    <li> Takes a long time to get hot but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I had bought a PYT straightener a few years ago and I loved it. I even bought the holster that keeps it buckled to the wall and I loved that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, all straighteners will die over time. They start taking far too long to heat up, and then they can&#x27;t hang onto the heat consistently so you have to let it heat back up in the middle of the job. This is what happened to my old PYT after enough years of constant use. I came on Amazon to find a new PYT and I was determined to stay loyal to the brand as I really loved it. Unfortunately, I bought two different PYT straighteners and had to return both of them. Neither of them worked properly when I received them. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt frustrated and no longer wanted to gamble on buying yet another PYT and then having to send a third one back. So I took a different kind of gamble and bought the 3rd gen HSI. It had great reviews, so despite not ever hearing of this brand, I trusted the reviewers enough to place my order and crossed my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled with this straightener. It worked great straight out of the box. It heats up in just a few minutes, even on the highest heat setting! Even faster than my old PYT when it was new!&lt;br /&gt;The heat dial goes up to 410 degrees Fahrenheit, which I noticed was not as hot at PYT. I honestly don&#x27;t see a difference. It straightens my hair just as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this straightener is a fraction of the cost of my old PYT. It does just as good a job on my hair. I now keep my HSI straightener in my old PYT holster and when it eventually dies, I will probably shop for HSI over PYT. I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> This is actually one of the better flat irons I&#x27;ve used. My hair is a lot like Alicia Keys. Relatively tight curls and frizzes in humidity. This was the closest I&#x27;ve gotten to salon hair since my Bablybliss Nano stopped working or stopped working on my hair. I find that after some time, certain devices are no longer able to tame my hair before I have to switch. I recommend this to anyone with type C curls or less.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. It does a lot better than my old flat iron. It gets my hair nice and straight and it even curls.</li>
    <li> It pulls through my hair smoothly until I get to the bottom of my hair (my ends) not sure if it&#x27;s how I&#x27;m using it or the flat iron. It&#x27;s my first straightener so I don&#x27;t know much about it (what to compare it to/what to expect) I&#x27;m just learning to use it but so far so good.</li>
    <li> This iron didn&#x27;t get as hot as I expected. It caught the ends of my hair as I slid it down and I didn&#x27;t think it flattened the hair as nicely as the Remington I currently have. My hair was not as shiny and silky as it is with the Remington. I did return the iron and the seller was very helpful and professional.</li>
    <li> This straight iron is a great value for the price.  I had this exact flat iron previously and dropped it one too many times.  I ordered the same product because I think this iron is as high in quality as many of the $80 flat irons I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> Do not buy! You may look at the price and think..&amp;#34;oh, that&#x27;s a great price for a professional flat iron&amp;#34;..but I am confident when I say this is NOT a professional flat iron. After a month and a half or so it gave off a burning hair smell and the plates don&#x27;t glide smoothly through hair. The plates should close tight when clamped down and they do not. You can try it out for yourself but take the $40.00 you&#x27;ll spend on this one and purchase a legit flat iron...zero stars for this one..</li>
    <li> This product is by far one of the best hair straightener i have purchase. I certainly did a lot of research and was skeptical at first because of the price. My hair looks bouncy and fabulous!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about buying a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; flat iron for such a low price but to my surprise it went above and beyond my expectations. My hair is naturally thick and quite frizzy so unless I pay to have someone straighten it at a salon its usually big and wild anytime I try to wear it down. I&#x27;ve used other flat irons that leave my hair smelling like smoke and steaming and with this one I have not experienced any of that... it seems to straighten just as well as the one my hair stylist uses which will save me a little money! Overall great buy and it also shipped very quickly so +++ all the way around :)</li>
    <li> Had some trouble getting the first one, but once it came...took two weeks, it&#x27;s been great.  Ive been using cheaper models so definitely notice a difference.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d figure out how to use a hair straightener but this is so easy and effective.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the best bang for your bucK, this flat iron is the one to choose. I bought many expensive flat irons from chi to titanium and many more. When my chi just stopped working I wasnt  looking at spending $200 again. So I was on the look. After much research I ran across the HSI professional and it is truly amazing. It gets to desired temperature in seconds and performs great. It has a great flexible cord that rotates with you. It is great for curling and getting that nice straight look. It also comes with a great bag for easy transport and storage which I usually pay $20 for. As well as a nice oil used to assist in straightening. I am of Swedish,Japanese,Hawaiian, and African American decent and it worked great. I see it doing well for all hair types! Definitely worth the money, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> The hsi glides nice threw my hair even though my hair is fine, an has damaged hair.  I like the fact that it is only 1&amp;#34;, I use it to straighten and curl my hair.  Came with a free Argan oil( have yet to use) but I hear is great for your hair. Also, a heat resistant glove.</li>
    <li> This flatiron is by far on of the best I have used. I have thick natural hair and when I use this flatiron my hair gets none straight and feels smooth and silky. I would recommend this flatiron for anyone who&#x27;s wants smooth sleek hair.</li>
    <li> It was an excellen. Straightener  for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as mentioned in description. Fast delivery. Excellent service. My hair is thick and wavy and the item works great.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair straightener. It gets hot fast. Literally within seconds. It runs smooth, and can be cleaned easily. Leaves my hair feeling shiny, and soft. Like no other straightener. The plate is bigger and makes for quick straightening. What used to take me an hour and some, only takes 30 minutes or less. My hair stays straight longer too. I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but I can wear it for a week without feeling like I need to wash or touch it up.  A few notes, it can snag your hair so be careful when running the straightener not to pull too hard or too fast.  Also, although it makes hair shiny and frizz free, it can reduce volume. This can be corrected by a bit of teasing of hair.</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Fast shipping!!  Thanks so much!!</li>
    <li> The HSI Professional iron is an excellent product, I recommend it completely, also comes with a glove is excellent for protection.&lt;br /&gt;and I love the Argan Oil too.</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair and this flat iron works as well as others that I have purchased for double or triple the price of this one in the past.&lt;br /&gt;It is very effective in creating silky smooth hair.  I usually use the higher heat settings and have not had any problems with hair damage though have been using a heat protectant with it.  So far it has been very reliable over the 3 months that I have owned this.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This straightener works about as well as a $20 straightener from the drug store. I&#x27;m very unimpressed. This thing is a total waste of money. It takes 5-10 passes on each tiny section of hair to properly straighten on the highest heat setting. It leaves your hair looking frizzy. If you buy this you might as well be flushing $59 down the toilet.</li>
    <li> Awesome straightener. Heats up in less than a minute and leaves my hair silky and smooth. Even better is that it costs a fraction of what I paid for my last hair straighter. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have never heard of the HSI brand before and after doing some research I thought I should give this a try based on the reviews and price. Long story short this flat iron is exactly what I was looking for. I have Natural Coily hair and it works great on my hair! Since this flat iron has temperature adjustment, I can fiddle with the degrees to see which is best for my hair.  It heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t produce a burning smell like my old flat iron. Everything comes in the box just as described in the ad, and this doesn&#x27;t look or feel like a cheap product. If you are looking for a high quality flat iron you should give this a go!</li>
    <li> Excellent, brand new item - exactly as described.  Super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> love this flat iron and the price is awesome !</li>
    <li> This flat iron is perfect for all hair types. I have relatively straight hair but my roommate has thicky curly hair and it works just as well for her! Fast to heat up and easy to use, this is by far the best hair product I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> The seller was great to work with. I feel like the temperature isn&#x27;t quite right but I just keep it on the highest setting and my hair comes out soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the quality of this flat iron. It&#x27;s a great value for the price. It came in the mail right when it was estimated to.</li>
    <li> Great product! Needed a straightener that could take control of my hair. I had a Chi straightener that wasn&#x27;t bad but wasn&#x27;t giving me the results I needed.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron.  I use it to curl my hair and I love that it is thick and leaves big curls and not tight ones.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly. Nice size. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but it seems to do a good job.  *Update*  Straightener makes my hair really frizzy and caused a lot of damage over the weeks that I used it. Finally, I decided to return it after giving it a really fair try.   Also, the heat settings are by a tiny knob that is not in an easy place to get to. It did pull my hair, and just not a very good design.</li>
    <li> It took the longest expected time to deliver. I could not track the package. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times...and I&#x27;m not extremely impressed yet.</li>
    <li> I have a young teenage girl who has very curly hair that is unmanageable at times.  I ordered the flat iron to do her hair.  It is everything I hoped and works perfectly on her hair.  Her hair looks naturally straight and healthy using the flat iron along with the thermal protector spray I had also ordered.</li>
    <li> Update to item:  This flat iron quit working properly a few months after purchase.  Appears to be a short in the wiring.  Very disappointed that the quality is missing.     Great item!  Heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t fry my hair. Easy to flip ends for fun styling.  My daughter has a Chi and she likes this one better.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great. I have bought several different brands in the past with 0 results. This flat iron straightens and curls with ease. I have crazy wavy hair and i love the results I get.</li>
    <li> I have used several different brands of flat irons. I&#x27;m in the process of letting my hair grow out. I had short hair for a while and was always cutting it so the flat iron really didn&#x27;t matter because the ends would be cut within 3 to 4 weeks. Now I&#x27;m more conscious of my hair. This flat iron is great along with the Argan leave in oil!! I have noticed no more fried ends and leaves my hair smooth. I really like the settings that you can change it to. The travel bag is great also. I travel and its convenient to be able to have a bag to protect my flat iron. The price is great for the value you get from this flat iron. Highly recommended!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful flat iron! I have thick curly hair and it usually takes forever to get straight with other flat irons. Using this product made it a breeze!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my very picky 14 year old daughter as a gift for Christmas (she&#x27;s got thick, really long hair, almost down to her butt!) and she absolutely LOVES it.  It gets her hair nice and stick straight and it looks really lovely - hah, makes me a bit jealous of her gorgeous hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I would definitely recommend this product, like I said, the girl is picky as heck (makes buying gifts pretty difficult) but if she loves it that much, you are guaranteed to love it too.  :)</li>
    <li> Just love it.  It is so handy .Use it every morning. Heats quickly.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this flat iron - it&#x27;s a good light weight and I appreciate the long cord; the red travel bag is cool and will be perfect as I travel several times a year. I have medium length, fine hair that is also colored, which means I need products that will not create anymore damage. I have owned Revlon flat irons in the past as I did not realize the differences between ceramic tourmaline and metal. Now, I see and feel the difference in my hair after using the HSI flat iron - major improvement over the cheaper models. I did purchase the HSI on sale - it&#x27;s worth every penny and more!</li>
    <li> This flat iron came with a glove and a really nice pouch to keep the iron in. There were directions included that I found helpful. The first time I used it-- my first ever flat iron-- and I got just the results that I was hoping for. It heated up quickly.  It says you can buy a holder to put the hot iron in but it was fine on my marble counter. I highly recommend this model!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works excellent . I shopped around before purchasing and I am extreemly satisfied with my purchase . My hair looks like I went to a salon when flat ironed with this flat iron . The glove that comes with the flat iron is also great and the pouch to put the iron away in is excellent . If your looking a good and affordable flat iron ... Look no further and buy this one .</li>
    <li> Its hard to rate this product because I got to use it on before it suddenly stopped working! But the one time I did use it it worked so well. No frizz and no burning smell that I notice most flat irons have. I did email the company about it not working and the replacement is on its way!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I only used it once for myself and once for my daughter but i&#x27;m already loving the results! And my daughter agrees! Can&#x27;t wait to bring this with us on our travel very soon! The dual voltage is also a big Plus for this product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned. I love it, it makes my hair shiny!</li>
    <li> heat up fast and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Received this flat iron because my old one from the mall had broken.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality compared to the low price.  The product came packaged perfectly and protected with bubble wrap on the inside.  1 year warranty information is included inside the box.  A silky carrying case is included with the product, which is great for traveling.  I have wavy hair, and I put this on the lowest setting.  The iron didn&#x27;t leave any kinks or marks in my hair or pull like others have done.  It ran smoothly across my hair.  For being on the lowest setting it did its job perfectly.  My hair even felt fuller after using it.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I recently made an upgrade and purchased the HSN Professional Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron and couldn’t be happier with my decision. The HSI Professional Tourmaline Flat Iron has been fabulous! PRO&#x27;s: Heats up quickly Handle fits nicely in my hand Nice heat cover pouchprovided Indicator light is a plus!!! Great price</li>
    <li> Excellent product with fast heat up times, it&#x27;s nice to have a straightener that actually feels like its well built.  The smooth ceramic plates don&#x27;t pull hair and I love the adjustable temperature.</li>
    <li> Great value. This flat iron seems to get hotter than others I have owned in the past and works great on my hair. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a high quality product for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Got a good deal on this item.  Works great and leaves my hair feeling soft and sleek.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as a gift...she travels abroad a lot so she needed a multi-voltage instrument that was versatile, easy to use and reliable...suffice to say I am now the best Dad in the world.</li>
    <li> My wife is very pleased with this purchase after she figured out that the red reset button had to be reset initially. Does an excellent job on her hair and the handle does a good job of insulating the heat from her hand. Would highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron for my wife because of the excellent experience that our daughter had with this model.  She had originally purchased it prior to an international trip, and the big selling point was the dual voltage feature.  My wife was also very pleased with its performance since she also used it on the same trip.  We are about to embark on another journey abroad, and my wife needed to add this to her arsenal of beauty products, since our daughter doesn&#x27;t live nearby.  My wife had no hesitation in suggesting this model, and we were very pleased that it was still available at Amazon.  The product arrived as expected, and she is relieved that she now has a flat iron that she can use anywhere without any concerns - she is very happy.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! It does great straightening my hair and also making curls. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as it says.  I have samoan hair and it takes a few swipes to tame the beast but the price was right.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy another but not throwing it away either.</li>
    <li> Great product quality, design and performance with a handy travel sleeve. Excellent product with all the bells and whistles at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I like the Flatiron. The only problem I have is that it catches on my hair a lot. That is the only reason I&#x27;m giving it a 4. But I must admit that it does straighten my hair which is quite curly very well. It must be noted that I am only straightening the very top of my head not all of my hair.</li>
    <li> Good price. Works as advertised. I got this to replace the same unit I bought 6 years ago. This iron will last.</li>
    <li> I really love the flat iron and love the Argan sample too.</li>
    <li> In Love with this flat iron. After reviewing many Amazon comments and sifting through all of the feedback for a lot of flat irons, this one was rated the highest and purchased the most often. As soon as my girlfriend plugged it in and let it heat up for 45 seconds she tried it out. She immediately was smiling and showing me how quickly a flat and her hair and how fast it heated up and how hot it got. Excellent product</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She says that it heats up fast and that it does an excellent job with her hair. She has very thick frizzy hair and this has made her mornings go much quicker. She absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I have super thin hair so flat irons tend to rip at my hair, this one DOES NOT RIP OR PULL AT ALL. I love the oil it came with too, makes my hair super soft. The price on this is perfect, I was so not looking forward to getting another decent flat iron because they are so expensive, so when I saw this one I was so excited it wasn&#x27;t going to cost me an arm and a leg. Thank you for making an awesome affordable flat iron.</li>
    <li> Met my expectations.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> After receiving my HSI straightener in the mail I went straight in to try it. Other straighteners had been frying my hair since my hair is so fine. With the HSI I have not had any fried off pieces. The straightener goes through the hair smoothly. I also like the caring bag that comes with it especially since I work on the road and some mornings I don&#x27;t have time for the straightener to cool. Great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron based on reviews from Amazon as well as a Facebook friend. Actually, all the girls made comments on Facebook about how nice this iron worked to both straighten and curl their hair. It works very well. My hair is never burned, and I can easily add a few curls if I&#x27;m in the mood. The temperature gauge works well as sometimes I want it cooler and/or hotter depending on what I&#x27;m doing with my hair that day. I worry about frizzy and dry looking hair as I&#x27;m an older gal! Great flat iron especially for the money! Gosh, I&#x27;ve spent tons of money on flat irons!</li>
    <li> I did some research prior to buying this item and I must say that I agree with most of the reviews available for this flat iron. The fluctuation in the heat setting that is mentioned in some reviews hasn&#x27;t been that big of an issue for me. I&#x27;m not one to complain about little things like that anyway. I would recommend this flat iron. It&#x27;s been named one of the best flat irons of 2015 under $100 and I think I got a good deal with this one :)</li>
    <li> packaged great, product works great.  I have short, wavy hair and a straight iron is better than a curling iron for taming the waves</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a pleasant buying experience and I am happy with this product, I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Great product.  GreT price!</li>
    <li> I have used many hair straightners. Some I have paid a lot of money for. The HSI professional straighner is one of the best I have used. The only feature I can say I do not like is there is no automatic off switch. I am sure this is because it is a professional tool and most professionals use their products throughout the day and do not want them to turn off. The straightner did pull my hair when I first started using it, but once it was broke in, it no longer pulled. I would recommend using some type of straighning cream so it doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
    <li> Works great!! I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. It&#x27;s still hard to straighten my hair but I&#x27;ve always had problems haha. It works alot better than other straighteners I use.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Heats Up Quickly&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to grip onto and hold&lt;br /&gt;- Comes in a silky red bag for the Straightener&lt;br /&gt;- Free glove and argan oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Dial for turning temperature</li>
    <li> Quick shipment and works great! I love it!</li>
    <li> I tried the flat iron out on a small section of my extremely corkscrew curly hair and it straighted it even without my blow drying it straight first! I am so excited about this product.</li>
    <li> Great product....great price!  I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! Price was better than store brands for a professional straightener!!! My daughter uses it a lot and it is easy on her hair. Recommend over cheap models for the same price basically!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best straightner I have used.  It works great!</li>
    <li> Works great, no complaints. Had a snag in the original shipping but that got sorted out super fast. Glad everything&#x27;s going good this is for when I travel and came just in time before a friend&#x27;s out of town wedding.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and great customer assistance.  Product arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> does the wrk&lt;br /&gt;great to straight or curl&lt;br /&gt;perfect&lt;br /&gt;will buy again</li>
    <li> I bought as a gift....</li>
    <li> Great product, straightens my hair and great price.</li>
    <li> This iron works great and heats up very fast! I have very thick, curly hair that is hard to manage and this iron works great for me. The oil that comes with this product has worked great for my hair since it is very dry during winter time. Love this iron!</li>
    <li> Product: I love love love this product! It&#x27;s really nice and it only takes 20 minutes to straighten your hair, without wetting it, the straightened hair lasts for about 4 days, which is really nice, and this is a high quality flat iron. If you&#x27;re going for straight hair, there are no bumps, the hair is all straight, and this iron also works really well as a curling iron. The iron slides smoothly over the hair, and does not catch. The product also comes with a glove, which is useful when touching the hot air. Included with the iron is a bag, which is convenient for travel. Again, I really love this product and give it a 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller: There was a very good transaction with the seller, and I would definitely recommend the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this flat iron!!!! It works very well. I have naturally curly hair and it makes my hair feel like silk. And it arrived on time!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works amazing. So glad I upgraded my old flat iron for this one.  My hair changed after pregnancy and my old straightener wasn&#x27;t getting my hair straight any more. This iron has worked wonders in my frizzy hair</li>
    <li> Wife really loves this unit. Happy wife, happy life.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t straighten my hair very often, because it is such a long process for my curly, thick hair. This straightener is so sleek and quick that I think I will be using it more often than my last. I liked it from the moment I pulled it out of the box, it&#x27;s a clean design and easy to hold in your hand. Very impressed with the price to quality of this item.</li>
    <li> Great flatiron..best one yet</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my fiancé after hers took a dive into the trash bin. All in all a good product. Only down side which she found is that the tongs don&#x27;t stay clamped shut and don&#x27;t have any kind of lever to hold them together.</li>
    <li> I bought this one for my girlfriend and I must say she is quite happy with the results. She has invested in countless other brands and spent over hundreds of dollars on other flat irons only to be disappointed and essentially have to return the item. At less than half the price of the other flat irons she has purchased, this particular one has been the one which has exceeded her expectations. She has very full and thick hair and it straightens it nicely and effortlessly. Would recommend to anyone looking for a flat iron to invest in this first before going on and spending hundreds on brands that do not perform as well as this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. She absolutely loves it. It&#x27;s the best one she&#x27;s ever owned and used. Great product! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It is an excellent iron, my wife is very pleased with it,&lt;br /&gt;It has two voltages which makes it perfect when travelling abroad.&lt;br /&gt;The oil is a very good product and works wonderful&lt;br /&gt;The glove is a nice detail and keeps your hand very safe.&lt;br /&gt;Not a single complaint about this product. We are very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again and strongly recommend it</li>
    <li> I gave it to my daughter as a Christmas gift. She said it worked fabulously!</li>
    <li> I was unsure about buying this since the price is so much cheaper than a lot of other products on the market that have all the same features, but are $50-$75 more. Also because this product has so many positive reviews that I originally thought this must be a scam, so I did my research and found that it really is just a great product so I went ahead and ordered it. It comes with a glove that is too big for my hand so I don&#x27;t use it, but still cool I guess. It also came with oil to silken your hair, but I haven&#x27;t used that yet either (but it smells good). My biggest reason for buying this was bc it has the ability to not just straighten your hair, but curl it also. I thought that it would take me awhile to learn the technique for it since I&#x27;m a little hair challenged, but it is super easy even for me. All in all this is by far one of the best things I&#x27;ve bought in awhile.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well but i hâd better.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my old hair straightener that I&#x27;ve had forever.  This one was so reasonable and the reviews were great, so I gave it a shot.  Love it!  It comes with a glove, a sample of argon oil, and a really nice carrying case.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, but it straightens my hair so quickly and the argon oil keeps it from getting frizzy!  Love this product and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Bought this for an Ireland trip for the wife.  She likes it but prefers titanium plates since this one drags on her hair too much.  She doesn&#x27;t use it while at home now.</li>
    <li> it styles my hair better than my CHI that i was using for the past couple of years. It keeps my hair smooth and shiny and I love that I can curl it with the straightener a little bit instead of it always looking the same way.</li>
    <li> Great product! Makes my semi- wavy hair, shiny, and straight.  I like that I can curl or flip my hair as well.</li>
    <li> This iron was the perfect gift for my wife. Very handy so far very reliable. I definitely made a good choice getting this as her valentine gift. Just as the descriptions and great reviews I read.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  The size is perfect for me to use at home or traveling.  It comes with a small bottle of some special oil to protect your hair and a very nice travel bag.</li>
    <li> Great quality but my wife has had trouble crimping her hair.</li>
    <li> Fabulous flat iron!! Very good price. The glove is a great touch!!</li>
    <li> Purchased to use for my daughter - came with a very nice storage pouch, heat resistant glove and oil to use in hair. Heats up very quickly and worked great. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron that I have owned, hands down. It heats up super fast, and straightens my hair smoothly.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I feel like all the hype is for nothing. I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for 6+ years and over time I&#x27;ve learned that it&#x27;s not always about the straightener you use - it&#x27;s about the technique and how much you take care of your hair. However, this straightener is one of the exceptions! When my Royale died on me after 5 years of use, I was in need of a straightener that could do as good of a job as that one, or even better. After reading all the reviews about the HSI straightener I decided to get it right away, as I didn&#x27;t want to downgrade from the one I previously owned for so long. This has been such a disappointment! I&#x27;ve had straighteners bought from grocery stores that work just like this one. It doesn&#x27;t thoroughly straighten your hair, it leaves your tips so dry, and after only 2-3 days your hair is already at an awkward stage between straight and curly. My hair can last up to 10 days straight (not that I want it to last that long, but it has happened before), and this time I didn&#x27;t even get halfway through the week! I feel that I did my hair with a straightener I could have bought at a CVS. Lesson learned: why save a few bucks for a crappy product when you can actually pay for what you get and for something that will do the job right? 2/5 stars for this disappointing straightener!! Going back to Royale - or CHI, BabyLiss, Conair, whatever, as long as it is of better quality!</li>
    <li> Came on time &amp; works perfectly! Better than all of my old flat irons! Love it!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase! I received the flat iron very quickly and it has been great for my hair. My hair is very sensitive, and other flat irons often leave my hair either too dry and &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; or too flat and greasy-looking. This iron makes my hair smooth and shiny, without drying it out too much or making it flat. I would definitely recommend this flat iron to anyone in need of a new one!</li>
    <li> This product came so soon; I was amazed.  I bought one for my daughter and she loves it.  She uses it everyday.  I am so happy with this product and so is she.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve had . The one I had for years broke and I was so worried I wasn&#x27;t going to get one that worked as good But I&#x27;m very glad I got this one . My hair is hard to straiten and this one straitens with just one pass! I&#x27;m very happy and definitely will be re purchasing</li>
    <li> Update: 11/01/16:  I continue to use this flat iron almost every day and it works as well as the day I got it.  This is an awesome flat iron for the price! It is very high quality. It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
